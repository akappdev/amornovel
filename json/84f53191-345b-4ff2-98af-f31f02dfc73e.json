The noise of hammering rain on the car roof drowned out her voice as she peered through her streaked windshield. The streets were filled with standing water in a special Florida trap for the unwary. She glanced up at the heavens where indubitably lived a whole slew of annoying gods. \u201cDo you think I have extra time to waste? Really?\u201d</p><p>Her grip on the steering wheel dented the faded blue padding. She mustn\u2019t be late to her job at the towing company. Not now, thanks to dear Cory, the owner\u2019s jerk of a son who\u2019d taken over the business last week. What an excruciating beginning to the new year.</p><p>Since then, each day had been a misery. Rainie\u2019s sigh sounded bitter, even to her own ears.</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t afford to quit. Not after wiping out the last of her savings. She didn\u2019t regret spending the money. Miss Lily had been as comfortable as possible before she\u2019d \u201cgone home\u201d\u2014as the fragile old woman termed death.</p><p>Rainie blinked back tears. Why did it seem as if it had been raining every day since her passing, as if the world itself mourned?</p><p>A horn blared behind the Civic, startling Rainie into the present. After a glance in the rearview mirror, she veered toward the curb to let the let-me-drive-up-your-ass BMW with Boston plates zip past. Cell phone in one hand, the driver used his other to hit the horn again.</p><p>\u201cIdiotic, irritating ignoramus.\u201d Rainie rolled her eyes. Better slow down, dude.</p><p>The speeding car reached the flooded intersection. Alas, no passage miraculously opened for Moses. As water sprayed outward, the vehicle hydroplaned, fishtailing violently.</p> <p>\u201cFoot off the gas, don\u2019t panic,\u201d Rainie whispered, cringing inwardly.</p><p>As the Boston car\u2019s tires caught traction, the rear pendulumed to the other side. A high yelp sounded. A brown animal was flung to the curb. The BMW kept going.</p><p>Oh no, no, no. Rainie\u2019s already clammy hands slid on the steering wheel. She didn\u2019t know how to fix injuries, especially non-people ones. Move, dog. Move. The little body lay motionless.</p><p>God, please let the dog be okay. Carefully, she drove across the flooded intersection, turned on the hazard flashers, and jumped out. The heavy rain flattened her hair and soaked her suit.</p><p>Blinking through damp eyelashes, she saw the dog was breathing. \u201cGod, you poor thing.\u201d With its fur matted down, the dog wasn\u2019t much bigger than a cat. Terrified. Panting. Trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so not good with animals.\u201d How could she be? She\u2019d lived in apartments. Never had a pet. She squatted awkwardly, trying to check for bleeding and broken bones.</p> <p>Brushing aside the fur, she scowled at the blood oozing from a scraped shoulder, but kept her voice smooth and easy. \u201cJessica\u2019s cat likes me. Does that help? Is there an animal letter of recommendation I should get?\u201d</p><p>The dog\u2019s tail beat once against the pavement.</p><p>\u201cI need to take you to a vet.\u201d She couldn\u2019t really determine if anything was wrong\u2014not in the rain. \u201cOkay, baby, if you don\u2019t want a doctor exam, you have to tell me you\u2019re all right. Can you\u2014can\u2019t you get up?\u201d Tears blurred her vision. Don\u2019t die, little dog. Please.</p><p>It whined, looked up at her with pain-filled, dark brown eyes, and sealed her doom.</p><p>Exhaustion sat heavy on Jake Sheffield\u2019s shoulders as he stared at the impossible schedule...and considered the merits of murder. He\u2019d start with his partner, Saxon, for taking a scuba diving vacation in Cozumel.</p><p>After disposing of his best friend\u2019s body, he\u2019d execute the so-called office manager of their veterinary clinic. Yes, most definitely\u2014Lynette had to die. He studied the schedule a second longer.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d kill himself instead.</p><p>\u201cYou knew a month ago that Sax would be gone, and you still scheduled surgeries for him?\u201d Jake asked in a low tone. He was thirty-one, a veteran, a veterinarian, and a sexual Dominant since his first year in vet school; he\u2019d had ample practice throttling back anger. \u201cI have a full load of exams. Sax isn\u2019t here. Who exactly is going to perform those surgeries, Lynette?\u201d The first appointments would start arriving in a few minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI...guess I messed up, huh?\u201d Lynette\u2019s blue eyes shimmered with tears.</p><p>Amateur hour in the damp eyes arena wouldn\u2019t cut it with him. In the dungeon, women were always crying. He\u2019d caused more than a few appealing sobbing fits himself. Deliberately.</p><p>Lynette could save herself the trouble of squeezing out some salt water.</p><p>And now he knew why Saxon had been pressured to give Lynette a job\u2014and why her sole job reference had been so noncommittal. Because she couldn\u2019t spell, forgot assignments, and took garbled messages. Even basic receptionist tasks were beyond her. The slender blonde was about as useful as dewclaws on a Chihuahua.</p><p>It\u2019d be the last time he let Saxon hire anyone.</p><p>\u201cYes. You messed up,\u201d Jake said evenly. \u201cNow call and shift some appointments to later in the week.\u201d They had a substitute vet who might be willing to pitch in on such short notice. Or maybe he could\u2014</p><p>The clinic\u2019s entrance door hissed open.</p><p>Jake looked up, and his mood lightened. The woman in the doorway was Rainie, a submissive in his and Saxon\u2019s favorite BDSM club, the Shadowlands. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>When he and Saxon opened the clinic over two years ago, they\u2019d been surprised and delighted when the owner of the club had trusted them with his cat. Since then, many of the Shadowlands members had brought their pets to the clinic.</p><p>Considering how the trainee avoided him at the club, her presence here was a surprise.</p><p>And he\u2019d never seen her in street clothing, let alone a tailored suit. Her streaky brown hair was in an intricate coil at her nape. Even drenched and mud-streaked, she looked amazing. Saxon had once commented she could be a model for a BBW\u2014big, beautiful woman. And that was only the beginning of her appeal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Her carefully even voice couldn\u2019t conceal the underlying panic. The blanket wrapped around the animal showed a growing bloodstain.</p><p>Ignoring the office manager\u2019s hissed, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have an appointment,\u201d he motioned to an exam room. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><p>After Rainie set the animal on the stainless steel table, Jake carefully unwrapped the bundle.</p><p>Dark brown eyes, wavy filthy fur. A small dog with an equally small growl.</p><p>\u201cHe bite?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She might not know, especially if her pet hadn\u2019t been seriously injured before. Jake would simply be careful, as always. Nothing obviously broken. Alert, eyes slightly glazed\u2014probably with pain. Breathing fast. Where was the blood coming from? \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car. Off Highway 19.\u201d Her wide-set, hazel eyes sparked with anger. \u201cThe driver didn\u2019t even stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens more often than you\u2019d think.\u201d Jake moved slowly, letting the dog smell him. A quick glance ascertained gender. \u201cEasy, boy. I see you\u2019re battered and sore, so I\u2019m going to go nice and slow. You\u2019re being a good dog. Your mama will be proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Under the measured rhythm of the words, Rainie relaxed. Dr. Jake Sheffield\u2019s smooth baritone projected utter confidence. That he was there to help. That he could help.</p><p>She studied him for a moment. Some of the Shadowlands Masters had the bulky musculature of powerlifters. Not Master Jake. He was a couple of inches over six feet with a lean, muscular build. Not too lean, though. The shoulders under his white polo shirt were broad, and the sleeves strained to fit around rock-hard biceps. The man was drop-dead gorgeous, with the chiseled features of a model. Shadowy designer stubble added a dangerous cast to a hard jawline.</p><p>Every instinct told her to flee.</p><p>A sizzling hot guy she could handle. But not this one. The first time she\u2019d seen Jake had been over a decade ago, and she\u2019d turned so starry-eyed her high school classmates had made fun of her. And...her entire life had been flushed down the toilet that day because of him.</p><p>Not his fault, certainly. He\u2019d never even known she existed.</p><p>He sure wouldn\u2019t have been her choice of a veterinarian today. But on the phone, Linda had insisted Jake was the best vet in the area. Master Sam, Marcus, and Master Z took their pets to his clinic.</p><p>Maybe Linda was right. Dr. Sheffield seemed very competent, carefully checking every inch of the little dog while murmuring reassurances. The ball of fur was shaking less.</p><p>Then Jake touched something painful, and the dog yelped.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Rainie glared at him. \u201cIf you hurt him again, I\u2019m going to hit you.\u201d</p><p>The sun lines at the corners of his eyes deepened. His warm hand closed on hers. \u201cLet me look under there. Just for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Rainie realized her fingers lay on the dog\u2019s neck. She\u2019d been trying to comfort the poor thing, even if she hadn\u2019t a clue what she was doing. \u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d She stepped away.</p><p>The dog on the metal table scrabbled in an attempt to stand.</p><p>\u201cGet back here.\u201d Iron edged Jake\u2019s quiet order. His voice gentled as he said, \u201cEasy, boy. She\u2019s not going anywhere. See?\u201d</p><p>Mouth open in surprise, Rainie resumed her place. When Jake set her hand on the dog\u2019s shoulder, the small body relaxed. Eyes the color of dark chocolate watched her anxiously. Was the tiny dog fearful she\u2019d move away again? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could feel the tug, as if a string had been tied to her heart.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, little guy. She loves you, see?\u201d As Jake palpated the dog\u2019s stomach, his brows drew together. \u201cHas he been off his feed? He\u2019s way underweight. And full of burrs. Do you live in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She massaged the wet fur lightly and felt gritty dirt. \u201cHe\u2019s not mine\u2014I mean I picked him up when the Boston butt-head hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. A car in front of me with Boston plates. I just got stuck with damage control.\u201d And speaking of damage, she was totally screwed. \u201cOh Go\u2014goodness, I have to get to work.\u201d</p><p>When she looked at her watch, her heart sank. She was horrendously late. And her suit was wet and muddy and covered with dog fur. \u201cI need to leave. Or I\u2019ll be fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Jake\u2019s dark brown hair fell over his forehead as he watched her with green eyes the color of leaves in midsummer. \u201cI don\u2019t think any bones are broken, but I\u2019d like to take some X-rays and check for internal damage. You can pick him up tonight on your way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick him up? But he\u2019s not my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Our tech will check if anyone\u2019s looking for him.\u201d He stroked his hand down the dog\u2019s side, flattening the curly fur. Rainie could see the hollowing below the ribs. \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s been living on the streets. Might\u2019ve been dumped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? A little dog?\u201d That was just wrong. A warm wave of kinship to the animal ran through her. She knew how it felt to be abandoned. Alone and not wanted. Surviving on the streets. \u201cPoor baby.\u201d She gently ruffled the dog\u2019s ears and heard his soft whine of...gratitude? Longing?</p><p>Oh heavens, what was she thinking? Brows pulling together, she scowled at Jake. \u201cYou are not going to coerce me into keeping this dog. I don\u2019t do animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things change, subbie,\u201d he said softly, for her ears alone. The light amusement of an utterly confident Dom made her insides shiver. His voice returned to a normal level. \u201cYou pick up the dog tonight, and I won\u2019t charge you for his care.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. Charge me? But...but... This day kept getting worse. She hadn\u2019t even thought about a vet bill, and from the professional appearance of the office, the clinic probably charged a whack of a lot.</p><p>But, to be fair, it was Jake\u2019s living.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have the cost of a vet visit in her savings. If he\u2019d take care of the little dog for free...</p> <p>In return, she\u2019d be stuck finding the little guy a good home. She drew herself up and gave him the iciest look she could muster. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be in around five-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d His firm lips quirked. \u201cThat works.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, Rainie\u2019s new boss sneered at her. \u201cYou think to work in my place looking like you got screwed by every long-hauler at the truck stop? Haven\u2019t changed much, have you?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened at his ugly allusion to when she\u2019d been a teenager, but she didn\u2019t dignify his rudeness by checking her ruined suit. \u201cA dog was hit by a car. I took it to the vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know you have priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame your job doesn\u2019t head up the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen.\u201d He walked over, close enough that her breasts almost touched his chest. \u201cYou want to keep working here, you got to give me your all.\u201d</p><p>She knew what he was implying\u2014that he wanted more than office work from her. Disgust held its own taste\u2014a foul one. \u201cI work harder than anyone else you\u2019d find for this job. That\u2019s why your father made me manager.\u201d</p> <p>And Cory\u2019d never worked hard a day in his life.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. I need to get the payroll started.\u201d She sidestepped him and moved toward her desk.</p><p>The phone rang. Rainie glanced that direction, but, as always, Mrs. Fitzhugh had things under control. After dispatching a truck, the gray-haired woman gave Rainie her usual good morning smile and returned to record keeping. Not a chatterbox, Mrs. Fitzhugh.</p><p>But thank goodness she was here.</p><p>Since Cory took over, Rainie had made sure she was never in the office alone with him. He probably wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to get physical, but she\u2019d discovered early in her life how a boner could shut down every cell in a man\u2019s brain.</p><p>And, although the company\u2019s owner, Bart, liked her, he wasn\u2019t here, and he might not believe her against Cory. He thought his boy was all pure and wonderful.</p><p>A burst of thunder shook the squatty building as sheets of rain slammed into the concrete outside. A wrecking truck drove by. The twisted mess of a brand-new pickup on the trailer was a pointed reminder that life could be fleeting.</p><p>She\u2019d worked for Thompson Towing and Recovery since starting grad school. Apparently, in the last few years, she\u2019d forgotten that nothing lasts forever.</p><p>Not that she planned to stay, now that she had her MBA. No, she planned to leave the Tampa/St. Pete area\u2014and her white-trash background\u2014far behind. She\u2019d settle in a different state, find an established, distinguished corporation, and take a position doing something that would garner admiration and respect.</p><p>But Miss Lily\u2019s illness had wiped out Rainie\u2019s savings, and moving required funds. By the time her apartment lease expired in mid-February, she should have enough money to relocate.</p><p>At the sight of the mess on her desk, Rainie came to a halt. She turned to Cory. \u201cWhat were you doing in my desk?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cLooking for a file.\u201d</p><p>Rainie growled under her breath. Her \u201cpersonal\u201d drawer was open, and he\u2019d rummaged through her stuff\u2014makeup, breath mints, even tampons. The sense of being violated was keen. Unfortunately, after her years in foster care, this was not an unfamiliar feeling.</p><p>Cory was such a bastard. Her jaw clamped to keep from spitting out her fury.</p><p>Bart was an honest, good ol\u2019 boy, like the truckers he employed. His son, however, was all show and no substance and never kept a job longer than a few months. Yet, Bart was convinced Cory could manage the company. Parents can be so blind.</p><p>A handsome thirty-year-old with carefully styled flaxen hair, a golden tan, and blue eyes, Cory figured if he wanted something, he should have it.</p><p>And to think he\u2019d implied she hadn\u2019t changed much. She huffed a laugh. He hadn\u2019t changed at all. At sixteen, she\u2019d run away from her foster home and a drug dealer took her in. Cory\u2019d shown up to buy coke for a frat party...then tried to buy her too. For a quickie. When Shiz refused, Cory\u2019d thrown his weight around...and gotten the crap beat out of him. They\u2019d dumped him in a garbage bin.</p><p>One nasty night. One nasty memory. Shaking her head, Rainie straightened up her personal drawer. Soon after Bart\u2019d hired her, she\u2019d run into Cory\u2014but he\u2019d wisely pretended not to know her. She\u2019d returned the favor. Just went to show St. Petersburg, Florida, really was too small of a city.</p><p>Now Cory was her boss, and his father was in Europe. Talk about an occupational nightmare.</p><p>Yesterday, when Mrs. Fitzhugh had taken lunch, Cory\u2019d sneaked up behind Rainie and groped her. Her outraged shove had caught him by surprise\u2014and he\u2019d fallen over a chair.</p><p>Rainie smiled slightly. She might surrender to a Dom she liked, but when it came to physically protecting herself from slimeballs? She didn\u2019t have a single submissive cell in her body. As she finished her tidying, she caught Cory staring at her.</p><p>\u201cWere you looking for a particular file?\u201d she asked. Her desk contained all her current projects. And she had a lot. She\u2019d put her MBA coursework to work by taking on the business\u2019s payroll, scheduling, and advertising. Last month, she\u2019d started on the arcane arena of insurance. God, she loved juggling the multitude of tasks, and Bart\u2019d been delighted to designate her the \u201coffice manager\u201d and hand over the reins.</p><p>Unfortunately, now Cory ran the company.</p><p>Face flushed, Cory stopped beside her desk, crowding her. When a file drawer slammed louder than the thunder outside, he realized Mrs. Fitzhugh was watching. He took a step back. \u201cI\u2019ll do the trucker\u2019s schedules this month.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t screw it up too badly. Rainie gave him a polite smile. \u201cHow nice.\u201d With his history, he\u2019d be bored with the company even before she quit. Be patient.</p><p>\u201cHere are the requests for days off.\u201d She handed him the correct folder and couldn\u2019t resist adding, \u201cThe schedule is due up on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Cory made a noise like a mouse flattened by a golf cart\u2014lovely sound. But then he leaned forward and lowered his voice. \u201cYou might consider being friendlier...assuming you want to keep this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be friendlier to manage the taxes, the advertising, the software, or the payroll,\u201d she assured him in a kind voice. \u201cAnd since the truckers get irritable if not paid on time, I\u2019d better start.\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept over her and lingered on her breasts.</p><p>With the soaking she\u2019d gotten, her shirt was almost translucent. The perverted prick. Turning away, she buttoned up her suit coat, then pulled up the payroll on her monitor. Finally...he moved away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She breathed out. God, how long could she put up with him? But he wouldn\u2019t do anything. After all, he couldn\u2019t run the place without her.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t leave. Rent was due. Her savings were gone. She needed the job.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Aching with misery, Jake entered the main room of the still quiet Shadowlands BDSM club. As the mansion\u2019s air-conditioning struggled against the evening heat, the humidity added to his weariness.</p> <p>Pretty sad to be decades older than a two-year-old and to be craving a nap. But because of the clinic\u2019s messed-up schedule, he\u2019d put in twelve-hour days the entire week. And his last furry patient today had been...bad.</p><p>At the long, oval bar in the room\u2019s center, Cullen and his submissive, Andrea, were concocting pitchers of drinks.</p><p>Jake eyed the water condensing on the outside of the crystal glass. The way he felt, a drink would be more satisfying than a scene. He slid onto a barstool. \u201cYou\u2019re adding vodka to an energy drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA special for tonight\u2019s glow party theme.\u201d Cullen grinned. \u201cThe liquid shines under the black lights.\u201d He patted the white T-shirt covering his massive chest. \u201cAnd so will this. People need to be able to find the bartender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to say this, but no one\u2019ll notice you with your gorgeous submissive around,\u201d Jake noted.</p> <p>Andrea wore a cut-off, white shirt that barely covered her full breasts. Her boy briefs curved delightfully over her round ass.</p><p>\u201cThis is true,\u201d Cullen said in open agreement. \u201cShe is gorgeous, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>At her Master\u2019s ready compliment, Andrea\u2019s face brightened as if a ray of sunlight had caught it.</p><p>\u201cSo, buddy, Z wondered where you were.\u201d Cullen put a few drops of blue food coloring into one pitcher. \u201cYou missed the Masters\u2019 briefing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an emergency surgery.\u201d Jake\u2019s gut tightened. \u201cA puppy chased a cat onto the highway. The driver of the car tried to stop. Cat got across okay. Dog didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Andrea turned, a stricken look on her face. \u201cIs the puppy all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis hind leg is fractured, and he has internal injuries.\u201d Jake sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cHe might recover.\u201d Or not. The wife had been in tears, and her husband pretty damn close.</p><p>\u201cAt least the dog had you to take care of him.\u201d Andrea patted his hand.</p><p>Jake straightened, uncomfortable with her sympathy. A Dom should comfort submissives, not the other way around.</p><p>Obviously, his exhaustion had turned him into a wimp, or so his BDSM mentor would have said. Even in his sixties, the Marine Gunnery Sergeant had never admitted to tiredness...let alone depression over an injured pet.</p><p>Andrea put a bottle of water in front of him. \u201cIf you were in surgery, you probably didn\u2019t get supper, did you?\u201d An experienced submissive, she read the answer from his expression. \u201cI thought not.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her Master and got a nod before heading for the munchie corner.</p><p>With an effort, Jake suppressed a surge of loneliness. Last year, he and Heather had been close enough to communicate without speaking. But when she\u2019d dumped him for her career, he\u2019d wondered if they\u2019d truly communicated at all. She\u2019d left so quickly that sometimes he felt as if he could still hear the door swing shut behind her.</p><p>Well, lesson learned. He\u2019d be more careful next time.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was in the briefing?\u201d he asked Cullen.</p><p>\u201cThe black lights stay on all night, and Z suggests light scenes. The theme rooms have normal lighting for those playing harder. He has some special floggers and paddles, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s special about them?\u201d</p><p>Cullen snorted as he mixed tonic water with juice. \u201cSprayed with neon paint. Should make for interesting scenes.\u201d He pointed to the white-linen-covered tables. \u201cAlso, there are glow paints. Submissives are to be decorated by Doms\u2014can\u2019t do it themselves. The trainees are wearing black underwear or the equivalent.\u201d</p><p>Submissive painting. Glowing floggers. \u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. Trouble is, we\u2019re short on Masters tonight. Dan\u2019s vacationing with Kari and the baby. Marcus is stuck at the courthouse, waiting on a jury verdict. Raoul is flying back tonight from a construction job in Panama.\u201d Cullen swiped up the few drops he\u2019d spilled.</p><p>\u201cNeed an extra dungeon monitor?\u201d He wasn\u2019t scheduled, but he could handle it. He\u2019d just shift gears from his expectation of a lazy evening to an active one.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cullen thumped a gold-trimmed black leather monitor vest on top of the bar. \u201cIf you can cover the main room for an hour now and then again at midnight, I\u2019d appreciate it. There\u2019s no Trainee Master tonight, so we\u2019re all watching out for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d With only three trainees left, keeping an eye on them wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><p>When Z had set up the program for submissives needing increased immersion in the lifestyle, most of the Shadowlands Masters and Mistresses were single. Now, since only Mistress Anne, Jake, and Holt were unattached, the program was ending once the last trainee found a Dom. \u201cWas there anything Z required them to work on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Tonight is for fun and light play. They\u2019re even to do their own scene negotiations. Good practice for them, actually.\u201d</p><p>Jake pulled on the vest, amusement lightening his mood. \u201cBut since Z\u2019s a mother hen, he asked us to check on them anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Master Jake.\u201d Andrea placed a small plate piled with finger foods in front of him. \u201cThis should keep your furnace stoked for a while.\u201d</p><p>Cullen is one lucky Dom. \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity of his gratitude made her smile.</p><p>He popped a mini-quiche into his mouth and considered his next bite.</p><p>\u201cMaster Cullen, I\u2019m here.\u201d The liltingly melodic voice came from beside him.</p><p>Jake glanced down to see Rainie at his shoulder, one beautifully curvy woman, about five-seven. Not too short, not too tall.</p><p>Unlike earlier in the week when she\u2019d brought in the injured dog, she wasn\u2019t dressed conservatively. In leather wrist cuffs, a black halter bra, and barely-there, black skirt, she was an explosion of light and color and softness, from her shoulder-length, brown hair streaked with bright gold and red, to the fountain-and-blossom tattoos that flowed upward beside her spine, over one shoulder, and down between her magnificent breasts.</p><p>Cullen poured a glass of juice and handed it to her. \u201cGood to see you, sweetheart. Did you bring in cookies for the munchie corner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready there, Sir. I used Kari\u2019s recipe, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. The caterers are good, but their sweets never taste like homemade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Rainie,\u201d Jake said, watching her closely. Considering she\u2019d brought him her dog, would she still avoid him?</p><p>\u201cMaster Jake.\u201d She took a step away from him, then her gaze fell on the plate in front of him. She frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked crab cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She picked the mini crab cake from his plate and replaced it with the chocolate chip cookie in her hand. As she looked up at him, her hazel eyes were more brown than green in the dim light of the room. \u201cI bet you\u2019d prefer this.\u201d</p><p>A cookie. His day brightened. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a cookie I didn\u2019t like. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Z says we\u2019re supposed to keep track of everyone\u2019s preferences.\u201d Rainie popped the crab cake in her mouth.</p><p>Her lips were as lush as the rest of her, and he tried not to imagine other things he\u2019d like to feed her...like his cock. He\u2019d managed to ignore the craving before this week, but after seeing her with the pup\u2014well, women with soft hearts were irresistible.</p><p>However, a Master wasn\u2019t worth much if he didn\u2019t master himself. \u201cGood job of paying attention, then.\u201d</p><p>He studied her and decided not to ask about the dog he\u2019d treated. He didn\u2019t mind blending his two personas, but others tended to be more cautious, especially submissives. And from the classic-cut suit she\u2019d worn in his clinic, he\u2019d guess Rainie held down a good, conventional job.</p><p>In contrast, when relaxed in the Shadowlands, she had a warm earthiness to her, much like a vivid hearth goddess.</p><p>\u201cHey, everybody.\u201d Jessica, the club owner\u2019s pregnant wife, appeared on Rainie\u2019s other side and beamed at Andrea. \u201cAndrea, I love your outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracias, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>The little blonde turned her attention to Rainie and wrinkled her nose. \u201cBoy, Z didn\u2019t do you trainees any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring, all right.\u201d Rainie tugged on the black halter top, then her brow creased. \u201cYou look tired, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing new.\u201d Jessica cupped her big belly. \u201cI carry a lead basketball around all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop walking for a while.\u201d With a snort, Rainie walked away.</p><p>She returned with a folding chair, set it behind the bar, and patted the seat. \u201cPlant your butt.\u201d</p><p>Jessica scowled. Stalled.</p><p>Jake had to agree with the trainee. \u201cJessica, sit,\u201d he said quietly, knowing the effect the command would have on a trained submissive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The blonde sat and pouted at him. \u201cYou\u2019re as dictatorial as Z.\u201d Then she glared at Rainie. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, I submit to Doms. Aside from them, I\u2019m the alpha-female in this place and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d Rainie exchanged a high-five with Andrea before returning to sit on a barstool beside Jake. Turned away from him, she picked up her drink and asked Andrea how work was going.</p><p>Stubborn and caring. How had he missed seeing that facet of her personality?</p><p>As Jake ate and traded greetings with incoming members, he kept an ear turned to Andrea\u2019s chat with Rainie and Jessica about the underprivileged youngsters she\u2019d hired for her cleaning service. Sounded as if the kids were a handful and needed instruction in not only housekeeping, but also manners and attire.</p> <p>\u201cWatch out for pilfering,\u201d Rainie commented. \u201cI know you\u2019re keeping them away from your residential clients, but even in offices, people leave easily pocketed valuables on their desks.\u201d</p><p>Odd. He hadn\u2019t thought Rainie would be prejudiced against the poor. Then again, her matter-of-fact tone lacked scorn.</p><p>\u201cThis is true.\u201d Andrea frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll be observant.\u201d The two women exchanged looks with undertones of...something shared?</p><p>As Jake studied them, his gaze focused on Rainie\u2019s yellow and red streaked hair. A few stiffer strands were green as well. \u201cDid you get something in your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did I. Master Galen brought in neon hairspray and wanted to be artistic.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cCrazy Fed.\u201d</p> <p>Jake turned slightly. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t let her impertinence pass. \u201cRainie.\u201d Fisting her hair, he pulled her smoothly to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She grabbed his wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhether you have a problem with the FBI agents or not, you\u2019re going to be respectful.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cTrainee.\u201d</p><p>Her arm lowered. \u201cI...I\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The instinctive yielding of her body sent a frisson of pleasure up his spine. Be a delight to push her further. \u201cThere are lines a submissive shouldn\u2019t cross. You shouldn\u2019t cross. Not only for a Dom\u2019s comfort, but yours as well. I\u2019ll enforce those limits, Rainie.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to add she wouldn\u2019t enjoy coming up against his will. Either she was smart enough to know it or she\u2019d learn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said. When he twisted her hair, increasing the pull, she added a hasty, \u201cSir. I\u2019ll remember, Sir.\u201d</p> <p>He eyed her. Was she going to cause trouble tonight? She and Uzuri were known pranksters. Only two other submissives in the Shadowlands were more mischievous. He smothered a smile. Gabi\u2019s mouthiness kept Marcus on top of the D/s game, and little Sally was such a handful it took both Galen and Vance to keep her playfulness within bounds.</p><p>He had to admit he envied the other Masters their spirited submissives.</p><p>Keeping Rainie quiet with his hand in her hair, he regarded her clothing. Completely black... He glanced at Cullen. \u201cLet me guess\u2014Z\u2019s using the trainees as walking canvases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s affirmative, buddy. And all submissives\u2014trainee or not\u2014get their lips painted so they glow.\u201d Cullen tapped Rainie\u2019s mouth and barked a laugh when she snapped her teeth at him.</p><p>Jake studied the sumptuous female feast he held and zeroed in on her very fuckable mouth. She had softly pink lips with a crease in the center of the lower one. \u201cWere your lips glow-painted?\u201d</p><p>Rainie looked up through a stray lock of hair. \u201cUh. No.\u201d When he didn\u2019t respond, she added a hasty, \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the task out of the way then.\u201d He put a hand on her nape, and her thick, silky hair tickled his fingers as he guided her toward a table. With an effort, he ignored the effect she had on him. The woman was too damned appealing for his good.</p><p>The reverse wasn\u2019t true. For whatever reason, she didn\u2019t want anything to do with him\u2014and he figured that was a submissive\u2019s choice to make. Even if it left him feeling fucking disgruntled.</p> <p>Master Jake had big hands. Rainie felt the power in the fingers curled around the back of her neck. She barely managed to suppress a shiver and wanted to scold her body for getting worked up. Burned once, twice shy.</p><p>But that thought kept slipping away when she was close enough to see the laugh lines fanning from the corners of his eyes.</p><p>He was known as a fun Master. Friendly. Easy-going...to a point. She liked that kind of Dominant.</p><p>But even without the past between them\u2014although he knew nothing about that day\u2014she wouldn\u2019t want to be with him. Last winter, when a date had taken her to the super-expensive restaurant, Caretta on the Gulf, Jake had been there with a gorgeous, thin, designer-clad woman. His suit had said money. His manners had said polish and class. Everything about him reaffirmed he was out of her league.</p><p>And yet his grip did funny things to her insides.</p><p>When they reached the table, he released her.</p><p>Silently, she looked up at him. He was more than a half-foot taller than her five-seven, and totally lean and muscled. His cheekbones were defined. His jaw, strong. His nose, a work of art.</p><p>And here she stood. A fluffy, plus-sized woman from the slums. They had nothing in common.</p><p>\u201cZ wanted scenes to be lightweight. Will his dictate put a crimp in your plans tonight?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was as flowing and flawless as the black silk shirt he wore.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Hitting the dance floor is at the top of my agenda.\u201d Dancing was far more fun than sex\u2014and tonight, it would be awesome under the black lights.</p><p>One sharply angled, masculine eyebrow rose. In all his perfection, he reminded her of a slightly younger Master Marcus. Jake must be...about thirty or thirty-one, right?</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you interested in doing scenes? Finding the ideal Dom?\u201d he asked.</p><p>At one time when she\u2019d joined, she\u2019d wanted to score the perfect Dom. Now? Not so much. \u201cOf course,\u201d she lied.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest as the heavy weight of a Dom\u2019s scrutiny landed on her\u2014Jake\u2019s scrutiny\u2014and her spine turned to water. How did he do that?</p><p>\u201cHey, Jake.\u201d Kendall\u2014known in the club as Barge\u2014strolled over. The Dom wore a skin-tight, black vinyl shirt and pants. Sometimes she wondered if he\u2019d joined the Shadowlands just to dress up.</p><p>\u201cBarge. Good to see you.\u201d As the wall sconces dimmed and the black lights came on, Jake dipped his finger into the glowing red pot and outlined her lips with the body paint.</p><p>Why did the simple glide of his finger seem like sexual overture? Why did his touch have to feel right? She knew better. No perving on the sophisticated, classy Dom.</p><p>When Master Jake stepped back, she stifled her urge to get closer. Instead, she turned her attention to Barge.</p><p>\u201cWant to do an easy flogging scene?\u201d Barge asked her. \u201cZ lent me a flogger, and I\u2019d like to see the falls in the black light.\u201d</p><p>Rainie considered. Last month, Barge had talked her into seeing him outside the club. Although their two dates had been pleasant enough, he reminded her of other \u201cnice\u201d men she\u2019d known, possessing a personality more willow tree than oak. When push came to shove, Barge would bend\u2014much as her previous boyfriends had when confronted with peer or family pressures over dating her.</p><p>However, even though she didn\u2019t want to date Barge, his scenes were fun. She wasn\u2019t looking for anything more intense\u2014not after her horrible week.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d After a warning look from Jake, she amended her answer to, \u201cI\u2019d like that, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s go, subbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She followed Barge across the room and managed to check over her shoulder only once...to see Jake watching her thoughtfully.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hour of serving as a dungeon monitor was over. After handing off the gold-trimmed vest and getting a bottled water, he dropped down in a leather chair between two scenes to admire the light show. In the shadowy room, the glow-painted floggers, canes, and paddles were mesmerizing.</p><p>There were also some enthusiastic body-paint jobs, especially on submissives\u2019 breasts and pussies. Stripes, circles, dots. In one shadowy section, a pair of glowing green breasts seemed to float in the air without a supporting body.</p><p>Z had developed a great theme, as usual. During Jake\u2019s travels in the Army Veterinary Corps, he\u2019d appraised several BDSM clubs and none suited him as well as here.</p><p>Being voted in as a Shadowlands \u201cMaster\u201d had been an honor he hadn\u2019t expected. He didn\u2019t mind putting in the extra time Z requested of the Masters. He figured mentoring new Doms, supervising scenes, and protecting submissives were all activities any experienced Dom should perform without being asked.</p><p>Of course, Z did have his favorite project. And during the past hour, Jake had made a point of checking on the trainees. Uzuri had gone upstairs with Holt, one of her favorite Doms. In the far corner, Tanner waited in a dog kennel while a married couple\u2014a Mistress and a switch\u2014prepared for the scene they\u2019d do.</p><p>And here was the third trainee.</p><p>In the scene area to Jake\u2019s left, Barge and Rainie finished cleaning the equipment and sat down to talk. She had her back turned to Jake, and he spotted a few light pink areas on the untattooed parts of her shoulders, but no welts. She hadn\u2019t cried, hadn\u2019t reached subspace, didn\u2019t appear stressed. Then again, not much frazzled Rainie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She definitely had an interesting personality\u2014and a confusing one. Damned if he could figure out why she had such an aversion to him.</p><p>He turned away to observe the other scene where Mistress Anne was caning a male submissive. The sub groaned with each smack of the cane and yelped at the lightest touch to his genitalia. The lack of expression on Anne\u2019s face conveyed her displeasure. The Mistress liked to dispense pain, and she didn\u2019t play with lightweights. As often happened, the submissive had probably tried to impress her by claiming to have a high pain tolerance.</p><p>Now they both knew the truth.</p><p>Barge\u2019s lifted voice drew Jake\u2019s attention.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Rainie. I\u2019m willing to work around your schedule,\u201d Barge said. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve got a night free next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t. It\u2019s a busy time at my company, and I\u2019m sorry, but my career comes first.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound particularly sorry, Jake thought. She sounded like a woman flicking an impertinent bug off her arm. His jaw clenched as memories rained down on him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jake. I have my future to think about. I can\u2019t turn down an opportunity like this.\u201d At least, Heather hadn\u2019t been cold. No, she\u2019d cried. Told him she loved him.</p><p>And then she\u2019d moved to the West Coast the very next day.</p><p>Fair enough. He\u2019d picked himself up and worked through the defeat. Live and learn, right? He still wanted a wife. Children. Damn straight. He just needed to fall for a woman whose priorities matched his own\u2014and someone who would at least talk about compromise.</p> <p>Feeling as if his presence was an intrusion, he rose. Their argument was polite enough. No need to intervene...although he\u2019d keep an eye on them from farther away.</p><p>As he retreated, he noticed Z and Sam also within hearing range. Sam had on a gold-trimmed dungeon monitor\u2019s vest, so he was on duty.</p><p>Z wore his usual tailored black clothing, right down to the black leather, black-faced watch. He tilted his head in an invitation to join them. \u201cJacob, did anything of interest occur this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo disasters.\u201d Jake smiled. \u201cI think you\u2019ll lose Tanner from the trainees shortly. The Coltons plan to ask him to become a third in their relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a good match for all three,\u201d Z said.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Sam glanced behind them with displeasure. \u201cBarge and Rainie, though. Not a match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d Jake\u2019s brows drew together. On a different night, he wouldn\u2019t have permitted the scene with Barge. She didn\u2019t need lightweight play. \u201cI\u2019d say she\u2019s in a rut. Doesn\u2019t want to be pushed. Doesn\u2019t want anything heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d The lines bracketing Z\u2019s mouth deepened. \u201cI need to carve out more time for the trainees.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head, seeing the guilt drop onto the Dom\u2019s shoulders. The owner considered the trainees\u2014hell, all the members\u2014to be his responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have more time available, Zachary.\u201d He deliberately used Z\u2019s full name. \u201cAnd you have new obligations, like a pregnant wife. Time to lighten the load and learn to delegate.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s sandpapery chuckle held approval.</p><p>To Jake\u2019s relief, Z gave him a wry smile. The best Doms saw themselves clearly\u2014and had a sense of humor. \u201cPerhaps so, Jacob. In fact, I think you should take over the trainees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gray eyes alight with amusement, Z squeezed his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not only equal to the challenge, but you would also enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Probably. Jake held up his hand to stall. To think. After a minute, he said, \u201cI might like being the Trainee Master, but I need to refuse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>\u201cThe responsibility isn\u2019t a concern.\u201d Jake\u2019s gaze drifted to Rainie. Since she\u2019d come into his clinic, he\u2019d had an...urge that grew stronger each day. Time to ante up. \u201cI believe a Trainee Master shouldn\u2019t meet a trainee outside of the Shadowlands. Which is why I\u2019d prefer to avoid the job.\u201d</p><p>Z followed his gaze, and a faint smile appeared. \u201cI see. And respect your honesty. Will you have a problem working with her as a Master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Z said.</p><p>Sam shifted his weight. \u201cGot a chore for you then. The girl has trouble refusing a Dom\u2019s orders. Maybe she\u2019s intimidated, maybe wants to please too badly, maybe both. I figured she\u2019d conquered the problem, but\u201d\u2014he nodded toward the couch\u2014\u201dshe\u2019s lying instead of just saying no.\u201d</p><p>Work with Rainie? Hell, yes. \u201cI\u2019ll take that project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Z said. \u201cThank you, Jacob.\u201d</p><p>As the two men continued their rounds, Jake stayed in place, considering. \u201c...trouble refusing.\u201d Not good.</p><p>As a veterinarian, Jake was skilled in reading body language\u2014although admittedly, humans were vastly more difficult. He\u2019d never exceeded a submissive\u2019s boundaries, spoken or not. But not every Dom had learned to read a submissive.</p><p>And even in a pick-up scene, a submissive and Dominant performed an intricate dance. To be fulfilled, the sub needed to give up control. Yet, a Dom had to trust that a sub would say stop if he pushed too far.</p><p>Sam, being a sadist, certainly knew the danger of a bottom lying to a top. Was he right about Rainie having a problem?</p><p>As he drank his water, Jake considered. When she\u2019d agreed to scene with Barge, her body had been relaxed. No conflict between her body language and her words. But later, she\u2019d refused a date and insisted she had to work. At that time, her head had jerked sideways in unspoken contradiction. She\u2019d widened her eyes and fixed her gaze on Barge, a technique often used by liars to show their honesty.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d lied to Barge. If Sam was correct, she\u2019d been uncomfortable saying \u201cno\u201d to a Dom.</p><p>The thought of Rainie caving in and doing something she didn\u2019t like sent a trickle of anger through him. Knowing she\u2019d lied didn\u2019t make him happy either. His job\u2014tonight\u2014would be to change that behavior.</p><p>Jake tipped his head back and studied the ceiling. How best to achieve that goal?</p><p>She\u2019d have to practice saying no...but in a realistically intimidating setting. One where she\u2019d find refusing difficult.</p><p>He\u2019d have to find more than one Dom to assist. She might find it easy to decline a stranger\u2019s orders, so he\u2019d create a tenuous bond between her and the Dom\u2014and punish her for anything other than a firm no.</p><p>Plan forming in his head, Jake looked around and picked out the Doms he\u2019d trust to follow instructions.</p><p>This is ridiculous. Rainie couldn\u2019t put up with more of Barge\u2019s bullshit. With some effort\u2014stupid low-slung couch\u2014she struggled to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean up.\u201d</p><p>To her relief, Barge remained sitting.</p><p>She gave him a token bow. \u201cThank you for the scene, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Brows drawn down in anger, he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>She turned away, annoyed more with herself than him. She was totally a sniveling, spineless slug. Why hadn\u2019t she simply said she wasn\u2019t interested in dating him? That he did nice scenes, but she didn\u2019t want anything else from him? But no-o-o, instead, she invented excuses. With a disgusted grunt, she shoved her hair back.</p><p>Thank goodness, Master Sam hadn\u2019t been around. When he\u2019d caught her waffling rather than giving a straight refusal, the sadist had given her a \u201clesson\u201d by smacking her ass until she\u2019d managed to spit out a resolute \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>She thought she\u2019d learned that day. Apparently not.</p><p>Let\u2019s not mention the backsliding to Master Sam, okay?</p><p>After a leisurely trip to the restroom\u2014to give Barge a chance to leave\u2014Rainie headed for the bar. Since Master Z\u2019d started hiring waitresses, she didn\u2019t have any official duties. Right now, she wanted to go home. A quick word to Master Cullen, and she\u2019d be free to leave.</p><p>Midevening, several club members had finished playing and sat at the bar socializing. Jessica perched on a barstool. Beside her, Master Z was talking to Mistress Olivia.</p><p>\u201cRainie. C\u2019mere.\u201d Jessica had always been curvy, but her pregnancy made her even rounder. A while back, she\u2019d abandoned her pretty corsets. Tonight, she wore a low-cut green tank top with a loose-waisted vinyl skirt held up by suspenders. Trust Master Z to attire his submissive in an outfit that would make even pregnancy sexy. \u201cDid you have a bad session? You seem unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, the scene was fun. The glowing strands on the cat-o\u2019-nine-tails were spectacular.\u201d As she\u2019d hoped, the flogging had been mostly a massage. If only Barge hadn\u2019t been a putz afterward.</p><p>\u201cThe paddles flash pretty good too.\u201d Jessica shifted her weight on the stool as if her bottom hurt. \u201cI can testify to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Rainie glared at Master Z. He\u2019d hit a pregnant woman?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look like that.\u201d Jessica wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe\u2019d told me to stay put and I didn\u2019t, so I got a few good swats.\u201d</p><p>A few swats with a paddle wouldn\u2019t hurt her. \u201cWell, you actually do look better. Not so tired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m good. Andrea made me sit longer after you left. And when I tried to restock the munchie tables, Z swatted my ass and planted me here.\u201d With a pout, Jessica stroked a hand over her rotund stomach. \u201cYeah, planted. I swear, I feel more like a potato than a woman.\u201d</p><p>Obviously hearing her, Master Z curved his arm around her waist so his palm rested on her baby bump. \u201cIf you want to compare yourself to a food, I\u2019d say a peach. Ripe. Succulent.\u201d He kissed the curve of her shoulder and neck, and his resonant voice deepened. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, kitten, and I love you more every single day.\u201d</p><p>As Jessica\u2019s eyes filled with tears, her hand covered her husband\u2019s. Her Dom\u2019s.</p><p>A disconcerting yearning shook Rainie.</p><p>I want that. Want it all.</p><p>But no. She wanted no husband or babies, at least not here in the Tampa/St. Pete area where her past would rise up and bite her in the butt.</p><p>She retreated a step and bumped into a body that was totally bone and muscle. Honestly, hadn\u2019t men ever heard of padding?</p><p>Lean fingers gripped her shoulders, steadying her. \u201cJust the person I was looking for,\u201d Master Jake said.</p><p>Oh, this is just craptastic. Green eyes. Carved features. And a trimmed five-o\u2019clock shadow on his strong jaw. She realized she was breathless. \u201cCan I help you with something, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm. I\u2019ve got some time, so we\u2019re going to work together tonight\u201d\u2014he added the final word as if to let her know she was screwed\u2014\u201dtrainee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought the trainees weren\u2019t... No. We\u2019re free to make our own choices tonight.\u201d</p><p>To her dismay, Master Z turned to contemplate her for a long, long moment. \u201cYou haven\u2019t the appearance of a satisfied submissive. Go with Master Jacob.\u201d</p><p>Oh hellfire and hissyfit hyena shoes. \u201cOf course, Sir,\u201d she said obediently and looked at Master Jake. \u201cSir, do you have an assignment for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit.\u201d He curled his hand around her arm, firmly enough that she felt controlled, carefully enough that she knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt her by accident. On purpose, though...</p><p>Despite her avoidance of him, she\u2019d observed him play, something he did frequently and well and with a variety of submissives. His BDSM skills appeared exhaustive. He well deserved the \u201cMaster\u201d title he\u2019d been voted into last summer.</p><p>And, from the way just his touch had melted her insides into liquid goo, she\u2019d still underestimated him. Unlike the in-your-face authority of other Doms, Master Jake\u2019s power was a lazy riptide, drawing a submissive under his command before she even realized she\u2019d surrendered.</p><p>He steered her to a secluded area and pointed to a chair. As she settled onto the leather cushion, he drew the other chair around so they sat face\u2013to\u2013face.</p><p>When his long legs bumped into hers, she pulled her feet up onto the chair.</p><p>A corner of his mouth tipped up and then he leaned forward to rest his forearms on his thighs, shifting right into her personal space.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to discuss, Master Jake?\u201d Considering her lack of attire, her manager\u2019s voice proved ineffective. Actually, she rather doubted the \u201cvoice\u201d would daunt Jake no matter what she wore.</p><p>\u201cCouple of things. I\u2019m curious\u2014your papers show only \u2018Rainie.\u2019 Is it your given name?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid so.\u201d He\u2019d checked out her trainee forms. Why? \u201cMy mother liked names to convey something. Her name was Carol, but she called herself Sunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d He was too close, his gaze too intent.</p> <p>She turned her head. At a nearby scene, someone\u2019s single-tail flashed under the UV lights. The thrum of the bass from the dance floor speakers struck her skin almost like impact play. \u201cSunny didn\u2019t want a baby and cried all the way through her pregnancy. So she christened me Rainie for rainy.\u201d</p><p>His snort held disgust.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty much how I felt.\u201d Her mother had often ranted about her unwanted pregnancy, the ghastly labor, and the amount of work raising a child required.</p><p>When younger, Rainie had fled in tears from the cruel words. She was a tougher bitch now. Oh yeah.</p><p>\u201cHere, I thought Rainie might be an abbreviation for Lorraine or something,\u201d Jake mused.</p><p>\u201cNope. It must frustrate Master Z not to have a \u2018real\u2019 name to call me.\u201d Master Z disliked nicknames. Sam was Samuel. Dan was Daniel. Jake, Jacob.</p><p>Amusement lit Jake\u2019s eyes. \u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>He kneaded her calf in an absent-minded act she didn\u2019t believe for a second. That friendly, casual attitude of his disguised a very controlled Dom.</p><p>The sensation of being touched without permission\u2014and dammit, wanting to be touched\u2014hit a sonorous note deep inside her. Behave, body, or no chocolate for a week.</p><p>\u201cRainie\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d His baritone held a hint of smokiness at the edges. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve never met anyone less like rainfall.\u201d</p><p>A compliment? Had he just given her a compliment? Her gaze swung back.</p><p>His eyes were straightforward...and his long, tapered fingers traced a pattern on her leg.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t drag me here to talk about my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Rainie, I didn\u2019t force you here.\u201d His lips curved up slightly. \u201cBut I can arrange to drag you if it\u2019s something you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Being dragged.</p><p>By Jake. The surge of sheer desire made her stiffen, even as she wanted to melt. But no. No, no, no. No Jake. She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He cocked a brow and made a sound, showing how little he believed her answer.</p><p>She tried to steady her breathing. Jake Sheffield had been a gorgeous twenty-one-year-old college student. As a confident, virile Dominant, he was lethal. She\u2019d been right to avoid him.</p><p>\u201cI noticed something odd in your files,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me, when did you last have a serious scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Even with her gaze on the leather cuffs circling her wrists, she sensed his gaze never wavered. \u201cA few months, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Sweetling, what is it you want from being a trainee?\u201d</p><p>The endearment made her heart flutter until she remembered whom she was talking to. Jake.</p><p>Why did some memories turn to shadows...and others corrode into rawness? Even after a decade, she could hear her classmates. \u201cDid you see how she stared at Jennifer\u2019s brother?\u201d \u201cThe fatty wants Jake Sheffield.\u201d \u201cGod, I think I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, hoping to fling the thoughts away.</p><p>Concentrate on the present, girl. He\u2019d asked a question. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d She didn\u2019t have a ready answer. Her goals had changed. As irritation bubbled up, she glared at him and tried to tug her leg from his grip. \u201cExcuse me, but when did this turn into a job interview?\u201d</p><p>His deeply masculine voice held a note of steel. \u201cWhen I decided it did.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her legs off the chair, placing them on the outside of his knees. His downward glance reminded her she wore nothing under the short skirt. At least her large thighs hid her pussy. Mostly.</p><p>His hands opened, palms up. \u201cGive me your breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>From the raging heat in her face, she knew her cheeks were redder than the lotus flowers in her tattoos. With a hand under each heavy breast, she hesitated. He didn\u2019t move. Well, at least he hadn\u2019t told her to remove her top. She inched forward on the chair. Her legs slid alongside his until her inner thighs aligned with his knees, and his jeans scraped against her tender skin.</p><p>Cool air touched the flesh of her labia. Now, she was completely exposed before him. And somehow, with the physical nakedness, the barricades protecting her emotions were splintering.</p><p>Leaning forward slightly, she set her breasts onto his cupped palms. Giving him her body. Giving him her soul.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d His fingers gripped her breasts over the fabric.</p><p>He angled his knees outward, spreading her legs farther apart. Opening her. Her instinctive jerk back was countered by his hold on her top half. She wouldn\u2019t be permitted to retreat.</p><p>At the amused look in his forest green eyes, she growled under her breath. The flames streaming up and down her spine, made her want to...to kneel. To beg. To submit.</p><p>\u201cYou like being controlled. Do you know how much your surrender pleases a Dom?\u201d he asked softly, his gaze on her face, then her breasts. \u201cLace your fingers together behind your neck.\u201d</p><p>How did he know the common hands-behind-the-back position was one she couldn\u2019t easily achieve? Her hair spilled over her wrists as she complied. Her breasts lifted with the movement.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d His resonant voice was as firm as the hands holding her breasts. \u201cI enjoy seeing you in this position, sweetling. Giving me your breasts. Offering your cunt.\u201d</p><p>And, oh God, she was. She wanted him to take her, to control her, to have her in any way he chose. As if she knelt on the beach in a heavy surf, the ground beneath her was being swept away, leaving her unbalanced. And she was being pushed right to him. She swallowed, her voice coming out husky. \u201cI didn\u2019t offer. Sir.\u201d</p><p>On top of the fabric, his thumbs circled her jutting nipples, making them bunch so tightly they ached. \u201cWhen a woman\u2019s nipples are this hard, Rainie, I\u2019d say you\u2019re an offering ready to be taken.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The way her lower half turned into a heated pool, her body agreed. She stared at the silk of his shirt, knowing she was wet. Please, please, please, don\u2019t let him notice how he turns me on.</p><p>\u201cAs a trainee, you\u2019re supposed to learn about new kinks. Meet and work with different Doms, searching for the one with whom you fit. Why aren\u2019t you doing that?\u201d While he talked, he used one hand on her left breast as a restraint, and the other slid under her halter bra to roll her right nipple. The skin-to-skin sensation grew more intense with each second. Her toes curled.</p><p>What had he asked?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have looked up. Tanned skin. Green eyes. Sun streaked hair the beautiful brown of chocolate, falling over his forehead, luring her to touch. She closed her eyes.</p> <p>A light pinch on her breast made her gasp.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, trainee.\u201d</p><p>Between his unyielding grip and his resolute focus on her, she couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate. \u201cI\u2019ve tried out new things. It\u2019s just... I-I don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019ve given up. There\u2019s no one out there for me.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re not giving me the complete story, sweetling.\u201d His focus had locked on her in a way that had her very bones trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s time your reasons were examined.\u201d</p><p>His grip gentled. \u201cRight now, make me a mental list of which Doms you\u2019ve decided against and the ones you\u2019d like to play with.\u201d</p> <p>She stared, mouth open, unable to find a reply.</p><p>He actually grinned. \u201cYou sit here and think until I return.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>As Jake moved away from Rainie, he saw her pretty face scrunch into a scowl.</p><p>What a cutie. And more. She\u2019d responded like a dream to his hands, his will. Even as he\u2019d watched her mind and emotions war, her body had been sweetly compliant. God, she was beautiful.</p><p>But something was going on with her, and it was more than her difficulties in honest refusals.</p> <p>Whenever a trainee was unsettled by a scene\u2014whether performed by a Master or another Dom\u2014her file got a note, so a follow-up could be performed. Jake had found no notes for months.</p><p>On her own, she requested scenes with lightweight Dominants, which wasn\u2019t necessarily wrong. However, he doubted she\u2019d be content with a Dom who didn\u2019t push her.</p><p>Yes, a Master needed to have a long talk with her. Jake planned that Master would be him.</p><p>He picked up the short length of chain from behind the bar and returned.</p><p>Curled in the chair, Rainie felt her anxiety increase as Jake approached. The seriousness of his expression made her rub her sweaty palms against her skirt.</p><p>\u201cThinking done?\u201d he asked. He stood over her, arms crossed over his chest, legs braced apart. His black jeans clung to his muscular thighs and cupped his bat and balls.</p><p>Bad Rainie. Pay attention.</p><p>With some effort, she lifted her gaze back to his face. \u201cStarted, but not concluded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a problem. This week, write everything out. Handwritten, not typed. In addition to the Dom lists, make another of your strengths and weaknesses as both a submissive and a person. Next weekend, we\u2019ll read over your homework together.\u201d</p><p>The thought was completely unnerving. Put her thoughts and emotions down on paper for him to read? To discuss? She\u2019d rather have a root canal.</p><p>He held his hand out. \u201cLet\u2019s walk, and you can tell me which Doms you know. Which ones you\u2019ve rejected.\u201d</p><p>His nonchalant strength when he pulled her to her feet sent a dizzying desire through her. \u201cI haven\u2019t played with everyone, but I\u2019ve met most. I haven\u2019t\u2014haven\u2019t rejected anyone.\u201d</p><p>Although a muscle flexed in his jaw, he merely nodded. When he put his arm around her and ran the knuckles of his other hand over the tops of her breasts, the casual intimacy of the touch blanked her mind.</p><p>\u201cSince you haven\u2019t said no to anyone, should I assume any Dom here would make you a good permanent Dom?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot permanent. I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d</p><p>She got the uncomfortable impression he saw right through her.</p><p>After pulling a short length of chain from his pocket, he secured her arms behind her back. The chain between her wrist cuffs was only about twelve inches, but long enough to prevent her shoulders from feeling dislocated.</p><p>On the way across the room, he picked up two tubes of body paint and a rag from a table.</p><p>She glanced at the tubes with a twinge of anxiety. Why did he need paint?</p><p>He guided her to a sitting area containing four Doms. \u201cGents, the trainee here needs to be decorated. Anyone up for the task?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>All three single Doms indicated interest.</p><p>Jake turned Rainie toward the first, and she tensed. She\u2019d hated her single experience with Donald. Some tops were deliberately sexually rough\u2014which was hot. Earlier, when Jake had hurt her nipples, he\u2019d done so with awareness of exactly what he was doing. He wasn\u2019t so self-absorbed to have missed her response.</p><p>Although Donald never overstepped the club boundaries, he was rough, because he was careless and selfish.</p><p>Rainie forced herself not to step back, and then realized Master Jake was watching her face. He arched a brow and directed her to stand in front of the other two. Although she hadn\u2019t played with them, neither had a bad reputation with the submissives.</p><p>\u201cBrand, Casey,\u201d Jake said, ignoring Donald\u2019s annoyed grunt. \u201cShow us your artistic talents.\u201d</p><p>Brand had silver at the temples and in his mustache, but his latex body shirt showed rippling muscles. His sweeping gaze took her in, and he smiled. \u201cWho could resist painting those tits?\u201d He glanced at Casey. \u201cI\u2019ll take the outsides of her breasts and leave the nipples for you.\u201d</p><p>After tossing them the paint tubes and terrycloth rag, Master Jake wove his fingers into her hair and immobilized her. Her arms were already restrained behind her back. His other hand gripped her upper arm, ensuring she\u2019d remain in place.</p><p>She looked at him from the corner of her eye. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold me,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut I like to,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His woodsy masculine scent wrapped around her\u2014which was just wrong. Anything that smelled that temping should be licensed. Regulated. Dispensed in very small amounts.</p><p>A touch on her chest startled her. She forced herself to hold still.</p><p>In front of her, Brand ran his finger over her halter top to circle her breast. Her breasts were sensitive. Responsive. And being touched there together with Jake\u2019s merciless control slid her body straight into a flustered arousal.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous breasts,\u201d Casey commented as he watched his friend paint. He glanced at Jake. \u201cShe\u2019s fair-skinned. Bet her nipples are a pretty pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe fun to find out, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Still holding her hair, Master Jake undid the halter ties at her back and neck and pulled the top off. Her nipples contracted at the cool wash of air...and the heat of the men\u2019s assessing stares.</p><p>Jake\u2019s warm breath brushed her ear as he whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ve got gorgeous breasts, trainee.\u201d</p><p>His hands. She wanted his hands on her so badly her knees wobbled.</p><p>\u201cMagnificent,\u201d Brand said. \u201cGuess I need to start over.\u201d After squeezing out some red paint, he drew filigree patterns on her bare right breast. The paint was cool over her heated skin.</p><p>He handed the second tube to Casey.</p><p>The younger Dom circled her left nipple with a bright yellow streak, then used one finger to massage in the paint.</p><p>God, having Jake standing so close, restraining her, watching her...somehow turned everything the others did into a type of foreplay. By the time the two men finished, her breasts were swollen and throbbing and sending urgent messages to her pussy.</p><p>Trying not to rub her thighs together, she shifted her weight.</p><p>Brand chuckled. \u201cYour trainee is aroused, Jake. We\u2019d be happy to co-top her in a private scene upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Dismay ran through Rainie like a whip of icy rain. I don\u2019t do threesomes.</p><p>Jake\u2019s steady gaze provided the only warmth in the suddenly cold, shadowy room. \u201cRainie, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Jake read her papers? \u201cI-I...\u201d</p><p>Brand and Casey watched her with open anticipation, obviously expecting her consent.</p><p>She faltered out, \u201cI\u2014I have other things to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do have a problem, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jake didn\u2019t release her hair as he stepped completely behind her. His hand smacked her bottom far, far harder than a fun swat.</p><p>Pain burst like fire across her buttocks. She bit back a yelp.</p><p>A second and third stinging spank followed. Ow! God, what had she done? Tears hazed her vision. She exhaled, trying to chase away the pain. \u201cWhy? Why, Sir?\u201d</p><p>Jake straightened and turned her to face him. His palm cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his grim gaze. \u201cSam said you\u2019d already received a lesson on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie, when you don\u2019t want to play with a Dom\u2014or date a Dom\u2014what is the proper answer?\u201d</p><p>Her thoughts whirled in her head, but all she could think of was how her bottom hurt. A tear escaped.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes softened, although his jaw remained stern as he positioned her to face the two Doms. \u201cWhat do you say to them, Rainie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Master Sam had told her to say no.</p><p>She cleared the thickness from her throat. \u201cI-I\u2014\u201d When Jake\u2019s hand squeezed her shoulder in warning, the memory of the pain he could wield impelled her words. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Sirs, but I\u2014No. No, thank you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we,\u201d Brand said. \u201cBut you gave us a courteous refusal. Well done, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Jake said politely and steered her away.</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t like threesomes,\u201d she told Jake. And she didn\u2019t want to be with him any longer, either. \u201cI\u2019m sure the restriction is on my limits list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but that\u2019s why I asked you to think about your limits again. A submissive\u2019s wants and needs change over time. Reassessment is needed.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be reassessed.</p><p>The lack of a dedicated Trainee Master meant she\u2019d escaped a re-evaluation for quite a while. But Jake\u2019s very posture held determination. He planned to be stubborn about this.</p><p>He turned her to face him, and his gaze dropped to her chest.</p> <p>Brand had painted a Celtic-style knot band around the outside of her breasts. At the centers of each pattern, her areolas glowed yellow.</p><p>\u201cArtwork like that is an open invitation to squeeze.\u201d Jake\u2019s fingers closed on one nipple, pinching and smearing the yellow paint. His green eyes stayed on her face as he squeezed firmly enough to hit the threshold of hurting\u2014and made everything inside her tighten and pool. \u201cLegs far apart and bend forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stared up at him, seeing the matter-of-fact resolve in his expression.</p><p>He picked up a paper towel and wiped the paint from his fingers...and waited.</p><p>Well, God. She set her bare feet shoulder-width apart.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p> <p>Fussy bastard.</p><p>After widening her stance, she bent forward, grateful his grip on her arm helped her balance. Her loose breasts hung down, swaying. Even worse, her very short skirt no longer covered her ass. As members of the club walked around her, her face flared with embarrassment.</p><p>And yet, her core rapidly filled with another kind of heat. No Master had driven her or controlled her so thoroughly in a long, long time. Her whole body seethed with excitement.</p><p>Jake ran his palm over the bare skin of her buttocks and squeezed, wakening the tender skin he\u2019d spanked. Slowly, he slid his hand between her legs.</p><p>At the intimate touch, she jolted and tried to straighten.</p><p>His unyielding grip on her arm held her still. His fingers traced her labia, her entrance. \u201cNice and wet, baby. Good to know.\u201d</p><p>After helping her straighten, he tugged her skirt back down.</p><p>Her breathing was fast, and desire was a hammering pulse beat between her legs. With every command, every firm touch of his hand, she wanted to beg for more.</p> <p>But not from Jake. No, not Jake. Tears pricked her eyes. She blinked, dredging up anger to burn away her weakness. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just asked.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted.</p><p>Even that miniscule movement made her knees try to buckle. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just asked, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I miss where your limits list noted \u2018no touching\u2019 or \u2018no touching intimately?\u2019\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>Oh, he was the spawn of Satan. Why had she wanted him for so many years? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, according to your lists and cuff colors, I could use my cock instead of my hand and fuck you, here and now. True?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted around the answer. \u201cTrue.\u201d And she totally hated the surge of edgy excitement.</p><p>Instead, he tugged her forward. \u201cLet\u2019s introduce you to more Doms, trainee.\u201d</p><p>Enjoying Rainie\u2019s mounting frustration, Jake steered his trainee through the room, visiting the Doms whom he\u2019d prepped about the \u201cscene.\u201d With his hand on her nape, he easily read her responsive body to determine how far he could push her.</p><p>Each time she attempted to defy him and failed, her trembling increased. Damn, but he wanted to comfort her and control her and explore the depths of her personality.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>Stay on task, Sheffield. Next lesson.</p><p>After he supervised her belly being painted, he checked her arousal. Nope, these two Doms didn\u2019t do it for her, although she was still wet.</p><p>One asked her to go upstairs to fuck.</p><p>She earned another two hard spanks before managing to refuse.</p><p>In preparation for the next group, he removed her skirt. She had a beautifully bare pussy, with the inner lips poking out between the plump outer labia. Damned tempting.</p><p>Stay on task, Sheffield. Next lesson.</p><p>Under his supervision, Adam and Carter painted her mound, ass cheeks, and upper thighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take that pretty asshole,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWant to let me have some time with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>She looked from him to Adam and back, and her cheeks pinkened with her dawning anger. Although Jake had made his expectations clear, she\u2019d apparently not realized how thoroughly she\u2019d been set up. \u201cYou-you...\u201d</p><p>Smothering his grin, he tilted his head toward Adam. \u201cShow me how you answer him, baby.\u201d</p><p>Despite now knowing the entire scenario was preplanned, she struggled. \u201cI\u2019m s-sorry, but I don\u2019t...\u201d Her gaze dropped, and she swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cRainie,\u201d Jake said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult. Try this: I\u2019m afraid not, but thank you for the offer, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The gratitude in her eyes made him want to cuddle her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid n-not, but thank you for the offer, Sir,\u201d she parroted to Adam.</p><p>\u201cNicely done.\u201d The young Dom grinned. \u201cCome and find me if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling over Rainie\u2019s disgruntled expression, Jake led her away. Her refusals would improve with practice. The physical memory of pain would provide impetus.</p><p>Being she was a smart woman, she\u2019d probably study her past to figure out why she had so much trouble saying no. If necessary, he and the other Masters would help her explore.</p><p>He was pleased with the evening\u2019s work. And he\u2019d gained some knowledge.</p><p>She didn\u2019t particularly like pain, but definitely got off on control, subtle or overt. She could tell the poser Doms from the real ones. Sexual submission was her gig, although she had a nice helping of service submissive in her personality, enough to create a need to please others. Especially Doms. Her smart-mouthed, independent personality tended to vie with the submissive side.</p><p>She was definitely an intriguing woman.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should do some painting, too,\u201d he murmured, catching the subtle scent of her body\u2014a light spicy fragrance that mingled with the musk of her hunger. \u201cOr, I could just play with you.\u201d</p><p>A flush of excitement darkened her lips and cheeks.</p><p>Interesting. She might avoid him\u2014but she also wanted him. His cock swelled in response, although he\u2019d been half-hard all evening as he\u2019d hauled her around. Touching her lit him up as if he\u2019d clasped a live wire.</p><p>She was everything he enjoyed in a woman, from her scent to her lush body to her sassy mouth. Trouble was, since he\u2019d spent the evening as a Master giving a lesson, he had to step back now. They each needed to be clear on what they wanted before moving on to fucking. Dominance and submission could definitely confuse matters.</p><p>So, to divert them both, he smacked her pretty painted ass hard enough to make her hiss. \u201cThat was a reminder to be truthful in relationships, whether you\u2019ve known the Dom for one minute or one year. I want to see you honest in your emotions, your thoughts\u2014and your refusals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She held still as he unfastened her wrist cuffs and the chain.</p><p>Once freed, she pulled in a breath and rubbed her ass, which probably hurt like hell. She\u2019d have trouble sitting for a day or so. \u201cIf you want the truth...I\u2019d really like to punch your face right now. Sir.\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>She pushed some hair back and faced him straight on. \u201cNonetheless, I\u2019m grateful for the lesson.\u201d</p><p>And her honesty was even sexier than her gorgeous body. \u201cGood night then, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cWell, Master Fuzzy-butt, I wish I felt like partying.\u201d The next night, Rainie stood in the bathroom, her makeup arrayed on the counter like a pre-battle army. Depressed and tired, she\u2019d resorted to the heavy artillery: thicker foundation, darker eyes, and eyelashes long enough to reach her eyebrows.</p><p>She checked the mirror. Not quite slutty, but close. Perfect for tonight\u2019s bachelorette party and the \u201cexotic dancers on the loose\u201d theme. God, what a theme. Uncomfortable with looking like a hooker\u2014outside of the Shadowlands\u2014she\u2019d tried to talk the other women out of the idea and been outvoted. So...just get over it, Rainie.</p><p>With a snort, she glanced at the fluffy little dog at her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of dumb going to so much effort, really. I mean, a bachelorette party means all women.\u201d</p><p>Rhage obviously agreed since his fluffy, wagging tail whipped over the glittering blue nail polish on her toes.</p><p>She beamed at him. He was such a good conversationalist. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the clinic didn\u2019t find someone looking for you, but thank God they didn\u2019t.\u201d Because losing Rhage would break her heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt that he owned her now, she knew. She grinned. The fifteen-pound fluff-ball had snarled at her neighbor\u2019s dog\u2014and returned to her, totally convinced he\u2019d saved her from the huge pit bull.</p><p>So she\u2019d named him after her favorite fictional boyfriend. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero, Rhage.\u201d</p><p>Ears pricked up, Rhage watched her closely. Anything she said was important to him, and how lovely was that?</p><p>\u201cI always thought I\u2019d grow up and find my own hero.\u201d Rainie grimaced at herself in the mirror. Obviously, she shouldn\u2019t have wasted her youth on reading and daydreaming. \u201cBut I gave up; I\u2019m not holding out for a hero anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Rhage whined. Did that mean he agreed?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think heroes exist anymore, puppy.\u201d Her ex-fianc\u00e9, Geoffrey Hollingsworth, sure didn\u2019t qualify as a knight in shining armor. Or, maybe he hadn\u2019t considered her a prize worth fighting for. The memory was an unhealed bruise on her heart.</p><p>She\u2019d been thrilled when he\u2019d taken her up north to finally meet his family. \u201cThis is Rainie Kuras,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>But when his mother and sister looked down their noses at Rainie\u2019s painfully purchased college clothing, her hopes shriveled. Then Geoffrey\u2019s sister had whispered in her mother\u2019s ear, \u201c...foster care...drugs...\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingsworth\u2019s lips had compressed tightly. Her gaze, not warm to start, chilled further. She\u2019d straightened her thin frame. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d</p> <p>Obviously, Rainie wasn\u2019t \u201csuitable,\u201d being a woman abundant in everything except money, respectability, and high-class ancestors. But then came the moment that really hurt. Despite past experiences, she\u2019d foolishly expected Geoffrey to put his arm around her and show his family what she meant to him.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Thus, she had learned a romance book was fiction. A hero who truly cared for the heroine was called a fantasy.</p><p>And reality was the way Geoffrey had sidled sideways to put distance between them. The way he\u2019d avoided any discussion of that night. The way cold had oozed into the empty space where love and trust should lodge.</p><p>After a painful breath, Rainie slowly straightened the mess on her counter.</p><p>A paw placed on her foot said Rhage wanted the rest of the story.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, honey. Nothing more to the tale. My so-called fianc\u00e9 slithered out of my life with a ton of excuses. The putz. I\u2019d respect him more if he\u2019d been upfront about dumping me.\u201d</p><p>Upfront.</p><p>She froze, staring at her excuse-making, equivocating face in the mirror. Was she really belittling Geoffrey for not being honest after spending last night getting smacked for doing exactly the same thing herself? She was always making up excuses to avoid sex or dating or whatever.</p><p>Master Jake had been more right than he knew\u2014and didn\u2019t that just suck?</p><p>Okay. No more lying. She was better than that. True, she intended to climb the corporate ladder, rung-by-rung, which meant using...tact...rather than unvarnished honesty. But she wouldn\u2019t abandon her character as she rose in status.</p><p>She scooped up the dog, cuddling him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, puppy. I\u2019ll never lie to you. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Her chin got a quick lick, and she rubbed her cheek on the top of his fuzzy head. The perfect hero. He didn\u2019t judge her by her clothing or her past mistakes or her horrible childhood. He loved her for who she was now. How rare was that? \u201cHow did I ever live all these years without you?\u201d</p><p>After she finished dressing, she opened the huge, black suitcase containing her special stock.</p> <p>Rhage bounced on his front paws, assuming the contents were new tug-of-war or chase-the-ball toys.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not, honey.\u201d Her lips curved as she studied a cock ring. It could be considered a type of chase the ball, right? \u201cThese are sex toys.\u201d</p><p>Was that an appalled look in Rhage\u2019s chocolate-brown eyes? \u201cSorry, dude.\u201d She ruffled his ears. \u201cArranging parties brings in extra money and lets me hang out with girls instead of truckers.\u201d And provided great prizes for bachelorette parties.</p><p>\u201cHopefully tonight won\u2019t run too late.\u201d She needed to work tomorrow\u2014Sunday\u2014to finish the payroll. Because of Cory. She scowled. \u201cThat man\u2014all liabilities, no assets.\u201d</p><p>First, her \u201cboss\u201d had screwed up the schedule, ignoring a trucker\u2019s requested hours off. Then when the trucker threw a fit, Cory\u2019d fired him and wouldn\u2019t let her mail off a final paycheck. She\u2019d been stomping-mad furious\u2014which was a trick to pull off in high heels.</p><p>And now she had to work tomorrow if anyone was going to be paid. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all because Cory is one period short of a write-off. No, worse than that. He\u2019s a putrid, piss-drinking, pustule with a pin-sized prick.\u201d</p><p>Rainie winced. Had she really said that out loud?</p><p>Miss Lily had continually tried to mold her into someone with class. And Rainie\u2019d curtailed her swearing\u2014at least the true profanity. Did name-calling fall under the \u201cgenteel women don\u2019t do that\u201d rules? Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t ask Miss Lily. Not ever again.</p><p>Grief hit her so brutally, she held her chest, trying to pull in a breath. \u201cWhy\u2019d you leave me?\u201d Like everyone else had.</p><p>In a pale peach blouse, pearl necklace, and earrings, Miss Lily looked out of the picture frame. Her gaze was steady, her head high. Even in a photo, she displayed dignity. But she\u2019d also known how to lay out the honesty.</p><p>At seventeen, Rainie\u2019d been left for dead after a drug deal gone bad. Her upcoming destination was juvenile hall, but the judge had seen something in her. \u201cWould you like to meet Miss Lily?\u201d he\u2019d asked, referring to his executive assistant from when he\u2019d been some fancy lawyer. The person who\u2019d helped him become the man\u2014the judge\u2014he was.</p><p>Rainie knew his question wasn\u2019t about choosing between juvvie and another foster home\u2014it was about who she wanted to be when she grew up.</p><p>At the courthouse, Miss Lily had looked Rainie over and given her a thin smile. \u201cYou can continue on your bobsled ride into hell, young lady, or you can come home with me and become a lady in truth. Your decision.\u201d</p><p>Though one eye was swollen shut, Rainie had stared at the woman and tried not to whimper. Her life was in chaos and Jesus fucking God, she hurt. Shiz lay in the morgue. She didn\u2019t want to be herself any longer.</p><p>Years later, Miss Lily shared that she\u2019d planned to turn the judge down, but she\u2019d seen the longing in Rainie\u2019s eyes to be...more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying, Miss Lily,\u201d Rainie told the woman in the photo. \u201cI\u2019ll make you proud.\u201d</p><p>As she fought the tears, she knew what Miss Lily\u2019s response would be. Then get moving. Do the next thing. Nothing is accomplished by tears or moping.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Rainie returned to the bathroom and fixed the streaking mascara under her eyes. Enough with the past. This evening wasn\u2019t about her, but about the two bachelorettes, and she\u2019d bust her ass to ensure Sally and Gabi had fun.</p><p>Setting her bag of toys on the tiny dining table, she scowled at the notebook that was supposed to have Master Jake\u2019s homework. She\u2019d started...and stopped. Like she\u2019d ever share her weaknesses with a man? Or her disgusting past? Never, never, never.</p><p>And the list of what she wanted in a Dom only pointed out her nonexistent love life. Since Geoffrey, no \u201crelationship\u201d had lasted past a few dates.</p><p>He\u2019d been the one to teach her about BDSM and, although he didn\u2019t like clubs, he\u2019d taken her to the Shadowlands during a visitor\u2019s night. With him, she\u2019d learned she liked bedroom domination. Because of her past, she kept a tight control over her life, but letting someone else take charge for scenes and sex was amazing.</p><p>Her smile faded. But because she\u2019d trusted Geoffrey that much\u2014enough to let go\u2014his abandonment had ripped her apart.</p><p>A while after they broke up, she\u2019d joined the Shadowlands, hoping to meet someone wonderful. Those dreams had died because investing all her trust and love in a man was simply an invitation to get hurt.</p><p>She bent over to tug lightly on Rhage\u2019s silky ears. \u201cAre you cruel too, buddy? Since you\u2019re a male?\u201d</p><p>His tail thumped the carpet.</p><p>\u201cSee, with humans, once a man conquers, he examines his prize and immediately begins picking her apart.\u201d She slapped her ample stomach. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to pick apart here. And my background provides even more.\u201d</p><p>Rhage waved a little paw in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou too, huh? Both of us with scummy backgrounds.\u201d Rainie smiled down at him. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll just keep it to you and me.\u201d No one else.</p><p>She shoved the homework right off the table. Damn Master Jake anyway. After getting home last night, she\u2019d dreamed of him, over and over. Even worse, she craved seeing him again\u2014as though he was dark chocolate and she\u2019d just come off a yearlong diet. She wanted.</p><p>But she could have dealt with dreams. Really. But the dreams had slowly twisted into nightmares of how she\u2019d fled his sister\u2019s birthday party back to her foster care house\u2014where she should have been safe.</p><p>Jake wasn\u2019t to blame. Nonetheless, he was a walking, talking reminder of why her life had descended straight into the sewer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her head lifted as she heard footsteps on the sidewalk. Probably the limousine driver.</p><p>\u201cOkay, dog, I have to go party.\u201d She picked up an encompassing shawl and swirled it around her body. \u201cYou guard the house, okay?\u201d</p><p>Rhage gave a small yip of agreement.</p><p>Who needed men? Rainie grinned. She had her own hero\u2014an incredibly smart, cuddly, four-footed hero.</p> <p>As the others in the bachelor party settled in, Jake shed his suit coat, rolled up his shirtsleeves, and stuffed his tie into his slacks pocket. Comfortable, he leaned back and stretched out his legs. For bar furniture, the burgundy-red, well-cushioned chair was fairly comfortable.</p><p>Around the table, the others followed suit. Marcus removed his silvery-gray pinstripe jacket. Galen hung his black suit coat as well as Vance\u2019s over the back of a nearby chair. Holt dumped his behind him. Neither Raoul nor Nolan wore coats. But after assessing the size of the two men, doormen tended to ignore their less formal attire.</p><p>Jake was enjoying himself more than he\u2019d anticipated. Well, aside from dying twice during the laser tag game earlier. Since the Shadowlands Masters were quite accustomed to exotic kink, the party hadn\u2019t bothered visiting strip clubs. Instead, they\u2019d taken over a laser tag facility.</p><p>Jake gave two of the grooms, Vance and Galen, a respectful glance. The FBI agents had headed up the law enforcement team\u2014and had shot him dead. Jake\u2019s team, consisting of ex-military men, had won by only one game.</p><p>After cleaning up and dining, the grooms and a few other Doms came here to check on the bachelorette party. Jake glanced around the crowded room. Supposedly, the women had picked this boutique nightclub for their last stop.</p> <p>It was a good choice, actually. The DJ played music ranging from rock to metal designed to encourage dancing. Because Vance had selected a table in the elevated back section, the view of the ground floor was excellent\u2014although Jake could hardly see his drink.</p><p>He glanced over at Marcus, one of the three grooms. \u201cI didn\u2019t think bachelor parties were supposed to rendezvous with the corresponding bachelorette one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a shame to waste the opportunity.\u201d Marcus gave him an easy smile. \u201cThe ladies get drunk and revved up. Can\u2019t beat the sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the women encouraged you to butt into their party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. They don\u2019t know we\u2019re here.\u201d Galen\u2019s smile was evil. \u201cBut my company specializes in finding people\u2014even when they\u2019re trying to hide.\u201d Galen\u2019s firm had a rep for delivering.</p><p>\u201cI hear the trainees were on their own last night,\u201d Vance said to Jake. \u201cYou were lucky our Sally isn\u2019t one any longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to agree with you,\u201d Jake said. The little brunette was adorable but a brat incarnate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame about the trainee program ending,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cI found my Gabi. Maxie and Dara met their Doms through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of trainees, do you hear from Heather?\u201d Raoul asked Jake.</p><p>Heather. He braced for the pain of remembering her but found only a distant grief. \u201cNow and then. She\u2019s doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And you, my friend?\u201d</p><p>Jake smiled slightly, thinking of the night before. \u201cGuess I\u2019ve recovered. Women seem inviting again.\u201d</p><p>Nolan King snorted. \u201cIf the last months were you in mourning, I\u2019d hate to see you at full strength.\u201d</p><p>At the chorus of agreement, Jake grinned ruefully. Okay, yes, he\u2019d gone through a few submissives in an effort to forget the one lost. But the women had known he wasn\u2019t interested in more than a fun evening. He tilted his glass toward the tough contractor. \u201cWatch and learn, old man.\u201d</p> <p>Even as Nolan barked a laugh, Holt scowled at Jake. \u201cWhen he rips your head off, it\u2019ll splatter blood all over my good suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth will rescue me,\u201d Jake said, enjoying the way Nolan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cShe likes me better anyway.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Holt edged his chair farther from Jake. Hell of a friend.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d Nolan swirled his beer. \u201cBut since I like well-endowed women, I\u2019ll sample Rainie instead.\u201d</p><p>No. Fucking. Way. \u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d Jake snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you fuck with Rainie.\u201d</p><p>As the men roared with laughter, Vance lifted his glass to Nolan. \u201cAnd the King scores!\u201d</p><p>Marcus grinned and told the others, \u201cAs a past Trainee Master, I do like the way Sheffield jumped to the trainee\u2019s defense.\u201d</p><p>And where the hell had his surge of possessiveness come from? Feeling like an idiot, Jake lifted his Kamikaze in a salute to Nolan. \u201cI definitely jumped, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>The Dom\u2019s rare grin flashed. \u201cJust so you know\u2014if I strayed, Beth would wait until I was asleep, lop off my balls, and bury them in her garden. As fertilizer.\u201d</p><p>Jake grinned back. Nolan\u2019s little redhead was sweet, quiet, and had a spine of pure titanium. \u201cI wonder what Rainie would do in a similar situation.\u201d Might be good to know.</p><p>The forthcoming suggestions were far too bloody for peace of mind.</p><p>Galen added, \u201cBeing the vindictive type, she\u2019d probably stuff everything down the garbage disposal afterward.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Jake could feel his balls draw up tight.</p><p>A second later, a commotion sounded at the door. Turning to look, Vance broke into laughter. \u201cAnd there they are.\u201d</p><p>Jake stared. Those were Shadowlands submissives? The group of women strutting in would look at home on a stripper\u2019s stage. But, damn, they looked good. Hair out to there, eyelashes forever, deep red lips that made a man\u2019s cock stand up.</p><p>He\u2019d seen less makeup on drag queens, but there was no doubt these were females, considering the amount of skin they were showing. Miniskirts, mesh stockings, cleavage to rival the Grand Canyon. And somehow, they made it all work.</p><p>After a minute, he spotted Rainie. She looked like sex, super-sized. A miniskirt of shiny black flirted with damn fine legs. Her dark blue bustier had almost no back, so her tattoo ran up and over her right shoulder, leading the eye straight down to those incredible breasts. God, he\u2019d never wanted to touch someone so much in his life.</p><p>He smiled ruefully. A Dom should know himself...and he had to admit she was the reason he\u2019d stayed with the grooms rather than peeling off like most of the others.</p><p>As the women formed a small group, Jake noticed Ben, the Shadowlands security guard, had accompanied them. The combination of his massive bulk, rough-hewn face, and fancy rags made him look like a lethal pimp.</p><p>As Jake watched, the women split into different directions. Beth headed for the DJ, Rainie and another women\u2014\u201dIs that Mistress Anne?\u201d Jake choked out.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Raoul\u2019s smile was a flash of white in the darkness. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her look so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>No lie. The sadistic Domme\u2019s attire usually held an edge of threat. What she wore tonight was complete and utter seduction, Penthouse style.</p><p>\u201cWonder what brave subbie talked the Mistress into that?\u201d Marcus wondered.</p><p>Every Dom at the table answered, \u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>Rainie hadn\u2019t expected to have so much fun. But her unhappiness about work had been erased by the amount of alcohol in her veins and her rowdy friends. Although the party had decreased from the original fifteen, the remaining few were serious partiers.</p><p>Even now, Kim was siccing Ben into intimidating a couple to move away from a large table to a smaller one.</p><p>Uzuri and Beth targeted the DJ to get the correct tune loaded up. Their private exotic dancing class at the start of the night had given them the moves to only one song.</p><p>Rainie and Anne had their own task. Rainie asked, \u201cIs this bartender mine or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to have a look at him,\u201d Anne said briskly.</p><p>Rainie grinned. The Mistress\u2019d imbibed as heavily as everyone, but she sure didn\u2019t show it. Despite black vinyl boots that put her close to six feet, Anne never made a misstep.</p><p>In contrast, Rainie had to concentrate hard to walk in a straight line. Swaying her hips helped\u2014and garnered appreciative whistles.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mother of God,\u201d a man said as she and Mistress Anne wiggled their way through the throng around the bar. \u201cLadies, whatever you\u2019re asking, I\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p><p>Anne ignored him and leaned her forearms on the bar so she could watch the bartender. Rainie did likewise, assessing his interactions with the customers. \u201cStraight,\u201d she judged.</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but I think he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Rainie waited until the man\u2019s gaze met hers. She got no tingle from his quick look. Of course, there was no foolproof way to differentiate Doms from submissives, but his gaze held no punch. So if Anne thought he was submissive, then this one was hers to coax. \u201cGo for it, sweetie-peach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie-peach?\u201d Gripping the top edge of Rainie\u2019s stiff bustier, Anne yanked her forward until their faces were an inch apart. \u201cThis is a fun evening, but, little girl, watch the manners. I prefer cock torture, but I\u2019ll make an exception for pussy if annoyed.\u201d</p><p>Note to self: never call a sadist cutesy names. \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Although laughter lurked in Anne\u2019s eyes, the Mistress would undoubtedly be even more amused if wielding a pussy whip.</p><p>When Rainie swallowed, she heard at least three men around them do the same. \u201cSorry, Ma\u2019am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Anne released her as the bartender approached.</p><p>\u201cLadies, what can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a request,\u201d Rainie started with the familiar spiel. \u201cWe\u2019re with a bachelorette party and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cGot two cops at the end of the bar figuring on busting some hookers.\u201d</p> <p>Rainie concealed her flinch and the urge to flee, reminding herself she wasn\u2019t an underage kid living with a drug dealer. She managed a smile. \u201cNo soliciting in our group, just an upcoming double wedding. We wanted you to serve a special drink shot for the brides, Gabi and Sally. It\u2019s called the G and S Smackdown. If you agree to make it, we\u2019ll talk it up and get people to order it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. See we have\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then Anne reached over the bar and wrapped the bartender\u2019s paisley tie around her slender hand. Rainie felt the blast of dominance accompanying the move, and when the bartender\u2019s gaze met the Domme\u2019s, his stubborn expression melted right off his face.</p><p>Anne slowly pulled him forward and said in her husky voice, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLance.\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very nice name,\u201d Anne said, and the bartender actually quivered. \u201cLance, it would please me if you\u2019d make the shooters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-okay. Sure. I\u2019d be happy to.\u201d His expression said he wished she\u2019d ask him for something more so he could do that as well.</p><p>Rainie\u2019s smile faded as she remembered the night before and her absolute joy, right down to her toes, when she\u2019d earned Master Jake\u2019s approval. Why, oh why, did Jake Sheffield have to be a Dom?</p><p>After ordering champagne drinks and handing over the recipe for the G and S Smackdowns, Rainie followed Anne back to the table, getting four requests to dance and two offers of a monetary nature. She grimaced and checked her bustier to make sure she hadn\u2019t popped out a nipple or something.</p><p>Nope. All good.</p><p>\u201cWell, ladies.\u201d She settled in beside Kim. As her weight left the high-heeled sandals, her tortured feet throbbed in relief. \u201cThis is the last bar on the list, so let\u2019s give them a good show.\u201d She glanced around the table. Even without dancing, they made a colorful group.</p> <p>Kim\u2019s short, short dress matched her icy blue eyes. Uzuri was in a skin-tight, red sheath that set off her chocolate-brown skin.</p><p>The brides-to-be had chosen white. Gabi wore a white leather miniskirt and sequined white corset. Her strawberry blonde hair now had a silver and blue streak to match the wedding colors. Sally was in a white leather minidress with cutouts that showed the sides of her breasts and hips.</p><p>Damn, she loved her girls. And so would the crowd. Smiling, Rainie edged back to survey the dance floor. Yes, there would be enough room for them to put on a show.</p><p>When she turned back, Gabi was lining up her prizes on the table...right next to the ones Uzuri had won. Good God.</p><p>Sensing a competition, Sally emptied her silver-striped party bag. A giant green dildo skidded across the table.</p><p>\u201cSally!\u201d Kim hissed, a little too loudly.</p><p>Around them, conversations dimmed as eyeballs locked onto the array of sex toys.</p><p>\u201cHulkorama wanted out,\u201d Sally announced innocently. \u201cHe\u2019s too big to like being covered up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true enough.\u201d Gabi wrinkled her nose at the green-veins bulging all over the dildo. \u201cThat\u2019s one ugly wanker. At least Iron Mania has some class.\u201d Picking up a sleek, dark-red-with-gold-stripes dildo, she waggled it at Sally.</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always preferred American military heroes,\u201d Rainie said, drawing her dildo like a sword. It was a gloriously garish red-white-and-blue, and dotted with stars. \u201cThe Captain here feels it\u2019s his patriotic duty to serve right up to his last brea\u2014uh, vibration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, good point.\u201d Gabi scowled. \u201cI bet Iron Mania has a vile sense of humor. I\u2019m not sure I can take an evil vibe as well as an evil Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooo, baby, that sounds like a story. What did Master Marcus do?\u201d Uzuri asked.</p><p>\u201cNo wait\u2014first tell us what you did to get in trouble?\u201d Kim asked with a knowing smile.</p><p>Gabi pouted. \u201cThat stupid inflatable swan had a leak, so I was patching it, and I had the glue out, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And?\u201d As Uzuri absentmindedly toyed with the bulging veins on the green dildo, a man walking by spilled his drink.</p><p>\u201cI just... Well, I glued together a bunch of the nipple clamps and gave the swan a pretty necklace.\u201d</p><p>As the shrieks of laughter burst around the table, Gabi started to giggle. \u201cYou should have seen Marcus\u2019s face when he saw the swan. Then when he couldn\u2019t get the tweezers clamps to open, his face got all...\u201d Gabi pulled her brows together and set her mouth into a line.</p><p>Kim\u2019s head was planted in her hands, her shoulders shaking.</p><p>Uzuri was holding her sides. Sally leaned against her for support.</p><p>Mistress Anne shook her head in disapproval...but her lips were twitching.</p><p>Rainie managed to gasp, \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know how he is...\u201d Gabi lowered her voice and added a southern accent, \u201cWell, darlin\u2019, you got thayut swan all fancied up, ah do believe you should join it foah a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Uzuri muttered.</p><p>\u201cE-zactilamente.\u201d Gabi gave a decidedly drunken nod. \u201cThe bastard tied a butterfly vibe right over my clit, put me on the swan, and chained my nipples to that damned necklace so tight I couldn\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ow,\u201d Rainie muttered, folding her arms over her chest in sympathy. Nipple clamps were the worst.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right? Then he lounged by the pool, drinking his Grey Goose, and playing with the vibe\u2019s remote controls. Oh Lord, I\u2019m sure the neighbors could hear me begging\u2014and by the time he let me come, I know they heard me scream.\u201d</p><p>Rainie laughed so hard she had to push her thighs together to keep from peeing.</p><p>Next to her, Anne was grinning, but her expression was intrigued. Uh-oh. If the Mistress had a swimming pool, some poor submissive would be in for some rough pool sex.</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d Kim\u2019s attempt at sternness was ruined by her sputtering giggles. \u201cLadies, put your toys away before you get us evicted. Or before Ben blushes so much his face explodes.\u201d</p><p>To the poor security guard\u2019s horror, they all turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cBoy, you white people can really turn red,\u201d Uzuri said in awe.</p><p>Rainie tried to smother her snickers by drinking and ended up almost choking to death.</p><p>\u201cNo dying during a party.\u201d Mistress Anne gave her a well-placed whack between her shoulder blades.</p><p>The impact didn\u2019t clear her airways, but the pain definitely did. \u201cGod have mercy,\u201d Rainie wheezed. \u201cI mean, Mistress, mercy.\u201d</p><p>After nodding a polite acceptance, Anne smiled as the bartender himself delivered their order.</p><p>He set the shots and drinks around the table, saving the last for Anne.</p><p>She held up one finger to him to wait and stood. \u201cReady, ladies?\u201d</p><p>They rose and then hammered their hands on the table to create a thundering drumroll.</p><p>With the others, Rainie lifted her tiny glass high. After downing the shot, she slammed her glass onto the table. A chorus of thuds came from the others.</p><p>Hands lifted, a screech erupted. \u201cG and S Smackdown!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for Gabi and me!\u201d Sally yelled. She and Gabi leaned across the table and exchanged a lascivious kiss.</p><p>\u201cThank God, the grooms aren\u2019t here,\u201d Kim muttered to Rainie.</p><p>\u201cNo shi\u2014kidding.\u201d Rainie glanced over to see Anne holding the bartender\u2019s face between her palms and saying, \u201cYou did very well, Lance. I\u2019m pleased with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, if the guy possessed a tail, he\u2019d wag it,\u201d Rainie said under her breath to Kim.</p><p>Kim huffed a laugh and touched the diamond-studded choker around her neck\u2014the symbol of her relationship to her Master. \u201cYou know, when Master Raoul praises me, I\u2019m exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>The edges of Rainie\u2019s happiness singed before she pushed her envy away. Kim had suffered, almost died before reaching safety with Raoul. Rainie planted a loud kiss on her friend\u2019s cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You deserve every bit of the happiness you have.\u201d</p><p>When Kim\u2019s eyes filled, Rainie shook her head. \u201cNone of that, BFF.\u201d She lifted her glass of champagne. \u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>The women looked up expectantly.</p><p>\u201cTo ex-trainees Gabi and Sally,\u201d Rainie said, \u201cwho left behind a matchless legacy of brattiness.\u201d</p><p>Under the cover of the clinking glasses and cheers, Anne resumed her seat. Her penetrating gaze settled on Rainie. \u201cSpeaking of brats, I still owe you a punishment for those bugs you put in my locker.\u201d</p><p>Rainie jerked, spilling her drink. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I do. But perhaps I\u2019ll let Jake handle the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Just his name made Rainie\u2019s heart rate increase. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard he enjoyed spanking you last night. I daresay he\u2019d be delighted to get another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No way.\u201d The dismay\u2014and excitement\u2014was almost enough to drive the alcohol from Rainie\u2019s system. \u201cHe\u2019s... I don\u2019t even like him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anne\u2019s lips curved up. \u201cI\u2019ll let him know you feel so strongly about him that you actually lied to me.\u201d</p><p>Rainie glared. \u201cThis conversation is under the bachelorette party seal. Silence is sacred.\u201d</p><p>Anne just smiled.</p><p>And then the DJ said, \u201cNow we have a song dedicated to G and S.\u201d</p><p>Their music came on.</p><p>\u201cGet your chairs, ladies,\u201d Rainie announced. \u201cWe\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Jake\u2019s gut hurt from laughing as he sipped his drink and watched the bachelorette party. Sex toys all over the table. Girl on girl action. The women were totally blitzed and cuter than a room of kittens.</p><p>As the music changed to Girls, Girls, Girls by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, they jumped to their feet. Holding their chairs in front like shields, they strutted their way to the dance section. The chairs hit the floor with a loud thump, and the women faced the room in one choreographed move.</p><p>Grinning, Jake leaned forward to watch.</p><p>To his amazement, the submissives\u2014and Anne\u2014proceeded to perform an incredible meld of pole and lap dancing, using some of the sexiest moves he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Sally learn that shit?\u201d Vance muttered to Galen.</p><p>Nolan frowned.</p><p>Marcus was tapping his fingers on the table in time with the beat, obviously enjoying the show.</p><p>Raoul, not so much. A low growl came from the Hispanic Master.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Jake asked him.</p><p>\u201cShe is showing off what is mine.\u201d With a glance at Jake, his frown lightened. \u201cDo not look so worried. I will not punish her\u2014much\u2014for breaking a rule I hadn\u2019t mentioned. She will know better in the future.\u201d</p><p>Jake relaxed. Far be it from him to come between a Master and his slave, but Kim wouldn\u2019t knowingly upset her Master. Raoul knew it and would undoubtedly find his sense of humor once his woman was no longer being stared at.</p><p>Every guy in the place was definitely staring...with good reason. The women were mesmerizing as they danced. Wiggled. Shimmied. When their mesh-stockinged legs slid over the backs of chairs, all a man could think of was feeling a soft inner thigh against his shoulder.</p><p>Rainie straddled the chair seat, wiggling her hips, and Jake\u2019s cock pulsed with every beat of the music. The damned place had grown far too hot.</p><p>Needing to do something with his fingers\u2014which had curved as if to grasp lush hips\u2014he opened his dress shirt another button. Dammit, he wanted to be on that chair with Rainie rubbing those gorgeous breasts on his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, gentlemen.\u201d Marcus rose and tossed back the last of his drink. \u201cI have a floozy to catch.\u201d</p><p>Everyone watched him stroll through the tables, then Vance and Galen stood. \u201cSorry, men,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBachelorette party will lose their second bride as well.\u201d</p> <p>Jake grinned as the two walked away, discussing bondage and orgasms. Little Sally was in for a long hard night.</p><p>Marcus had reached the dance floor. When Gabi turned toward him, he hefted her over his shoulder. Her screech of surprise reached from wall to wall. The second scream was sheer anger. Given the mouth on that little submissive, Jake was pleased to be out of hearing range.</p><p>Sally had tripped when Gabi was carried away. After catching her balance, she managed to plant her ass on the chair rather than the floor and just sat there laughing.</p><p>Still dancing, the others were teasing her as she struggled to adjust her dress.</p><p>In a well-executed ambush, Galen picked up the back of Sally\u2019s chair and Vance yanked up on the front legs, tipping Sally back. As they bore their prize away, Sally was giggling too hard to protest.</p><p>Nolan rose. After a nod to the men, he strode to the dance floor and nabbed his Beth off the end of the line so quietly that none of the women noticed her disappearance.</p><p>Smooth. Jake grinned. Probably why the sneaky bastard had managed to get so many shots off in laser tag.</p><p>A moment later, Raoul slapped Jake\u2019s shoulder and nodded to Holt in farewell.</p><p>Kim was doing a hip-bump with Anne when Raoul stepped onto the floor. Anne noticed him, grinned, inclined her head politely, and moved away.</p><p>With a perplexed look, Kim turned to see what had attracted Anne\u2019s attention. She saw Raoul. Even as her eyes lit with delight, she bowed her head, sweetly acknowledging her Master.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s shoulders relaxed slightly.</p><p>Nice. Very nice. How could any Master not be pleased with such pretty and instant submission?</p><p>Raoul caressed his slave\u2019s cheek, spoke to her for a moment, and then swung her up into his arms and carried her away.</p><p>The music ended a couple of beats later, leaving Anne and Rainie and Uzuri exchanging high-fives. As the women returned to the table, taking the extra chairs with them, Ben walked over.</p><p>Probably to haul them home.</p><p>It would only be polite to help out the security guard\u2014save him a drop off. Jake rose to his feet and glanced at Holt. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll try to nab myself a subbie as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing for Rainie?\u201d Holt grinned. \u201cGood thing you have balls of steel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2014so maybe she\u2019ll think twice before stuffing them in her garbage disposal.\u201d</p><p>Rainie settled into her chair with a pitiful sigh. Raoul\u2019s behavior with Kim had been so dominatingly romantic, it had hollowed out a place in her chest.</p><p>No one will ever love me like that.</p><p>She made herself smile at Uzuri and Anne. \u201cOur poor group. Attacked and picked off one by one. We\u2019re the sole survivors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the Doms upset with the dancing?\u201d Uzuri bit her lip. \u201cAngry?\u201d</p><p>Rainie patted her hand. She got the feeling Uzuri had experience with...disapproving men. Not getting dumped like Rainie, but more physical. \u201cGirlfriend, the others might get fucked to death, but nothing worse.\u201d</p><p>As Uzuri shook off the past, her smile broke out. \u201cIt did look as if the guys were a bit...aroused.\u201d</p><p>Anne snorted and picked up the giant green dildo. \u201cAbout to this degree, I\u2019d say from my wealth of experience.\u201d</p><p>A throat cleared. Ben stood beside the table, staring at the green monster. His darkly red face clashed with his pink pimp shirt. \u201cAre you ready for your transport home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so. Thank you, Ben.\u201d Anne stuffed the dildos into the correct party bags and handed them to the security guard, increasing his embarrassment.</p><p>As Anne rose, the bartender hurried over to offer his business card with obvious deference and embarrassment. Anne set her dainty foot on a chair and fisted the bartender\u2019s white shirt, pulling him closer. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice boy.\u201d She plucked the card from his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t beg\u2014although it was close. Rainie nodded approval.</p><p>As he headed back to his job, Anne watched, tapping the card on her palm.</p><p>\u201cWill you call him?\u201d Rainie asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Anne dropped the card in her bag\u2014the one with a tiny flogger tied to the handle. \u201cI\u2019m not in the market for new boys.\u201d</p><p>Rainie exchanged a concerned glance with Uzuri. The Mistress hadn\u2019t been the same since breaking up with her submissive Joey months ago. Although she still played with random \u201cboys\u201d at the Shadowlands, she always left alone.</p><p>Someone needed to talk with her, but Rainie quailed at the thought. Anne wasn\u2019t the type who\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this one home, Ben.\u201d The deeply masculine voice came from behind Rainie.</p><p>Jake? She twisted in her chair\u2014not an easy move considering the snug fit of her bustier. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t need a ride.\u201d</p><p>A tailored suit enhanced his broad shoulders, and the open shirt collar framed his corded throat. Sensuality darkened his chiseled features as he smiled down at her. She could happily stare at him for hours, just taking in all that was Jake.</p><p>He slid her chair back from the table as if it held a feather pillow rather than a very ample woman. \u201cI\u2019m going to escort you home and check on your dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dog?\u201d Her brains must have been overtaken by the alcohol...or something.</p><p>His smile disappeared. \u201cDon\u2019t you still have the pup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhage? Of course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He grasped her upper arms with strong hands and effortlessly lifted her to her feet.</p><p>Her heart fluttered as if buffeted by a gusting wind.</p><p>Uzuri handed Jake Rainie\u2019s bag. \u201cSo you were with the bachelor party?\u201d</p><p>With his attention on Uzuri, Rainie managed to inhale.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Jake answered Uzuri. \u201cBy the way, when I checked the trainee records last night, I saw your goals haven\u2019t been updated recently. Do so before next weekend, please.\u201d</p><p>Blinking in surprise, Uzuri glanced at Rainie.</p><p>Oh yeah, he got me too. Rainie bugged out her eyes at her friend.</p><p>Jake turned in time to see. He bent down to whisper in Rainie\u2019s ear, \u201cBe careful, subbie. I\u2019d enjoy another excuse to turn that fine ass of yours bright red.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran from the top of her spine right down to her toes...and he chuckled.</p><p>Turning, he nodded at the Mistress who stood at the other end of the table. \u201cAnne, when you get some time, I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t Rainie.\u201d The shrill voice from nearby scraped away Rainie\u2019s composure like fingernails on a chalkboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t be real. Even the Gods wouldn\u2019t be so evil. Slowly, Rainie turned to see her old high school classmate. Life really wasn\u2019t fair sometimes.</p><p>Praying Jake and the others wouldn\u2019t notice, Rainie walked toward her. \u201cHello, Mandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d The brunette smirked. \u201cI\u2019m sure you remember Jefferson and Clay, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The Gods of Cruelty were feeling lively that evening since the woman\u2019s two companions were also high school classmates. They\u2019d ridiculed Rainie when she was poor, socially inept, and in dirty, ragged clothing. Their scorn had increased after they\u2019d seen her on the streets with the drug dealer.</p> <p>The two men looked her up and down as if assessing how much she\u2019d charge for a blowjob.</p><p>Her mouth twisted. She\u2019d never turned tricks. Ever.</p><p>Jefferson said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize they permitted your kind in nice clubs. How\u2019d you get in the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think, bro?\u201d Clay made kissy noises. \u201cProbably gave the bouncer a blowjob and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A second later, Jake moved right up into Clay\u2019s air space, his face set into hard lines of anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, man.\u201d Clay stumbled back a step. \u201cHey, you\u2019re Jennifer\u2019s brother. Jake, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t get out from under your rock often enough to recognize a bachelorette party?\u201d Jake\u2019s raised voice carried to the surrounding tables.</p><p>He was defending her.</p><p>Rainie\u2019s skin went hot, went cold.</p><p>\u201cNow listen\u2014\u201d Jefferson blustered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps your education is lacking in how a man should address a woman. I\u2019ll be happy to instruct you. Shall we move this outside, gentlemen?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice held a fillet-sharp edge.</p> <p>Clay and Jefferson flushed and retreated several more steps.</p><p>Mandy whined, \u201cJaaake, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She received a look only a Shadowlands\u2019 Master could deliver, and her bright red lips shut so fast the lipstick smeared.</p><p>As Jake advanced on the two men, they glanced at each other, trying to decide how to withdraw without further loss of face. Cowards.</p><p>A second later, they backed away.</p><p>\u201cNot going to fight over a piece of trash,\u201d Jefferson muttered once out of reach. They disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Rainie let out the breath she\u2019d been holding.</p><p>Mandy sneered at Rainie\u2019s low-cut bustier and short skirt before tilting her chin toward Jake. \u201cI see you figured out how to get him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Her snide tone hadn\u2019t changed from a decade ago when her gang of mean girls spotted Rainie staring at Jake. Their cutting remarks still rotted in Rainie\u2019s memory, surfacing when her spirits were low.</p> <p>As Jake walked back, Mandy sidled away.</p><p>Jake watched her leave, shaking his head. He glanced at Rainie, then over her shoulder, and his anger transformed to amusement. \u201cNo wonder the boys surrendered the field.\u201d</p><p>Rainie spun.</p><p>Ben stood nearby, his brawny arms folded over his huge chest. She was so used to his amiable grin that she\u2019d forgotten how dangerous he could appear. While Jake was a razor-sharp blade, capable of slicing a man into thin strips, Ben was a cudgel designed to flatten them into the ground.</p><p>Like an elegant stiletto knife, Mistress Anne stood beside Ben, and the deadly glint in her eyes would make anyone afraid.</p><p>Warily, Rainie edged over to stand beside Uzuri.</p><p>\u201cScary, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Uzuri said under her breath, visibly trembling.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d In the Shadowlands, Rainie had viewed whippings, knife-play, needle-play\u2014but the tops always had everything under control. They were careful, even when blood flowed. But here, the open threat of uncontrolled violence had turned her stomach.</p><p>After talking quietly for a minute, Jake, Anne, and Ben joined them.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jake\u2019s gaze swept Uzuri and Rainie.</p><p>Although Uzuri nodded, her color was more gray than brown.</p><p>Ben set a big hand on her shoulder. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to hurt you, honey. Not while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Jake stopped next to Rainie and lifted his brows. \u201cAnd you, sweetling?\u201d</p><p>Answering in the affirmative would be a lie, and annoying him right then would be unwise. So she dodged the question. \u201cThank you for the help.\u201d</p><p>Having him jump to defend her was... She couldn\u2019t even say how that made her feel. Was her shaking from her ex-classmates\u2019 cruelty or from the surprise of being protected?</p><p>How amazing. Really. She\u2019d actually been rescued by a knight in shining armor. Rainie wrapped her arms around herself, wanting to cling to the sensation of being cared for.</p><p>If only Jake had saved her from pirates or criminals, but nooo, her attackers were people who\u2019d known her. They hadn\u2019t been surprised to see her dressed like a hooker\u2014because they thought she was.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t matter if she wore the most respectable of designer clothing. They\u2019d never let her forget her past. And she\u2019d never escape them, not in Florida.</p><p>A little sick, she asked, \u201cCan we leave now, Ben?\u201d</p><p>Jake wrapped an arm around her. \u201cYou get Uzuri and Anne home, Ben. I\u2019m taking Rainie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d Rainie said as Jake parked his car.</p><p>Her voice sounded better, he thought, as if she\u2019d finally recovered from whatever screwed-up shit had happened at the nightclub. \u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see myself in.\u201d She jumped out.</p><p>Jake joined her on the sidewalk and took her arm. \u201cMy mother would disown me if I didn\u2019t escort a lady to her door.\u201d</p><p>She gave a huff of exasperation, but then smiled. \u201cDid you inherit that stubbornness from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost assuredly.\u201d His spirits lightened. Not much kept this woman down. He admired that.</p><p>Didn\u2019t admire where she lived though. The damp night air brushed over his face as he walked her to a poorly lit, three-story apartment building. The closest streetlight was dark\u2014shot out was his guess. The landscaping consisted of several dying bushes surrounded by weeds growing through sun-bleached bark mulch. How did Rainie stand it here?</p><p>Maybe it was the suit she\u2019d worn, but he\u2019d gotten the impression she had a good-paying job\u2014so why live here? This wasn\u2019t a safe place for a woman.</p><p>As they approached the end unit, she rummaged in her bag for her keys.</p><p>Her wide shawl cover-up fell open, and he reluctantly pulled it back together for her while inhaling her light, sensual scent. \u201cBetter keep this closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Her eyes darkened, and the pain he\u2019d seen during the confrontation reappeared. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to give the place a bad name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie.\u201d He touched her cheek, wanting to comfort.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Old history.\u201d She shook her head as if to dislodge the past. \u201cI really appreciate the way you rescued me.\u201d Humor returned to her face. \u201cYou\u2019re a regular paragon of chivalry. I would have said a knight in shining armor, but you\u2019re closer to a gentleman pirate, like in old Errol Flynn movies or...or even Dread Pirate Roberts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d Nice imagination. \u201cSeems like a pirate should get a reward for saving a fancy lady. Doesn\u2019t the code of the seas state that after rescuing, then comes the ravishing?\u201d</p><p>She had a gorgeous laugh, easy and open, sounding as if it came from inside her chest rather than a fake one from her throat. This was a woman he\u2019d enjoy ravishing.</p><p>\u201cI think those are more like guidelines than rules,\u201d she said seriously, although the glint in her eyes revealed laughter.</p><p>Moving closer, crowding her, he ran his finger down the sweet curve of her cheek. \u201cYou know, in a role-play, if booty isn\u2019t offered...it\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>Her color deepened, and the way her pupils dilated said she wouldn\u2019t be adverse to some rough sex and ravishing.</p><p>Then she blinked and shook her head. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She set her hand against his chest and stepped away.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t push; she\u2019d had enough stress for one night. He gave her hair a teasing tug, took the keys, and unlocked her door.</p><p>From the darkness inside, a whirlwind of a black-and-white dog assaulted her in a torrent of bouncing and barking.</p><p>She yelped and staggered back against Jake\u2019s body.</p><p>Fuck, she was soft. He steadied her and reluctantly released her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you scared me spitless, baby.\u201d Ignoring her dropped bag, she squatted to give hugs and scratches until the dog bounded away, turned two happy circles, and dove in for more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he might be a little crazy.\u201d She laughed as the pup ran out for another circle. Her gaze rose to Jake. \u201cIs he supposed to act like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally normal.\u201d Jake grinned. \u201cThis your first small dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst pet ever,\u201d came the muffled response as she buried her face in the dog\u2019s fur. When she lifted her head, her pleasure was bright enough to melt icecaps. \u201cI never knew how...how...wonderful a dog was.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the pup. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re absolutely the best dog ever, so other dogs might not measure up.\u201d</p><p>Never had a pet? Jake raked his hand through his hair. What kind of parents didn\u2019t give their kid...something? He and his sister had conned his folks into cats, dogs, rabbits, birds\u2014even mice and hamsters and gerbils, until one too many escaped, and his mother had decreed a no rodent establishment. \u201cHow come no pets?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t like animals. And later, when...Well. I never got a pet.\u201d She concentrated on picking up her spilled bag, and the light in her face dimmed.</p><p>As she rocked, trying to rise, he put a hand under her arm and helped her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She gave him an uncertain look. \u201cI appreciate you bringing me home. So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m here, I want to examine the dog. What\u2019s his name again? Anger? Fury?\u201d</p> <p>Her smile popped back out. \u201cIt\u2019s Rhage\u2014with an \u2018RH\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Right. Why the hell would she spell a name that way? Shaking his head, he lifted the pup and walked into the living room.</p><p>Pretty place. Rainie\u2019d overcome the apartment\u2019s off-white walls and beige carpet by scattering bright floral pillows over her white-denim-covered couch and chair. Artwork of ocean vistas hung on the walls, and the coffee table and end tables were constructed of glass and driftwood. The entire room had a beach-at-sunrise ambiance.</p><p>Jake took a seat on the couch and stroked Rhage\u2019s soft fur. The dog was already filling out a bit. Eyes clear. Happy smile.</p><p>\u201cEasy, boy. Let me check you over.\u201d He palpated the abdomen. Soft, non-distended. No tenderness.</p> <p>Rainie sat down beside him, petting Rhage as she listened to her cell\u2019s voice messages. A junk call. A friend hoping to meet for lunch. The closure of a phone account for a Lily someone. Absently, she rubbed her forehead.</p><p>The alcohol was probably wearing off. Jake set the dog down and patted her thigh. \u201cWhere\u2019s your aspirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bathroom. Do you have a headache? I\u2019ll get you some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay put, baby. I\u2019ll find it.\u201d After tossing his suit coat over the back of a chair, he crossed the room, detouring to check out the shelves beneath the television stand.</p><p>She had a ton of books, mostly historical and contemporary romance novels. Even the suspense stories were\u2014judging by the covers\u2014still romance. The DVDs were predominantly chick flicks. The Princess Bride DVD had been played so often the cover was cracked. Dread Pirate Roberts, hmm?</p><p>Someone was a romantic.</p> <p>In the bathroom, he rummaged for the aspirin and finally found it under the sink. With two tablets in his palm, he stepped out to an empty living room.</p><p>Loud voices drew him to the front of the apartment where Rainie stood at the door, talking with someone.</p><p>He stayed back, not wanting to intrude, although\u2014wasn\u2019t it rather late for visitors?</p><p>An unhappy realization dawned. For all he knew, she had a boyfriend. Or two. Had a date planned.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t sound pleased with the guy. When her spine went steel-post rigid, Jake decided to step in.</p><p>On the front step, the man was focused on Rainie, not seeing Jake behind her in the shadowy hallway. The blond was good-looking enough, although his slick GQ impression was ruined by a fucked-up sneer reminiscent of Professor Snape in Harry Potter. The guy told Rainie, \u201cI said this already. You make me happy; I\u2019ll make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Jake scowled. What the fuck?</p><p>Just in case his female audience missed the point, the guy patted his groin. Had a hard-on, Jake noted. Jesus, what an asshole. If Rainie wanted this guy, then, as a Shadowlands Master, Jake was going to go all Dom on her ass.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I told you already, Cory, I\u2019m the office manager,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cNot a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a whore to me. Try behaving like one. You fucking go down on me\u201d\u2014Cory unbuckled his belt\u2014\u201dor the only money you\u2019ll make will be from hooking on the streets. Cuz you won\u2019t be working for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Her voice went higher with her shock. \u201cCory, are you insane? You can\u2019t run that place without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do anything I want to. And that includes fucking the staff.\u201d</p><p>She let out a growl of pure anger, but the asshole grabbed her wrists and yanked her out the door.</p><p>Jake shook his head in surprise. Alcohol must have impaired her reactions or she\u2019d have emasculated the guy. Oh well. He stepped around Rainie and punched the asshole in the snout. Cartilage crunched satisfyingly.</p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck!\u201d Hands clapped over his face, Cory staggered back. \u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>Gently but firmly, Jake pushed Rainie behind him, catching a glimpse of her wide eyes. \u201cEasy, sweetling. Just let me finish this up.\u201d</p><p>He advanced on the asshole.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d Cory\u2019d regained his balance\u2014and discovered his nose was busted. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Right. A punch to the solar plexus doubled up the idiot. Jake quickly sidestepped to avoid any blood spatter\u2014and hammered an elbow onto the guy\u2019s back over the kidney.</p><p>Cory hit the pavement with a pleasant thump. Crying and swearing, he curled into a ball.</p><p>Jake considered kicking the bastard\u2019s junk into his throat. No, Sheffield, that would be overkill. He turned to check on Rainie.</p><p>Hands pressed to her mouth, she stood in the doorway. Eyes wide and horrified.</p><p>Hell. She\u2019d probably never seen a fight before. Might even like the asshole. Well, if she did, he was going to have a long, long talk with her.</p><p>Jake cleared his throat to get her attention. \u201cPlease tell me you two aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no, then called, \u201cHey, Cory.\u201d</p><p>The asshole had made it up to his knees. \u201cYou-you fucking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that answers my concern nicely.\u201d Jake guided her into her apartment\u2014pushing a snarling Rhage back\u2014and closed the door. With the pup trotting at his heels, he walked into the living room and settled Rainie on the couch.</p><p>Dropping down beside her, he pulled her close. \u201cYour ex-boss is an asshole, sweetling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He really is.\u201d When her lower lip trembled, she mashed her mouth into a flat line. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m unemployed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. You know, you could take legal action.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe company belongs to Cory\u2019s father. And Bart...he means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>Compassion, again. He was beginning to realize how deep her caring spirit went. \u201cHave you been working there long?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the wall, looking little-girl lost. \u201cA few years.</p><p>Long enough to feel the loss. Hell. \u201cDo you have a plan in mind?\u201d</p><p>Her face was still shell-shocked pale. \u201cI\u2014I guess I start job hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you do? I know some people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But thank you.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cI can find work, and I don\u2019t need much to survive. Not anymore.\u201d Her gaze turned toward the end table and a photo. A thin, white-haired woman posed cheek-to-cheek with a beaming Rainie, who looked about eighteen.</p><p>The grief in Rainie\u2019s face broke Jake\u2019s heart. Hell, she couldn\u2019t catch a break, could she? \u201cYour grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lily. She...gave me a home when I was seventeen.\u201d Rainie\u2019s eyes gleamed with tears before she turned her head away. \u201cShe\u2019s gone now. So, aside from Rhage, I don\u2019t have anyone to spend money on.\u201d</p><p>With a whine, Rhage crawled into her lap, and she buried her face in his fur.</p><p>Jake stayed silent, hurting for her.</p><p>Yet the more he discovered about her, the more she pleased him. The woman was more than a fun-loving submissive with attitude. She possessed a deep well of character, one he wanted to explore.</p><p>Her first thought about losing Miss Lily was regret at not having the elderly woman to care for. And a self-centered woman wouldn\u2019t rescue an injured animal, ruin her suit, risk being bitten\u2014or spend money on it afterward. Someone had a heart big enough to match her abundant body.</p><p>Jake glanced at the basket in the corner. Looked like the dog probably had more toys than Rainie\u2014although Jake wouldn\u2019t mind checking her nightstand to see how many toys she did have. Putting that thought away for some time in the more distant future, he tugged on her hair, pulling her attention back to him. A change of subject would be wise, especially since he didn\u2019t plan to leave until he knew she\u2019d be all right. \u201cYour dog looks good, by the way, and I\u2019d guess he\u2019s about two or three years old.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head. Paused. \u201cOh. Right. He\u2019s older than I thought.\u201d As she gently smoothed the dog\u2019s mustache, she asked, \u201cWhat kind of dog is he? Can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s trickier.\u201d Jake studied the beast as he stroked the wavy soft\u2014clean\u2014fur. \u201cMostly poodle.\u201d Muzzle wasn\u2019t squished. Had a double coat that was fairly heavy. Fur fell over the eyes. Ears flopped. Interesting coloring with black ears and face, white on his whiskers, chest, and legs. \u201cMight be part Tibetan Terrier. That\u2019s a good combination. Smart, friendly, not too hyper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like my baby. You\u2019re a hero, puppy.\u201d She kissed the top of Rhage\u2019s fuzzy head before smiling at Jake. \u201cAnd so are you. Thank you for the rescue.\u201d Her grateful expression made him feel as if he could accomplish anything.</p><p>Jake managed a seated bow. \u201cAll part of the pirate-rescue service. Speaking of which...\u201d He rose and retrieved the aspirin tablets along with a glass of water.</p><p>He squatted beside her and set the medicine in her hand. \u201cTake the pills and drink all the water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>Did no one take care of her? \u201cYes. Drink up, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw the dog wander over to a pile of soft blankets and settle in with a sigh.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Why was Master Jake being so nice?</p><p>Holding the water and aspirin, Rainie regarded him. He was on his haunches, perfectly comfortable in that position. His rolled-up shirtsleeves showed corded forearms under a dusting of brown hair. Along his sharp jawline, his designer stubble was darker from the day\u2019s growth. His steady gaze was compelling. This Dom didn\u2019t flaunt his power, but kept it hidden like the strong current in a deceptively lazy river.</p><p>He\u2019d saved her. After flattening Cory without even mussing his clothing, his only concern had been for her. He made her feel...special. Valued.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stay for a bit?\u201d she blurted out and wanted to cringe. What was she thinking?</p><p>His eyes crinkled. \u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p> <p>This time, she took a moment to think, but oh, her desire hadn\u2019t changed. She\u2019d craved him since she was sixteen. Sure, she was being unwise, yet, why not? As soon as she had the funds, she\u2019d move from Florida and wouldn\u2019t see him ever again. She breathed out, accepting the pain in the same way she\u2019d absorb the impact from a flogger. \u201cYes. Stay. But I don\u2019t want anything serious. A one-night stand is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed at her qualification. At the club, he\u2019d picked up on the fact she wasn\u2019t searching for a permanent Dom. But still...it should be a relief to him now, right?</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything...just looked at her.</p><p>Under his intent gaze, her entire body heated as if a desert wind swept across her skin. She could smell his cologne\u2014a light scent that combined sex and male in one heady note. Her hand moved of its own accord, over his lean cheek, along the stern jawline.</p><p>His lips curved against her fingers. \u201cYou sure, sweetling?\u201d he asked, his voice huskier.</p><p>Yet the glint of laughter in his gaze made her stiffen. \u201cYou\u2019re the Dom. Aren\u2019t you supposed to make all the decisions?\u201d</p> <p>He turned her wrist over and kissed it lightly. How could his firm lips feel like velvet? \u201cAbsolutely\u2014after you say this is what you want. I need to hear the words.\u201d The resolve in his tone said he wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cAfter that, since you\u2019re not a newbie, I stop only if you safeword with \u2018red.\u2019\u201d</p><p>God, it was as if he\u2019d flipped open a hormone switch that sent all the blood in her body straight to her core. Put up or shut up, Rainie.</p><p>How rare for a man to be so straightforward. None of that \u201cC\u2019mon, baby, just let me...\u201d And oh, she wanted him more than she could say. She leaned forward, her mouth almost on his. What would he taste like? \u201cI\u2019d like you to take me\u2014in any way you desire.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in a formal acknowledgment she couldn\u2019t duplicate in a million years. \u201cAs you wish, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>Her insides instantly turned to melted jelly, but he didn\u2019t give her a chance to process how he\u2019d sounded exactly like Westley from The Princess Bride.</p><p>He curved his callused hand around her nape and held her in place as his mouth grazed over hers, settled, and then took...slowly and so thoroughly she felt ravished without ever taking a stitch off.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He studied her face and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s have another.\u201d</p><p>When he halted the next time, she was dizzy, barely comprehending he was guiding her into the bedroom.</p> <p>He stopped in the doorway, perhaps in surprise at changing from her cottage-style living room to an Italian Renaissance bedroom.</p><p>Although threadbare, the richly colored tapestries brightened the walls and faded Oriental rugs were layered over the beige carpeting. Her prize\u2014an ornate Italianate frame bed\u2014took up most of the room. Dark red, gauze draperies hung from a suspended metal frame to create an Old-World style canopy bed.</p><p>Smiling, Jake ran his finger down her cheek. \u201cYou really are a romantic at heart.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran through her as he tilted his head back to study the well-anchored, rectangular frame that hung a foot below the ceiling. \u201cWell.\u201d His low voice brushed like suede against her skin. \u201cThis has potential.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, belatedly realizing how many tie points the bed and frame provided. And this man was a Dom.</p><p>Perhaps she should have kept him in the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo...wench.\u201d As his lips twisted into a cruel smile, he curled his fingers over the top of her bustier and yanked her forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t save you from your sinking ship\u2014and my crew\u2014to receive a mere verbal thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d Her eyes widened as he started unhooking the front of her garment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to inspect what my sword has won me.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Her heart pounded as the bustier fell to the floor, and air brushed her damp skin. He lifted her breast, teasing the nipple with a thumbnail. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to play with these.\u201d The corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cAlthough you might not enjoy it as much as I will.\u201d</p><p>The sensuous threat sizzled straight to her pussy even as he unfastened her short skirt and shoved her thong down, leaving her in only a garter belt and mesh stockings.</p><p>\u201cThose can stay on.\u201d Satisfaction filled in his gaze. \u201cVery nice.\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the bed. \u201cUp there, wench. Sit on the edge and await my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cToo slow.\u201d He curved his long fingers around the front of her neck and smacked her bottom hard enough to make her yelp.</p><p>A whine came from behind the closed door, and she realized he\u2019d shut Rhage out.</p><p>Jake\u2019s gaze followed hers and filled with amusement. \u201cNo rescue for you, sweetling.\u201d He swatted her again, smiling at her squeak. \u201cTonight, you\u2019re mine for as long as I want to use you.\u201d</p><p>The hand around her throat was big enough to grip without shutting off her air...and yet, and yet...if he tightened his fingers, he could.</p><p>Knowing she was here alone with him sent little tremors up her spine. Not...quite...fear.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me now.\u201d The dark edge of threat sliced into her defenses like a razor through silk.</p><p>The burning from her spanked bottom and helplessness under his hands were affecting her, she knew. Nonetheless, her legs inched apart.</p><p>He ran his hand between her thighs. \u201cI love a smooth, bare pussy. A pussy that gets wet from spankings is even better.\u201d</p><p>Doms discovered secrets. It\u2019s what they did. So why did each bit of knowledge he acquired make her as uneasy as though she\u2019d surrendered part of her soul?</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He pointed again to the bed.</p><p>She certainly didn\u2019t hesitate this time. As she planted her butt on the mattress, he rummaged her bedroom. He picked up several silky scarves from the golden brackets on the wall. Purse straps came from a shelf in her closet. Then he opened the drawer to her nightstand and made a gratified sound.</p><p>Embarrassed heat flooded her face. \u201cNo. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes down, woman, or I\u2019ll blindfold you.\u201d He picked up a tube of...</p><p>God, that was the peppermint clit stimulant she\u2019d recently bought and had been too chicken to use. She heard its wrapping tear and managed not to look up.</p><p>Hard hands pushed her knees apart, and he used the applicator to smear the stuff all over her throbbing clit, ignoring her squirming.</p><p>After tossing the tube onto the nightstand, he asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t own any nipple clamps?\u201d</p><p>God, no. Her breasts were sensitive enough without pointed pokey clamps. She shook her head and dared a look at him.</p><p>His cheek creased as he looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, wench. I have other ways to torture female parts.\u201d</p><p>She considered grabbing a pillow and covering up the target area. But surely, he wouldn\u2019t push her past what she could take. She knew that. Right?</p><p>After examining the gauze canopy curtains for sturdiness, he repositioned the fabric along the metal rail. He tied two opposite sides together to form a kind of sling near the head of the bed.</p><p>Finding the candles in the wall shelves, he lit them. Then he checked her music selection on the iPod. When Kitaro\u2019s soft strains drifted from the small speakers, she knew he\u2019d discovered her playlist labeled \u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t miss a trick.</p><p>\u201cEyes down, Rainie,\u201d he warned her again.</p><p>She tried to obey, but had to\u2014just had to\u2014watch him.</p><p>He sat down in front of her and picked up the first of the scarves, rubbing it teasingly over her skin. Silky and cool. He wrapped it under and around her breasts in an intricate form of breast bondage and...just the sight of his strong fingers, the brushing of his hands as he worked, made her hotter than sex with anyone else.</p><p>Slowly, he tightened the knots, and her breasts were forced outward, the skin taut. \u201cVery pretty,\u201d he murmured as he tied off the last knot. He took her mouth again in a long wet kiss, even as he caressed her now-tightly squeezed breasts.</p><p>\u201cLots of toys, but no nipple clamps,\u201d he said. \u201cMust mean these babies are sensitive, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>And his damned bondage increased the sensation. Her \u201cum-hmm\u201d of agreement rose into a mew as his fingers circled her swelling nipples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRainie.\u201d He brushed his knuckle back and forth over her jutting left nipple, sending a sizzle straight to her core. \u201cWhen I told you to lower your eyes, you disobeyed me. Am I correct?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded.</p><p>The controlled power in his gaze kept her trapped. \u201cSince it matters so much to you, you may watch me. However\u2014do you want to obey me, Rainie?\u201d</p><p>His question was even. No judgment however she\u2019d answer.</p><p>Did she want to obey him?</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered. She really did.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to punish you for the disobedience. Next time, if you don\u2019t agree with my order, you may question me. I might explain or relent. But you will obey. Clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d His fingers closed on her right nipple, squeezing to the point of pain\u2014and over.</p><p>Ow, ow, ow.</p><p>As his fingers continued the pressure, tears burned in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to suffer this,\u201d he murmured, stroking her hair with his free hand. \u201cBreathe past it, sweetling.\u201d</p><p>Even as she inhaled through her nose, the sinking sensation of surrender closed like a wave over her head. He wouldn\u2019t allow disobedience and really would enforce his rules. The knowledge was...devastatingly erotic.</p><p>When his fingers released her, the blood surged into her breast with a sharp influx of relief and pain, and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Jake licked her sore nipple. The moist heat increased the burn, then eased it. Her heart sped even faster as his tongue curled around the peak.</p><p>On her clit, the peppermint ointment warmed, increasing to a light burning. She squirmed at the influx of sensations.</p><p>He laughed and, with an easy movement, rolled her onto her back in the center of the bed.</p><p>\u201cJake. Sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Smiling, he pushed her legs apart and knelt between them. As if he had all the time in the world, he teased her breasts, kissed her stomach, and took a long study of her pussy.</p><p>She closed her eyes. What a place to look at.</p><p>\u201cThe tube said peppermint.\u201d He had a brigand\u2019s grin. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if they got the flavor right.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, it was her most carnal of fantasies coming true\u2014Jake Sheffield going down on her. A tremor went through Rainie as he lowered his head.</p><p>His breath laved her sensitive tissues, making the peppermint ointment turn both cold and exquisitely hot. \u201cMmm, pussy and peppermint\u2014great combination.\u201d</p> <p>The deliberate brush of his unshaven jaw on her inner thigh made her squeak and jerk. Made him laugh.</p><p>Even as his tongue teased circles around her clit, he slowly pressed a finger into her pussy. Her hips rose, and his free hand held her down.</p><p>She whined an objection.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, little captive.\u201d He added another finger. \u201cThis is my body to enjoy\u2014or to punish.\u201d The threat pushed her to try to obey, even as his fingers explored deeper inside her, wakening every nerve.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cI usually suggest Sir or Master, but I suppose God is adequately respectful.\u201d Her snort made him chuckle. And then he sucked on her clit so forcefully her hips bucked at the thundering pleasure, and every thought drained right out of her mind.</p><p>When he lifted his head, she wanted to yank him back to the position. He licked his lips. \u201cThe ointment isn\u2019t as strong as breath strips, but it\u2019s got a good flavor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, that\u2019s a relief,\u201d she muttered. Her face felt like it was sunburned, so who was her sarcasm kidding? Knowing she tasted good was a relief.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing some more squirming from the heat though,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cNext time, if I don\u2019t plan to do oral, I\u2019ll use something harsher\u2014when my mouth won\u2019t be at risk.\u201d</p><p>Harsher? On her pink bits? Her head shook in an involuntary no, and he laughed, then his teeth closed on her clit, ever so gently.</p><p>As his tongue flickered over her trapped nub, an unstoppable tide of pleasure flowed through her. She wiggled, losing her hold on reality, and he pinned her hips and continued using his tongue as a weapon. Pressure built inside her, swirling low in her pelvis.</p><p>The ointment had made her so, so sensitive, and the teasing flicks on her clit kept her moaning as he thrust his fingers in, pulled out, again and again, relentlessly transporting her to a peak from both inside and outside.</p><p>She thought at one point that she was taking too long and tried to move. \u201cYour turn.\u201d When she tried to pull him up to fuck her, he snorted and captured her wrists, holding them against her stomach to pin her down.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even need to speak\u2014his actions showed he\u2019d do\u2014and take\u2014what he wanted. Her head fell back onto the bed.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t lose a beat. His tongue tapped lightly on her increasingly sensitive clit, even as his fingers kept up a steady in and out.</p><p>God, God, God. She was there. Right there. Her muscle strained to the point of pain.</p><p>\u201cLet go, buttercup,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He traced his tongue over her engorged clit and along the edge of the hood before rubbing ruthlessly.</p><p>Every nerve in her lower half went off as if someone threw a match into a fireworks booth. The zinging and exploding and sparkling spread upward until her whole body shook with the climax.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I love the way you come.\u201d</p><p>Dazedly, she opened her eyes.</p><p>Fingers still deep within her, he watched her intently. A slight smile curved his lips.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d she whispered. His turn. She should\u2014</p><p>\u201cI think you have one more in you.\u201d He lowered his head. His mouth closed around her clit, and he sucked...and rotated his fingers inside her.</p><p>\u201cAaah.\u201d Another wave of explosions ripped through her.</p><p>When she finally floated down from the vicinity of the ceiling, heat radiated from her skin as if her body\u2019d been in a bonfire. Her heart still thudded enough to jostle her rib cage. \u201cAm I dead?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, wench. However, the ship won\u2019t dock for several hours, and I intend to have my way with you over and over again.\u201d Propped on one elbow, he lazily ran his gaze over her with obvious pleasure. \u201cYou might not survive.\u201d</p><p>His lips were tipped up at the corners. Teasing her. Oh God. She heard a sound escape her, the one a prizefighter would make when punched right in the stomach.</p><p>Because...because sex with Master Jake was better than dancing. What had she done? She didn\u2019t need to\u2014want to\u2014know this.</p><p>His regard intensified.</p><p>No. No, no, no. This evening was to be fun. Temporary. A one-night stand. Checking something off her bucket list\u2014not creating an impossible-to-ever-meet memory.</p><p>\u201cSweetling, what\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>Role-play, Rainie. Pirate talk. She hauled in a breath and put her head into the game. \u201cListen, you scabby-arsed, scurvy-brained...\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cDamn, girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c...thumb-sucking, syphilitic, slimy scalawag.\u201d She scowled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll never, ever cooperate, no matter what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye, there\u2019s a challenge I\u2019ll take.\u201d He glided his powerful hand up her thigh and his squeeze made clear how strong he was. And just his touch made her core clench in response. \u201cYou\u2019ll cooperate...because I won\u2019t give you a choice, wench.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she knew how to make an evening fun, Jake thought as he stripped off his shirt and pants and sheathed himself, enjoying the way she watched him. Her open appreciation was a delight.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me, you bilious, butt-scratching, baboon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will, me buxom beauty.\u201d He rolled her to uncover her ass cheeks and smacked her hard enough to provide adequate incentive.</p><p>By the third swat, she was up on her knees, facing the head of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re in a nicer position, don\u2019t you think?\u201d With his hand in the soft mass of her hair, he tilted her head back and kissed the pout from her lips. \u201cSay, \u2018Yes, me wonderful Captain.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit with laughter and surrender, infinitely pleasing. \u201cYes, me wonderful Captain.\u201d</p><p>Holding the improvised drapery sling out, he said, \u201cArms against your sides. Put your head and shoulders through here.</p><p>That got him a worried glower, but she did as he ordered.</p><p>Before she had second thoughts, he slid the sling down her torso to below her breasts. Her lower ribs rested on the fabric. Most of her weight remained on her knees, but the sling supported her upper body. \u201cIt\u2019ll hold you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, it will,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>But when he shoved her legs farther apart, she was forced to trust more of her weight to the drapery swing.</p><p>After a second or two, she realized she couldn\u2019t straighten up...and that the sling had pinned her arms against her sides. She was trapped. \u201cYou...you bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother insists not.\u201d He rolled to his back and maneuvered himself between her legs until she straddled him with a knee on each side of his hips. Perfect. He liked having a woman on top, but in Rainie\u2019s case, if she were over him on her hands and knees, her breasts would hang too low for him to enjoy. And wouldn\u2019t that be a shame?</p><p>This way, the sling not only gave her some support, but also angled her just right to let him play. A hard-working pirate deserved some fun, after all...and he loved bondage in all its forms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran the head of his cock over her wet pussy and pushed just inside. The sensation of moist heat shook his control. \u201cDon\u2019t move, me beauty.\u201d</p><p>In open defiance\u2014half for role-playing and half reality\u2014she fought the restraints, trying to get her arms loose, trying to kneel up. She failed. Panting, she glared at him. \u201cYou...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck, sweetheart,\u201d he said quietly. He smiled into her vulnerable eyes, assessing her. Not afraid, but anxious, definitely. He\u2019d stolen away her ability to control the sex\u2014and they both knew he intended to give her a good fucking.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d she whispered in a plea to be released, but beneath it, loud and clear, was the desire to be taken. Was there anything more enthralling to a Dom than a submissive\u2019s need to be both cherished and ravaged? Than her need to feel safe\u2014and scared.</p><p>\u201cShhh, you\u2019ll be fine, baby.\u201d He ran his thumb over her soft lips, slowly. Back and forth.</p><p>Her breathing slowed.</p><p>Then he made his voice cruel. Edged. \u201c\u2019Tis a shame, beauty, but I can do whatever I want to you. And I will.\u201d Even as her eyes widened, he curled his fingers around her hips, gripped...and yanked her down onto his cock.</p><p>Her neck arched, her mouth opened in a soundless cry. Fuck, she was slick and hot, and her cunt clenched around him, welcoming him to the heart of her. He held there, letting her adjust to his size.</p><p>Her back had arched, pushing her chest toward him in a pretty invitation. The scarves had made her breasts swollen and taut, so he cupped them and rubbed his thumbs over the nipples.</p><p>She made little whimpering moans, pain and excitement, as he continued stroking the softest of velvety skin. So fucking responsive.</p><p>As her core relaxed slightly, he gripped her hips and moved her up and down on his cock a few times, watching arousal overwhelm her anxiety. Beautiful. Then he pushed her up until the head of his shaft barely remained inside her. Time to add in another element\u2014a submissive\u2019s joy in serving, in making her Dom happy. \u201cCan you show me, baby, how still you can hold? For me?\u201d</p><p>Blinking, she focused on him. She had the prettiest gold-flecked hazel eyes. So vulnerable. Like her body\u2014open to him completely. She swallowed. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d After a second, her leg muscles hardened, and she held the position.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl. Look at me, baby.\u201d</p><p>As he rubbed his palms over her jutting nipples, everything she felt showed.</p><p>She had sensitive breasts\u2014his favorite kind. He spread his fingers over the beautiful mounds and squeezed lightly. Her nipples contracted to adorable nubs as he teased them.</p><p>Her pupils widened until more black than hazel showed. Each inhalation brought him the scent of her musk and her unique spicy fragrance</p><p>As he studied her, he carefully increased the pressure to the edge of pain, learning what it took to pull her to that place where the world faded and to keep her there, piling sensation after sensation onto her pleasure.</p><p>Far before he was ready, her cunt clenched around him like a hot fist, and the insides of her thighs quivered uncontrollably against him.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re a delight, sweetheart.\u201d How long had he wanted to see her like this? Be inside her like this? With one hand, he cupped her face, caressing her damp cheek with his thumb. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Even though her gaze had gone unfocused, her lips curved.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to take you hard, sweetling,\u201d he said. He gripped her breasts in the most intimate of restraints, hearing the soft whoosh of her inhalation. With one swift move, he shoved his hips up\u2014burying himself to the root.</p><p>Her body shook from the impact, and her hair brushed with feather strokes against his chest. \u201cOh, God.\u201d Her clear voice had turned to a smoky hoarseness.</p><p>He made his tone stern. \u201cThis time, buttercup, I want you to ask before you come.\u201d</p> <p>With a tiny nod, she acknowledged his order, and her mouth set into an adorable line of determination.</p><p>Her top half was pinned in the sling, holding her trapped, while he gripped her hips and pistoned into her softness, fast, then slow. Absolute heaven. The burn in his balls grew. The air itself thickened. The slapping of moist flesh blended with the music.</p><p>As her pussy muscles contracted, her whimpering grew louder. \u201cPlease. Please.\u201d She tried to lift up, to wiggle. \u201cI need to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I choose.\u201d He refilled his palms with her breasts, preventing her movement, forcing her to take what he gave. What they both wanted.</p><p>Muscle by muscle, her body grew rigid, and her vagina clamped around him. She was panting, quivering with the need to go faster, and so he paused, holding his shaft barely inside to torture them both. \u201cLook at me, sweetling.\u201d</p><p>Her wide eyes glowed in her pink-flushed face. \u201cPleeeze.\u201d Her voice was almost inaudible.</p><p>He pinched her nipples in the same rhythm as his thrusts had achieved. Her moan made him smile. But enough teasing. She was in a beautiful place\u2014right at the edge\u2014and needed no more stimulation.</p><p>\u201cCome now, baby.\u201d He squeezed the velvety areolas and rolled, even as he thrust in hard and fast.</p><p>She gasped, and her cunt clenched him in a mind-blowing vise of pleasure. And then she was coming, wiggling, spasming, crying\u2014and driving him toward his own climax.</p><p>Like a volcano, the pressure built inside him, squeezing his balls from within, then burning through his shaft in a wrenching eruption of heat and pleasure.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, his heart rate returned to normal. In blessed contentment, he savored the tiny erratic spasms of her easing climax. Her nipples unbunched; her flush lightened.</p><p>Using his abdominal muscles, he sat up far enough to kiss her generous mouth and nip the plump lower lip.</p><p>Her lips curved under his.</p><p>\u201cYou make a superb captive,\u201d he said, just to hear her throaty laugh.</p><p>\u201cSure I am.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. She really was, and if she thought this was a one-night stand, she was in for a surprise. Smiling slightly, he kissed her again, taking his time, enjoying the feel of her...everywhere.</p><p>You\u2019re not done with me yet, sweetling.</p><p>After he\u2019d cleaned himself up, he released her. As she cleaned up, he put the room back to rights, then tucked her into her bed. Obviously exhausted, sassy mouth silenced, she merely blinked at him.</p><p>Jake opened the bedroom door and tossed Rhage up onto the bed. As the dog curled up near the footboard, Jake slid in under the covers.</p><p>Rainie gave him a surprised look. \u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d</p><p>Her lips were generous when he took her mouth. \u201cI am.\u201d She was on her back, and he slid his arm under her head and cupped her closest breast in his other hand. Oh yes, he was going to enjoy the rest of the night. \u201cPirates do that.\u201d</p><p>She snorted softly. \u201cOf course they do.\u201d Idly, she stroked his upper arm and traced out the tattoo on his deltoid\u2014a V covering a caduceus and winged staff. \u201cThat\u2019s a medical insignia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm. Army Veterinary Corp.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in perplexity. \u201cThe military has veterinarians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince World War I, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure, but back then, they used horses and mules. Now...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the soldiers use dogs.\u201d For bomb sniffing, among other things, and his memories weren\u2019t good. He\u2019d lost friends, both human and canine, in Afghanistan. The ache in his chest and gut made it difficult to inhale.</p><p>Rainie curled her fingers around his arm, the pressure a comfort.</p><p>Don\u2019t be a wimp, Sheffield. He forced his lips to curve up. \u201cWe also treated normal pets on bases, did public health work, disease control.\u201d It hadn\u2019t been all heartbreaking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only five years older than me\u2014maybe thirty or thirty-one\u2014so when did you fit in a long education? Doesn\u2019t getting a veterinary degree take time?\u201d</p><p>Now, how did she know his age? She\u2019d obviously asked about him. \u201cI skipped a grade in elementary school and did my bachelor\u2019s in three years. Four years to get the DVM, four of active service. Saxon and I bought the clinic a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>She stared. \u201cSaxon? Our Saxon from the Shadowlands, who likes puppy play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet-suffering fudgesicles, I need to get better gossip.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughed and rolled to his back. \u201cMembers rarely talk about their vanilla lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d She snuggled next to him and put her head on his shoulder. Her silky hair spilled over his arm and chest, tickling him.</p><p>Nice. And wasn\u2019t this a good position? He adjusted her breasts so one lay on his chest to fondle.</p><p>When she gave him an exasperated scowl, he gave her a warning look as his fingers traced over the lingering dents in her flesh. \u201cI like sex toys as much as you do, sweetling. The difference is that I consider you one of my toys, and I intend to play with you off and on all night.\u201d He remembered the well-handled movie cover and added, \u201cAs the Dread Pirate Roberts, I have a rep to maintain.\u201d</p><p>Even as she gave a choked laugh, her body softened against his in a submissive\u2019s instinctual surrender. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Rainie yawned and tried to force herself to wake, but her muscles had the consistency of overcooked spaghetti. Aching spaghetti. Her arms were sore, as were her thigh muscles. The skin on her breasts burned. When she moved, she realized her pussy was tender. Because... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because she\u2019d had awesome sex last night. Oh God. With Jake. Her heart gave a painful thump as she held herself totally still, letting the thrill roll over her.</p><p>He\u2019d let her sleep for a couple of hours. She\u2019d woken when he pushed Rhage out of the bedroom again.</p><p>Ignoring her halfhearted objections, Jake had tied the thin bed curtains around her ankles to hold her legs up in a high V split. After teasing her orally...forever...he\u2019d stopped right before she could come and taken her in his own version of missionary style.</p><p>With her thighs pulled out of the way, he went deeper than she was used to, and she was so primed, she\u2019d started coming with his first thrust.</p> <p>He\u2019d laughed, settled in, and hammered her into another orgasm before getting off himself.</p><p>When he\u2019d woken her again\u2014before five a.m., damn him\u2014she\u2019d hit him. Her lips curved. Not a good move with a Dom.</p><p>He\u2019d hauled her out of bed and onto her knees before she\u2019d had a chance to finish swearing at him\u2014let alone apologize.</p><p>Needless to say, he\u2019d made sure she gave him a hell of a blowjob with a ruthlessness that\u2019d make Dread Pirate Roberts proud.</p><p>But she\u2019d enjoyed it. The man was wonderfully endowed, thick and long, with potently heavy testicles. And he had a sexy sense of humor. When she\u2019d commented on his neatly trimmed manscaping, he\u2019d grinned and answered, \u201cIf I prefer pussies to be bare, seemed only fair to partly return the favor.\u201d</p> <p>After he\u2019d come, she\u2019d thought to go back to sleep. But nooo. The blowjob had been for refusing him. She\u2019d gotten a damned spanking for hitting him. Then he\u2019d used his hands and fingers and more toys until she was begging to be allowed to come. When he\u2019d finally let her climax...well, her neighbors probably thought someone had been murdered.</p><p>No wonder she was sore and positively, completely satiated.</p><p>A noise made her jump, and she rolled over to see Jake beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou getting up now? On a Sunday?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of dogs in the clinic didn\u2019t make it home on Friday.\u201d He\u2019d already pulled on his pants. His shirt hung open, displaying his tanned pecs and where his curly brown chest hair narrowed to a line down his flat abdomen.</p><p>Still wet from the shower, his hair was shoved carelessly back. Why did he seem even sexier when not all neat and tidy?</p> <p>\u201cAn attendant is there, but I need to check on them too,\u201d he finished.</p><p>She wiggled upright in the bed. He didn\u2019t sound upset that he had to get up early. Just matter-of-fact about his responsibilities. How long had she been around boys pretending to be men?</p><p>But even a decade ago, he\u2019d already been a man. He was also a Shadowlands Master\u2014the best of the best\u2014and the first requirement of a good Dom was to accept responsibility for himself and his actions. \u201cGot it. Do you have time for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>His hands stopped in the process of buckling his belt, and he said in unconcealed hope, \u201cYou\u2019d cook me breakfast?\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019d bet he\u2019d been an adorable child. \u201cSure. I like to cook.\u201d</p><p>Even knowing he had impeccable manners, she almost expected to hear a crack about her weight. But he said with open pleasure, \u201cWorks for me. I like to eat.\u201d</p><p>She slid out of bed and reached for her robe.</p><p>He slid it out of her reach. \u201cNope. You\u2019ll wear this.\u201d He pulled off his dress shirt and helped her into it.</p> <p>He was tall enough that the hem hung below her butt cheeks, but...her full breasts pushed the front open. \u201cI\u2019ll never get it buttoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it buttoned.\u201d He took advantage by circling his finger around her nipples \u201cI prefer these be accessible.\u201d</p><p>God, no matter how many times he\u2019d taken her, he could waken her lust anew with just the dark desire in his green eyes.</p><p>An hour later, Jake sat back from the table with a supremely satisfied groan. \u201cYou can sure cook. That was damn good.\u201d</p><p>She flushed but managed to respond with a calm, \u201cThank you.\u201d She\u2019d made him a customized spinach, cheddar, and sausage omelet\u2014and added hash browns to balance out the healthy green stuff. The meal would keep a hard-working veterinarian going for quite a while.</p><p>Thinking of veterinarians, wasn\u2019t it funny that Saxon, the veterinarian, loved furry play? Of course, she wouldn\u2019t gossip about him or his career, but...during the next puppy and kitty role-play, she\u2019d talk the submissives into coming down with a wealth of injuries. They\u2019d be limping, with broken tails and crumpled ears, and whining at the big blond Dom until he \u201chealed\u201d them.</p><p>Poor veterinarian. Would he be at the Shadowlands next weekend? \u201cI didn\u2019t notice Saxon at the club on Friday or even the week before. Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s fine.\u201d Jake\u2019s low growl was alarming. \u201cHe\u2019s been on vacation. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he done something wrong? Aren\u2019t you friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so concerned. I didn\u2019t murder him\u2014although it was close,\u201d Jake grumbled. \u201cYou saw our receptionist, right?\u201d</p><p>The blonde bimbo. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSax caved in to family pressure and gave her a job. She was\u2014bar none\u2014the most incompetent receptionist I\u2019ve ever seen. Unfortunately, before we caught on, she did a number on everything in the computer, including the schedule. I fired her Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Rainie felt a twinge of sympathy for the poor receptionist. Deserved or not, losing a job really hurt. She cleared her throat. \u201cSo, did Saxon yell at you for dismissing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beat him to it. I called and yelled at him yesterday and told him to haul his ass back by tomorrow. It\u2019ll take us both to clean up her mess.\u201d Tension tightened his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to assign a tech to answer the phone until we hire someone\u2014but we don\u2019t have time to interview because of the disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch-22, huh?\u201d Rainie hesitated. She needed to start making calls and get her butt into a new job, but...how could she not pitch in? A receptionist position wouldn\u2019t improve her resume, but certainly she could help the guys out for a little while. Until they found someone. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about animals but I\u2019m superb at answering phones. If you want, I can fill in until mid-February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Rhage needs his vet in good shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He extended his hand across the table.</p><p>She started to take it and then pulled back. Now she had a problem. Work versus sex. She didn\u2019t combine the two. Ever.</p><p>Her inner self cringed at the thought of speaking her mind. But...this was the Dom who\u2019d spanked her at the Shadowlands for not being honest. \u201cJake.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed before he took her hand in his callused one. \u201cTell me, sweetling.\u201d</p><p>Even with his encouragement, the words wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cI need a refill\u2014how about you?\u201d She picked up their cups and rose.</p><p>In the kitchen, she poured the coffee, seeing the blackness swirl in the bottom of the cup. Why couldn\u2019t she refuse Jake\u2014or other Doms? Her problem was due to more than being submissive.</p><p>With Miss Lily\u2019s help and the counseling she\u2019d required, Rainie had learned that the uncertainties in her childhood\u2014because of her mother and foster parents\u2014trained her to be a pleaser. By knowing the cause, she\u2019d managed to overcome the behavior.</p><p>But she\u2019d never discussed the ugly habits acquired during her year on the streets. There, if a girl didn\u2019t give a man what he wanted, she starved or got hurt. Confrontations led to slaps, punches, kicks...or worse. Rainie had suffered it all before Shiz had taken her in. And even with him...she\u2019d never said no. Giving in had been safer.</p><p>Well. Now that she recognized the reasons for her wimpy behavior, she\u2019d work through it. And she\u2019d not keep being a wimp either. She set Jake\u2019s coffee in front of him and met his patient gaze. \u201cI... I don\u2019t mess around with my bosses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it out. Good for you.\u201d His smile was filled with approval.</p><p>And she deserved it. A glow of self-satisfaction filled her.</p><p>\u201cMess around,\u201d he repeated. As the meaning registered, his smile turned rueful. \u201cHell. Well, hell.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair, messing it up even further. \u201cUnfortunately, I agree. I don\u2019t screw my staff.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Rainie sighed.</p><p>After a second, Jake rose. \u201cYou do realize though, I\u2019ve never worked with an employee I\u2019d previously fucked.\u201d Looking down at her, he ran his thumb over her kiss-swollen lips. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, sweetling...since I already want to take you again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>On Monday morning, Jake headed into the feline room.</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d His buddy and co-owner of the clinic grabbed his arm and spun him around. Saxon\u2019s blue eyes and shoulder-length pale hair almost glowed against the dark tan he\u2019d picked up on the Caribbean beaches. \u201cThat\u2019s Rainie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Rainie out there answering our phones.\u201d Saxon hadn\u2019t looked so shocked since a subbie doing puppy play had actually bit him. \u201cBro, you might be a Shadowlands Master, but you can\u2019t just draft the submissives no matter how much we need a receptionist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake laughed. \u201cJesus, Sax. If I tried conscripting the subs, Z would hand me, balls up, to Mistress Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie\u2019s between jobs and heard I fired Lynette. She volunteered to man the desk until the middle of February.\u201d</p><p>Saxon let out a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you, Deity of All Veterinarians.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can hope it works out. I didn\u2019t check for references. Hell, I don\u2019t even know what kind of job she had before.\u201d At Saxon\u2019s skeptical stare, Jake shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s an honest woman. If she says she can do something, I figure she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty trusting for you, bro.\u201d</p><p>True enough. However...Jake shot him a pointed look to remind him of who\u2019d hired Lynette.</p><p>\u201cRight. Shutting up here.\u201d</p><p>Not long before noon, a retriever pup was brought in, having tried to eat something sharp. After handing the case to Saxon, who loved surgery, Jake, who preferred his patients awake, took over the exams. Hairballs, cancer, ear abscesses, removing stitches. Helping and healing. He loved his job.</p> <p>If only running a vet clinic didn\u2019t involve running a business, he\u2019d be a happy man.</p><p>When he finally emerged from the exam rooms, Rainie sat behind the reception counter, looking as calm and collected as when she\u2019d first walked in. Although she\u2019d removed the jacket to her dark red suit, she was still too classy for the clinic.</p><p>He eyed her, trying to decipher what appeared different. Ah. Her tattoos were completely covered by her three-quarter-length sleeves. With her hair pulled back in a French braid, she was a poster child for professionalism.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Sheffield,\u201d she said, making him smile with her formality. \u201cWhen you\u2019re free, I have a list of calls for you to return.\u201d She gave him a notepad with several\u2014completely readable\u2014messages. \u201cNothing is urgent, and they\u2019re all willing to wait until you take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tech Ceecee said the kennel attendant schedule hadn\u2019t been done, so I took a stab at creating one. Kris gave me the pile of vacation requests from your desk and the usual hours each person works.\u201d She handed him a neatly labeled folder. \u201cI printed out a tentative schedule and put it in here with the requests. I think I satisfied them all, but you should check it over and okay it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could use you at my office. What are you doing working as a receptionist?\u201d a new client holding a cat carrier asked from the waiting area.</p><p>Rainie smiled. \u201cJust helping Dr. Sheffield out temporarily.\u201d</p><p>With her terrier perched politely beside her on the bench, Mrs. Pritchert peered over her reading glasses. \u201cYou lucked out with this one, Doc. That snippy receptionist last week wasn\u2019t worth the ink on her paycheck.\u201d</p><p>He found no discreet answer available, so he nodded his response, then studied the papers in his hand. \u201cExcellent work, Rainie.\u201d</p><p>At his pleased smile, pink bloomed in her cheeks. Submissive. And delightful.</p><p>Obviously flustered, she rose to greet Mrs. Flanders, who\u2019d brought in her grumpy Doberman. Even the techs were careful when dealing with the ancient canine.</p><p>But when the old woman dropped her checkbook, Rainie hurried around the counter to pick it up. She remained crouched and held out her hand. \u201cGood grief, you\u2019re a big guy. You\u2019d probably eat my little dog for breakfast and still want more.\u201d</p><p>Prince Albert\u2019s ears pricked forward. After sniffing her palm, he gave a butt-wiggle of approval. Know how you feel, old man. Rainie was soft, caring, and a real heart-tugger.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is Rhage, by the way?\u201d Jake asked, hoping she hadn\u2019t left the animal at home. A bored pup could rip an apartment to pieces.</p><p>\u201cUnder my desk. Kris was a sweetheart and took him outside when she walked the other dogs.\u201d Rainie grinned. \u201cShe wore him out so thoroughly he\u2019s been sleeping since.\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced over and saw the dog sprawled in a hand-fashioned bed. \u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking your lunch now?\u201d Rainie asked.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cHardly. Lynette never bothered to schedule breaks or lunches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She scowled. \u201cThat surly, sway-backed strumpet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She waved an airy hand. \u201cI\u2019m practicing pirate curses.\u201d</p><p>At the thought of her sumptuous curves beneath him while she cursed him like a fishwife, Jake laughed. And his body hardened.</p><p>She didn\u2019t notice, but with her beautiful mouth set into a determined line, she stared at her monitor. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get time for lunch tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He barely managed to refrain from stroking her hair. Instead, he took the folder she\u2019d given him and headed into his office.</p><p>Saxon would be praying to his Deity of All Veterinarians to keep this woman.</p><p>Jake might set up an altar himself.</p><p>The sun was rising when Rainie unlocked the clinic by herself two days later. Good thing Jake had given her a key since a client had arranged to arrive early to drop off her puppies to be vaccinated. Ginger hadn\u2019t wanted to be late to work.</p><p>Having experienced the joy that was Cory, Rainie understood all too well.</p><p>\u201cHey, come on in,\u201d Rainie said. With Rhage tucked under her arm, she held the door open for Ginger to edge past with her big box.</p><p>Rhage\u2019s ears pricked up at the squeaking noises.</p><p>\u201cYou can put them behind the counter,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cAs soon as one of the kennel staff is free, she\u2019ll get them settled in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate you taking them early.\u201d Ginger set the box down and lifted up one of the puppies. \u201cY\u2019all be good for Rainie, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re adorable.\u201d When Rainie made an involuntary movement, Ginger put the tiny squirming ball of fur in her hand.</p><p>Plush and soft. Rainie held the baby up to her face, and a teeny tongue touched her chin.</p><p>Ginger grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine they\u2019ll grow to seventy pounds or so.\u201d She rubbed the little perked-up triangular ears. \u201cShepherds make such cute puppies.\u201d</p><p>Rainie sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about animals, but so far, I haven\u2019t met an ugly puppy.\u201d And she\u2019d managed to hold most of them. It was a weakness.</p><p>Rhage planted his paws on her knees, stretching up for a sniff.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my hero dog,\u201d she told him, tucking the puppy back into the box. \u201cYou own my heart.\u201d Although the puppies had stolen a piece or two.</p><p>Ginger glanced at her watch. \u201cI\u2019m gone. I\u2019ll see you at lunch to get my batch of fuzzy-butts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be ready for you.\u201d</p><p>In the wonderfully quiet office, Rainie worked steadily for an hour until the staff showed up, followed by the first appointments. As time passed, the waiting room filled.</p><p>Jake and Saxon were keeping up fairly well. It helped that the technicians handled the shots and initial exams. The clinic hadn\u2019t yet achieved the super-smooth functioning that was Rainie\u2019s goal, but the work was totally fun.</p><p>And then it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>A man entered with a slender black dog. \u201cRainie, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Her heart leaped at the familiar tenor\u2014and crashed. She wiped away her expression. \u201cGeoffrey, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Her ex-fianc\u00e9 looked...good. His lightly tanned face showed off his clear blue eyes and a new trim mustache.</p><p>\u201cAre you working here?\u201d he asked. His white shirt was stiff and bright, his silk tie perfect for the silver-gray pinstripe suit. Beautifully tailored, as always.</p><p>Not her. She grew keenly aware of the bloody splotch on her sleeve, and the stain from where Rhage had put his paws on her skirt. At least her legs were under the counter; a fleeing kitten had climbed her like a tree and snagged her hose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working here temporarily.\u201d Submerging herself in the safety of business, she opened the schedule. \u201cAh, I see there\u2019s a miniature Doberman scheduled for a routine physical and shots. He belongs to Kailie Hollingsworth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sheepishly. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>Married. Her mind went blank.</p><p>\u201cGeoff, good to see you.\u201d Jake walked out of his office. The two men shook hands with the brotherly buffet on the shoulder that meant an extra dollop of friendship.</p><p>\u201cDoing great. I don\u2019t know if you heard. Kailie is pregnant.\u201d Geoffrey\u2019s chest pumped up as if he\u2019d invented procreation all by himself.</p><p>The first kick in the teeth hadn\u2019t even dissipated before the pain of the second hit Rainie. Pregnant? What happened to not wanting children for years, maybe not at all?</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Jake grinned. \u201cThat would be why you\u2019re stuck dealing with Kailie\u2019s demon Doberman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be why. Kailie can\u2019t manage more in the mornings than looking green. At least, she has a ton of international clients and later in the day works well for contacting them.\u201d Geoffrey handed Jake the leash and nodded to Rainie. \u201cIt was good to run into you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Rainie managed past the blockage in her throat.</p><p>Jake turned a speculative gaze on her and Geoffrey. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Geoffrey smiled. \u201cI think you were in Afghanistan when we were engaged.\u201d He lifted a hand and strode out.</p><p>She stared after him and then remembered Jake.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, he was studying her.</p><p>Her defensiveness flared. Swiveling her chair around, she faced the computer monitor. \u201cThe dog is on your schedule. I\u2019ll check him in.\u201d</p> <p>He walked behind the counter and planted a hip on the desktop. Did the man have no concept of personal space?</p><p>\u201cEngaged? So...how long did you and Geoff date?\u201d His voice remained quiet enough that the clients in the waiting room wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>She gave an indifferent shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014six months and twelve days\u2014\u201dhalf a year, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a while. What happened to break you up?\u201d</p><p>The surge of hurt made her eyes prickle. \u201cThat\u2019s not your business.\u201d She raised her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re my boss, not my Dom.\u201d</p> <p>His intent gaze held the warmth of the sun. \u201cI\u2019m both. Seems like Geoff\u2019s into inertia, so I\u2019d say if he stayed with you that long, something else derailed him. What happened, Rainie?\u201d</p><p>The determined set of his mouth said he\u2019d sit on her desk until she answered him\u2014she\u2019d seen the same determination when he\u2019d pulled a massive St. Bernard out of a room. The dog\u2019s tail had whipped up under its belly as it had given in to the superior force that was Master Jake.</p><p>She gave in, too. \u201cHis family happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jake\u2019s smile flickered ruefully. \u201cStatus conscious. Appearance conscious. Shallow as a Disney cartoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His assessment was dead on. He didn\u2019t sound impressed with Geoffrey\u2019s family, as if they weren\u2019t worthy of his regard. She cleared her throat. With his family, Geoffrey\u2019d been ashamed of knowing Rainie, acting like a cat trying to cover his waste. \u201cOur relationship ended the day I met them.\u201d</p><p>She stared at her keyboard and willed Jake to leave.</p> <p>His callused hand settled on her wrist, the warmth calming. \u201cI see your hurt, baby. Still...knowing you both, I\u2019d say you can find a better fit.\u201d</p><p>Right. Too bad for her that she wanted a gentleman Dom. The chances were slim that she\u2019d find a gentleman who wouldn\u2019t mind that his woman was raised in the slums, in foster homes, and on the streets. Bitterness tasted foul on her tongue.</p><p>She shut her thoughts down and brought up the next bill on her computer. \u201cI\u2019m busy, Dr. Sheffield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jake\u2019s light touch on her hair felt like a caress. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just pencil that little talk into the appointments.\u201d Not a problem. There should be an hour or two free on the day after the apocalypse. What year would that be?</p><p>On Thursday, Rainie emerged from the dressing room in the bridal store, happily re-attired in jeans, sandals, and a peasant blouse. \u201cNo more bridesmaid dress fittings. Yay!\u201d She danced across the floor to Gabi and Kim, who waited by the wall of mirrors.</p><p>Her two friends laughed.</p><p>\u201cGabi, thank you\u2014and Sally\u2014for picking a gown that\u2019s gorgeous on me.\u201d The clinging halter top and flowing skirt had totally made the most of her assets. \u201cMade me feel like Cinderella at the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Gabi beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel in my wedding dress. And we loved finding the perfect style for each of you. You should have seen the over-frilled frumpy rag I got stuck wearing in college.\u201d Gagging sounds ensued. \u201cThank God for the same-color, different-styles trend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my dress\u2014and the deep blue color too.\u201d Kim patted Gabi\u2019s hand. Her bridesmaid gown would be a skin-tight sheath which displayed her perfect figure.</p><p>As Rainie took a chair near her friends, Kim asked Gabi, \u201cBy the way, did Master Z mandate a theme for this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t check since\u201d\u2014Gabi scowled\u2014\u201dmy beloved has said no Shadowlands this week. Marcus wants a little \u2018anticipation\u2019 for the honeymoon which means, starting Saturday, no sex either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Kim snickered. \u201cHe\u2019ll be so horny, he\u2019ll drag you out of the reception after one dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be the one dragging,\u201d Gabi said grumpily.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Rainie? Do you know the theme?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cI\u2019m in a dress-up mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t check either. I\u2019m taking a hiatus from the club.\u201d When the other two stared at her, she moved her shoulders. \u201cJake and Saxon are my bosses at the clinic. Interacting with them at the Shadowlands would be...too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, I get how you might feel awkward.\u201d Gabi tilted her head. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I come!\u201d With the laughing announcement, Andrea popped out of a dressing room and strode toward the mirrors, the seamstress scurrying behind her like a mouse after a big cat. \u201cWell? What do you think?\u201d Her strapless gown exposed her beautiful muscular shoulders and golden tan.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Kim clapped her hands. \u201cYou look fantastic. Like the Amazon Cullen is always calling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder Woman,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cGirl, you\u2019ve totally got to wear golden bracelets\u2014you know, the bulletproof ones.\u201d</p><p>Gabi waggled her eyebrows. \u201cJust be careful about wearing a Lasso of Truth. Cullen\u2019s liable to use it on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe-he wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d Andrea\u2019s golden-brown eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Gabi jumped to her feet and wrapped her arms around the taller woman. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, girlfriend? Has he been mean to you?\u201d</p><p>Cullen mean? Rainie knit her brow. Strict, maybe, but the giant Dom didn\u2019t have a cruel bone in his body.</p><p>Andrea shook her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s...\u201d Her breath hitched in a sob. The little seamstress bobbed in to hand her a handful of tissues, and Andrea wiped her face. \u201cI\u2019m being an idiot. It\u2019s just\u201d\u2014she peered at the wedding dress displays\u2014\u201dI want to get married. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, finally,\u201d Kim said, smiling.</p><p>Rainie understood the lure of a wedding and having someone to spend a lifetime with, to trust and hold. \u201cBut, why the tears? Mast\u2014um, Cullen has been proposing to you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stopped.\u201d Andrea\u2019s eyes filled again. \u201cHe gave up on me. Or maybe he changed his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat chance,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe adores you.\u201d</p><p>Gabi took a tissue and patted the tears from Andrea\u2019s cheeks. \u201cHe really does. He\u2019ll ask again.\u201d Her mouth set in a stern line. \u201cYou\u2019d better say \u2018yes\u2019 next time, or I\u2019ll wallop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, threat,\u201d Rainie cooed. \u201cI\u2019m getting all excited. Where\u2019s my flogger?\u201d</p><p>The seamstress\u2019s mouth dropped open, and she backpedaled. \u201cI think everything fits fine. Bring the dress upfront when you\u2019re done.\u201d Face a bright pink, she scurried toward the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d Rainie whispered, sending the others into giggles.</p><p>When Andrea disappeared to change, Gabi dropped into a chair with a sigh and scrubbed her hands over her face.</p><p>Rainie exchanged glances with Kim and said, \u201cGabi, Andrea will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Kim added, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about you. Is something wrong? Are your parents causing trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gabi grimaced. \u201cNot really...aside from constantly adding more guests and demanding fancier food. But since they\u2019re not paying for the reception, they lack any leverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...?\u201d Rainie prompted.</p><p>Gabi scowled. \u201cThey\u2019re unhappy about the \u2018double\u2019 wedding and about a m\u00e9nage being included, so they\u2019re really cold to Sally. And worse, Galen\u2019s mom is just plain nasty and constantly criticizing Sally. \u201c</p><p>Kim winced. \u201cSally\u2019s pretty vulnerable to parental disapproval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Gabi slumped in the chair. \u201cNo one is openly rude. Sally\u2014and I\u2014could fight that\u2014or the guys would. But Galen and Vance are out of town, and Sally won\u2019t rock Galen\u2019s relationship with his mother, so she hasn\u2019t told her guys anything. And, dammit, I figure it\u2019s her decision to make. Only I\u2019m so frustrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree since\u2014\u201d Rainie bit back the words. How would she react if someone interfered in her relationship with a lover? \u201cNo, I\u2019m wrong. It\u2019s not your choice. But ugh, just imagine\u2014Sally\u2019ll have to celebrate holidays with that woman.\u201d Galen\u2019s mother was the coldest person Rainie\u2019d ever met. One glare from her and mice would flee a cozy heated building in the dead of winter.</p><p>Kim nodded glumly. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to shield Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as we can.\u201d Gabi scowled. \u201cJust because Sally wasn\u2019t born to some rich East Coast family, Mrs. Kouros thinks she\u2019s not good enough for Galen.\u201d</p><p>Rainie\u2019s anger at the unfairness was slowly undermined by her dismay...and depression. Sally\u2019s handicap was merely from growing up on a small Iowa farm. What if Mrs. Kouros faced a slum-raised daughter-in-law like Rainie? The woman would go off the rails entirely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rainie thought of her wonderful night with Jake and how he seemed to enjoy having her in the clinic. He never treated her as something...less. Then again, he was a special sort of man. Maybe his years in the military had changed his perception of what was important.</p><p>However, if Jake\u2019s family thought their precious son might date a woman like Rainie, they\u2019d undoubtedly react just as cruelly as Mrs. Kouros.</p><p>Rainie\u2019s chest constricted as her resolve deepened. Once her time at the clinic ended, she\u2019d hunt for a job far away, maybe in the Northeast. When she eventually found someone to love, her manners and attire would be perfect\u2014just as Miss Lily had advocated\u2014and her past would be left far, far behind.</p><p>And she\u2019d never return to Florida.</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>With Mrs. Morelli\u2019s miniature poodle cuddled in one arm, Rainie stood in front of Jake\u2019s pale yellow, two-story house and pressed the doorbell.</p><p>No one answered. As she breathed in the moist green scent of freshly cut grass, she listened.</p><p>No footsteps. The \u201chorse country\u201d was so quiet, she could hear the rumble of cars on a distant highway. The birds cheeping in the trees. And the thumping of Rhage\u2019s tail.</p><p>Hoping Jake would unload some of his grief, Rainie had tied Rhage on the shaded porch. He sat on his own special blanky, watching her closely. After being abandoned once, he wouldn\u2019t trust easily again.</p> <p>She knew how he felt.</p><p>At the low whine of the dog she carried, she sighed. When Saxon had asked her to deliver Guido, he\u2019d said Jake planned to spend his Saturday off at home. A truck sat in the driveway, so Jake was here.</p><p>But everyone at the clinic knew he didn\u2019t always carry his phone.</p><p>She turned in a circle. Tightly woven fencing enclosed the house\u2019s acreage. In the long expanses of green, colorful patches heralded the gardenias and azalea bushes beneath the oaks. But no Jake.</p><p>Maybe behind the house? Didn\u2019t he have a pool? Since no fence separated the front from the back, Rainie walked around the side of the house. Maybe she\u2019d get lucky and find him sunbathing in the nude.</p><p>The poor excuse for a joke didn\u2019t lighten her mood. She was sad and even unhappier she\u2019d have to break the bad news to Jake.</p> <p>Behind the house, a screen-caged octagonal pool sparkled in the sunlight. Bright red-and-white striped deck chairs were scattered around the patio. Under the shade of the overhang, Jake slept on a lounge chair. He wasn\u2019t naked, unfortunately, although the bare chest was a good start.</p><p>Rainie opened the patio\u2019s screen door, deliberately making enough noise to waken him. Smart people didn\u2019t sneak up on war zone veterans.</p><p>He was on his feet before she had the door closed. \u201cRainie,\u201d he said slowly. Absently, he rubbed the sexy dark stubble on his jaw. His day off meant he hadn\u2019t trimmed his beard. He looked...rough. Dangerous.</p><p>Tempting.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her momentary lust disappeared as she recalled her reason for the visit. God, how could she tell him? Her heart ached as she searched for words that wouldn\u2019t hurt him. There were none. Mrs. Morelli passed on last night.</p><p>Jake\u2019s brows drew together as he studied her face. His gaze dropped to the dog. When his jaw hardened enough to draw the skin taut, she knew he\u2019d recognized Guido and why she\u2019d come.</p><p>Grief filled his eyes for a moment before his expression smoothed out. He walked over and took the dog from her arms. \u201cThank you for bringing him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jake.\u201d She\u2019d only met the tiny elderly woman once, but her sweetness had drawn Rainie in.</p><p>One of Jake and Saxon\u2019s first clients, Mrs. Morelli had requested they care for Guido if anything happened to her. Like Miss Lily, she\u2019d viewed her mortality with equanimity.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you making the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have things to do, and I should get Guido settled in.\u201d He walked away.</p><p>She stared at his back, surprised. Had she ever seen him so brusque? Only, he wasn\u2019t deliberately being rude. His normally smooth voice was almost harsh\u2014as if forced through a tight throat. He made her want to cry for him...because he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Jake stalked into his house, knowing he\u2019d been discourteous, wanting to apologize, but not trusting his voice.</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for this. At the hospital last night, Violetta\u2019s doctor said she had a good chance of recovering. Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cTake care of my Guido, Jake,\u201d she\u2019d asked him. Her only concern had been for her dog. God, Violetta. His chest hurt\u2014ached like a fresh stab wound.</p><p>At an unhappy whine, he cuddled the shivering dog closer. Yes, they both knew the world was a sadder place today.</p><p>Lonelier, as well. His footsteps echoed in the tile-floored room, emphasizing the emptiness. \u201cHadn\u2019t planned on having a dog, buddy,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019d better get along with cats, or we\u2019re going to have problems.\u201d</p><p>His two cats had hidden under his bed, but once they saw the intruder was a small canine\u2014rather than a human\u2014they\u2019d be out and ready for war.</p><p>Speaking of problems... \u201cI bet Rainie didn\u2019t give you a chance to piss, did she?\u201d After detouring to the kitchen for a leash, he took the dog out the front door and stopped.</p><p>An ancient Civic sat in his driveway, and Rhage lay curled on a blanket on the porch. Rainie hadn\u2019t left? Jake stopped to pet Rhage, then walked Guido around the side of the house, retracing Rainie\u2019s path to the pool.</p><p>And there she sat with her back to him, in his lounge chair. She was watching the back door, probably hoping he\u2019d settle before she knocked.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She jumped a good foot\u2014and had a fucking cute scream. Turning, she gave him a glare. \u201cYou sadist, you almost gave me a heart attack.\u201d She patted her chest, making her breasts jiggle in a way he had to appreciate.</p><p>For a full minute, he forgot his grief. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you,\u201d she said as he and Guido entered the screened area.</p><p>Once unleashed, Guido ran over to give her an enthusiastic greeting.</p><p>\u201cYou act like you haven\u2019t seen me for a month,\u201d she muttered, pulling the wiggling dog onto her lap.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nervous,\u201d Jake said. \u201cHe knows something is wrong, and his person isn\u2019t here to fix it.\u201d Would never be here.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She snuggled Guido closer, murmuring, \u201cIt\u2019ll get better, honey.\u201d</p><p>Longing whispered through Jake. Lucky little pup to be the recipient of her affections and soothing caresses. \u201cI notice you didn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObservant that way, are you?\u201d She set the dog down and held out her hand, expecting Jake to help her to her feet.</p><p>Manipulative little brat. He pulled her up and smiled at the logo on her pink button-up shirt: Audit Me \u2013 Audit Me Now! \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, actually.\u201d She slid her arms around him. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone so in need of a good hug, and I stayed to give you one.\u201d</p><p>He froze, almost hearing Gunny\u2019s snort of disgust, hearing him lecture: \u201cPussy Doms need comforting. Real men don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to care for the submissive. To take what you want. Not to lean on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand on your own fucking feet.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t leaning...exactly. With a sigh, Jake drew the sweet submissive closer and let her tenderness ease the chill in his heart. Something fuzzy settled onto his bare foot.</p><p>He pulled back far enough to see Guido lying beside Rainie with his muzzle on Jake\u2019s foot.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a dog\u2019s version of a group hug. Or maybe he\u2019s hungry,\u201d Rainie said. She smiled up at him, innocence filling her face. \u201cMe, too. Are you cooking me supper, then?\u201d</p><p>He stared. She wasn\u2019t asking him if he wanted company, but just...pushing...herself into his evening. And fuck, he didn\u2019t want to be alone, especially not with a little dog who would constantly remind him of his loss. \u201cAh...how do you feel about grilled steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarmly. I could feel quite warmly toward a good steak dinner.\u201d She bent to pat Guido. \u201cLet me get Rhage, and I\u2019ll even help cook.\u201d</p><p>Several hours later, Rainie watched as Jake rose to put the DVD away.</p><p>He\u2019d tossed the back cushions of his toast-colored sectional onto the floor, leaving the wide bottom cushion for them to lie on side-by-side. It had been a comfortable way to enjoy television, but the evening had reached an end. She\u2019d better head home.</p><p>With a sigh, she sat up and swung her legs to the floor.</p><p>Before she could stand, he rejoined her on the couch. \u201cWhat did you think of the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGalaxy Quest isn\u2019t bad,\u201d she said, judiciously. \u201cGood choice.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cConsidering you had to have a funny movie with a romance and a happy ending, I\u2019d say I did an excellent job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I gave you lots of alternatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetling, I have balls. I\u2019m not allowed to watch movies with names like Runaway Bride or 27 Dresses. At least, not in the first month of screwing around.\u201d His dark green eyes caught hers, held them, as he drew his finger across her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re not permitted a \u2018cute\u2019 romance at all...unless it\u2019s horror, sci-fi, or has really explicit sex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get much X-rated sex in comedies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just sad.\u201d Still holding her gaze, he turned his hand over, trailing the backs of his fingers down her neck. When his hand closed, he had her hair in an unbreakable grip. He tugged, forcing her head to tilt back.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move away as he took her mouth, penetrating with his tongue, exploring... Her mind spun under the onslaught as he moved closer.</p><p>She stiffened as he started to push her back\u2014and he paused. Letting her decide. She shivered as she remembered sex at her apartment and how he\u2019d made her verbalize her desire for him to stay. And how, after that point, she wasn\u2019t allowed to decide anything.</p><p>She wanted him tonight. So, so much.</p><p>No. She should leave.</p><p>\u201cJake, I didn\u2019t come here to mess around.\u201d Yet, what would it hurt? He was so sad; he needed her. And she wanted him. She\u2019d lusted after him from the first moment, and the more she got to know him, the more she wanted him.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d been afraid to find his home decorated in a snobbish-sophisticated style. Instead the landscaping was sweetly rural, the house older and decorated for comfort in creams and browns, with tall windows and ceiling fans in every room.</p><p>In the living room, a geometric design rug, thick enough to screw around on, covered the lime-washed oak flooring. A leather-topped coffee table practically begged for bare feet. The long sectional faced the usual hi-tech guy electronics, like the television that took up most of the wall. Another wall was all windows, framed by fan palms, and overlooking the rolling fields. The low bookcase against the third wall held military history and thrillers. She felt at home in his house.</p><p>And she could stay tonight. She could. She\u2019d be leaving Florida soon. Having sex with the boss wouldn\u2019t affect her job; she\u2019d be gone within a month.</p><p>As her resistance eroded, he knew; he pushed her back and followed her down. His lips were firm, knowing, yet soft enough to lure. His weight pushed her deeper into the cushions, and the anxious thrill of being overpowered increased when he set her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cJake. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d As he pinned her wrists with one powerful hand, she instinctively struggled and found herself helpless. The melting sensation in her depths said her body wanted that loss of control\u2014no matter what her mind tried to tell her.</p><p>His hip rubbed hers as he sat up. For a moment, he studied her, and his lips curved upward. \u201cGood,\u201d he murmured in his smoky smooth voice. \u201cWe agree. Tying you down is an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWe? I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot verbally. But you have a very talkative body, sweetling.\u201d He reached past the arm of the couch and pulled something up\u2014two Velcro cuffs attached to a thick rope. Swiftly, he slipped one cuff around her right wrist, yanked the Velcro tight, and did the same to the other. She had no chance to escape before he\u2019d restrained her arms.</p><p>She glared at him, trying to ignore the internal flutter at how easily he\u2019d immobilized her. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafeword\u2019s red, buttercup. Anything else is agreement.\u201d His eyes laughed at her as he adjusted the cuffs to a more comfortable snugness.</p><p>Sitting back, he considered her. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit overdressed.\u201d His voice came close to a purr. \u201cLet me fix that for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d removed her sandals earlier. Now he yanked off her shorts, started to take off her thong, and paused at the picture of a four-leaf clover\u2014directly over her clit\u2014with green letters stating, RUB FOR LUCK.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Grinning, he pulled her legs apart and followed the instructions. His scraping strokes over the fabric grazed her clit, making it burn, making it swell. God, the man knew how to touch a woman.</p><p>He stopped long enough to yank off her thong, then ran his finger over her bare pussy. \u201cI do like the way you keep yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks?\u201d Yet his enjoyment made it worth the time doing Hazel\u2019s accounts in exchange for a waxing...and the Jesus-Help-Me agony of having the wax ripped off.</p> <p>One by one, Jake undid her buttons, and the anticipation grew within her. When he opened her front-hooked bra, her breasts spilled out.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d he murmured and the compliment put a happy beat in her heart. Cupping his hands on the sides, he pushed her breasts together so he could lick her nipples. His mouth was hot, his tongue wet, slick, yet slightly scratchy.</p><p>Her breathing changed to short little pants as he played, and she shivered when he rubbed his bristly chin over the damp areolas. Her back arched, pushing her breasts toward him. God, she wanted more. Wanted him. Wanted\u2014</p><p>\u201cLike being scratched, eh? Let\u2019s do more of that.\u201d Smiling slightly, he lifted the hinged top of his coffee table.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the wealth of BDSM equipment. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy restrict myself to a one-room dungeon\u2014I prefer to use the entire house.\u201d He opened a small, carved box and fitted stainless steel claws over the fingertips of his right hand. Like a cat\u2019s, each curved downward, narrowing to needle thinness.</p><p>A jolt of fear slid through her, and she tugged at the restraints. No give.</p><p>He lifted his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The word burst from her. \u201cI don\u2019t like needles.\u201d</p><p>With his unencumbered left hand, he captured her chin. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t pull her gaze from the sharp glittering claws. Her hands clenched.</p><p>\u201cLook. At. Me.\u201d The subterranean note in his order tugged on something deep inside her.</p><p>Her eyes lifted. Met his. Read the control in his steady green gaze. Jake\u2014this is Jake. The breath blockaded in her lungs sighed out.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Laughter tipped his lips. \u201cHowever, be aware that I consider \u2018no\u2019 to be a delightful addition to an evening. A safeword will work. No turns me on.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Why did his pleasure in screwing with her limits make her hotter? She made a frustrated\u2014worried\u2014sound.</p><p>A crease appeared in his cheek. Turning his needle-tipped hand over, he skimmed over her hard-peaked nipples with only his bare knuckles. Not the claws.</p><p>Her hands relaxed.</p><p>His grip tightened on her chin, holding her face for his perusal. And then he drew the claws lightly from her right shoulder all the way to her wrist.</p><p>No pain. Just a long tickling array of scratches. Her skin tingled afterward.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Rainie,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She exhaled and sucked in air.</p><p>His laugh was sexily husky. His left hand stayed curved around her jaw, trapping her while he raked his clawed fingers along her stomach. He pressed sharply enough to not tickle, hard enough to remind her of the sharpness of the points.</p><p>Down they swept...toward her mound.</p><p>Every muscle in her body tensed. She started to draw her thighs together to protect the very, very exposed tissues.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, subbie.\u201d His order held a growl that kept her legs in place.</p><p>The claws moved upward, then wandered to and fro over her torso. Below her breasts. Across her stomach. Above her mound. He made slow circles, small circles, wide circles.</p><p>The skin of her stomach grew more and more sensitive, then as if he\u2019d turned a rheostat, her entire body became intensely aware of everything\u2014the strength of his hand on her face, the scrape of his jeans against her hip, the cool air touching her damp pussy.</p><p>He ran the claws over the top of her breasts and paused, hovering over her left breast with the claws spread in a circle.</p><p>She squeaked in protest. Not there. No.</p><p>As he drew his fingers together, the needle tips scraped toward her nipple, panic-inducingly dangerous yet terrifyingly erotic. She was aroused, so, so aroused, panting for air and somehow frozen in place.</p><p>His gaze traveled from her face, her shoulders, her hands, and back to his claws. One tiny needle dragged over her nipple with enough sting to send a sizzle through her. To have her pussy throbbing with need.</p><p>Jake smiled as the slow application of sensual pain drew Rainie closer and closer to an orgasm.</p><p>He picked up his hand and started to set the claws on her other breast. But no. He wanted more. Wanted to see her climax with a need that was probably equal to her own. She came more beautifully than any woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Turning sideways, he touched her mound with one bare finger. Her breathing went staccato for a moment. Unhurriedly, he fondled her pussy, enjoying the naked smoothness of her plump outer labia. Her darkly red inner folds were carnally slick. Ready for him. But he could wait...a while.</p><p>\u201cI think you need a little more to occupy you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to get bored.\u201d</p><p>Her tiny snort held both laughter and exasperation...and a hint of worry.</p><p>With his free hand, he took a rabbit vibrator from the toy box, choosing a size slightly smaller than his own cock, so he could enjoy filling her when he took her.</p><p>Her eyes widened, but a warning look kept her from speaking.</p><p>He wet the vibrator in her juices and slid it up into her cunt. She was puffy enough the vibrator stretched her, and she inhaled sharply. Perfect. With the rabbit in deep, the small vibrating ears barely brushed her clit. With a few clicks of the controls, he set it to a wavelike rhythm, from slow to fast.</p><p>She made a gloriously helpless noise. Her hips lifted. Wiggled. The color in her face increased, her lips such an inviting red that he took himself another probing kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His dick throbbed its own demand, but he wasn\u2019t through playing with her. He sat up and simply enjoyed the sight before him. What was there about having a submissive tied on his couch, open to his use? And when the submissive was Rainie? All soft and round, color high, quivering with arousal and anxiety. Sheer fucking loveliness.</p><p>So. She was filled with the dildo, clit teased by rabbit ears. Time to top off the array of sensations with something sharp.</p><p>Lowering his voice to a warning growl, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t move, sweetling. I don\u2019t want to hurt you...too much.\u201d</p><p>A shiver shook her brutally enough her breasts quivered.</p><p>Still sitting beside her, he laid his claw-tipped hand on her left breast, letting her feel the pinpricks of pain.</p><p>Her moan of protest made him harder than a rock.</p><p>Using a pulling motion, he dragged the claws down Rainie\u2019s breast until the points converged on her pointed, dusky nipple. Her poor areola tried to bunch tighter. To add to the fun, he rolled her other nipple between his unadorned thumb and fingers.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. Against his hip, the muscles in her thigh grew rigid with her approaching climax.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered back and stroked her breast with the claws again. \u201cDo stay nice and still when you come, baby, or these might draw blood.\u201d The skin on her breasts was delicate, her nipples even more so.</p><p>She gave a muted whine of protest and tugged at the restraints. Her hands clenched as she tried to exert control over her impending orgasm.</p><p>\u201cPoor subbie,\u201d he murmured. Each breath brought him the scent of her arousal, and the insides of her thighs glistened. He reached down and reset the rabbit\u2019s rhythm to a quicker build-up with a pause before starting over again.</p><p>As she shuddered with the fresh onslaught of vibrations, he gave her two more strokes of the claws. Then he switched to her other breast, leisurely drawing the points to the pink tip. There he paused to dig in the sharp claws slightly.</p><p>Sweat broke out on her upper lip. Her thighs trembled as fear of being cut warred with her unstoppable orgasm. Her breathing held a delightful moan with every breath.</p><p>There was a sheer glory in driving her to this point\u2014to where she was submerged in sensation alone, to where she was focused only on what he gave her, hearing only his voice... Keeping her nipple trapped in sharpness, he laid his free hand on her mound, scissoring his fingers on each side of her clit so he could lift it right against the rabbit ears\u2019 vibrations. \u201cCome for me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>With a low wail, she climaxed, still struggling to hold still. The effort would internalize the spasms so her orgasm would last\u2014at least to her\u2014forever.</p><p>As her muscles went limp, her skin glowed with the light sweat covering her body.</p><p>Gorgeous.</p><p>He dropped the claws onto the end table so she could clean them later and fully appreciate their sharpness...before the next time when he\u2019d use them on her pussy.</p><p>Rainie felt...satiated, as if every nerve in her body had imbibed chocolate cake. With thick frosting. And sprinkles. She was drowning in after-sex repletion.</p><p>Yet, when her eyes opened to Jake\u2019s heated, assessing gaze, she was ready to go again. And again. As long as he wanted her, she wanted him.</p><p>Even more, she needed him to get his own satisfaction\u2014needed to give that to him. To make him happy.</p><p>Because he was Jake. Amazing, incredible, impossible. From his absolute control and ability to read her, his perfect technique, his harder than rock body, to his intoxicating scent of light pine and musk\u2014the man totally turned her on.</p><p>But she could have controlled that. Unfortunately, there was more to him. The outgoing personality and easy sense of humor that disguised a consummate Master. His affection for people and animals. His sense of honor. And...his kindness. Yesterday she\u2019d found a note. Jake had ordered that an impoverished senior wasn\u2019t to be billed for anything more than medications. The incredible knowledge of all that was Jake washed over her in a downpour of desire.</p> <p>She looked up and realized he was considering her thoughtfully. A shiver ran up her spine. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. Jake\u2019s smile could never be cruel, but ruthless...definitely ruthless. \u201cI\u2019m deciding what position I want you in when I bury my cock in that soft pussy of yours.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Her core clenched. Still...no need to let him have everything his own way. He\u2019d put the claws down; her courage was returning. \u201cWell, Sir, feel free to tell me if and when you ever decide.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and tapped the small logo on her shirt, Audit Me \u2013 Audit me Now!</p><p>\u201cYou gave me the idea, subbie\u2014seems as if you must be due for an internal audit.\u201d</p><p>Imagining the...tool...he\u2019d use to perform the audit, she shivered, then made a loud huff. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that my ledgers are well balanced.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her breasts and ran his thumbs over her exquisitely sensitive, abused nipples. \u201cOh, baby, I agree. You definitely have some fine assets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, you can play with my assets any time.\u201d</p><p>With a grin, he whispered, \u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>His kiss was gentle...at first...then his tongue plunged inside, and he simply...took. Possessed. Plundered.</p><p>When he stopped, he gave her a quick smile and opened the Velcro wrist cuffs. He removed the rabbit vibe, and her insides clenched around the emptiness.</p><p>\u201cNew position, babe.\u201d</p><p>Her head spun as he helped her sit up. The floor chilled her bare toes, and she looked around, feeling as if she\u2019d traveled to an exotic land for the last hour.</p><p>He patted the wide bottom cushion. \u201cKneel here and hang on to the back of the couch.\u201d</p><p>As she turned and maneuvered herself into position, her knee slipped and she flopped down, half onto her side\u2014far too much like a beached whale. God. She loved herself and her curves\u2014she did\u2014but her clumsiness summoned up memories of school gym classes, of being the fat girl, of being ridiculed.</p><p>As Jake pulled her upright, she felt...ugly. Her arm pressed over her rotund stomach as she longed to be skinny and graceful and...and everything she wasn\u2019t. Forcing away the maddening tears, she managed a weak laugh and said, \u201cLet me try that again.\u201d She started to roll up onto her knees.</p><p>His grip on her shoulders stopped her. \u201cOne minute, baby. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-nothing.\u201d Her voice quivered. God, she was such an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She shoved at his arms.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Sliding his hands down to take hers, he squatted in front of her. \u201cYou looked as if I\u2019d slapped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a...a stubborn...\u201d</p><p>When his chin lifted slightly, her words dried right up. Calling a Dom stupid could lead to pain and not the good kind.</p><p>\u201cRainie?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let it go, was he? She huffed in exasperation, but at least her tears were gone. \u201cSir, I\u2019m a big woman, and mostly I like that. But society is...can be...cruel.\u201d She scowled down at her wide hips, feeling immense.</p><p>He studied her for a long, long minute, then tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cWe all have those moments, baby. Bear in mind, though, I really enjoy your shape. You\u2019re a fantastic playground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Her tone came out on the icy side.</p><p>With his hands curled over her knees, he kissed the inside of her thighs. \u201cNow, some playgrounds only have swing sets. I suppose that\u2019s all right, but in my opinion, the more, the better. As it happens, I like ones with slides.\u201d He nuzzled her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAnd jungle gyms.\u201d Cupping her breasts, he teased the nipples taut again, then rose to his feet. In a swift move, he lifted her, set her on her knees, and with unyielding hands, positioned her to face the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cAnd merry-go-rounds.\u201d He kneaded her full buttocks before whispering into her ear, \u201cThe playground that is your body could keep me entertained forever.\u201d</p><p>As he kissed the hollow between her neck and shoulder, his open hum of enjoyment erased her unhappy memories, replacing them with sizzling hunger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d He ran his fingers along the top of the couch to her right. A Velcro cuff popped out from a hidden pocket beneath the upholstery.</p><p>Another cuff? \u201cHow many of those do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots, sweetling.\u201d He secured her wrist and pulled another cuff from the left side.</p><p>As he finished, her shoulders rested on the top of the couch, her arms restrained toward each end. Her breasts dangled. In the air, her bottom tilted up, stationed above her feet.</p><p>He stood behind her, bathing her in his heated gaze before lightly slapping the insides of her thighs. \u201cOpen for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her knees apart and jolted as he ran two fingers through her wet labia. When she tried to lift her torso, a heavy hand between her shoulder blades kept her in place. \u201cStay put, subbie, or I\u2019ll spank that gorgeous ass.\u201d</p><p>One merciless hand pinned her, and his other massaged her buttocks.</p><p>Restrained. Touched. Her body heated with a smoldering desire.</p><p>His playground. As he touched, he\u2019d stop to slide a finger inside her pussy or stroke around her clit\u2014as if he wanted to see her wiggle.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was openly enjoying himself\u2014using her in precisely the way he wanted.</p><p>His ruthless handling drove her into a floating surrender. Take me; take everything. Her whole body softened.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, sweetling,\u201d he murmured, leaning in to kiss her cheek.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t feel any embarrassment or worry with such open approval.</p><p>A second later, she heard a zipper and a condom wrapper. Her body trembled in anticipation, and then his cock pressed against her pussy. And stopped. The rabbit vibrator had left her slick...and very swollen. She hissed as he rocked his hips to work his shaft in. When the broad head breached her entrance, he stopped.</p><p>Her stretched core throbbed around the intrusion. All of her, every cell, felt alive and begging to be touched.</p><p>He ran his hands down her back, leaned forward, and kneaded her breasts. The claws had left the delicate skin abraded and so, so sensitive. When he rolled her abused nipples between his fingers, her insides clenched around him...and he laughed.</p><p>Jesus, how much control did the man have? Was he going to stand there with his dick only partly in her? She wanted...wanted to be taken. Hammered hard. She tried to push back onto him, but her arm restraints allowed no movement...and he noticed her attempt.</p><p>\u201cBad girl.\u201d Amusement underlay the stern tone. A stinging smack hit her right buttock, and the flare of pain made every nerve in her pussy sparkle and spasm. Three additional spanks followed, hard enough to leave her ass cheeks feeling scalded.</p><p>God, she needed him more than she could bear. \u201cPlease.\u201d Her breath escaped in sharp little pants. \u201cI want...need...you to take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready, Rainie. When I\u2019m ready.\u201d He leaned forward again and kissed the back of her shoulder, nuzzling her, driving her crazy. Sadistically taking his time, he pinched her nipples and teased her breasts until they swelled to a throbbing tightness.</p><p>Finally, he straightened, and his big hands curved over her full, full hips. \u201cFuck, I love your ass. Next time, I\u2019m taking you there.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her response, he rammed into her pussy, hard and fast and deep.</p><p>The surprise, the stretch of sensitive tissues, the exhilarating knowledge of being taken for a Master\u2019s pleasure blew through her. Her neck arched as the shock hit, and he was already pulling back and driving in again.</p><p>God, yes.</p><p>Hands gripping her securely, he hammered her. \u201cLook at those ass cheeks quiver.\u201d He paused to fondle her buttocks, rotated his hips as if to be sure every inch of her pussy had been wakened, and resumed. Each deep penetration started a shockwave low in her pelvis to travel up her center.</p><p>And she loved it. Loved... No. With an enticing wiggle, she squeezed her internal muscles to please him.</p><p>His laugh rolled out. \u201cThere\u2019s the cunt I love.\u201d Leaning forward, he wrapped his long arms around her waist. His right palm pulled her stomach and mound upward, forcing her clit to poke out...for his left hand to find. His callused fingers brushed tantalizingly against the nub.</p><p>As the exquisite sensations engulfed her, she groaned and everything inside her bore down. A coil of pressure at her core tightened, growing, expanding, taking over her body, her control. The ache in her shoulder, the awkwardness of the position, the tightness of the cuffs\u2014all disappeared, leaving only the stroke of his merciless, knowledgeable fingers and the ruthless impalement on his thick cock.</p><p>Her body tensed, thighs quivering, as he drove her to the peak. Almost...almost...</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>Her moan of protest was loud in the room. He pulled back slightly to edge her legs out wider, then gripped her ass cheeks, pulling them apart. This time his cock penetrated deeper than any ever had before, invading her body so thoroughly, so intimately, as Jake took her over completely.</p><p>The onrushing tidal wave of orgasm slammed into her, sending her over. And over. And over.</p> <p>Jake woke before dawn, lying on his back. Rainie\u2019s head rested on his right shoulder, and her thick, wavy hair covered his chest. Her softness against his side and the light fragrance of her shampoo had him hardening. But damned if he wanted to\u2014or could\u2014move.</p><p>She had him pinned down on one side. On the left, Rhage and Guido lay curled against his hip and thigh. Normally he\u2019d insist the dogs sleep at the foot of the bed, but his two rescue cats had staked out that territory. Patton, the Manx, was draped over his right leg, MacArthur, the tiger-stripe, on his left.</p><p>Good thing he didn\u2019t get claustrophobic, he thought drowsily. On the contrary, even with his grief for Violetta still fresh, he couldn\u2019t recall feeling more content.</p><p>Sure, being surrounded by animals always made him happy, but this ease was deeper. As if the woman lying next to him had carved new channels in his soul and filled them with her ever-flowing joy.</p><p>He half snorted at the thought. Any minute now, he\u2019d break into The Sound of Music or something. Gunny would have been horrified.</p><p>Guido stirred and raised his head. With a whine, the dog jumped off the bed to sit by the door.</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>Another whine.</p><p>Fuck. But he couldn\u2019t blame the beastie for the impact of a changed environment, different routine, and new food on his system. Carefully, Jake disentangled himself from the various bodies.</p><p>Rainie murmured inaudibly and rolled to her other side. He eyed the pale roundness of her ass with prurient thoughts, sighed again, and motioned the dog out of the room, taking Rhage as well.</p><p>A few minutes later, as he sat on the edge of the concrete slab, he heard the porch door. A glance over his shoulder gave him a treat.</p><p>In his T-shirt, Rainie was all curves and beautiful legs. Her multi-colored hair waved over her shoulders, her eyes were sleepy, her mouth swollen from his kisses.</p><p>Nice. Very, very nice.</p><p>She pulled a chair close to him and sat. \u201cDogs?\u201d she asked, her voice beautifully husky as if she\u2019d had all the high notes fucked away.</p><p>Made a man proud.</p><p>He pointed to the field and the two dogs stalking and pouncing on field mice with abysmal success.</p><p>\u201cAt this hour?\u201d She snorted. \u201cYou know, when I drag home from work, Mr. Energizer Puppy\u2019s raring to play. All evening. It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m out of school or I\u2019d flunk.\u201d</p><p>School? He leaned his shoulder against a post. \u201cWhat were you going for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...an MBA.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. Hell, he\u2019d known she was smart, but... \u201cThat\u2019s great, Rainie. And you got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished in December.\u201d When she smiled down at him, the golden streaks in her hair glinted in the moonlight.</p><p>She smelled of his soap from the shower they\u2019d taken. He liked her in his clothes and scent. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so good at everything in the office.\u201d</p><p>The compliment made her eyes light. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you plan to do with that fancy new degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a fancy new job...somewhere.\u201d She added lightly, \u201cI need a position where I can wear all my suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do look stunning in them.\u201d The thought of her leaving the clinic shredded tiny bits from his contentment.</p><p>In the moonlight, the dogs flushed a rabbit and chased it across the grass, barking madly.</p><p>\u201cHe may have too much energy, but I\u2019m glad you made me keep him.\u201d As the dogs trotted back, panting happily, Rainie laughed.</p><p>A shame she hadn\u2019t had a dog growing up. \u201cYour mom disliked pets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. It\u2019s just that owning a dog would have meant rental deposits. And...she didn\u2019t want to care for anything.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Rainie\u2019s tone was even, not bitter, but her face was easy to read. \u201cNot even you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>As if to avoid the question\u2014and him\u2014she leaned back in the chair.</p><p>He put his hand on her calf, keeping contact whether she wanted it or not. \u201cRainie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, even me. She took off with a guy when I was twelve and never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ended up with your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he left when I was seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was seven,\u201d she said. Didn\u2019t have to think to remember her age...which meant it had been nasty. Memorable.</p><p>\u201cDid he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalked out on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He stood, scooped her up, and took her place in the chair with her on his lap.</p><p>\u201cJake, no, I\u2019m too heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Even if she were\u2014being smothered in soft, fragrant female flesh would be a fucking fine way to go. He pulled her closer, marveling how there wasn\u2019t a place on her that was bony.</p><p>When he nipped her jaw, she shivered...and his cock began to lengthen. No, she needed cuddling and conversation, not sex. The subject was childhood. And abandonment.</p><p>A shame irresponsible people couldn\u2019t be spayed\u2014or neutered\u2014as easily as dogs. \u201cWho raised you, baby? Relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have any. I got foster care.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. He knew guys who\u2019d had decent, loving foster parents. Knew others who\u2019d suffered. Rainie lived her life with joy and laughter, but...she had formidable emotional defenses. \u201cSo the foster home didn\u2019t allow pets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of mine did.\u201d Her grim tone told him even more.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d In the clinic, affection flowed from her in a river, washing over animals and people. If, as a child, she\u2019d had no one to spend that love on, it\u2019d have been like damming up the Mississippi. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d try to make up for that lack.</p><p>He guided her to her feet and stood himself. A whistle brought the dogs, panting and quivering with happiness. \u201cBack to bed, crew,\u201d he ordered, ushering her into the house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. We\u2019re going to sleep in.\u201d He tucked an arm around her as he led her to the bedroom, feeling the rightness of having her beside him. \u201cBeen wondering, buttercup. What kind of a bribe will it take to get you to cook breakfast?\u201d</p><p>The slight tilt of her lips told him exactly what inducement she was considering.</p><p>As he ran his hand over her luscious ass, he smiled. Wasn\u2019t it amazing how great minds thought alike?</p><p>In her apartment, Rainie tossed another bra toward the overloaded suitcase on her bed. Three pieces of underwear fell off the pile onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Jake said, amusement in his tone. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a bigger suitcase?\u201d</p><p>He was laughing at her, damn him. She eyed her carry-on. It really was too small.</p><p>Each night since last weekend, Jake had coaxed her into staying at his place. And she\u2019d loved that\u2014but hated having to visit her apartment every morning to change outfits. If he didn\u2019t own two cats and now Guido, they might have alternated. But the felines were used to freedom.</p><p>Besides, Rhage loved Jake\u2019s fenced acreage. And she always gave her sweet puppy what he wanted. Really, she was doing all this for the dog: working with Jake. Having sex with Jake. Sleeping with Jake.</p><p>She opened another dresser drawer and considered the shirts. Jake wanted her to pack some clothes and keep them at his house. And she\u2019d finally agreed.</p><p>Since finding Rhage, she\u2019d spent more time with Jake than in half a year with Geoffrey. Every day, she fell more and more into...liking him. Caring for him.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Jake walked up behind her and pulled her back against his chest. Gripping her hair, he tilted her head sideways, giving him access to nibble on her neck. His beard stubble tickled, scraped, and the slight sting of his teeth was soothed by his gentle lips. Hard and soft, pain and pleasure, sweet and cruel. He never gave her a chance to get her bearings.</p><p>\u201cIt happened, Rainie.\u201d He nipped her earlobe. \u201cAnd I\u2019m damned pleased. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Under his level, questioning eyes, all she could do was nod. \u201cI... Yes. I am.\u201d Very pleased. Very happy.</p><p>And very scared. She felt as if she\u2019d been floating in a meandering river and suddenly an undersurface current had grabbed her. Her emotions were being swept along with no chance of escape.</p><p>She reached up to touch his lean cheek. When had she come to care so much?</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cKeep looking at me like that and you\u2019ll get fucked instead of packed.\u201d</p><p>A snort escaped her. She retreated, pointing at him with an accusing finger. \u201cYou are insatiable.\u201d And she loved it.</p><p>\u201cQuite true, where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d Blatantly adjusting himself in his jeans, he turned to study the clothes scattered over the bed. \u201cBigger suitcase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the closet.\u201d She turned back to the dresser and selected another set of underwear. With more room, she could\u2014</p> <p>Behind her, the bed squeaked as Jake tossed the suitcase on the mattress. Latches clicked.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. I am impressed.\u201d Jake\u2019s baritone had lowered, turning an edgy hot as if he\u2019d descended into the fires of hell.</p><p>With a red thong in her hand, Rainie glanced over her shoulder. Oh crap. Wrong suitcase.</p><p>The oversize black suitcase lay open, showing how she\u2019d customized the interior with Styrofoam and padding to hold dildoes, vibrators, gags, edible oils, and...everything. \u201cI arrange sex-toy parties. Those are the samples. My stock. That\u2019s not the right case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, this is the perfect suitcase.\u201d Jake picked up a pair of fluffy nipple clamps and gave her a Dom\u2019s assessing stare. One that made her entire body soften. \u201cRemove your blouse. And bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d Her mouth had gone dry\u2014and her pussy was dampening, preparing for him. \u201cI-I don\u2019t... The toys are for parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come I never get invitations?\u201d Laughter teased the edges of his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetling. I\u2019ll buy whatever I open.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie,\u201d he interrupted and picked up a gag. \u201cWant me to use this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. Oh yes. \u201cI\u2019ll keep\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned. You do.\u201d His gaze turned more intense.</p><p>Oh shit. She backpedaled, heading for the door.</p><p>Hard hands closed on her arms, and he tossed her onto an empty place on the bed. A second later, he\u2019d pushed the pretty red gag into her mouth and was strapping it on.</p><p>As she made irritated noises and struggled, he mercilessly stripped her clothes off\u2014and picked up a set of nipple clamps from the case.</p><p>Not nipple clamps. \u201cMmmmh, mmmmh!\u201d She tried to roll off the bed.</p><p>He swatted her ass, rolled her onto her back, and straddled her, holding her down as he applied the damn things.</p><p>Ow, ow, ow.</p><p>\u201cDamn, those are pretty,\u201d he murmured. With a finger, he rang the little hanging bells.</p><p>She glared at him\u2014and he laughed. But he hadn\u2019t made the clamps too tight, and as he fondled her breasts, the ache in her nipples turned wonderfully exciting.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to make time to visit your apartment more often. This canopy setup has definite benefits.\u201d He knotted one of the hanging drapes around her right knee, then another on her left, forcing her thighs widely open. After an evaluating look, he shoved a pillow under her hips to open her more widely. Bare and exposed.</p><p>She should feel embarrassed, but the appreciation in his gaze and the heat simmering under her skin burned it away.</p><p>After a quick search, he placed one of Rhage\u2019s squeaky toys in her hand. \u201cI might not be able to differentiate between your screaming and a safeword, so use that.\u201d</p><p>Screaming?</p><p>From the suitcase, he removed a tube of lube, and his hand hovered over the array of anal plugs. \u201cAccording to your Shadowlands trainee files, you\u2019ve done anal play.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the Gods of Cruelty have struck again. She nodded. She loved being taken anally. And hated it. It felt too...intimate, too...possessed. And yet nothing quite equaled the sensation.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He chose the smallest plug\u2014thank you, God\u2014lubed it, and pushed it in with no fanfare, ignoring her wiggling. The slight burn and the stretch and wakening nerves made her clit throb and need.</p><p>Her gaze took in the wonderful bulge beneath his jeans. She was so ready to have sex.</p><p>Instead, he turned and dropped additional anal plugs beside her.</p><p>She stared at him and made a sound. A bad sound.</p><p>He gave her a terrifying smile and picked up a vibrator. \u201cAfter you come\u2014each time\u2014I\u2019ll reward you with a bigger plug.\u201d</p><p>The restraints held her open as he ran his finger around her clit. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetling. The biggest one will be...me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>With a depressed sigh, Rainie finished updating her resume at Jake\u2019s kitchen table. Now that the task was completed, she needed to send out applications. Get a job. Move.</p><p>Misery grew like a weed inside her.</p><p>For a while, she\u2019d escaped thinking about the future. Between wedding chores and the clinic, she\u2019d been busy. Then there was Rhage, as well. And\u2014her new man took up even more time.</p><p>I have a man.</p><p>She could feel her lips curling up into an idiotic grin, but didn\u2019t care. She loved it all. Loved having her life filled with activities, loved having a dog, loved being involved with Jake Sheffield.</p><p>From outside came the sound of a mallet striking metal. She rose to peek out the window.</p><p>Across the green swath of grass, Jake was attaching what looked like a chain wastebasket to a tall pole. Jake had decided to set up a disc golf course.</p><p>Admittedly, the game was fun, although she\u2019d never been able to hit the broad side of a barn with a Frisbee. Actually, she was lucky if the disc stayed in the same zip code. But ever since last Sunday when Jake had dragged her out for some \u201cfun,\u201d she\u2019d been improving.</p><p>And both Rhage and Guido loved Frisbee catch. They\u2019d gone out with Jake today, obviously in hopes that he\u2019d play with them again. But he was focused on getting the course done so he could start having weekend Frisbee golf and grill parties.</p><p>Only he\u2019d used the word \u201cwe.\u201d \u201cWe can have...\u201d The way that made her feel, with hope and sadness so intermingled she couldn\u2019t pull them apart.</p><p>As she watched, Jake peeled off his shirt and tossed it over the pole. His wide chest gleamed in the sunlight, and her thoughts scattered before a rising wind of lust. Down, girl. He wasn\u2019t stripping for a show but because the sun was too hot. Shame on me.</p><p>Feeling guilty, Rainie poured ice tea into a sports bottle and grabbed a couple of the cookies she\u2019d made the day before. If nothing else, she could go succor her man.</p><p>She sure didn\u2019t do much for him\u2014all she gave him was food and...well, and sex. Nothing emotional. Nothing real. Her lips turned down. She\u2019d come to need him, but the reverse wasn\u2019t true at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the screen door banged shut behind her, the dogs raced across the grass to bark and bounce around her.</p><p>\u201cLook at you two. Were you helping your human?\u201d They were so happy to see her, to be outside, to be together. As she dispensed scratches and ear tugs, her heart felt so full it was tender.</p><p>Jake said they\u2019d probably been raised in one-dog families, and now they\u2019d found themselves a \u201cpack.\u201d She knew the feeling.</p><p>Jake was on his cell as she approached. He\u2019d shoved his hair back off his forehead, and the sun glinted in the thick brown strands. When he saw her, he winked and kept talking. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell the housekeeper to have the fridge stocked. No, Mom, I won\u2019t check on Jennifer\u2019s kitchen. If she left stuff in there, she can clean it out herself.\u201d</p> <p>His family was due to return from Europe next week, Rainie remembered. She handed him the bottle of ice tea.</p><p>His pleased smile was enough to melt every ice cube in the bottle and her bones as well. Tilting his head back, he drank, and his Adam\u2019s apple moved in his hard, corded neck as he swallowed.</p><p>As she watched\u2014and perved\u2014her mouth grew dry and the air heated.</p><p>The work of pounding in the iron poles had pumped up his muscles until his tanned skin stretched taut over his rock-hard biceps, delts, and pecs. He gleamed with sweat, and his light scattering of chest hair had matted down, allowing flat brown nipples to show. On the back of his forearms, his veins stood out, daring her to trace them with her tongue. His jeans hung low on his hips, giving her a mouth-watering view of the ridges of his abdominal muscles. The bulge of his package in those jeans was growing.</p><p>She jerked her gaze up.</p> <p>Lowering his phone, he said in an intensely masculine growl, \u201cIf you keep those hungry eyes on me, I\u2019ll show you all about sex in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re talking to your mother\u2014you can\u2019t...\u201d She sputtered, knowing her face had gone beet red. How could he have said such a thing with his mother listening? At a loss, Rainie held out a cookie. \u201cEat this, and stop whatever you\u2019re thinking!\u201d</p><p>His deep laugh reverberated through her, filling her heart with happiness. Then he glanced at his phone and...turned the mike back on. \u201cStill here. Just had to deal with something for a moment. Yes, tomorrow is Marcus and Gabi\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s a shame you won\u2019t return in time.\u201d</p><p>Before Rainie could escape, he nabbed her with a long arm around her waist. Holding her against his front, he rocked his hips, teasing her with his thick erection. One big hand kneaded her ass.</p><p>He said into the phone, \u201cNadia\u2019s actually working? With William Renard? Well, maybe I\u2019ll run into her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Another long flow of indecipherable words came through the phone before he responded, \u201cI love you, too, Mom. Put him on.\u201d</p> <p>I love you, too. Trapped within the curve of Jake\u2019s arm, unable to flee, Rainie stared up at him as his sentiment resonated down into her center. The very same words\u2014I love you\u2014lived inside her heart just waiting to be released.</p><p>No. No. Absolutely not. No, she didn\u2019t love him. Couldn\u2019t love him. Ever. Wrong.</p><p>She tried to take a step back, and he drew her closer. Even as he answered his father about a business matter, he pressed a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p>The affectionate gesture hit her resolve with the weight of a sledgehammer. And as the broken pieces of her future fell around her, she was wondering...what would it be like to stay?</p><p>But what about her past? Her jaw firmed. The cruel people from her past\u2014as well as the memories\u2014would find her, over and over. She\u2019d never escape.</p><p>Yet, she\u2019d had experience in dealing with the jerks who judged her, and she\u2019d survived so far.</p><p>She leaned into Jake and breathed in his scent. If the assholes\u2019 verbal abuse was the cost of staying with Jake\u2014and God, she wanted to be with him\u2014she could handle what they dished out.</p><p>She could.</p> <p>The gods had smiled on Gabi and Sally, Rainie thought, gifting them with a flawless wedding day. The gauzy clouds overhead grew denser near the horizon, softened the sun, and kept the temperature perfect. The light sea-scented breeze blew any bugs away and ruffled the vivid blue-and-white blooms of the annuals and vines.</p><p>Rainie dodged a caterer, stepped around a woman carrying a tissue-wrapped gift, and hurried toward the bridal suite.</p><p>Behind her at the entrance to the ceremonial garden, Jessica and Linda were going over last minute details with the wedding planner. Although both women were gowned in the rich blue of the bridal party, they\u2019d managed to sidestep the walking-down-the-aisle portion.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy. Linda had tactfully refused, then refused again, and finally told the brides that Master Sam would handle the next refusal. Neither Gabi nor Sally were about to annoy the Shadowlands\u2019 notorious sadist.</p><p>Faced with the same pressure, pregnant Jessica had informed the brides that if they persisted, she\u2019d either go into labor or\u2014even worse\u2014inform Master Z of every trick the two brats had pulled in the club.</p><p>Awesome threat.</p><p>Grinning, Rainie walked through the main entrance of the bridal suite. Decorated in quiet colors of cream and khaki, the suite held a small kitchen, bathroom, and dressing room. In the main space, which combined a living room and a beauty parlor, counters, sinks, and mirrors lined one entire wall.</p><p>Right now, chaos ruled. At the counters, three hairdressers were finishing Kim, Beth, and Andrea. A makeup artist was putting the last touches on Gabi\u2019s face.</p><p>Doing a mental count, Rainie nodded. Gabi and bridesmaids were accounted for.</p><p>In the center of the room, Uzuri and Kari lounged in the beige suede chairs. They, along with Rainie, were Sally\u2019s bridesmaids. Rainie cleared her throat. \u201cWhere\u2019s the second bride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen,\u201d Gabi called.</p><p>\u201cNo, she came out and went into the dressing room.\u201d Kari jerked her head toward the back. \u201cShe\u2019s been there a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looked a little upset,\u201d Uzuri said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure whether to check on her or not. Maybe she\u2019s got an attack of nerves?\u201d</p><p>Over getting married? That didn\u2019t seem like Sally. \u201cI\u2019ll take her in a Sprite and see if she wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>But when Rainie reached the kitchen door, waves of animosity seemed to pour forth.</p><p>The two voices were unfortunately familiar. Gabi\u2019s mother. Galen\u2019s mother\u2014Mrs. Kouros. The Queen of Petrified Nastiness was conversating with the Empress of Icy Bitchiness.</p><p>How had either warmed up enough to procreate? Rainie grinned, imagining some poor guy trying to fuck one of them. With one thrust, his cock would ice over...and shatter.</p><p>Her smile faded at what Galen\u2019s mother was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Galen found her, but he could do so much better. She is quite coarse. Common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t stay on the farm where she belongs,\u201d Gabi\u2019s mother agreed. \u201cHer graceless presence lowers the entire tone of the wedding\u2014as do her gauche relatives.\u201d</p><p>Rainie\u2019s teeth ground together. They meant Sally, and Sally\u2019s charming brother, wife, and their adorable children.</p><p>\u201cIt is a shame, but Galen is quite determined to proceed.\u201d Mrs. Kouros gave a chilled sigh. \u201cI fear I will have to endure her when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay that is exactly what Sally is saying to herself right now.\u201d Rainie didn\u2019t bother to lower her voice. Miss Lily would have been horrified at the incivility.</p><p>Stepping into the room, Rainie faced the obsessively thin, older version of Cruella de Vil.</p><p>Mrs. Kouros stared down her nose at the intruder. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt there is an excuse for you,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cYour son managed to find a beautiful woman who makes him so happy he laughs now\u2014and I\u2019d say that\u2019s a rarity for him, although understandable, considering who he has for a mother.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Kouros drew back as if she\u2019d been slapped, and Gabi\u2019s mother\u2019s expression turned cold. Colder.</p><p>\u201cBut, having been raised by you,\u201d Rainie continued, \u201cGalen knows exactly what he does and doesn\u2019t want in a wife. He searched for a warm, spirited woman, one courageous enough to save his life. Or did you forget you wouldn\u2019t have a son at all without Sally?\u201d</p><p>When no answer was forthcoming, Rainie tsked-tsked. \u201cYou did forget. Oh well, mental deterioration is common at your age.\u201d</p><p>Gabi\u2019s mother stepped forward. \u201cListen, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you two pay attention now. This is a happy time, and you are destroying the mood. I want you both to leave this suite right now.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Kouros had recovered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any say here.\u201d</p><p>Rainie gave them a threatening smile. \u201cI\u2019m commonly known as a brat. And I can assure you that if you don\u2019t stay away from the entire bridal party, including the brides, I will make you the center of a scene the likes of which you\u2019ve never known. Screaming, hair-pulling, ripped clothing, scratched faces.\u201d</p><p>She paused for breath. Fury edged her voice. \u201cJust try me.\u201d</p><p>They backed away, clear to the other side of the kitchen. Mrs. Kouros opened the kitchen door and...</p><p>Dear God of little cats and dogs. Dressed in a black tuxedo, Jake stood right outside. From his stunned expression, he\u2019d heard every single word. He stepped aside to let the two Bitches of the Year flee and turned to watch them scurry down the sidewalk on their high heels. He pointed his gaze at Rainie and cocked a brow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wasn\u2019t it just fate that her voice chose that moment to dry up?</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cZ sent a heads-up. Guests will start arriving in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Rainie choked out. \u201cI\u2019ll tell everyone.\u201d</p><p>With a polite tilt to his head, he closed the door. Through the open window, she watched him stride away.</p> <p>He\u2019d heard. She stood in the empty kitchen and shook. Her face felt hot. Cold. Hot. The man she...admired...had listened to her ream out two distinguished women. Like poor white trash. Or a crude, rude, graceless girl from the slums.</p><p>Like her own mother.</p><p>She\u2019d ruined the entire wedding with her stupid mouth. Please don\u2019t let anyone else have heard her.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and walked into a mob. All the bridesmaids and brides were gathered around the door.</p><p>No, no, no. God, what had she done? \u201cI thought I\u2019d kept my voice down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, you weren\u2019t that loud,\u201d Uzuri said. \u201cBut we heard the squeaks from the road kill and, um, moved closer.\u201d</p><p>When Gabi met her gaze, Rainie wanted to cry. I attacked my best friend\u2019s mother. She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabi. I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely honest and direct.\u201d Gowned in white satin, Gabi hugged her. \u201cI just wish I had it on tape, dammit. Now I have to remember it all for Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me?\u201d Rainie choked out, and then, worse, so, so much worse, she saw Sally. Who was crying.</p><p>God, she\u2019d ruined her entire\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had friends like you,\u201d Sally whispered. \u201cOnes that would stand up against pressure like that.\u201d Sally wrapped her arms around Rainie and hung on tight.</p> <p>Oh. Breathe. She pulled in a shuddering inhalation, blinked hard, and hugged Sally back. After the water cleared from her eyes, she managed to look around. She saw the same approving expression from everyone in the room\u2014as well as more tears.</p><p>\u201cStop it, all of you.\u201d The makeup lady scowled at the bridal party. \u201cI used waterproof, but there\u2019s only so much it can do. No crying until after the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>As the room exploded with laughter, there was a sound like a gunshot.</p><p>Unfazed by the screams, Jessica stood at the counter pouring frothing champagne into tall flutes. She lifted one. \u201cHere\u2019s to the Battle of the Bitches where the best maid won.\u201d</p><p>Next to her, Linda laughed, winked at Rainie, and handed out glasses.</p><p>Jesus Christ. Still stunned\u2014and laughing\u2014Jake reached the groomsmen\u2019s quarters.</p><p>Fucking amazing job. Rainie had taken on those two witches and flattened them. How many people would have the courage? Those two women were the human female equivalent of huge, aggressive Brazilian Mastiffs. In comparison, by fighting weight and disposition, Rainie would be closer to a sweet fluffy collie. But she\u2019d taken them on, defended her friend, and conquered.</p><p>He\u2019d have to figure a way to reward her tonight. Damn, he was proud of her.</p> <p>He stepped inside the room set up for the groomsmen. The masculine d\u00e9cor of dark wood and leather was lightened by a floor-to-ceiling view of the shore. One mirrored wall had a long counter where Marcus, Dan, and Nolan were finishing the last touches to bow ties, pocket silks, and cuff links. Drinks in hand, Vance and Galen relaxed in the leather chairs in the room\u2019s center. Saxon, Raoul, and Cullen stood by the chest-high bar, conversing. Near a window, Sam sat at a table, reading a newspaper.</p><p>Jake cleared his throat loudly. When he\u2019d gained everyone\u2019s attention, he announced, \u201cZ requests the groomsmen be at the wedding garden in about five to ten minutes to seat people.\u201d</p><p>Cullen nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got time for this, then.\u201d Saxon poured and handed Jake a shot of Ketel One.</p><p>Jake checked over his friend. \u201cNice mixture of tux and Viking barbarian.\u201d To do justice to his tux, Saxon had pulled his long hair into a neat queue. His jacket was open, showing off the silver waistcoat. \u201cYou look good, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Saxon said smugly. He\u2019d been asked to step in as a groomsman when Holt had been unexpectedly called out of town. Although the brides and grooms possessed family and friends who could participate, they\u2019d kept the wedding party to Shadowlands members.</p><p>Surrounded by the relaxed group of friends, Jake had to appreciate the decision.</p><p>When Saxon returned to his discussion with Cullen, Jake took an empty chair next to Galen and asked, \u201cThe photographer and her helper passed me as I left the brides\u2019 suite. Wasn\u2019t the assistant supposed to be here?\u201d</p><p>Vance grinned. \u201cYeah. She fled when Cullen started stripping.\u201d</p><p>Cullen glanced around at the sound of his name.</p><p>Jake eyed him. \u201cI thought you finished dressing an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d One elbow on the bar, Cullen swirled his drink. \u201cNext time, she\u2019ll ask permission before busting into the men\u2019s quarters.\u201d</p><p>Every guy in the room laughed, even Nolan. Galen lifted his glass, toasting Cullen.</p><p>Galen. Hell.</p><p>Jake took a hefty swallow of the vodka, let it burn its way down, before facing a man he considered a friend. Jake judged himself diplomatic, but this was out of his depth. Yet, if positions were reversed, he\u2019d want to know\u2014and sooner rather than later. \u201cListen,\u201d he started.</p><p>Galen straightened at the grim tone. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When I went to the bridal suite...\u201d</p><p>As the retelling of the battle continued, Galen\u2019s expression turned dark.</p><p>\u201cGalen,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe knew this might happen. Your mother is...who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. And she had her chance,\u201d Galen said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll ensure she excuses herself once the wedding is over. She won\u2019t attend the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Vance gave Jake a chin-lift. \u201cWe appreciate the info, and we\u2019ll thank Rainie when we get a chance.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded. Their Sally was a delightful submissive, younger than Rainie in some ways, but with the same exuberance of spirit. Perhaps, that\u2019s why it had taken two FBI Doms to tame the girl.</p><p>As for Rainie... Jake smiled slightly. He considered himself just the subbie-tamer needed for her.</p><p>Not men to postpone an unpleasant task, Vance and Galen set their drinks down and left.</p><p>As Raoul joined Sam by the window, Cullen settled into a leather chair across from Jake.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro.\u201d Saxon took the other seat. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so busy I didn\u2019t ask how your new pet worked out.\u201d</p><p>Jake raised an eyebrow, thinking Sax meant Rainie, then realized he referred to Violetta\u2019s dog. \u201cGuido is fine, although the little bastard dug up three of my pepper plants.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s decided he\u2019s a cat now, so MacArthur and Patton drafted him into the feline army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pitiful. Ruination of a fine dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, they keep him busy enough he hasn\u2019t had a chance to mope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the delivery girl useful?\u201d Saxon\u2019s light brows quirked upward.</p><p>Now, he meant Rainie. Jake scowled. \u201cI appreciate it...but you shouldn\u2019t have sent her. I was damned rude to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she understood.\u201d Drink in hand, Saxon extended his legs, totally at ease. \u201cWhen she\u2019s not playing prankster, she\u2019s a comforting woman. I figured she might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t need help,\u201d Jake growled. \u201cI can deal with things myself.\u201d Jesus, did he think Jake would dump his troubles on\u2014</p><p>\u201cAndrea thought that, too,\u201d Cullen said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd she is right,\u201d Jake said. \u201cA Dom stands on his own feet. Shouldn\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cullen shook his head. \u201cNo, buddy, that\u2019s what she thought about herself. Her father played hell with her perception of independence. Took a while before she realized we\u2019re just human, and it\u2019s all right to lean on someone else.\u201d</p><p>Jake imagined Gunny\u2019s growl of outrage, but he said mildly, \u201cHow can a Dom be strong for the submissive if he needs her help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one gets through life without needing some support,\u201d Cullen answered. \u201cA Dom has to be honest with himself and his submissive. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to go, gentlemen,\u201d Nolan interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guests arriving.\u201d</p><p>As he followed the others out the door, Jake set aside the argument. Dammit, he respected Cullen. Fine man; fine Dom.</p><p>But he was wrong.</p><p>For half an hour, Jake escorted guests down the curving path through crimson roses, under the jasmine arbor, and then across the manicured grass to the white chairs decorated with silver and blue ribbons. In the front, blue flowers cascaded from the arch of the white gazebo, and beyond that, the sandy beach rolled down to the blue-gray waters of the Gulf.</p><p>The day was peaceful with the quiet conversations of the guests and waves sighing on the shore. The palms dotting the edge of the grass rustled in the light wind.</p><p>As the sun dropped behind the bank of clouds, the grooms and groomsmen took their places, half on each side of the gazebo. Z stood at the apex, and his black on black attire lent his justice-of-the-peace appearance a dangerous edge.</p><p>Jake turned as the bridal party appeared. The chairs had been arranged to provide twin diagonal corridors, and on the left one, Kim headed the line of Gabi\u2019s bridesmaids. Kari led Sally\u2019s posse. Upon reaching the front, Kari took a place beside her husband Dan, and Kim beside Raoul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Uzuri and Beth were halfway down the aisles, Rainie and Andrea followed, glancing across the center seats at each other to keep in step.</p><p>Jake smiled. Hell, most men seeing Rainie would have to smile. In contrast with Andrea, Rainie was shorter. Rounder. And so happy that the light seemed to increase when it struck her.</p><p>He\u2019d never met a woman like her. From the way she was transforming their clinic, to her pleasure in Rhage, to the way she\u2019d defended her friend, to the way the animals\u2014and owners\u2014instinctively trusted her.</p><p>She was...amazing. What they had was amazing.</p> <p>He intended to hang onto her.</p><p>The music changed, and the audience rose.</p><p>Much to their fianc\u00e9s\u2019 bemusement, the two brides had decided on a traditional entrance.</p><p>So Gabi\u2019s father escorted her.</p><p>Sally\u2019s father, who apparently was a total asshole, hadn\u2019t been invited. However, in Jake\u2019s opinion, Sally had found someone better. She\u2019d asked Sam to act as her father and walk her down the aisle.</p> <p>And the sadist\u2014who terrified every submissive in the Shadowlands\u2014had choked up with tears in his eyes.</p><p>As they came down the aisle, Gabi\u2019s father moved like a robot, far more concerned with his dignity than with his daughter. Upon arriving at the front, he handed his daughter off to Marcus and strode away.</p><p>In contrast, Sam kept his gaze on Sally, openly pleased with the girl\u2019s sparkling joy. He brought her to a halt at the gazebo and offered Galen her left hand, Vance her right. After kissing her cheek, he shot her men an easily interpretable stare\u2014treat her right or answer to me.</p><p>When Sally made an undoubtedly impertinent comment, he barked a laugh.</p><p>He paused to give Marcus the exact same warning look. Touching Gabi\u2019s cheek gently, he said something too low to hear.</p><p>And, Gabi, having easily dismissed her own father, smiled at Sam and blinked back tears.</p> <p>As Sam took his seat, Z cleared his throat and began, officiating the ceremony with the dignity and polish everyone expected from him. With an occasional revision to accommodate Sally\u2019s m\u00e9nage, he blended together a psychologist\u2019s hard-won knowledge with a Master\u2019s even harder-won wisdom.</p><p>Vows were exchanged. Rings were exchanged. Most of the women in the audience were dabbing at their eyes.</p><p>Amused, Jake shook his head, then caught the look Marcus offered his woman. Openly loving and proud and possessive.</p><p>Next to him, Galen held Sally, resting his cheek on top of her hair, as if he\u2019d acquired something so precious he feared to squeeze too hard. After exchanging a long pleased look with Vance, he passed her to his partner.</p><p>And Jake found himself blinking back tears.</p><p>Weddings, truly a treacherous battlefield. His gaze rested on Rainie. Hazardous or not, he planned to win the skirmish and take her home tonight.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Both exhausted and fizzing with happiness, Rainie stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Gulf shore. From the dark waters of the Gulf, white frothy waves rolled up onto the beach. In the rising wind, the tall palms shook and bowed.</p> <p>Behind her, dinner over, the reception was going gangbusters. Filling the center dance floor, an older crowd gyrated crazily to the old tune, The Twist.</p><p>Most of the over-fifty crowd were business associates invited by Galen\u2019s mother and Gabi\u2019s parents. In the interests of harmony, Gabi and Sally had caved in...and for a while, Rainie\u2019d wondered if any relatives were worth the bother.</p><p>But in the past couple of days, Vance and Marcus\u2019s loving, supportive families had demonstrated what a family could be\u2014and made her wish she had one.</p><p>A flicker caught Rainie\u2019s eye as the light of the moon gleamed off the sails of a boat gliding toward the marina. What a gorgeous location. To her delight, despite a fair amount of parental pressure early on, the brides had held out for their beachside wedding location. Gabi and Marcus had romantic memories of playing together in the waves, and Midwest-born Sally had loved the idea of a true tropical wedding.</p><p>Rainie smiled. If Sally wanted something, Galen and Vance would work their asses off to see she got it. Although \u201clegally\u201d people in a m\u00e9nage couldn\u2019t \u201cmarry,\u201d the men had wanted their Sally to have a beautiful, traditional wedding ceremony, so despite any objections, that\u2019s what she\u2019d gotten. Even Gabi\u2019s mother quailed when faced with Galen\u2019s implacable stare.</p><p>Rainie had practiced that expression in the mirror and added it to her personal arsenal. In her future corporate position, she\u2019d need all the firepower she could wield.</p><p>However, the reception wasn\u2019t the ground on which to employ such weaponry.</p><p>Here, people fought their battles with beautiful attire and graciousness. Turning away from the windows, she smoothed her gown and looked around for possible dance partners. She saw Shadowlands members scattered throughout the room.</p><p>Near the head table, Kim, Andrea, and Kari chatted with their husbands.</p><p>In the center of the room, Beth was dancing with Nolan. Who knew the rough Master could actually dance? Dancing with the couple who\u2019d chosen him as their submissive, Tanner looked blissfully happy.</p><p>Like a good pregnant woman, Jessica sat beside Linda, both their Masters nearby. By the punch bowl, Uzuri\u2019d nabbed a sizzling hot man.</p><p>Anne was dancing with a young man who was obviously star struck and hardly a challenge to the Mistress. Rainie frowned. Anne better be careful or she\u2019d be on the receiving end of one of Master Z\u2019s infamous talks.</p><p>In the center of the dance floor, Gabi and Sally were showing off steps from the bachelorette party, and somehow their virginal wedding dresses transformed the exotic dancing moves to breathtakingly sexy.</p><p>Off to one side, the Shadowlands\u2019 security guard Ben stood with Galen and Vance. As they talked, the two grooms watched their bride with wide smiles. Ben\u2019s gaze kept drifting to Mistress Anne.</p><p>As the song came to an end, Rainie moved out. She should check in with the brides in case they needed something. After that\u2014</p><p>Around the side of the room, Jake was heading toward her.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Not knowing how late her bridesmaid\u2019s duties would keep her, she\u2019d told him he was on his own, and she\u2019d go home to her apartment after the reception was over. Now she regretted her decision; she wanted to sleep in his arms.</p><p>But, either way, at least she\u2019d get to dance with him.</p><p>Unfortunately, even as she watched, Gabi\u2019s parents intercepted him. Rainie considered a rescue, but from the way Mr. Renard clapped a hand on Jake\u2019s shoulder and shook his hand, they were well acquainted.</p><p>Despite his annoyance at the delay in reaching Rainie, Jake shook hands with William Renard and answered the man\u2019s question. \u201cMy parents are enjoying their trip. Thank you for asking.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThey made a stop in Paris before heading home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t join them,\u201d Mrs. Renard said. \u201cCertainly you\u2019d have more fun in Europe than running that clinic of yours.\u201d</p><p>Jake shrugged. \u201cI get bored on vacations.\u201d Although a holiday with Rainie might defeat boredom nicely. He glanced over his shoulder, but she\u2019d been pulled out to the floor by Uzuri, Saxon, and Holt.</p><p>She really could dance...</p><p>He\u2019d noticed her talent at the Shadowlands and the bachelorette party. Here she was simply having fun and looked incredibly sexy in that floaty-skirted gown. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>A body blocked his view. Irritated, he sidestepped.</p><p>Two soft hands clasped his. \u201cJake, don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</p><p>Startled, he glanced down to see a slender woman. Dark copper hair in an up-swirl style, gold designer dress, sultry blue eyes. \u201cNadia.\u201d His distant cousin looked beautiful, as always. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. Mom mentioned you might come. Is your husband here as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ve been divorced for ages. That\u2019s why I took a job with William\u2019s law firm.\u201d A pout crossed her expression as if she were miffed Jake hadn\u2019t kept track of her.</p><p>He had, at one time. As an undergrad, he\u2019d chased her until his tongue dragged on the ground, but she\u2019d scraped him off in favor of richer prey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the divorce,\u201d he said politely. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m sure William is pleased to have your expertise. I imagine he keeps you busy.\u201d</p><p>She drew closer. \u201cHe does. But I can always find time for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to have a drink one of these days.\u201d Over her shoulder, he noticed Rainie heading for the drink table. \u201cExcuse me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Nadia rose up on tiptoes to kiss his cheek. \u201cLater, honey.\u201d</p><p>Rainie managed only a gulp of punch before Jake steered her away. Typical Dom\u2014he hadn\u2019t even asked if she wanted to dance.</p><p>Then again, slow dancing with Jake was almost as good as having sex with him. She snuggled closer. \u201cTruly Madly Deeply. I love this song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got them to play it? Is that why they played two slow tunes in a row?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his cheek against hers. Although his hands were positioned properly, he kept her plastered against him...and the half-erection he boasted. \u201cDid I mention that in high school, my friends and I had a garage band? I know from experience that a good bribe works wonders on a playlist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She breathed in his cologne, spice and pine, and melted even closer.</p><p>\u201cThis one was worth every penny since I\u2019ve been wanting to dance with you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019d like to find a closet and do more, but the staff\u2019s monitoring the private areas. Maybe the beach though...\u201d</p><p>Thinking he was joking, she laughed. \u201cYou are...\u201d The heat in his gaze made her swallow hard. Maybe he wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cUm.

His arms flexed into iron bars holding her captive.</p><p>\u201cI like your little whimpers when I\u2019m balls deep,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI like how your cunt squeezes my cock as you come.\u201d</p> <p>He was liable to make her climax right there in the middle of a crowd. As her legs wobbled, he laughed.</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d Linda walked through the dancing couples. \u201cSam says you\u2019re in charge of summoning the two limos for the newlyweds. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d With his usual impeccable manners, Jake escorted Rainie to the edge of the dance floor and kissed her fingers. \u201cEnjoy yourself, sweetling. I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said under her breath, watching him stride away. Jacob Sheffield in a tuxedo had to be one of the wonders of the world.</p><p>He made her feel so special when he danced with her. Talked with her. Laughed at her jokes and teased her. His gaze said he thought she was beautiful.</p><p>But... She winced. Mr. Politeness-Itself Sheffield had witnessed her tirade at the evil mothers, Mrs. Kouros and Mrs. Renard. Why hadn\u2019t he mentioned her behavior?</p> <p>A knot formed in her stomach as she remembered his ease with Gabi\u2019s parents\u2014and they with him. The totally snobbish Renards wouldn\u2019t converse with someone they considered beneath them. But he was at their level.</p><p>Her shoulders tightened. She hadn\u2019t missed how Jake attracted female attention\u2014like the redhead who\u2019d made a play for him, kissing his cheek and rubbing her breasts against his arm.</p><p>But he left her to dance with me.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Rainie.\u201d Like a witch materializing out of black smoke\u2014obviously summoned by Rainie\u2019s unhappy thoughts\u2014the redhead approached. Wine glass in hand, she gave Rainie an insolent scrutiny, making her aware of each hair out of place, of every bulge of her hips and stomach, of how her chin was round, not pointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard quite a bit about you tonight.\u201d The woman\u2019s snide tone established she wasn\u2019t applying to be one of Rainie\u2019s BFFs.</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d Rainie said evenly. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a thing about you.\u201d A feeble comeback, but better than none.</p><p>\u201cI can see how Jake would enjoy a woman like you for a quick fling,\u201d the redhead said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain appeal to fat and coarse, at least for a brief change in diet.\u201d Her flawlessly curved eyebrows lifted to complement a delicate sneer.</p><p>Rainie stiffened. What in the world?</p> <p>\u201cHowever, since I know the Sheffields, I suggest you don\u2019t get comfortable. Men rarely marry beneath their class, and you, my dear, are so far below you\u2019re barely out of the gutter.\u201d</p><p>Before Rainie could find a response to the unexpected vitriol, the bitch spun on her high heel and stalked away...back to the Renards, who were staring at Rainie as if she\u2019d crawled out of some lagoon for monsters.</p><p>After a second, Rainie got it. Gabi\u2019s mother had unleashed the woman as her own personal attack dog.</p><p>Turning her back, she fought the sickness trying to crawl out of her stomach. Yes, she\u2019d been rude to Mrs. Renard and Galen\u2019s mother, but only in defense of her friend\u2014and with good cause.</p><p>Being attacked for a background she hadn\u2019t chosen, that wasn\u2019t...wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Then again, was it fair in college when boyfriends like Geoffrey took her home, then dumped her after their parents disapproved? Was it fair when teens like Mandy had ridiculed her in the classrooms?</p><p>Or, worse, at the Sheffield\u2019s house? Tears pricked the backs of her eyes and burned in her throat. The redhead was right about the Sheffields. They were elegant. Refined. Cultured.</p><p>Rainie closed her eyes, remembering. As a foster child, she hadn\u2019t visited anyone\u2019s home, not until popular, charming Jennifer Sheffield invited Rainie to her birthday party. Rainie\u2019d worn her coolest, prettiest clothes and spent hours getting her hair and makeup just right. She\u2019d walked into the Sheffield\u2019s home, with her ugly backpack slung over her shoulder. In wonder, she\u2019d stared at the parquet floors, the antique furniture worn to a smooth patina, and the paintings with vivid colors and textures. Everything merged to create breathtaking beauty in a way she\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>And there had been another kind of beauty as well. Jake had been there.</p><p>Staring blindly at the dance floor, Rainie heard the song change to Nobody Knows it But Me. Could a tune get any sadder? Crying inside was right. She realized she was backing away from the music, from the guests.</p><p>At the Sheffield\u2019s, she\u2019d learned an ugly lesson\u2014that clothes and manners only took a person so far. When mean people discovered a vulnerability, like a distasteful background, they\u2019d tear away at it until the victim bled to death.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong to think she could stay. To love Jake. All her work to improve herself would be useless if everyone knew her past. And she\u2019d be Jake\u2019s vulnerability. Being with her could hurt him. She must\u2014must\u2014move away. But escape meant leaving Jake.</p><p>Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. Breathing through her nose, she forced the tears back.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d Beth appeared and took her hand.</p><p>Nolan was a step behind. The clean lines of his black tux emphasized his facial scars and the deadliness of his dark gaze. This Master was scarier than Master Sam. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-nothing.\u201d Her voice broke. Nolan\u2019s eyes narrowed, and she added hastily, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger under her chin, tipped it up. His eyes turned blacker. \u201cWho upset you?\u201d</p><p>Damn him for noticing. For caring. Tears blurred her vision. \u201cNo one. I-I\u2019m just...hey, it\u2019s a wedding. Females are supposed to cry.\u201d She took the tissue Beth handed her and wiped her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cFemales are supposed to be honest,\u201d he growled, and, to her horror, looked past her.</p><p>The redhead had disappeared\u2014thank you, God. But Mrs. Renard stood with two of her stuffy women friends. Watching. Gloating.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking Gabi\u2019s nasty mother was rude or did something, probably because Rainie gave her a few home truths.\u201d Beth leaned on Nolan and stroked his huge biceps through his jacket. \u201cOh, my most wonderful, majestic King of Kings, could you drag that woman out onto the dance floor and make her uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest, yet amusement lit his cruel eyes. He studied Rainie, the tissue in her hand, and returned his gaze to his submissive. \u201cI can, little rabbit.\u201d Without another word, he strolled toward the women.</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d Rainie whispered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Beth squeezed her hand. \u201cShhh, I want to enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>He escorted Gabi\u2019s mother to the dance floor, and his big hand completely wrapped around her upper arm.</p><p>The woman gabbled protests and was ignored. When her voice rose, he gave her a Master\u2019s stare. One the Shadowlands really should patent.</p><p>Mrs. Renard shriveled on the spot, mouth shut completely.</p><p>\u201cGo, Sir.\u201d Beth was giggling worse than Sally on her silliest day.</p><p>\u201cBeth, he shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should. Gabi gave the guys orders. If her mother caused trouble, a Master was to drag her out to the dance floor and go all Dom on her ass.\u201d</p><p>Rainie tried to laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabi\u2019s mom is mean.\u201d Beth squeezed her hand. \u201cWhat did she say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, really. A friend of hers simply rubbed my nose in an indisputable fact.\u201d One she\u2019d tried to forget. \u201cJake is rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family is.\u201d Beth considered. \u201cI guess that makes him wealthy as well. But he doesn\u2019t care about money.\u201d</p><p>Sure, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Beth\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some experience with these matters,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cJake might not be concerned now. After all, he\u2019s a guy. Guys think with their dicks. And a dick has a fairly short-sighted range of ambitions.\u201d</p><p>Beth choked on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut parents don\u2019t have the dick handicap. So if their beloved heir brings home a woman like me? One ugly scene ensues.\u201d As Geoffrey\u2019s family had demonstrated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJake\u2019s not the kind of man to give in to pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That was part of what made him special. \u201cBut, seriously, causing a family blowup isn\u2019t a good thing to do to someone who\u201d\u2014you love\u2014\u201dis so nice. Jake needs his family.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need me.</p><p>\u201cRainie...\u201d Beth protested.</p> <p>Rainie hugged Beth and whispered, \u201cThank Master Nolan for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>As Rainie stepped back, her escape path was blocked. The woman was a grandmotherly age, but this grandmother would turn heads no matter how old she got. It wasn\u2019t just the flawlessly made-up face and hair, and the exquisite ice-blue gown which set off her dark hair and gray eyes, but her sheer composure. Nothing would upset this woman.</p><p>When I grow up, I want to be her.</p><p>The lady had undoubtedly heard Rainie being a total crybaby. Wonderful. Rainie straightened her shoulders. \u201cMa\u2019am, may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes, you may.\u201d The smile was charming with a hint of reserve. \u201cI\u2019m Madeline Grayson. I believe you know my son, Zachary?\u201d</p> <p>Master Z\u2019s legendary mother? God, help me.</p><p>Rainie drew her shoulders back and pulled on her shawl of perfect manners. Etiquette, I got this. \u201cIt\u2019s delightful to meet you, Mrs. Grayson. I\u2019m Rainie Kuras, and this is my friend, Beth King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely to see you again, Beth. I thought the landscaping you did for the Leighton\u2019s beach house to be very fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Beth turned as the music changed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to reward\u2014uh, rejoin\u2014Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Mrs. Grayson tilted her head in a mannerism reminiscent of her son\u2019s. Only when Master Z did it, submissives tended to kneel.</p><p>Mrs. Grayson\u2019s attention turned to Rainie. \u201cZachary informed me you achieved your master\u2019s in business administration with a specialty in organizational management?\u201d</p> <p>Master Z had talked about her? To his mother? There were no words. \u201cHe\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe speaks extremely highly of you, as do your professors.\u201d</p><p>My professors? Why would she have\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re working in a veterinary clinic now?</p><p>\u201cYes. For Dr. Sheffield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping out, yes.\u201d Her smile was gracious. \u201cI did hear about Jake and Saxon\u2019s...problem...with office staff.\u201d</p><p>Rainie smothered her smile...and yet, she couldn\u2019t help defending the guys. \u201cJake and Saxon are superb veterinarians. Their failing was to not thoroughly check out a family recommendation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I spoke to Saxon about the lapse,\u201d Mrs. Grayson said mildly. \u201cNow...\u201d Her chin lifted slightly. \u201cAlthough Zachary recommended you, he doubted you\u2019d be willing to relocate. However, I overheard some of your conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Rainie felt her face heat. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Grayson handed her a card. \u201cI recently bought an advertising company in New York and am taking it in a different direction. Thus, several management positions will soon be open. Would you be interested?\u201d</p><p>New York? So far away from... Yet, she\u2019d always planned on moving, at least until she\u2019d started daydreaming. But daydreams were nothing on which to build a life. She had no future here. Not with Jake Sheffield.</p><p>And she refused to cry in front of this indomitable woman.</p><p>Rainie swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m very interested. However, I\u2019ve committed to the clinic until mid-February. I can\u2019t\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be fair to leave them in the lurch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d Mrs. Grayson gave an approving nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be interviewing for another couple of weeks, so you have time to decide. Since my son has infallible instincts, I think I can assure you of a position. Please do give me a call.\u201d</p><p>With a brisk nod, she glided away.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Rainie glanced down to see if the floor had disintegrated beneath her feet. She wanted to scream, do a victory dance, shoot off fireworks...and burst into tears.</p><p>How could she leave?</p><p>\u201cSweetling, are you all right?\u201d Jake\u2019s firm hand closed around her arm. He turned her to face him and ran his hands up and down her arms. \u201cI saw Mrs. Grayson with you. She can be a bit intimidating.\u201d</p><p>Rainie forced her numb lips to form the words. \u201cShe was...nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pushed her hair back, his fingertips leaving a wake of sensation, ripples that spread through her body. \u201cLinda is herding the guests to the entrance to wave Gabi, Sally, and the men off. Afterward, the place closes, and we\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She had duties. What was she thinking? Too obsessed with her own problems to do her job. \u201cI need to check in with Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s over there.\u201d He guided her toward the head table. \u201cSpend the night with me. We can pick up Rhage on the way.\u201d</p><p>Her whole life had changed in the last hour, from the redhead to Mrs. Grayson...and Jake didn\u2019t know. He still thought... Her heart felt squeezed between two abrasive surfaces, sending flares of pain outward with every beat. \u201cJake.\u201d</p><p>He spotted Sally. \u201cThere she is.\u201d</p><p>How could she do this to him?</p><p>\u201cMen rarely marry beneath their class, and you, my dear, are so far below that you\u2019re barely out of the gutter.\u201d</p><p>How could she stay? If she remained here, it would be because of her own selfish need to be loved. And she\u2019d wind up harming Jake. She couldn\u2019t hurt him. She would never hurt him.</p><p>Her life was drained out onto the floor, leaving a stiffening corpse behind. And she wanted the chill, needed the ice, or she\u2019d never get the words out. \u201cJake. She offered me a job. In New York.\u201d</p><p>He halted so suddenly she tripped. \u201cMrs. Grayson? New York?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cManagement. Like I\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d And you\u2019ll be free of the low-class woman who\u2019d ruin your life. Even if\u2014someday\u2014she grew enough to be equal to him, he\u2019d never move out of this state. Veterinarians didn\u2019t relocate. \u201cI\u2019m going to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving? Just like that?\u201d His hand dropped from behind her waist, and he stepped back. \u201cDecision made. No discussion?\u201d</p><p>The disbelief in his eyes stabbed through her ribs and right into her heart.</p><p>Jake took another step back. He\u2019d been thinking marriage; she\u2019d been thinking career. Last year, he\u2019d been butted by a ram. The massive animal hit, sent him flying, and knocked the air out of him so completely he hadn\u2019t managed to inhale for a good minute.</p><p>This was worse.</p><p>He stared down into Rainie\u2019s wide eyes, a compelling mix of green and brown that normally sparkled like a sunlit cypress forest. Fucking beautiful. Tonight her eyes were dimmed. Worried.</p><p>She should be. Jesus. She was leaving. Going to New York. Hell, Z\u2019s mama had probably offered a bonus for moving\u2014a few extra bucks to treat their relationship like an annoyance to be discarded.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Fuck, maybe he was the only one using the word relationship.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d She put her hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d The word tasted bitter. \u201cGuess I need to start interviewing new staff right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes. I told her I\u2019d stay until the middle of February, like I promised you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you an honorable...person?\u201d he said, and despite his care, sarcasm invaded his tone.</p><p>She flinched. \u201cIt\u2019s best for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Glad you had the brains to realize I needed someone to make my decisions for me.\u201d He removed her cold fingers from his arm. \u201cI believe that answers the question of whether you\u2019re coming over tonight.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clamped over further foolish words, and he strode away, leaving his plans, his life, and his heart behind him in a pile of ash.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>She might not survive two more weeks in the vet clinic, Rainie decided. At the reception room counter, she hit the backspace and retyped in the correct amount. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t screwing up the files as badly as the old receptionist, but only because she rechecked every entry three times.</p><p>With a sigh, she stroked the ancient, stick-thin cat snoozing in her lap, grateful for its jagged purr. Grateful for any comfort.</p><p>When Jake had walked away from the wedding reception two nights ago, she knew it was for the best. Because really, what did they have between them? He\u2019d been happy with her, sure, but he didn\u2019t truly need her. Any woman could give him food, sex, and someone with whom to talk.</p><p>She\u2019d been right to sever their relationship. She\u2019d found that out quickly enough.</p><p>At the reception, after waving off the brides and grooms, she\u2019d joined the exodus. In the parking lot, the nasty redhead had been talking to Jake. Laughing and flirting, she\u2019d gotten into his car.</p><p>Jake had driven away, redhead beside him, not looking back once.</p><p>She\u2019d hated him then, as pain had driven deep, deep into her heart. And yet...she couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>Rainie hit SAVE on the document and pulled up another bill. Considering the cruel way she\u2019d broken off their relationship, he wouldn\u2019t pine over her. Only...couldn\u2019t he have? At least for an hour or two? The hurt of seeing him with the redhead had been horrible. Even worse was the hurt of not being with him now... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The melody of her days continued, but the low notes of pain were only getting louder.</p><p>Poor Rhage didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. He\u2019d lick the tears from her face, sit in her lap, and try to coax her into playing with him. But holding the little dog was bittersweet, because Rhage had been the one to bring her to Jake.</p><p>Why, oh why, had she said she would work in the clinic these last two weeks? Every time she saw Jake or heard his voice, her heart shredded even further.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t leave until they hired someone else. Even if she hated Jake\u2014and God, she never could\u2014she had to be fair to Saxon.</p> <p>Okay. Okay. Get over yourself. Like the survivor she was, she straightened her spine and printed the last bill and put it into a folder, ready for Mrs. Atkinson to pay when she picked up her pretty, newly spayed cocker spaniel.</p><p>Rainie wrinkled her nose at the other folder, which contained her ideas for the clinic: Expanding into an emergency hospital. Stocking and selling specialized foods and medicines. Offering boarding. Streamlining the scheduling with new software. Improving the invoicing system and...enough.</p><p>She opened a drawer and tossed the folder inside. As with the suggestions for Bart\u2019s tow truck company, her notions for the clinic would simply die away, not wanted, not used.</p><p>Around her, the place hummed with quiet noises\u2014a complaining cat in the feline room, low voices from the treatment area, cupboards slamming in the pharmacy. The waiting room had emptied as the staff took lunch. Despite emergencies, Rainie usually managed to give everyone a chance to sit down and eat. Since she\u2019d come, the stressed expressions and general unhappiness had disappeared.</p><p>The clinic needed her. And she was happy here. Involved in everything. The animals added an incredible dimension of reward she\u2019d never known before. I don\u2019t want to leave.</p> <p>The emaciated cat in her lap rubbed her fingers, marking her with his scent as if to emphasize she belonged...here.</p><p>Way to realize that too late, Rainie.</p><p>But, even if she\u2019d known, she\u2019d still need to leave. To get away from her past.</p><p>No, she had no choice, especially since Mrs. Grayson had offered this big chance. In New York, she\u2019d make herself into someone better. Respectable. Classy. And she\u2019d never have to run into old classmates or be called a whore again.</p><p>At the thought, she smoothed down her jacket. She\u2019d worn her most conservative suit for its ability to deflect Jake\u2019s cold stares. If her clothing could only deflect the way her heart leaped at the sound of his voice\u2014and even his damned footsteps. When had she learned what his boots sounded like?</p><p>Swallowing the ache in her throat, she looked up as Jake strode out of the pharmacy room.</p> <p>\u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I help you, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his jaw tensed. \u201cCan you schedule an exploratory abdominal surgery, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Buckingham, Jed Parker\u2019s basset hound. Probably has cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Oh God. The elderly man was crippled with arthritis and lived in the country. \u201cHe will be all alone without Buck. His son lives in Miami and doesn\u2019t get over here often. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jake cupped her cheek; his thumb brushed away the tear she shed. And then he simply stood there, staring at her.</p><p>She put her hand on his wrist. Pushed. \u201cDon\u2019t, Jake.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t move. His piercing green eyes shot steely anger through her ribs, straight to her aching heart. \u201cHow can you leave, Rainie? You love it here. People share their personal lives with you.\u201d His gaze took in the Siamese curled in her lap. \u201cYou cry over puppies and carry cats around. What the hell will you find to like in some frigid advertising company?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, but the words didn\u2019t come out. She, who never had trouble expressing herself, was mute. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>He waited and then let her go with a disgusted noise. \u201cNot the first time I was mistaken about a woman,\u201d he muttered, picked up a chart, and headed to Exam Room Two.</p><p>Yes, you\u2019re wrong about me. He had no idea who she\u2019d been. How having her in his life would impact his own future, his relations with his family. She closed her eyes, feeling her emotions boil up out of control.</p><p>Why did he have to act as if he cared about her? He didn\u2019t. When he\u2019d learned she planned to move? Snap\u2014he\u2019d found himself another woman before even leaving the wedding grounds. He was rich and important. His world didn\u2019t admit her.</p><p>But...God, she hated making him unhappy.</p><p>\u201cMrow-ow-ow.\u201d The cat\u2019s complaint sounded like a feline buzz saw.</p><p>With her back still to the waiting room, Rainie checked her lap, but the Siamese lay sleeping. She stiffened. Had someone come in while she was talking to Jake? How had she not noticed?</p><p>Because Jake took up her entire world.</p><p>She plastered on a smile, spun her chair around, and saw Master Z.</p><p>He wore a white shirt and a dark gray tie that matched his eyes. She\u2019d helped Jessica pick the tie out a couple of months before. \u201cYou\u2019re in white,\u201d she said like a total dumbass.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d His eyes crinkled. \u201cI work with children, pet. A psychologist in all black is frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Right.\u201d She straightened, realizing he held a cat carrier. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica and I realized Galahad is due for his shots. Can you fit him in?\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, she brought up the records on the computer. \u201cHe\u2019s not due for another couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019m here now.\u201d He set the carrier on the counter.</p><p>Such a scruffy cat for a sophisticated person like Master Z. The huge feline had scars, ragged ears...and narrowed eyes. That was one pissed-off kitty.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve missed you at the Shadowlands,\u201d Master Z said.</p><p>God, she\u2019d missed everyone too. She struggled to get her dejected expression under control. \u201cIt\u2019s mutual.\u201d</p><p>When Rainie extended her fingers for the annoyed cat to sniff, Master Z watched. \u201cMy mother reports you plan to relocate to New York. Do you think you\u2019ll enjoy it there?\u201d His voice was relaxed. Just making conversation\u2014as if the Shadowlands owner had ever made casual conversation in his life.</p><p>\u201cProbably. Hey, if the city were that bad, your mother wouldn\u2019t live there.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an easy smile. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t reside in New York if her existence depended on it. Although she buys companies around the world, her home is Sarasota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Rainie felt despair slide through her again. Soon she\u2019d leave all her friends behind. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll adapt quickly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make friends easily, yes. But, Rainie, you and Jake seem good together, and you love Florida. Why did you accept my mother\u2019s offer?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard her talking with Jake. The...the snoop. Her mouth turned down, and yet, under his compelling silence, words slid right out of her. \u201cI have to live in a place where people don\u2019t know my past. And to become more...more. Besides, Jake found a better woman. Someone of...of his class.\u201d Of Z\u2019s class, as well.</p><p>He regarded her thoughtfully. \u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken, pet. I doubt Jake is interested in anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>Joy zinged through her and then dissolved in the light of reality. \u201cNo. I saw them\u2014I mean, I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>He considered her as those silver-gray eyes held her in place. Then his grin flashed, taking her by surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a wager, Rainie. If I lose, I\u2019ll pay for Jessica and Gabi and Uzuri to fly to New York and help you get settled in.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers closed on the edge of the counter. Have friends with her in her new place? She wanted that. The only thing better would be Ja\u2014 Stop. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bet? And what if I lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jake proves he\u2019s not interested in...the other women...before Friday, you\u2019ll return to the Shadowlands. And there you will spend the evening serving him with total trust and total submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>Jessica and Gabi and Uzuri. In New York. They\u2019d help her settle in, ease the strain of the move, relieve the loneliness.</p><p>But, what if she lost? Could her heart withstand another night with Jake? \u201cHe won\u2019t do it. He\u2019s interested in...her, and even if not, he doesn\u2019t want me any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave the decision to him.\u201d Z poked his fingers through the carrier\u2019s wire door to stroke his battered cat. \u201cI won\u2019t tell him about the wager unless you lose. If you do, you\u2019ll call me, and I\u2019ll explain the rules to him that evening.\u201d</p><p>Friends in New York. One more night with Jake. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Z\u2019s silvery-gray eyes met hers, trapped hers, and his voice deepened. \u201cRainie, you\u2019re wrong about who suits him. And who you are. And what is important in life. You think long and hard before you make a mistake.\u201d</p><p>His family had returned to St. Petersburg on Monday. On Wednesday, Jake took Saxon to supper at their house. The cook had outdone herself with preparing an it\u2019s-nice-to-be-home meal, then gone home to her husband. So the casual dining room held only his parents, his younger sister, and his best friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the talk of their European vacations swirled around him, Jake contributed absent-mindedly while fuming inwardly. Rainie hadn\u2019t smiled all week. Even the clients noticed. Mrs. Flanders had scolded him and ordered him to fix whatever was bothering her.</p><p>Difficult to do. Damn him for being an idiot and getting involved.</p><p>\u201c...Jake?\u201d Jennifer lifted her eyebrows.</p><p>Everyone waited for his answer.</p> <p>\u201cI missed that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into Nadia, and she said you two were dating. When did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Nadia?\u201d Saxon scowled. \u201cIs this why Rainie hasn\u2019t laughed for three days? You might have mentioned you broke up.\u201d</p><p>Fuck was the only word that came to mind. He ignored Sax to frown at his sister. \u201cSince when does having a post-party drink mean I\u2019m dating someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Rainie?\u201d his mother asked.</p> <p>No, fuck wasn\u2019t enough. Clusterfuck was more like it.</p><p>His mother didn\u2019t rule her children\u2019s lives, but she was an advocate of staying informed. \u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>No help for it. \u201cRemember Lynette, the receptionist Sax\u2019s uncle recommended? She screwed up the office so badly I fired her. Rainie has been helping out.\u201d He gave Saxon a flat stare. \u201cHowever, Z\u2019s mother, Madeline Grayson, offered Rainie a position in New York, and she\u2019s moving soon. I\u2019ll call in an ad to fill the receptionist spot tomorrow.\u201d He should have acted sooner but hadn\u2019t been able to face the task.</p><p>\u201cWell, that sucks.\u201d Saxon scowled. \u201cI wanted her to stay.\u201d He glanced at Jake\u2019s father. \u201cShe had Lynette\u2019s mess straightened out within a day, took on the staff schedules and the payroll, as well. She\u2019s been researching more efficient software. And she keeps notes on what\u2019s required to expand into an emergency hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you call her a receptionist?\u201d Jake\u2019s father laid his napkin beside his plate and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cShe just completed her MBA,\u201d Jake said. \u201cHer last job was managing a towing company. Since the owner hated business, she kept on taking on new projects. She\u2019s enthusiastic that way.\u201d Not so enthusiastic about relationships.</p> <p>But he couldn\u2019t escape the memories... Rainie surrounded by puppies. Coaxing a homesick cat out of the sulks. Dancing with heart and soul. Kneeling before him. Laughing with him.</p><p>His chest squeezed painfully. He\u2019d miss the joy she brought to everything she did.</p><p>Now get over it.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who thrives on multitasking is the perfect office manager for your clinic. If she likes that, she\u2019ll probably find a large company a tad stifling,\u201d Jake\u2019s father said.</p><p>Quite true. She didn\u2019t seem to care though.</p><p>As his mother poured decaffeinated coffee, his sister served the dessert.</p><p>\u201cInteresting name.\u201d Jennifer set a piece of key lime pie on Jake\u2019s plate and said, \u201cI knew a Rainie once. A girl in my class who dropped out. She ran away from her foster home, which made me unhappy because I wanted to get to know her.\u201d</p><p>Jake stiffened. Rainie\u2019d been in foster care. \u201cSounds like our\u201d\u2014my\u2014\u201dRainie. Why\u2019d she run away?\u201d And why hadn\u2019t she mentioned the running away part?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I heard some nasty rumors about the foster home she lived in. The man\u2014\u201d Jennifer grimaced. \u201cWell, there are always rumors. Like after that, Mandy said Rainie was staying with a drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>Mouth tight, Jake\u2019s dad tapped his fingers on the table. \u201cHow old were you at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. I was studying for my driver\u2019s license,\u201d Jennifer said.</p><p>Jake pushed his pie away, appetite gone. Then Rainie\u2019d been sixteen...and living with a dealer? His softhearted woman who cried over old dogs and their owners?</p><p>\u201cSo, big brother,\u201d Jennifer said, trying to lighten the table conversation. \u201cWere you dating this paragon of efficiency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not seriously or she wouldn\u2019t be moving to New York.\u201d He winced at the bitterness in his voice. With a forced smile, he added, \u201cWhich is as well. Her priorities differ from mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jennifer\u2019s gaze flickered over his face, and then she bit her lip and turned her attention to her pie.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d His mother\u2019s expression held sympathy. She\u2019d always been able to read him like a book. \u201cHow is Nadia doing with her job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jake said. \u201cShe\u2019s an excellent choice for Renard. One good snob deserves another.\u201d At his mother\u2019s choked-off laugh, he smiled slightly, remembering when he\u2019d thought Nadia exemplified the ultimate in womanly perfection. But young men grow up and learn to cherish the beauty hidden beneath the surface.</p><p>Rainie was beautiful inside and out.</p><p>Ignoring the conversation around him, he toyed with his pie and thought about Heather, his prior girlfriend. They\u2019d been good together, and she\u2019d been an easy person to love. He\u2019d missed her cheerful company, but...but not with this profound ache, as if he\u2019d accidentally sliced a hole in his chest.</p><p>When he heard Rainie\u2019s voice in the clinic, his body warmed, not with lust, but just...happiness. Seeing her with puppies, he felt like gifting her with a half dozen simply to keep that smile on her face. Always, he wanted to sit next to her and share in her joy.</p><p>But her glow had been missing since the wedding. He\u2019d done that\u2014or she had.</p><p>She was unhappy; he was unhappy. Couldn\u2019t she figure this out? Why wouldn\u2019t she talk with him, dammit?</p><p>The plate and pie he was playing with disappeared, and he looked up with a scowl.</p><p>Sax gave him a smile. He forked up a big bite of the half-smashed pie and popped it in his mouth. \u201cSorry, bro, but if you\u2019re not going to enjoy something tasty, you\u2019re going to lose it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Late the next night in a restaurant\u2019s private dining room, Jake sat back in his chair and listened to the other Masters and Mistresses talking. The various conversations were drawing to a close. The monthly Shadowlands M&amp;M dinner was almost over.</p><p>As the waitress set a beer in front of him, Jake smiled at her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a timid nod. Poor woman. While taking their orders, she\u2019d actually been shaking. But Z had eased her fears, Cullen had teased her, Marcus had paid her one of his silver-tongued compliments. Even Nolan had found a smile for her.</p><p>She\u2019d relaxed slightly...probably as much as possible when faced with all the firepower of the Shadowlands, let alone the conversational material. The argument they\u2019d had about blood-play would disturb anyone but a sadist.</p><p>\u201cAny more concerns?\u201d Z asked from the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cA small one.\u201d Anne turned to Jake. \u201cI heard Rainie is moving?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re down to two trainees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess,\u201d Jake said. \u201cTanner told me he\u2019s joining the Colton household. Only Uzuri is left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame about Rainie.\u201d Marcus frowned. His face was deeply tanned from his honeymoon. As he gestured, the wide gold band on his hand flashed in the dimly lit room. Gabi had told Jake she\u2019d picked a ring so \u201cginormous,\u201d every woman in Florida would see he was taken. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss the girl, and so will Gabi.\u201d</p><p>And so will I. The Shadowlands wouldn\u2019t be the same. Rainie had added a special flash of brightness and color to the club. And to his life.</p><p>He caught Z\u2019s gaze on him and stiffened. Much as he respected the owner of the Shadowlands, Jake didn\u2019t need his counseling.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, meeting adjourned.\u201d Z got to his feet.</p><p>Jake rose with the others and after the general round of farewells, he took his beer to the bar to finish. Wasn\u2019t as if anyone waited at home for him\u2014except for a small dog and two cats. Pitiful, Sheffield. After all, his \u201cblack book\u201d\u2014the cell phone\u2019s contact list\u2014was filled with numbers to call if he wanted female companionship.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, you\u2019re still here?\u201d Cullen\u2019s voice boomed over the noise of the television and nearby conversations. He slid onto a barstool beside Jake. Probably a month or so past due for a haircut, he had to brush his brown hair out of his eyes.</p><p>His dark red, button-up shirt fit him well\u2014except for some rather suspicious bulkiness under the left sleeve. Gauze bandages, perhaps? Cullen was an arson investigator\u2014not the safest of career choices.</p><p>Jake nodded at Cullen\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat got you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalling beam. Got a bit scorched before I knocked it aside.\u201d Cullen caught the bartender\u2019s attention and pointed to the Guinness on tap. \u201cBeer\u2019s a hell of a lot easier\u2014and tastier\u2014to swallow than pain pills.\u201d</p><p>Jake studied him. Cullen was probably well over two hundred pounds, but that wasn\u2019t his first beer. \u201cHow about I drive you home when you\u2019re done self-medicating?\u201d</p><p>Cullen drank past the foam to the dark brown liquid and heaved a pleased sigh. \u201cNo need. Andrea\u2019s out with friends. When I told her I wanted to overindulge, she volunteered to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Jake turned his attention back to his beer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cullen grinned. \u201cDoes this make me less of a man then? To ask my submissive for help?\u201d</p><p>Hell. Gunny would have said yes\u2014that a Dom should manage his own problems. Jake rolled his beer bottle between his palms. He wasn\u2019t sure he agreed; Cullen was one of the strongest Doms he knew.</p><p>Cullen\u2019s mouth tipped up when Jake didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWho told you a Dom couldn\u2019t show weakness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor in grad school. A Marine Gunnery Sergeant who served in about every war zone since Moses and had so many medals he could\u2019ve used them for weight lifting.\u201d Jake frowned, remembering his first sight of the battle-hardened vet. Jake had been maybe twenty-one? Young enough to hang on the Dom\u2019s every word. \u201cHe introduced me to the lifestyle. Mentored me.\u201d</p><p>Gunny\u2019d missed the camaraderie of the Marines. Missed having younger men to supervise. Upon discovering Jake\u2019s interest in BDSM... Jake grinned and shook his head. In hindsight, he realized Gunny\u2019d been delighted to find someone like Jake to train.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Cullen drank half his beer, and then leaned an arm on the bar top. \u201cNot a surprising stance considering the Marine mentality. However, I disagree. Much as we Dominants hate to admit it, we\u2019re human. You can pull off that infallible, invulnerable shit if the submissive only scenes with you occasionally, but the fa\u00e7ade will fall apart in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>Jake stiffened. \u201cYou\u2019re saying being strong is a pretense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. We are strong. We also get hurt and need help.\u201d Cullen glanced at his burned arm. \u201cLast I looked, even Doms lose loved ones or jobs or pets. We need to mourn. We get depressed.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSome of the best sex of my life was the night Andrea bratted me out of a black hole. I needed her, and she knew it.\u201d</p><p>Jake scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving is a two-way street, buddy. Don\u2019t deny your submissive the pleasure of being able to help you. Of knowing she\u2019s needed.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure of helping. His mentor had denied anyone that satisfaction, hadn\u2019t he? \u201cI\u2019m fine, Sheffield. Don\u2019t need help.\u201d Gunny\u2019s color had been gray, his age finally showing after his most recent heart attack. He\u2019d been crippled up. Jake had wanted so fucking badly to assist\u2014and been refused.</p><p>Was it strength that\u2019d kept the old Marine from accepting any support...or a kind of weakness?</p><p>\u201cThere he is. And Jake too.\u201d Andrea\u2019s slightly accented voice drifted across the bar.</p><p>Jake glanced over his shoulder, relieved at the rescue. Fuck. Seemed like his life since meeting Rainie had been a mess of confusion.</p><p>\u201cJake, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d Andrea smiled at him, then her Dom. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>Cullen pulled her between his long legs. \u201cJake just reminded me you\u2019re the best thing in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake is right.\u201d Andrea\u2019s smile softened into pure beauty. \u201cI love you, mi Se\u00f1or.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Marry me, little tiger. We\u2014\u201d Cullen swore under his breath and released her. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. I will.\u201d Andrea\u2019s answer was swift and sharp. \u201cMarry you.\u201d</p><p>Cullen\u2019s hands clamped onto her arms so hard she squeaked. \u201cSorry, love, but...you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes gleamed with tears, but her smile would rival sunlight. \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Cullen muttered. \u201cYou said yes\u2014you really did.\u201d His craggy face split in a huge grin as he pointed at Jake. \u201cYou\u2019re my witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it covered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo escape for you now, love.\u201d Cullen pulled his captive closer.</p><p>Grinning and trying to give the two some privacy, Jake spun on the barstool\u2014and came face-to-face with Heather. \u201cHey.\u201d She\u2019d cut her hair, he realized, and the brown strands curled around her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Jake.\u201d She took the hand he held out and kissed his cheek. Her scent was still lightly floral, her lips soft. \u201cI was at a convention in Orlando and popped over to visit friends here.\u201d</p><p>Of course, the Shadowlands submissives would be part of her gang of buddies.</p><p>\u201cWe arranged for me to drop Andrea off so she can chauffeur Cullen home in his truck.\u201d Her smile brightened. \u201cAnd probably celebrate their engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he agreed, hearing the sounds of someone being thoroughly kissed behind him.</p><p>When a person at the bar muttered sourly, \u201cGet a room,\u201d Cullen laughed. With Andrea tucked against his side, he kissed Heather\u2019s cheek, slapped Jake\u2019s shoulder, and was out of the restaurant in seconds.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Heather stared after them. \u201cI didn\u2019t even say congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they noticed.\u201d Jake took a drink of his beer. He was happy for Cullen, no question about that, but felt pretty damned sorry for himself. How pitiful was that?</p><p>But the woman he wanted had dumped him in favor of her career. And here was Heather, who\u2019d done the same. Fuck, he needed to reevaluate his handling of relationships.</p><p>He motioned to the bartender. \u201cWhat can I get you, Heather?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated before sliding onto the barstool Cullen had vacated. \u201cJust a diet soda,\u201d she told the bartender before asking Jake, \u201cHow is the clinic doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy.\u201d If they could have kept Rainie, they\u2019d have expanded. \u201cHow\u2019s your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Her smile was still sweet. \u201cI\u2019ve been promoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. I\u2019m sure you earned it.\u201d She would have. As a submissive, she\u2019d always given a hundred percent. He couldn\u2019t imagine she offered less to her career. \u201cYou look happy. Apparently, you made the right decision.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped, and her weight shifted on the barstool. \u201cI did. Although, I almost changed my mind and stayed, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jake watched her as he took a slow sip of beer. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was torn.\u201d Her hands opened and closed in her lap. \u201cIf you\u2019d said you needed me...if you\u2019d given the slightest hint that losing me would upset your life, I\u2019d never have been able to leave.\u201d</p><p>Jake straightened, winded as if she\u2019d kicked him in the gut. \u201cWhat fucking hint? I love\u201d\u2014when had the word turned past tense?\u2014\u201dloved you. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Gaze on her drink, she traced a finger through the condensation on the glass. \u201cYou know, we all love our family, friends, even pets. But, a person doesn\u2019t need a dog. They\u2019re not essential to happiness. It\u2019s not a give-and-take relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never treated you like a pet.\u201d Jesus.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She huffed in exasperation. \u201cBut people who start a life together, they rely on each other. Lean on each other. Know each other\u2019s weaknesses and worries so they can assist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou supported me. But...I never did that for you. I didn\u2019t make any difference in your life. You didn\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you nothing you couldn\u2019t get from a couple of friends and an occasional sex buddy.\u201d</p><p>Jake straightened. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know now. But at the time, that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She laid her hand over his on the bar. \u201cBecause you never let yourself show you\u2019re not invulnerable.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. What the fuck was it with people wanting him to be weak? \u201cDoms are supposed to be strong. Submissives want someone to lean on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I found a Dom,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he showed me what bothered me about you and me, Jake. It\u2019s that I never felt as if I gave you anything important. A relationship\u2014even a D/s one\u2014is two people growing stronger together than they would apart. Not one tree standing alone with another leaning on it.\u201d</p><p>Her smile wavered a little. \u201cYou know, submissives need to give just as much as Doms need to protect.\u201d</p><p>Shades of Cullen. Jake\u2019s brows drew together. Sipping his beer, he considered. Gunny had shown him how to dominate, how to flog and whip and all the various scene techniques. But...maybe, just maybe, his mentor hadn\u2019t demonstrated how to maintain a long-lasting D/s relationship\u2014because Gunny hadn\u2019t known how. He\u2019d had three divorces under his belt. Jake had figured the women couldn\u2019t take the stress of loving a professional soldier, but perhaps something more fundamental had been lacking.</p><p>Fuck. Jake met Heather\u2019s gaze. \u201cI did need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI eventually reached that conclusion.\u201d Relief and sorrow showed in her eyes as she rose. \u201cWe\u2019ve both moved on, but...friends?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lightly. \u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>As she walked from the bar, Jake watched her, seeing her appeal and sweetness. In all reality, their relationship might have worked if he\u2019d been different. But...the bond he had with Rainie contained even more potential. Was more fulfilling.</p><p>When Rainie left, her loss would gut him in a way he\u2019d never experienced before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSubmissives need to give just as much as Doms need to protect.\u201d Did Rainie find it easy to leave because she didn\u2019t believe he needed her? He closed his eyes.</p><p>She was a woman who loved fulfilling the desires of everyone and everything around her\u2014pets, friends, Doms. And her lover hadn\u2019t let her do anything for him. Fuck, I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>There was more to her moving away though\u2014a compulsion he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>But in order to get through to her, he\u2019d have to show her he needed her...and that he\u2019d fight to keep her with him.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a cold snap had blown off the Gulf, giving a bite to the moist air. A light breeze rustled the leaves of the maples as Rainie left her car and joined Jake in front of a popular Irish bar. She glanced up at him, relieved the strain on his face had faded.</p><p>The last few hours had been bad. Actually, they\u2019d had an easy day until late afternoon when a cop arrived carrying a bloody mess. Saxon and Jake had done their best to save the animal. According to Ceecee, they\u2019d tried long after most vets would have given up, but the dog had been too badly injured.</p><p>When Jake had come out of surgery, face set with misery, Rainie\u2019s eyes had filled with tears. He\u2019d started to turn away, then hesitated and said, \u201cI know after-hours isn\u2019t in your job description, but I\u2019m... Would you come with me for a drink? For company? I...need you.\u201d</p><p>He needed her. She could do something to help. Despite her sadness, her heart had been lightened.</p><p>When they reached the bar, Jake pulled open the door and smiled down at her. \u201cThanks for taking the time to join me.\u201d</p> <p>She fought back her first response, \u201cI\u2019d go with you anywhere,\u201d and offered instead, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>The crowded bar smelled of beer and frying food, with hints of cologne and perfume. From the corner dedicated to darts came a light thunk, then high-pitched cheers and groans.</p><p>Hand on Rainie\u2019s arm, Jake checked for a table.</p><p>She waited silently, cherishing even the smallest impersonal touch of his hand, storing memories for a future without him.</p><p>Jake ran his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re excellent company, even when quieter than normal.\u201d The sun lines at the corners of his eyes creased. \u201cMaybe because you\u2019re quieter than normal.\u201d</p><p>Jostled out of her melancholy, she stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re-you\u2019re insulting me? I was kind enough to join you and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>A roar went up from the crowd watching basketball on the bar television. Rainie glanced over, noted the scoreboard\u2014Miami Heat in the lead\u2014and added her own, \u201cWoot! Woot! Woot!\u201d She was totally going to win her five-dollar bet with Saxon.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a table.\u201d Taking her hand, Jake tugged her after him. His grip was strong. Warm. Familiar. And she wanted to hold on forever.</p><p>As he threaded their way through the rough-hewn tables, she smiled at various acquaintances. To her dismay, Mandy and Jefferson from her high school sat at one table. Her stomach clenched. Did they have to turn up everywhere?</p><p>It was as if they were walking, talking reasons of why she had to leave the Tampa/St. Pete area.</p><p>Then Jake stopped at an empty booth far too close to them. Dammit. She should have told Jake to pick a different bar. This one was far too popular with the locals.</p><p>Since flinging her arms out and screaming at the heavens, \u201cJust shoot me now,\u201d wouldn\u2019t help\u2014no matter how satisfying\u2014she simply took a seat across from him. At least her back was to the rest of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you folks?\u201d A waitress in jeans and a skimpy top appeared.</p><p>\u201cRainie?\u201d Jake prompted.</p> <p>\u201cA Frozen Mudslide.\u201d To Jake\u2019s raised eyebrows, she explained, \u201cIt\u2019s like getting chocolate, dessert, and alcohol all at once. Good for the end of a crap day.\u201d</p><p>When his eyes darkened, she regretted her words. Why had she been stupid enough to remind him of the dog\u2019s death?</p><p>But his smile reappeared. \u201cWomen and their chocolate.\u201d He nodded at the barmaid. \u201cMake that two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t work for you, dude,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cYou see, the soothing effect of chocolate is diminished by too much testosterone\u2014and I think you\u2019re at toxic levels.\u201d</p><p>Jake snorted.</p><p>As the giggling barmaid left, Rainie realized something. \u201cYou let me order. Without interfering or taking over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He leaned back comfortably, his long legs stretched under the table, catching Rainie\u2019s ankles between them. She tried to move, but his legs trapped her. And her hormones burst out of the gate like racehorses when the bell sounded.</p><p>\u201cI like being in control for sex, sweetling,\u201d he said easily. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t need to be in charge all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I try to put mushrooms in your eggs?\u201d Her last morning at his house, he\u2019d delivered a stinging swat to her ass as well as a lecture on why fungi were not to be confused with food.</p><p>His grin flashed in the dim bar lights. \u201c\u2019Tis most distressing when a subbie tries to poison her Dom.\u201d</p><p>Her Dom. He never would be again. \u201cMushrooms or not, making breakfast is not sexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is. Whenever a female is in a man\u2019s house, it\u2019s all about sex. Showering is sexual. Meals are sexual.\u201d He grinned ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a guy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, toxic amounts of testosterone.\u201d No joke. Every moment in his house had been infused with anticipation of being ravaged on the couch or fucked on a counter...and she\u2019d loved it.</p><p>To Rainie\u2019s relief, the barmaid interrupted the conversation to drop off their drinks.</p><p>Jake eyed his suspiciously. After a drink, he swirled the glass and drank again. \u201cGood stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rainie smiled. \u201cThanks.\u201d She took a sip, closed her eyes, and moaned appreciation for the sublime combination of chocolate ice cream, Baileys, and Kahlua.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, his gaze met hers\u2014hot with lust.</p><p>Her expressions of enjoyment stopped abruptly.</p><p>But, after clearing his throat, he returned to their conversation. \u201cSeems like your Shadowlands notes said you wanted a part-time Dom. Not a full-time one.\u201d</p><p>No, this would not be a topic they\u2019d discuss. Not when the subject increased her sense of loss. \u201cNothing I\u2019m going to worry about now, since it\u2019ll be a while before I get settled in and find a new club.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his jaw grew taut, and his eyes turned an ice green.</p><p>He still wanted her to stay. The realization tightened her throat. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. She forced her lips to tilt up. \u201cSo, what do you think of Miami Heat\u2019s chances against Orlando?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are changing the subject,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A man crowded their table. \u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>Rainie looked up. \u201cBart? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in Europe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He almost spit the word. His stocky frame was rigid with a fury she hadn\u2019t seen since one of their truckers committed a hit and run. \u201cI had to cancel our plans...to come back and save my business.\u201d</p><p>Cory must have made a mess of things. No surprise there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Cory\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slapped the table so violently the glasses rattled. \u201cI hired you when you had no references. Gave you a good salary. Responsibilities. Trusted you.\u201d</p><p>Wait...he wasn\u2019t mad at Cory, but at her. Her breath clogged in her chest. \u201cYes, you did. And I worked my butt off for you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, glaring into her face. \u201cSure you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Jake rose.</p><p>Bart ignored him. \u201cYou walked out the door the minute I needed you. No notice. Left my boy in the lurch.\u201d</p><p>When Jake stepped between them, Bart made a disgusted sound. \u201cYou aren\u2019t worth yelling at.\u201d</p><p>He stomped across the room, pushing people out of his way.</p><p>Rainie stared after him. But, but, but...</p><p>\u201cRainie.\u201d Jake sat next to her and tucked her into his side. \u201cEasy, sweetling.\u201d</p><p>Bart disappeared somewhere in the room. She couldn\u2019t pull her gaze away. The music and conversations were drowned out by the clamor of pain in her head. In her heart. He thought she\u2019d walked out on him. He\u2019d yelled at her. She put her hands over her mouth to hold back the sobs.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d With gentle fingers against her cheek, Jake forced her to look at him. \u201cBaby, I\u2019ve seen you remove the hide from two old dragons. This was just one man, and he was wrong. Why didn\u2019t you lay the truth on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is\u201d\u2014her voice broke\u2014\u201dhe was a friend. Gave me a job. Trusted me. Just like he said.\u201d Self-loathing poured blackness through her veins. \u201cI should have tried harder to work with Cory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie, his son attacked you. You didn\u2019t walk out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooo, is the whore crying?\u201d The whisper came from the nearby table of classmates.</p><p>Rainie stiffened as the comments grew louder. \u201cLook, Sheffield\u2019s got it bad. Is he pussy-whipped or what?\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull away. Jake shouldn\u2019t hold her. Shouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>His head tilted, and he scowled. His arm was an unmovable iron bar around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe rude assholes really do bother you, don\u2019t they?\u201d He tipped her face up again, but she closed her eyes to avoid the disgust that must be in his. \u201cBabe, they\u2019re fucking insecure, needing to drag someone else down to feel adequate. Ignore them.\u201d</p><p>What? Her gaze met his. He didn\u2019t appear angry with her. Or disgusted.</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cWhat did you think I was going to do? Toss you out of the booth in case your unpopularity with a few losers might be contagious?\u201d</p> <p>She barely kept from nodding.</p><p>He stared. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He honestly didn\u2019t care what her classmates said? He\u2019d called them losers. Her fingers were icy. Little tremors shook her body.</p><p>But Mandy and Jefferson were losers. She closed her eyes as the truth sank into her bones. She had friends, teachers, mentors who considered her valuable. Strong. Why did words coming from losers upset her so badly? Maybe her judgment scale was skewed if nasty comments from those she didn\u2019t respect weighed more than opinions from people she valued. Somehow, someday, she needed to think about that.</p><p>\u201cRainie.\u201d Jake squeezed her shoulder. \u201cThat old guy, Bart. He needs to hear the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Misery was a heavy anchor, dragging on her heart. \u201cHe thinks his son is a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm. He might hope, but I doubt he believes it. He\u2019s hurting because he thinks you let him down. You, he trusted.\u201d</p><p>Even knowing she should shift away, she couldn\u2019t leave the comfort of Jake\u2019s arms. She leaned her forehead against his chest as she tried to work out what to do. How did a person choose a path when each ended in pain?</p><p>But Jake was right. Bart thought she\u2019d betrayed him. Even worse, if he didn\u2019t comprehend the dangers of leaving Cory in charge, Bart could lose his company.</p><p>But...oh...facing Bart would be much more difficult than merely walking away.</p><p>This time when she retreated from Jake\u2019s embrace, he let her. She firmed her trembling lips. \u201cYou go on home. Thank you for the advice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d God help her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not facing him alone, sweetling.\u201d He rose and helped her out of the booth. \u201cI won\u2019t butt in, but I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blurred with tears. \u201cDon\u2019t be nice, damn you.\u201d She slapped his arm, knowing she was one small second from bursting into noisy sobs.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The lines fanning from his eyes creased, although he didn\u2019t smile. His knuckles brushed a tear from her cheek gently enough to make her heart ache. \u201cI\u2019ll work on being mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d broken up with him. So how could her love continue to grow and expand until her heart felt filled to bursting? How could that be?</p><p>As they wove through the tables, she spotted their destination in a booth under a bank of night-black windows. Bart and his wife, Tilly, on one side.</p> <p>Cory sat on the other side. Clean-shaven, groomed, suited up and looking like a Boy Scout\u2014except for his swollen nose still bearing yellowing bruises.</p><p>When Bart spotted her, he rose. Watching his face darken with anger was like taking a knife in the chest. When had she come to love the gruff old man? Why hadn\u2019t she ever told him?</p><p>Her regrets were like an echo in a rock-lined valley. Too late, too late, too late.</p><p>Cory saw her and stiffened. \u201cWhat the fuck is she doing here? Beat it, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCory,\u201d his mother gasped. \u201cLanguage.\u201d</p><p>Rainie pulled a shield around her heart. If she didn\u2019t speak now, she\u2019d never find the courage again. \u201cGive me one minute, Bart, and I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d Chin up, she held the old man\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Rainie.\u201d Bart\u2019s jaw was tight.</p><p>Behind her, Jake stepped closer, giving her the warmth of his body. Of his support.</p><p>Cory glared, malice coating his expression.</p><p>She swallowed and forced the words out. \u201cYou never knew this, Bart, but I first met Cory when I was sixteen and living with a drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drug dealer? Sixteen?\u201d Tilly gasped. Her face changed, worry filling it\u2014and Rainie realized it was for her, a teenager in a bad situation. Bart\u2019s wife had a heart as big as his.</p><p>Bart merely nodded. \u201cI knew. Lily told me.\u201d His bushy brows drew down. \u201cWhy would Cory have been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to buy drugs.\u201d This was like wading through a swamp of ugliness with the muck of her past dragging at her feet. \u201cThen he wanted to buy me for s-sex. Had a fight with Shi\u2014with the dealer and Cory ended up thrown into a dumpster.\u201d</p><p>She saw Bart and Tilly\u2019s expressions. Complete disbelief. It hurt, and her momentum faltered.</p><p>Jake squeezed her waist. \u201cGo on, babe,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>God, she loved him.</p><p>She forced her gaze back to Bart. \u201cWhen I got a job with you and realized Cory was your son... Well, it was an unpleasant surprise for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are full of bullshit,\u201d Cory burst out. \u201cBitch, I never met you before and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d The dominance that had made Jacob Sheffield a Master in the Shadowlands filled the air.</p><p>Cory turned pale, and with a jerky movement, slid as far away in the booth as he could get.</p><p>Well. The wonder of having her own hero at her back loosened her throat, letting her continue. \u201cThe day before I quit, Cory took over the scheduling. You know Larry tends the baby when his wife works, and he needs those afternoons off. Cory ignored the requested-time-off slips and scheduled him anyway. Larry had a fit, and Cory fired him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFired Larry?\u201d Bart looked as if someone had punched him. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most reliable ones there. Cory, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rainie continued, \u201cAfter I wrote out Larry\u2019s paycheck, Cory ripped it up and said he wouldn\u2019t pay Larry, even though he\u2019d worked all month. We argued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Cory snarled. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rainie never looked away from Bart. \u201cCory kicked me out of the office. That was on a Friday. The next night, he showed up at my apartment, and he was high on drugs. Probably coke. He told me...\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met Tilly\u2019s, and her voice closed down.</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t do this. Not to that sweet woman. Rainie tried to take a step back and bumped into Jake.</p><p>He put an arm around her waist, anchoring her against his side as he spoke to Tilly. \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this. Cory told Rainie that if she didn\u2019t give him a blowjob, he\u2019d fire her. He told her he could do anything he wanted, including fuck the staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No,\u201d Bart whispered. His eyes turned to Rainie. Appalled. Filled with pain.</p><p>\u201cI... Yes.\u201d This was like kicking a helpless puppy. \u201cCory grabbed me, and Jake punched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch! I never touched you!\u201d Cory jumped to his feet. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never met your asshole boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to break your nose again?\u201d Jake stepped around Rainie. \u201cSit. Down.\u201d</p><p>Rainie\u2019s knees almost buckled. Cory dropped back onto the bench.</p><p>Bart stared at his son\u2019s bruises. \u201cYou said you\u2019d fallen down.\u201d The color drained from his face, leaving his lined skin gray. He sagged.</p><p>As his wife took his hand, she was choking back sobs.</p><p>Oh God, what had she done? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bart,\u201d Rainie managed to whisper. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She hesitated and then fled, pushing her way to the front door.</p><p>\u201cRainie.\u201d Jake followed her out.</p><p>In the distance, thunder rumbled, and the palms lining the parking lot bent under the advancing storm.</p><p>Rainie turned to face Jake. Another person she\u2019d let down. He\u2019d lost a dog at the clinic, and he\u2019d needed her\u2014and she\u2019d used him. Ruined his evening with her own problems. She hadn\u2019t helped him at all\u2014because, once again, her past had returned. Hurting her. Hurting others.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a step back, distancing herself. \u201cThank you. Thank you for...for being here. But, I\u2019m not good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Rainie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMy choice.\u201d</p><p>As she walked away, she could feel the tie between them stretch and thin and disappear. The wind whipped at the tears streaming down her face, leaving only coldness behind.</p><p>Jake watched Rainie as she sat at her desk in the clinic. She looked like hell. Her color was so pale he could see the blue veins at her temples, the shadows under her eyes. She moved as if even her muscles hurt.</p><p>She\u2019d undoubtedly spent the night suffering for Bart and his wife. Yes, she was the type to take on that guilt.</p><p>Fuck, he wanted to hold her.</p><p>Instead, he opened the fridge, grabbed a couple of energy drinks, and handed her a can. \u201cYou need that. Drink it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him and half smiled. \u201cYour presentation lacks finesse, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou doing all right?\u201d</p><p>Her lips drew up into a wry smile. \u201cThe fact you fetched me an energy drink means I\u2019m not going to win Miss America today, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled back. \u201cPretty bright, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d She pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t braided or coiled her hair today. Not that he\u2019d complain. The way her hair fluffed over her shoulders made him remember burying his fingers in it. \u201cMmm-hmm?\u201d</p><p>Looking down, she opened the can. Turned it around in her hands. Finally said, \u201cLast night, you heard what my old classmates were saying, and I was surprised at your reaction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t beat them up for you?\u201d</p><p>From her startled expression, she hadn\u2019t even considered he might have defended her that way.</p><p>Now he rather wished he\u2019d mopped the floor with them. \u201cI don\u2019t try to defend against whispering. Open rudeness, yes. Behind the back is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, God, no, I didn\u2019t want you to... Sheesh.\u201d Her hands closed on the can, denting it. \u201cNo, I simply noticed you weren\u2019t embarrassed or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what assholes are farting about?\u201d</p> <p>At her appalled stare, he grinned. \u201cSorry for the crudeness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Right.\u201d Her fingers loosened. \u201cIt\u2019s just... When people don\u2019t like you and you\u2019ll never change their opinion, it must be nice to not really care.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes narrowed. Once again, he was realizing just how much she did care what others thought. \u201cRainie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cSo, can you fit in a walk-in?\u201d</p><p>Totally changing the subject. He glanced at the waiting area, nodded to the three clients who waited with their pets, and answered, \u201cI finished the buckshot extraction on the Doberman. So, yes, I should be able to take another.\u201d</p><p>The reception door opened and closed. \u201cJake,\u201d a woman called across the room.</p> <p>Jake let out a sigh. The day lacked only this. \u201cNadia, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I told you last night.\u201d She glanced at Rainie, and her lips twisted into a smirk. \u201cRemember? I said I\u2019d drop by to take you to lunch.\u201d</p><p>As the bitch\u2019s claws ripped through Rainie\u2019s skin and ribs and heart, she forced her face blank. What Jake did with Nadia was his own business. After all, he liked the woman. Had left with her after the wedding. Rainie should wish them well.</p><p>Not going to happen.</p><p>She checked her blouse in case blood was leaking from the far-too-accurate heart shot. When Jake didn\u2019t say anything, she looked up.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, he regarded Rainie...reading with a Dom\u2019s uncanny perception every single emotion she was feeling. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cJake, honey, are you ready to leave?\u201d Nadia asked, her voice thicker than cold molasses.</p><p>Ignoring her, Jake touched Rainie\u2019s cheek with a gentle finger, holding her gaze trapped for...forever.</p> <p>Finally, he straightened. \u201cNadia, last night when you called\u201d\u2014his glance at Rainie undoubtedly caught the surprise and relief on her face\u2014\u201dI said I didn\u2019t have time for lunch. Or anything else you offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jake.\u201d Nadia\u2019s pout took full advantage of her well-collagened lips. She gave Rainie a look of disdain. \u201cI certainly hope someone like her hasn\u2019t come between us.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave a short laugh. \u201cNadia, there is no us. I dated you years ago, before you married. I have no interest in seeing you now. At all.\u201d</p><p>The whispers from the waiting room clients grew audible.</p><p>Jake turned his back on Nadia, leaned a hip on the desk, and said to Rainie, \u201cThe lab work on Brennan\u2019s rabbit came back, and I need to change the antibiotics. Can you get the owner on the line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014of course. Right away, Sir.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked at her submissive slip, but he simply opened a folder and flipped through the contents.</p><p>The outer door made its distinctive hiss, and Rainie gave a quick glance up.</p><p>Color almost purple, head held high, Nadia stalked out.</p><p>The elderly man in the waiting room had his hand over his mouth, but his shoulders were shaking. The woman with the cat carrier winked at Rainie. The one with the poodle gave her a surreptitious thumbs-up.</p><p>Rainie\u2019s body hummed with amazement. Jake didn\u2019t want the redhead. Eventually, her fingers managed to bring up Mr. Brennan\u2019s file\u2014without any mental input, thank goodness, since her brain had taken an extended leave.</p><p>Annoyed with herself, she huffed out a breath.</p><p>And Jake turned his attention back to her. The power in his gaze made her hands turn clammy. \u201cProblem, Rainie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, Sir.\u201d Realizing she\u2019d called him \u201cSir\u201d again, she flushed.</p><p>The sun lines beside his eyes crinkled, and he bent to whisper in her ear. \u201cDid you know that each time you call me \u2018Sir,\u2019 you lighten my day?\u201d</p><p>The resonance in his voice shivered through her, and then he disappeared into the treatment area, leaving her staring after him. God, she wanted him so badly. Thank goodness, she\u2019d be gone before he sucked her into\u2014</p><p>Oh no. What had she done?</p><p>The blood drained right out of her head with an almost sucking sound. She must have moaned, since Rhage came out from under her desk to press against her legs. As her fingers teased his soft ears, she tried to swallow past a dry throat.</p><p>You stupid, senseless, slow-witted squid.</p><p>Master Z had got her. Got her good. She watched her hand reach for the phone. Punch up the contact. Wait. Don\u2019t answer. Don\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShadowlands.\u201d Master Z\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t be mistaken for anyone else\u2019s. His power sizzled through all the miles between them, probably making the telephone wires shake as violently as she was.</p><p>\u201cThis is Rainie,\u201d she said almost in a whisper. Pull it together. She forced her spine straight...and watched her fingers tremble. \u201cYou...won, Sir. The bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>He let her hang for only an eternity or two before he said gently, \u201cYou will come to the Shadowlands on Friday at nine. Tell Ben to notify me when you arrive.\u201d</p><p>Total trust. Total submission. With Master Jake. Her gaze instinctively lowered as she whispered, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>When Jake arrived at the Shadowlands, he swung by the bar where Raoul sat talking to Cullen. \u201cMen,\u201d Jake greeted.</p><p>He received chin lifts.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you needed time off,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. The Shadowlands held too many memories of Rainie. \u201cNot exactly. Z asked me to stop in and talk to him.\u201d And had refused to discuss the problem, whatever it was, on the phone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the back.\u201d Raoul nodded toward the rear of the club. \u201cNear the cages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jake slapped Raoul on the shoulder and headed through the room, walking past the various scenes, inhaling the scents of leather, light perfume, sweat, and fear.</p><p>With Jessica curled in his lap, Z sat in a black leather chair, watching a newer Domme practice with a flogger. He noticed Jake\u2019s approach and squeezed his submissive\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan you give us a few minutes, kitten? I don\u2019t want to put you in the position of keeping secrets from a friend.\u201d</p><p>Jessica frowned at him. \u201cWhat evil thing are you up to now?\u201d When her Dom didn\u2019t answer, she gave a cute grunt of exasperation, then rubbed her cheek against Z\u2019s in a pretty surrender.</p><p>As the little blonde walked away with one hand on her rounded belly, Jake took a seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming in.\u201d Z picked up his drink. \u201cDid Rainie mention our wager?\u201d</p><p>Rainie and Z? \u201cNo.\u201d Jake shut his mouth on the questions and waited.</p><p>\u201cShe thought you wanted to be with another woman\u2014one more suited to your class. I bet her that you would demonstrate her error.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cMy class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Jake scowled. Rainie must have seen Nadia at the wedding. Nadia was beautiful; it was true. But Rainie seemed more comfortable in her own body than most women Jake had met, small or large. \u201cWhat\u2019s this \u2018class\u2019 bullshit?\u201d</p><p>Z steepled his fingers in consideration. \u201cHas she spoken of her goals in life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s studied for a career in business. She wants a management position\u2014a high status one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why did she choose high status as a goal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what every businessperson wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more than all vets want to handle horses.\u201d Z smiled slightly. \u201cHer friends say she loves your clinic\u2014the animals, the challenges, the people. My question\u2014which she wouldn\u2019t answer\u2014is why she\u2019d give up a job she loves to do something else. And why she said she had to \u2018be more.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBe more what? She\u2019s already...\u201d perfect. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I. Which is why I made the bet.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, if Z made a bet with a submissive, the consequences could get ugly. Jake straightened. If Rainie were uncomfortable with the penalty, Z would damn well back off. \u201cWhat are you going to make her do?\u201d</p><p>Laughter lit Z\u2019s gray eyes. \u201cShe agreed to come here tonight to serve you in total trust and total submission.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Z rose. \u201cShe\u2019s in the dungeon waiting for you, Jacob. This might be a good time to get some answers.\u201d</p><p>As Z walked away, Jake stood...and sat back down.</p><p>She had to serve him. To trust him\u2014although she obviously didn\u2019t or he\u2019d know her background. She\u2019d been reluctant to tell Bart about living with a drug dealer. Jennifer had mentioned the streets. Foster care. Running away.</p><p>Most people were happy to confide their pasts, ugly or not. If Rainie was so reticent, was she...ashamed? He needed to know.</p><p>And goals. The assholes the other night had really bothered her. And she wanted to be more.</p><p>Jake stared at the wall. Z\u2019s bet gave him one night\u2014and there would be a lot to accomplish in only a few hours.</p><p>Planning came first.</p><p>And then he\u2019d get some answers.</p><p>Her knees hurt. Head down, Rainie shifted her weight from side to side. Behind her, someone used a paddle on their submissive, and the slapping of flesh was loud in the rock-walled dungeon room.</p><p>How long had she been in here, anyway? Had Master Z forgotten her?</p><p>No, he never forgot anything...except maybe a grocery-list item. Jessica\u2019s report that the Master could be occasionally absent-minded had been a surprise.</p><p>Because he was never inattentive in the Shadowlands.</p><p>Maybe Jake didn\u2019t want to see Rainie. At the dismal thought, she blinked back tears. Determinedly she turned her attention to the sounds around her\u2014the moaning from the other side of the dungeon, the clip of a Domme\u2019s heels. A sigh. A laugh.</p><p>Boots appeared in her field of vision. Black, scuffed at the toes. Black jeans.</p><p>Her heart lifted and actually bounced like a beach ball as her gaze rose. A heavy leather belt around trim hips. Broad shoulders under a black collared shirt\u2014one of the slim-fit kind that showed off hard pectoral muscles and his narrow waist. Jake. My Jake.</p><p>Only he isn\u2019t. Why did she have to keep reminding herself of the fact? Why did each repetition hurt more?</p><p>His top shirt buttons were open to show the tanned skin of his chest. His shadowed jaw was tight; he looked angry. Did he even want to be here?</p><p>She dropped her eyes before meeting his gaze. Unhappiness was a solid lump under her sternum. Don\u2019t cry. She dug her fingers into her thighs so the pain would drive her tears back.</p><p>The bare skin dented under her nails. Bare legs, bare ass, bare everything. When Master Z had led her into the dungeon, he\u2019d pointed to the corner and ordered, \u201cStrip completely, kneel, and wait for Master Jake\u2019s directions.\u201d</p><p>And now Master Jake was here.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re to serve me tonight with total trust and total submission,\u201d Jake said. She got nothing from his voice\u2014not sarcasm, not surprise, not enthusiasm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound like her Jake at all...because she\u2019d hurt him more than she\u2019d realized. More than she\u2019d thought possible. The last thing she\u2019d ever wanted to do was cause him harm. She bit her lip, wanting to beg him to understand that she wasn\u2019t the right person for him.</p> <p>But he\u2019d sent the perfect Nadia away. And come back and touched Rainie.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d He offered his hand to help her rise. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood to work you over hard, so this is fine timing.\u201d</p><p>A quiver of anxiety and longing lodged low in her belly. How pitiful that she\u2019d let him do...anything...just to have him touch her.</p><p>She followed him to the back corner. The wax play area was set up with a disposable covering on the bondage table. The heavy stone table next to it held a lit candle.</p><p>Wax could feel wonderful\u2014or hurt like hell if the Dom was in a sadistic mood. How angry was Jake? But he\u2019d never take out his anger on a submissive. He\u2019d call off a scene first...wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>She dragged her gaze from the flame to look up into intent eyes. \u201cYes, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal trust?\u201d</p><p>She winced and let go of her doubts. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir. I do trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust me with your body.\u201d He helped her onto the table and positioned her on her back with firm, impersonal hands. \u201cBut not with your emotions. Or your past. Or your future.\u201d His baritone had chilled to be as emotionless as his expression.</p><p>I don\u2019t like him this way.</p><p>Yet his quiet accusation hit the bull\u2019s-eye. The realization she\u2019d deliberately hidden herself from him\u2014from her Dom\u2014was a blow severe enough to make her tremble.</p><p>With deliberate movements, he pushed a wedge under her ass to tilt her hips up and wrapped cuffs around each thigh before clipping them to the side table hooks. As he tightened the straps, her knees were forced up and out to the sides\u2014giving him an open pussy playground, especially after he positioned her butt on the table\u2019s edge.</p><p>Another band across her low abdomen ensured she couldn\u2019t wiggle away from whatever he had planned.</p><p>When he applied a forehead strap, she barely kept from whining. Not being able to move her head made everything seem far too restrictive. More straps went over her arms, crossing both above and below her breasts.</p><p>He walked around the table, tightening or loosening the fastenings to an even snugness. \u201cYour safeword is red. For cramping, numbness, tingling, or discomfort you can\u2019t handle, use yellow. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her heart grieved for the affection missing from his voice.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He stood close, filling her vision and blocking out the room. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful, intelligent, loving woman, Rainie. Why do you think you\u2019re not good enough for me?\u201d</p><p>The question dropped out of nowhere, a tornado ripping up her internal landscape and stealing her breath.</p><p>She had no answer for him.</p><p>He gave her time to respond and then shook his head, letting his disappointment in her silence show.</p><p>Tears prickled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk to me, I might as well use this.\u201d After placing a squeaky toy in her fist, he gagged her with a black silicone pacifier. It wasn\u2019t as gag inducing as the huge penis ones, but the soft roundness filled her mouth completely.</p><p>Inhaling through her nose, she could smell Master Jake\u2019s evergreen-forest cologne. It was like a hint of freshness in the rock and leather scent of the dungeon.</p><p>\u201cBite down on the gag, if you need to,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cUse the squeaky toy to safeword\u2014or when you\u2019re ready to speak.\u201d</p><p>When. Not if.</p><p>His palm was warm against her cheek as he bent. \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to me, sweetling. The only question is how much you\u2019ll subject yourself to before that point.\u201d</p><p>At the terrifying determination in his voice, she involuntarily pulled at her straps, but she was completely restrained.</p><p>He leaned his forearm on the table, his face inches from hers. The stern set of his jaw reminded her of the steely core beneath his usual charm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in that head of yours, Rainie. But before this evening is over, we\u2019re going to explore it, even if we journey back to your birth.\u201d</p><p>She bit down on the gag. No way would she talk about her horrendous childhood.</p><p>\u201cTotal trust. Total submission. You\u2019re one of the most honest people I know, Rainie. You wouldn\u2019t renege on the bet.\u201d</p><p>Her mind went blank as she realized the depth of Master Z\u2019s trap.</p><p>When he paused, giving her a chance to respond, she told her fingers to squeak the toy, to talk to him. And everything in her stayed immobile.</p><p>He waited another second before brushing his lips against hers. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Rainie. You\u2019re going to tell me everything.\u201d His face was expressionless as he put a pair of sunglasses on her.</p><p>The room turned dark. Even worse, the lenses curved like magnifying glasses, distorting the surroundings like funhouse mirrors, enlarging objects and people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you eventually,\u201d he said softly, \u201cbut first I\u2019ll ensure the sensation is increased for both of us.\u201d</p><p>What did he mean? Was he planning to do chemical play?</p><p>He positioned a rubbery-feeling circle above her clit, extending almost to her anus. He held it in place with one hand. With his other hand...</p><p>The circle dug into her skin even as something seemed to pull on her clit and labia. There was another surge. The drawing sensation increased. And increased. And increased.</p><p>Unsure if the device hurt her\u2014or just scared her\u2014she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll leave it at this pressure for a while and see how you do.\u201d</p><p>Pressure. Her eyes widened. He had a pussy pump on her\u2014a suction device. Now she recognized the feeling. It didn\u2019t really quite hurt, but was extremely disconcerting, as if a giant mouth kept sucking on her entire pussy.</p><p>She looked up at his looming presence in her shadowy world and couldn\u2019t make out the features of his face.</p><p>His hands were warm as he massaged a light oil into her stomach and breasts. \u201cYou have the softest skin,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLike silk.\u201d His callused fingers scraped lightly as he rolled her nipple, making it peak.</p><p>A sultry hunger flowed to her core, adding to the sensations. Having his hands on her again was the most bittersweet of pleasures.</p><p>Jake idly caressed Rainie\u2019s full breasts as he contemplated her response. Her color had heightened. Her nipples beaded tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Knowing he needed to unsettle her quickly tonight, he\u2019d removed her ability to move, to speak, to see. Her pussy belonged to him, and the constant pressure from the suction device would enforce that awareness. But she was still too much in her head.</p><p>Time to up the game with the next step. He put wet towels on the stone table. A bowl of water with ice. A table knife. The candle had a stand to prevent accidents. His toy bag held aloe cream.</p><p>Lifting the candle, he visually noted the height before letting a drop fall on his inner arm. The pleasant splat was followed by a spreading warmth. Not too hot, at least for him.</p><p>He looked down at Rainie. The glasses hid her eyes, but with the curved lenses, the flame probably appeared huge to her. With consideration for her more delicate skin, he raised the candle an extra foot of height to ensure the wax had more time to cool. A drop fell on her shoulder.</p> <p>She jumped. Gasped in surprise\u2014but he didn\u2019t hear any sound of pain.</p><p>Using his fingertips, he pried up the hardening blob. Beneath, her skin was slightly pinkened. Just right.</p><p>And so he began.</p><p>Wax play was as engrossingly fun as finger painting in kindergarten. Even more than the artistic enjoyment in creating interesting patterns, he had the delight of using a woman\u2019s silky skin and curves as his canvas. Add to that his Dom\u2019s pleasure in taking a submissive up and up. He increased the heat, the amount, the timing, until Rainie was straining upward and yet flinching away from each drop.</p><p>Her face turned pinker. Her lips reddened with her arousal.</p> <p>Speaking of which... He set the candle on the table and assessed his artwork. White lines of wax crossed her torso, circled her breasts, and thickened on her lower abdomen. Gorgeous.</p><p>The quick-release on the suction device ended the pressure. He removed the cup and surveyed the results.</p><p>Her clit and pussy lips had puffed up to three times their normal size. \u201cVery pretty.\u201d</p><p>When he ran his finger over her beautifully swollen flesh, she sucked in a breath. Yes, she was much more sensitive. And her labia already glistened with her arousal.</p><p>Damn, he wanted her\u2014but he wanted all of her, not merely her body. Answers came first. At the head of the table, he pulled the gag from her mouth. The mini-dildo pacifier had cute bite marks in it. After wiping her lips, he pushed the glasses up onto her forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little dazed there, sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed and whispered, \u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>Even before talking to Z, Jake had wondered about the gaps in his knowledge of her. Her father, then mother had abandoned her. She\u2019d been in foster care. But...she\u2019d run away and possibly been with a drug dealer at sixteen. And Miss Lily had given her a home at seventeen. Wherever you are, Miss Lily, thank you for your care.</p><p>\u201cPretty Rainie. You\u2019re being such a good girl.\u201d Murmuring in a low voice, Jake stroked his submissive\u2014because, dammit, she was. He ever so slowly traced the skin not covered by wax to ease her into a calm state. \u201cThe wax looks gorgeous on you, baby.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed under his hands, her gaze losing focus.</p><p>In the same quiet voice, he asked, \u201cWhy\u2019d you run away from foster care?\u201d</p><p>Rainie\u2019s mind had taken up residence somewhere else. But with the question, a darkness slid into her, like a rain cloud over the sun. Foster care. \u201cMr. Evans tried to...\u201d Her lips had trouble forming the words. \u201cRipped my dress.\u201d Her borrowed clothes had made her look almost as nice as the popular high school girls. \u201cMy pretty clothes for Jennifer\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennifer? For Jennifer\u2019s Sweet Sixteen party?\u201d a husky voice said.</p><p>\u201cInvited me.\u201d To be invited to Jennifer\u2019s home was...beyond cool. And the house was sparkling clean, lushly beautiful. It even smelled different, like flowers and pastries. She\u2019d been late. Heard the sounds of people having fun when she came in. \u201cGo through the living room to the back patio, miss.\u201d Only halfway there, she\u2019d glanced in the door of a game room and seen...</p> <p>Her feet had simply stopped. \u201cLook at him...\u201d Surrounded by his friends, the boy\u2014no, the man\u2014moved with a lean power. Hair a shaggy brown, eyes a mesmerizing green. She\u2019d never seen a man so beautiful. So decent and strong.</p><p>\u201cLook at who, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...brother.\u201d Then the laughter started, right behind her. Horrid. Cruel. She flinched at the sound. \u201cHey, Fat Girl, who you looking at.\u201d \u201cJesus, she\u2019s staring at Jake.\u201d \u201cLike you\u2019d ever get him.\u201d She flinched.</p><p>\u201cTell me, baby. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ugly. Trash.\u201d</p><p>The voice held an angry edge. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenn...friends.\u201d Her legs shifted, but straps held her down. \u201cRun.\u201d Tears filled her eyes, a harsh sob escaped. Run, run home.</p><p>\u201cJesus, that\u2019s it.\u201d A calming hand settled on her legs. \u201cYou ran home\u201d\u2014the voice growled\u2014\u201dfrom my place, and the bastard attacked you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to nod. \u201cHe said I deserved it. Asked for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied.\u201d</p><p>At the snap in the Dom\u2019s voice, her head started clearing. What had she told him? Trash. She\u2019d called herself trash. Oh God. Her eyes blurred with tears, and she shut them tight. Let the world go away. Please, God.</p><p>Instead of more questions, he kissed her. \u201cI love your lips, sweetling.\u201d He kissed her again, tenderly enough to have fresh tears seeping from under her closed lids.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you cry.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to finish telling me the rest of what bothers you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth clamped shut...and he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou will. Because I\u2019ll push you to the point you\u2019d rather talk than suffer.\u201d He slid the glasses back on her face, cutting her tie to the world.</p><p>Her skin prickled under the cooling wax\u2014and her arousal had disappeared, although her swollen pussy throbbed. When she opened her eyes, he was only a giant shape in her distorted vision. A black body in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d The rich timbre of Jake\u2019s voice gathered her thoughts to him, holding her in his will.</p><p>She sighed, comforted.</p><p>\u201cTime for something new. Open up.\u201d With firm hands, he pulled her buttocks outward slightly.</p><p>Buttocks. Wait. \u201cUhhh.\u201d She squeezed her muscles to prevent the intrusion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done this before, sweetling, and you enjoy it.\u201d He held her open, and the feel of his hands on her bottom, the acknowledgment of his complete control, sent a wash of desire through her.</p><p>As he pushed the slickened plug against her anus, her rectal muscles fought and lost. In it went, stretching her. Nerves sizzled to life around the anal rim, somehow connecting with her core and sending heat boiling upward.</p><p>A second later, the pump ring once again covered her pussy. The suction started, fattening her labia, sucking on her clit. The pressure increased, more and more, higher than before. Her entire lower half grew stretched and throbbingly taut.</p><p>The sounds from other scenes in the room drifted to her. Murmurs and groans. The harsh smack of a flogger. The lighter slaps of a cane. Through the dark glasses, she saw Master Jake, taller than trees, and his broad shoulders and chest blocked out the wall behind him.</p><p>He flattened his palm on her belly, and his fingers lingered on the bare places between the lines of wax. \u201cYour pussy is getting slick and puffy, sweetling,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI plan to take you hard afterward.\u201d</p><p>A tremor ran through her at the carnal promise in his voice. The air itself had grown smolderingly thick.</p><p>The flickering flame of a candle rose like a sunrise into her field of vision. And then the first spatter of wax. A second later, fire blossomed under her skin.</p><p>In exquisite slowness, he drizzled more wax over her stomach and upward to her breasts. Her body tensed with the effort of anticipating each new drop, each new fiery stream. Her pussy throbbed; her anus burned.</p><p>She was panting, groaning. More wax.</p><p>A pause. Her muscles tensed.</p><p>More wax. The thick pleasure of the heat.</p><p>Up and up, she rose, and somehow, somewhere, something snipped her balloon loose and she floated free. Drifting. The bite of hot wax hitting her skin faded into the sensation of warm rain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby.\u201d The subterranean murmur felt part of her, as if the voice had flowered from the warmth impregnating her skin.</p><p>Lips touched hers. The light scent of forest drifted to her, reminding her of safety and strength. A face brushed hers, the beard a scrape against her cheek. \u201cMiss Lily took you in.\u201d</p><p>Were they talking about something? She tried to think, failed, and her worries slid out from under her reason.</p><p>\u201cYou said you need to be more. Did Miss Lily tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Sweet Miss Lily. \u201cWatch your posture, Rainie.\u201d Frail Miss Lily sipped her tea, her spine ramrod straight, not touching the back of the chair. \u201cKnees together.\u201d Rainie carefully crossed her legs, only at the ankles, to form a pleasing line. \u201cToo much cleavage is for tramps; you are a lady.\u201d \u201cDon your jewelry, and then remove a piece.\u201d \u201cAct like a lady.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t swear. No one loves a trashy woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rainie heard herself whispering the rules.</p><p>The slow slide of a deep voice murmured. \u201cHell. She thought she was helping\u2014and instead she overdid it, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>She got another kiss. So light that her thoughts floated again.</p><p>Sweet Miss Lily. She could almost smell the elderly woman\u2019s lavender, feel her soft wrinkled cheek. \u201cShe loved me.\u201d Rainie\u2019s lips curved up as she soaked in the memory.</p> <p>Question. A question hovered in her mind, whispered by a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, sweetling.\u201d</p><p>Question. \u201cGeoffrey\u2019s family didn\u2019t like me. Said I was coarse. And heavy.\u201d The hurt dug into her like sharp claws. She pulled in a breath, blinking.</p><p>Her world changed, came clear.</p><p>Holding the dark glasses, Jake leaned down to her. His eyes were sharper than lasers. The forehead strap kept her from looking away from his hard face. \u201cAbandoned by your parents, attacked in foster care, criticized by your mentor, dumped by your wimpy boyfriend. No wonder your thinking got screwed up.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth worked, but nothing escaped. She\u2019d...told him that? Fragments of her own words drifted through her memory, leaving her more naked than any lack of clothing would.</p><p>\u201cYou figure you have to make yourself over in order to be loved?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cI do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have to be smooth and put together and polished and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Sweetheart, you\u2019re not expected to change yourself.\u201d He cupped his hands on each side of her face. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to find someone who likes you as you are.\u201d His jaw was so tense he had trouble speaking. \u201cThe rest is just...polish...like you said, but not who you really are, Rainie.\u201d</p><p>Not who she was?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like clothes\u2014sometimes you dress up for an occasion. But, sweetling, friends like you no matter what you wear. The man who loves you will adore you without any polish...or clothes.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him.</p><p>His lips curved. \u201cAs it happens, I love you naked.\u201d</p><p>A second later, he stepped back.</p><p>And wax splashed on her stomach, up over a breast and down again. Over and over. The heat flared along her skin and through her, growing, blossoming, until she floated away in a cloud of sensation.</p><p>Jake stopped to survey his work. Rainie\u2019s body was covered in a light sweat, and the wax glowed in the dungeon lights.</p><p>He felt as if he\u2019d been dragged behind a truck for a few miles, yet exhilarated at the progress they\u2019d made. Fuck, she\u2019d had a hell of a childhood. Everyone had let her down. In a way, he\u2019d been part of her trauma. That ugly revelation still grated through his system.</p><p>She\u2019d seen him at Jennifer\u2019s party.</p><p>He\u2019d have been near twenty-one, just starting to explore BDSM with his mentor, and thinking about enlisting. Hell, if only he\u2019d met her that day, what might he have spared her? Regret bit at him.</p> <p>But if he\u2019d met her then...if she\u2019d managed to avoid the heartbreak and trauma, would she be the same woman?</p><p>All her friends and even his clinic clients poured out their life stories...because she listened without judging. Because compassion was a river running through her so strongly that anyone who knew her could feel it.</p><p>He had to think destiny had set Rainie\u2019s feet on her path. And, being the amazing person she was, she\u2019d climbed higher than anyone could imagine.</p><p>Dammit, though... Thinking about what she\u2019d been through made him growl. Even her beloved mentor had messed with her head. With the best of intentions, Miss Lily had tried to redesign a brilliant spirit rather than teaching her the difference between internal and external appearances.</p><p>He sighed. One scene wouldn\u2019t address those insecurities of hers. They\u2019d have to come back to this often. If fact, he should talk her into some counseling as well.</p><p>As he ran his hand through his hair, he decided to sign himself up for a bit of therapy too. Damned if he didn\u2019t have a few problems to work through himself.</p><p>Heather\u2019d been quite clear. \u201cIf you\u2019d said you needed me...if you\u2019d given the slightest hint that losing me would upset your life, I\u2019d never have been able to leave.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice.</p><p>Jake picked up Rainie\u2019s hand. \u201cSweetling, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had glazed again. Good. She had no defenses to keep his request, his plea, from sliding in deep. She\u2019d hear him true. \u201cRainie, I love you, just the way you are. Please don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d she whispered. Her hazel eyes started to clear, to focus on his face. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, sweetheart. Stay here. With me.\u201d If he could, he\u2019d relocate with her, but he and Saxon owned the clinic together.</p><p>\u201cNeed me?\u201d Rainie\u2019s brow puckered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clamped down. Had he been wrong about what she felt?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good for you. Hurt your future. When I\u2019m more. Better\u2014\u201d</p><p>He had to blink away the tears. Jesus, he\u2019d been an idiot. Not good for him? \u201cYou\u2019re perfect, sweetling. Everything I need in a woman. I don\u2019t want you to change.\u201d</p><p>And next time he asked her to do a list of her strengths and weaknesses, he\u2019d write out his own...and share.</p><p>His words slid between the clouds and streaked down like lightning bolts into Rainie\u2019s soul. She blinked, unsure if she was really looking at him. But he stood beside her, his eyes brilliantly green. And then he kissed her.</p><p>Oh yes, it was Jake.</p><p>When he lifted his head, she blinked as the world and the evening spun into focus. The dungeon. Her bet. His vow.</p><p>\u201cRainie, I love you, just the way you are. Please don\u2019t leave me.\u201d He\u2019d said he loved her.</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>Her breasts were prickling as the wax cooled. Her skin was tingling and throbbing with heat, as if someone had turned the thermostat of her sensations up to the top.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, baby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She did. She really did.</p><p>He grinned and put the dark glasses on her. And lifted something long and shiny from the table.</p><p>It wavered, ballooned, curved in the distorting glasses\u2014but she knew he held a knife.</p><p>Her insides wanted to flinch, but she breathed out and closed her eyes. He\u2019d never hurt her. Not Jake.</p><p>The blade burned as it touched her upper breast\u2014and she stiffened with a surge of panic. He was burning her, branding her, cutting her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t. A second later, she realized the burn was...cold. The knife was cold. And wet. \u201cYou sadistic jerk.\u201d Her voice came out hoarse.</p><p>The sound of his easy laugh was like sunlight breaking through a morning fog.</p><p>Piece by piece, he pried the wax off her, forming small piles to the sides, and the slow scrape of the knife was incredibly erotic.</p><p>The glasses and straps came off. He disengaged the pussy pump and removed the anal plug. Every cell in her body, inside and out, was exquisitely sensitive and quivering.</p><p>\u201cUp you come.\u201d Without any sign of effort, he carried her to a couch in the dim dungeon corner.</p><p>Sprawled on top of him, she relaxed into his embrace. God, she\u2019d missed him so, so much. His arms were hard, safe. When she rubbed her cheek against his shoulder, his scent pulled at her as if she were coming home\u2014coming home in a way she\u2019d not ever had.</p><p>\u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Rainie. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>How could she leave him? But, she couldn\u2019t stay. She wasn\u2019t good enough\u2014no, she was. He didn\u2019t want someone else. Just her. And she loved him\u2014completely. Her voice cracked as she reached out for what life held. \u201cI-I want to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>The happiness lightened his eyes. Her tears started again. He really did need her.</p><p>He kissed her, a velvety brush of his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll assist you with your polish, if that\u2019s what you want. As long as you don\u2019t change the wonderful person you are inside.\u201d</p><p>A sob broke free.</p><p>His thumb wiped her tears away. \u201cI can help you find a fancy corporate job here\u2014although losing you will devastate our staff and clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your clinic,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen stay. Stay at the clinic. And stay with me, Rainie.\u201d</p><p>Her heart kept expanding faster than she could tolerate, pushing on her ribs and filling her with joy. Her words bubbled up and out. \u201cI love you, Jake.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure hit his eyes first, then his lips curved. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time to hear that.\u201d He kissed her, slowly, possessively, and staked his claim thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cNow, for something else I\u2019ve been anticipating.\u201d His gaze heated as he leaned back on the arm of the couch and positioned her to straddle his groin.</p><p>Every wiggle rubbed her acutely swollen pussy against him. He urged her to kneel up as he undid his pants and sheathed himself with a condom.</p><p>Holding her gaze with his, he put his cock between her puffy labia. Although she was slickly wet, the pressure of his iron-hard erection on her abused, suction-distended tissues made her hiss.</p><p>\u201cYes, this\u2019ll be fun,\u201d he murmured, a wicked glint in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be even tighter than normal.\u201d He gripped her hips, firmly pulling her down onto his thick cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he entered her, all steel and velvet and heat, the sensations swamped her mind, arched her back. With a merciless grip, he prevented her instinctive attempt to push away.</p><p>His added demonstration of control sent another surge of heat to her center. Slowly, inexorably, he sheathed himself completely.</p><p>\u201cUuuuhh.\u201d The moan escaped, the penetration through her tender labia almost more than she could take. His fingers tightened on her ass, holding his throbbing length inside her.</p><p>She leaned forward, her palms on his chest, looking down at his wonderful face as gradually the discomfort transformed into a wonderful, dawning hunger. She squirmed uncontrollably, straining against his hold...and realizing that her extremely swollen clit rubbed wonderfully on his groin.</p> <p>\u201cSay this to me, Rainie: \u2018I\u2019m perfect just as I am. I don\u2019t need to change to be loved.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stared at him in disbelief and increasing frustration. \u201cDude, this is sex, not psychotherapy.\u201d</p><p>His deep, hearty laughter was the most gorgeous sound in the world, filling the hollows in her soul to overflowing. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who likes efficiency, baby.\u201d His chin lifted, and his compelling gaze melted her objections faster than the wax had dripped from the candle. \u201cSay. It.\u201d</p><p>The words slid from her. \u201cI\u2019m perfect just as I am. I don\u2019t need to change to be loved.\u201d Then she wiggled her hips, making him laugh again. \u201cNow let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect just as I am. I don\u2019t need to change to be loved.\u201d She huffed out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to have doubts about your perfection, though.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he let her struggle to pull herself up. Her eyes half-closed at the hot slide of his cock. Thighs straining, she stopped near the top, quivering with him barely inside her.</p><p>And then he yanked her down so rough and fast, a mini-climax pulsed through her, leaving her surging with need.</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaaake.\u201d Was that whine hers? Her skin was searing hot, sending off heat waves into the room. Her clit throbbed, her insides burned, and\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m perfect just as I am. I don\u2019t need to change to be loved.\u201d And then she added two more of the damned affirmations for extra measure.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Chuckling, he gave her three magnificent thrusts that almost sent her over.</p> <p>\u201cPlease...\u201d At his raised eyebrows, she chanted, \u201cI\u2019m perfect just as I am. I don\u2019t need to change to be loved.\u201d Over and over.</p><p>\u201cLouder.\u201d He lifted her slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect just as I am. I don\u2019t need to change to be loved. I do need to hit my Master really hard. I\u2019m perfect just as I am.\u201d</p><p>His laugh made her insides quiver.</p><p>He moved, finally, finally. Up, down.</p><p>A coil of pressure grew inside her, a burgeoning upsurge of release rushing toward the beach. The tsunami of sensation was terrifying in its size and strength\u2014and his thrusts quickened.</p><p>God, God, God.</p><p>Just as the tidal wave rose and rose, he gripped her hips and pushed her up off his erection. Holding her there on the peak. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes opened. Every muscle in her body was rigid.</p><p>\u201cRainie, I love you. I love you just the way you are.\u201d His lips curved, and he jerked her down on his cock, burying himself so deeply she felt possessed by infinity.</p><p>And the climax slammed into her and through her and around her in such a massive fireworks of exquisite sensation that even her cries of pleasure held her answer, \u201cI love you, love you, love you.\u201d</p><p>Eyes closed, Jake lay on the dungeon room couch with the softest, roundest woman in the world on top of him. Satiation radiated through him like a Florida sun in July. Eventually\u2014perhaps sometime tonight\u2014he planned to stand up. Clean the equipment. Get his woman home.</p><p>Right now, he was disinclined to budge.</p><p>From somewhere nearby, a sound drifted to him.</p><p>The noise repeated and settled into something recognizable. A man was courteously clearing his throat.</p><p>Jake opened his eyes.</p><p>Z stood near the couch, a faint smile on his face as he gazed at Rainie\u2019s immobile form.</p><p>Politely, he handed Jake a bottle of water before draping a fluffy blanket over Rainie\u2019s bare back and butt. \u201cPeggy will clean up the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cNo need to move anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>The Dom was a saint.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Z.\u201d Jake ran his hand through Rainie\u2019s silky hair and let his fingers curve around her nape. The surge of possessiveness was disconcerting...but fucking nice. \u201cBy the way, I appreciate the talk we had...and the bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Z tilted his head slightly. \u201cShould I assume I lost another trainee from the program?\u201d</p><p>Rainie lifted up, her gaze on Jake\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, Z.\u201d He touched her cheek and smiled into her joyful eyes. \u201cThis submissive is mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jake is here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his mother\u2019s voice, Jake grunted and looked up from the paperwork on his desk. \u201cIt can\u2019t be seven already.\u201d</p><p>She strolled into his clinic office, attired in tan casual slacks and a tailored silk top. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so, my darling.\u201d</p><p>His father and Jennifer filled the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, J. I\u2019m starving,\u201d his sister announced.</p><p>He grinned at the nickname they\u2019d shared through childhood and tossed his pen on the desk. \u201cMe, too, J. Did Rainie let you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCeecee did. She was on her way out,\u201d his father said. His gaze took in the papers neatly stacked in the inbox and the pile of stamped envelopes with letters awaiting his signature. Approval accompanied his nod. \u201cVery tidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie\u2019s work.\u201d Jake rose. \u201cShe must be in the back. If you wait here, I\u2019ll grab her and we can go.\u201d</p><p>In the hallway, he heard footsteps trailing him, and he grinned. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t wait. His mother\u2019s curiosity about Rainie had peaked\u2014thus the maternal directive that they all go out for dinner.</p><p>He passed the feline room and entered the larger room containing the dog kennels.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>To his surprise, raised voices\u2014Rainie\u2019s and one of the new kennel attendants\u2014came from the small supply room.</p><p>Rainie stood in the doorway, her back to Jake. \u201cDr. Sheffield pays the staff to care for the animals. That means the cages are kept clean, the food and water dishes full.\u201d Her hands braced on her hips. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been doing, Duke, but it sure isn\u2019t your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, c\u2019mon, Rainie. So I slipped up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dogs are sick. Their recovery depends on them getting the basics. Food, clean kennels, water\u2014attention. That\u2019s not much to ask. Because of you, we let them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, cut me a break. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIf you screw-off during the honeymoon period of a new job, you\u2019ll be a total loss later. I\u2019m afraid this is a difficult way to learn about consequences, but you\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s mom whispered, \u201cNow there\u2019s a natural mother.\u201d His father rumbled his agreement.</p><p>Despite his anger at the asshole attendant, Jake smothered a grin. Way to go, sweetling.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you can\u2019t fire me,\u201d Duke sputtered.</p><p>\u201cI can. I did.\u201d When she shook her head, her previously French-braided hair spilled down her back...because she\u2019d spent her break playing with a litter of kittens. \u201cNone of us have time to monitor you constantly. Head on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to sack me. Hell, this place never has adequate staff\u2014you going to shovel shit yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Jake and Saxon hired me. Because I\u2019m good enough to have on hand half-a-dozen workers eager to fill in.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cYour position will be filled five minutes after you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>She motioned toward the employee lockers. \u201cCollect your things and meet me at the front. I\u2019ll write out your check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch. Just because you fuck the boss, you figure he won\u2019t dump you when he finds someone prettier?\u201d</p><p>She paused in the act of turning. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think he will. He loves me.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cAnd I love him\u2014enough to fire your worthless ass.\u201d</p><p>Now that last sounded like his woman. Jake grinned...and blinked his eyes. A guy didn\u2019t tear up in front of a younger sister.</p><p>Mouth set in anger, Rainie had taken four steps when she spotted Jake...and the people behind him. Oh no, no, no. She stopped dead. Jake\u2019s family couldn\u2019t have missed hearing her argument with Duke.</p><p>Not fair. Totally not fair. Rainie glanced around. No escape route in sight. Where was a good hole in the floor when a girl needed one?</p><p>A quick glance told her life could truly get worse. Jake\u2019s sister was beautiful, and his mother was one of those women who always looked perfectly put together.</p><p>Rainie\u2019s slacks bore muddy tracks from a Jack Russell that liked to jump. A huge mottled print decorated her left thigh where a Great Dane\u2019d planted a paw to remind her to pet him. Her hair was straggling down her shoulders. A scratch had bloodied one sleeve of her white shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDid you all just arrive?\u201d Please, let them have just walked into the kennel area.</p><p>Laughter filled Jake\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think we caught most of the show.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps sounded behind her, and Duke appeared.</p><p>\u201cDuke.\u201d Jake\u2019s voice chilled. \u201cGo out the back. Your rudeness to Ms. Kuras eradicated the courtesy of a quick paycheck. It will be mailed.\u201d</p> <p>Duke opened his mouth, thought twice, and left.</p><p>Rainie gazed at her lover. Was it tacky that she found Jake\u2019s anger\u2014at someone else\u2014to be totally hot? Stop. Stop now. Jake\u2019s mom stood right there, observing how Rainie was perving on her son.</p><p>Rainie flushed. As the door slammed behind Duke, she straightened her shoulders. Hopefully Jake\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t be rude to her in front of him. She no longer thought he\u2019d dump her if they disapproved\u2014he had too much character for that\u2014and he loved her. He showed her that every single day.</p><p>But she\u2019d hate to cause friction between him and his family. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Sheffield, I\u2019m sorry you had to witness that unpleasantness. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I must arrange for another attendant to cover tonight.\u201d</p><p>And Jake could leave with his family, and\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to take you two out to eat, honey.\u201d Jake\u2019s mother linked arms with her. \u201cI\u2019m Elaine, and I\u2019m so happy to finally meet you. I can see you\u2019re just as wonderful as told.\u201d</p><p>Rainie stopped dead in the hallway, pulling Elaine off stride. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s mother burst into laughter. \u201cOh, everyone has been telling us about the woman our son\u2019s fallen for. Madeline Grayson. Zachary and his Jessica. Saxon. Such glowing reports.\u201d</p><p>Glowing reports? But...</p><p>But if these people discovered who Rainie was, what she came from, they wouldn\u2019t be so nice. And Rainie couldn\u2019t deal with waiting for them to be disillusioned.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and manned up. Jake had taught her that hiding her past from loved ones was a mistake. \u201cMrs. Sheffield, you should know, my parents abandoned me. I ran away from foster care. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJake told us.\u201d Jennifer stepped forward to take Rainie\u2019s free hand and squeeze. \u201cBut, hey, we were in school together, remember? I just wish... Back in the day, I\u2019d kinda hoped to be friends. Maybe we can now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Jake\u2019s family knew? And still, they came here, wanting to go out to eat. Wanting to be friends. Despite the radiance filling her, she made one final try. \u201cI-I have a bad background. On the streets and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet that\u2019s why you could stand up to the dumbass back there.\u201d The sister linked arms with Rainie on the other side and started them walking down the hall. \u201cI would\u2019ve wussed out. You were awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Elaine sounded...proud.</p><p>Rainie\u2019s breathing hitched, and she stopped dead, frantically blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Hard hands closed on her shoulders, and Jake pulled her away from the women and into his arms. \u201cShe\u2019s the toughest woman I know, but she falls apart if you\u2019re too nice to her. Be warned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Elaine said. She smiled at both Rainie and Jake, gathered her husband and daughter with a glance. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you in the front.\u201d</p><p>And as the footsteps retreated, Rainie heard Elaine whispering, \u201cShe\u2019s a total keeper, all right. Saxon was correct.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou suppose Jake\u2019d let me borrow her?\u201d Mr. Sheffield asked. \u201cThat new secretary of mine could use some mentoring and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was getting Jake\u2019s shirt wet, she realized, about the time she felt his chest shaking. He was laughing.</p><p>Laughing.</p><p>She pulled back to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you have the cutest mean look,\u201d he said, kissing it right off her face. \u201cYou know, if you show me you love me, baby, I might\u2014might\u2014let you eat supper with us tonight.\u201d His grin flashed white in his tanned face; his hands were strong on her shoulders, his eyes filled with his love.</p><p>She had to clear her throat before she reached up and held his face in her hands. \u201cI love you so, so much. More than I ever can tell you.\u201d She pulled his head down to hers.</p><p>And she knew, through all the years they would live, the kiss she shared with him then would rate as one of the most loving of all kisses...ever.</p><p>His smile lit her heart like a candle tucked inside.</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d He pulled her tighter into his arms, as if he couldn\u2019t bear the few inches separating them. \u201cThat works, buttercup. That definitely works.\u201d</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
