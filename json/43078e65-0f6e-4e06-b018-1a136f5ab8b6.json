It saw me through two lengthy bouts of cancer, a particularly terrifying kind that formed tumors inside my brain and tormented me with indescribable headaches. I experienced pain I could never have imagined before. Cancer destroyed my teen years and my twenties, but I was determined to survive.</p> <p>I\u2019d just turned sixteen the first time I was diagnosed, and I learned to knit while undergoing chemotherapy. A woman with breast cancer, who had the chemo chair next to mine, used to knit and she\u2019s the one who taught me. The chemo was dreadful\u2014not quite as bad as the headaches, but close. Because of knitting, I was able to endure those endless hours of weakness and severe nausea. With two needles and a skein of yarn, I felt I could face whatever I had to. My hair fell out in clumps, but I could weave yarn around a needle and create a stitch; I could follow a pattern and finish a project. I couldn\u2019t hold down more than a few bites at a time, but I could knit. I clung to that small sense of accomplishment, treasured it.</p><p>Knitting was my salvation\u2014knitting and my father. He lent me the emotional strength to make it through the last bout. I survived but, sadly, Dad didn\u2019t. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? I lived, but my cancer killed my father.</p><p>The death certificate states that he died of a massive heart attack, but I believe otherwise. When the cancer returned, it devastated him even more than me. Mom has never been able to deal with sickness, so the brunt of my care fell to my father. It was Dad who got me through chemotherapy, Dad who argued with the doctors and fought for the very best medical care\u2014Dad who lent me the will to live. Consumed by my own desperate struggle for life, I didn\u2019t realize how dear a price my father paid for my recovery. By the time I was officially in remission, Dad\u2019s heart simply gave out on him.</p><p>After he died, I knew I had to make a choice about what I should do with the rest of my life. I wanted to honor my father in whatever I chose, and that meant I was prepared to take risks. I, Lydia Anne Hoffman, resolved to leave my mark on the world. In retrospect, that sounds rather melodramatic, but a year ago it was exactly how I felt. What, you might ask, did I do that was so life-changing and profound?</p><p>I opened a yarn store on Blossom Street in Seattle. That probably won\u2019t seem earth-shattering to anyone else, but for me, it was a leap of faith equal to Noah\u2019s building the ark without a rain cloud in sight. I had an inheritance from my grandparents and gambled every cent on starting my own business. Me, who\u2019s never held down a job for more than a few weeks. Me, who knew next to nothing about finances, profit-and-loss statements or business plans. I sank every dime I had into what I did know, and that was yarn and knitters.</p> <p>Naturally, I ran into a few problems. At the time, Blossom Street was undergoing a major renovation\u2014in fact, the architect\u2019s wife, Jacqueline Donovan, was one of the women in my first knitting class. Jacqueline, Carol and Alix, my original students, remain three of my closest friends to this day. Last summer, when I opened A Good Yarn, the street was closed to traffic. Anyone who managed to find her way to my store then had to put up with constant dust and noise. I refused to let the mess and inconvenience hamper my enthusiasm, and fortunately that was how my clientele felt, too. I was convinced I could make this work.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get the support you might expect from my family. Mom, bless her, tried to be encouraging, but she was in shock after losing Dad. She still is. Most days, she wanders hopelessly around in a fog of grief and loss. When I mentioned my plan, she didn\u2019t discourage me, but she didn\u2019t cheer me on, either. To the best of my memory, she said, \u201cSure, honey, go ahead, if you think you should.\u201d From my mother, this was as rousing an endorsement as I could hope to receive.</p><p>My older sister, Margaret, on the other hand, had no qualms about drowning me in tales of doom and gloom. The day I opened my store, she marched in with a spate of dire forecasts. The economy was down, she told me; people were hanging on to their money. I\u2019d be lucky to stay afloat for six weeks. Ten minutes of listening to her ominous predictions, and I was ready to rip up the lease and close my door\u2014until I reminded myself that this was my first official day on the job and I had yet to sell a single skein of yarn.</p><p>As you might\u2019ve guessed, Margaret and I have a complicated relationship. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I love my sister. Until the cancer struck, we were like any other sisters with the normal ups and downs in our relationship. After I was initially diagnosed with brain cancer, she was wonderful. I remember she brought me a stuffed teddy bear to take to the hospital with me. I still have it somewhere if Whiskers hasn\u2019t gotten hold of it. Whiskers is my cat and he tends to shred anything with a fuzzy surface.</p><p>It was when I went through the second bout of cancer that Margaret\u2019s attitude changed noticeably. She acted as if I wanted to be sick, as if I was so hungry for attention that I\u2019d brought this horror on myself. When I took my first struggling steps toward independence, I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d support my efforts. Instead, all I got was discouragement. But over time, that changed and eventually all my hard work won her over.</p><p>Margaret, to put it mildly, isn\u2019t the warm, spontaneous type. I didn\u2019t understand how much she cared about me until I had a third cancer scare just a few months after I opened A Good Yarn. Scare doesn\u2019t come close to describing my feelings when Dr. Wilson ordered those frightening, familiar tests. It was as if my entire world had come to a sudden halt. The truth is, I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve endured the struggle yet again. I\u2019d already decided that if the cancer had returned, I would refuse treatment. I didn\u2019t want to die, but once you\u2019ve lived with the threat of death, it loses its potency.</p> <p>My come-what-may attitude disturbed Margaret, who wouldn\u2019t accept my fatalism. Talk of death unsettled her, the way it does most people, but when you\u2019ve been around death and dying as much as I have, it seems as natural as turning off the lights. I don\u2019t look forward to dying, but I\u2019m not afraid of it either. Thankfully, the tests came back negative and I\u2019m thriving, right along with my yarn store. I mention it now because it was during those weeks that I discovered how deeply my sister loves me. In the last seventeen years, I\u2019ve only seen her cry twice\u2014when Dad died and when Dr. Wilson gave me a clean bill of health.</p><p>Once I returned to work full-time, Margaret bullied and cajoled me into contacting Brad Goetz again. Brad, who drives the UPS truck that makes deliveries to A Good Yarn, is the man I\u2019d started seeing last year. He\u2019s divorced and has custody of his eight-year-old son, Cody. It would be an understatement to say Brad is good-looking; the fact is, he\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous. The first day he came into the store, wheeling several cartons of yarn, it was all I could do to keep the drool from dripping down my chin. I got so flustered I could hardly sign for the delivery. He asked me out three times before I finally agreed to meet him for drinks. Given my experience with male-female relationships, I was sure I\u2019d be completely out of my element dating Brad. I would never have found the courage to say yes if not for Margaret, who harassed me into it.</p><p>I always say that A Good Yarn is my affirmation of life, but according to my sister I was afraid of life. Afraid to really live, to venture outside the tiny comfortable world I\u2019d created inside my yarn store. She was right and I knew it, but still I resisted. It\u2019d been so many years since I\u2019d spent any amount of time with a man other than my father or my physician that I had the social finesse of a dandelion. But Margaret wouldn\u2019t listen to a single excuse, and soon Brad and I were having drinks together, followed by dinners, picnics with Cody and ball games. I\u2019ve come to love Brad\u2019s son as much as I do my two nieces, Julia and Hailey.</p><p>These days Brad and I see quite a bit of each other. During my cancer scare, I\u2019d pushed him away, which was a mistake as Margaret frequently pointed out. Brad forgave me, though, and we resumed out relationship. We\u2019re cautious\u2014okay, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s taking things slow, but Brad\u2019s fine with that. He was burned once when his ex-wife walked out, claiming she needed to \u201cfind herself.\u201d There\u2019s Cody to consider, too. The boy has a close relationship with Brad, and while Cody loves me too, I don\u2019t want to disrupt that special bond between father and son. So far, everything is going well, and we\u2019re talking more and more about a future together. Brad and Cody are so much a part of my life now that I couldn\u2019t imagine being without them.</p><p>Although it took her a while, Margaret is finally in favor of my yarn store. After a shaky start, my sister is a believer. She\u2019s actually working with me now. That\u2019s right, the two of us side by side, and that\u2019s nothing short of a miracle. Occasionally we regress, but we\u2019re making strides. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s with me, in every sense of the word.</p><p>Before I get too carried away, I want to tell you about my shop. The minute I laid eyes on this place I saw its potential. Despite the construction mess, the temporary drawbacks and shifting neighborhood, I realized it was perfect. I was ready to sign the lease before I\u2019d even walked inside. I loved the large display windows, which look out onto the street. Whiskers sleeps there most days, curled up among the skeins and balls of yarn. The flower boxes immediately reminded me of my father\u2019s first bicycle shop, and it was almost as if my dad was giving my venture his nod of approval. The colorful but dusty striped awning sealed the deal in my mind. I knew this old-fashioned little shop could become the welcoming place I\u2019d envisioned\u2014and it has.</p><p>The renovation on Blossom Street is almost complete. The bank building has been transformed into ultraexpensive condos and the video store next to it is now a French-style caf\u00e9, cleverly called The French Caf\u00e9. Alix Townsend, who took my very first beginners\u2019 knitting class, worked at the old video store, and it\u2019s somehow fitting that her first real job as a pastry chef is in exactly the same location. Unfortunately, Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9 down the street is closed and vacant, but the space won\u2019t be empty for long. This is a thriving neighborhood.</p><p>The bell above my door chimed as Margaret stepped inside. It was the first Tuesday morning in June, and a lovely day. Summer would be arriving any time now in the Pacific Northwest.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I greeted her, turning from the small coffeemaker I keep in the back room that\u2019s officially my office.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer me right away and when she did it was more of a grumble than an actual response. Knowing my sister and her moods, I decided to bide my time. If she\u2019d had an argument with one of her daughters or with her husband, she\u2019d tell me eventually.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pot of coffee on,\u201d I announced as Margaret walked into the back room and locked up her purse.</p><p>Without commenting, my sister pulled a freshly washed cup from the tray and reached for the pot. The drip continued, sizzling against the hot plate, but she didn\u2019t appear to notice.</p><p>Finally I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and my resolve to give her a chance to get over her bad mood disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I demanded. I have to admit I felt impatient; lately, she\u2019s brought her surly moods to work a little too often. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Facing me, Margaret managed a tentative smile. \u201cNothing...sorry. It\u2019s just that this feels a whole lot like a Monday.\u201d</p><p>Because the shop is closed on Mondays, Tuesday is our first workday of the week. I frowned at her, trying to figure out what the real problem was. But she\u2019d assumed a perfectly blank expression, telling me nothing.</p><p>My sister is a striking woman with wide shoulders and thick, dark hair. She\u2019s tall and lean, but solid. She still looks like the athlete she used to be. I wish she\u2019d do something different with her hair, though. She wears the same style she did in high school, parted in the middle and stick-straight until it hits her shoulders, where it obediently turns under, as if she\u2019s tortured it with a curling iron. That was certainly part of her teenage regimen\u2014the curling iron, the hair spray, the vigorously wielded brush. The style\u2019s classic and it suits her, I suppose, but I\u2019d give anything to see her try something new.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to post a new class,\u201d I said, changing the subject abruptly, hoping to draw her out of her dour mood.</p> <p>\u201cIn what?\u201d</p><p>Ah, interest. That was a good sign. For the most part, all the classes I\u2019d held had gone well. I\u2019d taught a beginners\u2019 class, an intermediate and a Fair Isle, but there was one I\u2019d been thinking of offering for a while.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a difficult question?\u201d</p><p>My sister\u2019s sarcasm shook me from my brief reverie. \u201cSocks,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to offer a class on knitting socks.\u201d</p><p>With the inventive new sock yarns on the market, socks were the current knitting rage. I carried a number of the European brands and loved the variety. My customers did, too. Some of the new yarns were designed to create an intricate pattern when knitted. I found it amazing to view a finished pair of socks, knowing the design had been formed by the yarn itself and not the knitter.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Margaret\u2019s shoulders rose in a shrug. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to suggest knitting them on circular needles versus the double-pointed method,\u201d she said casually.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I preferred using two circular needles.</p><p>Margaret would rather crochet and while she can knit, she doesn\u2019t often. \u201cThere seems to be a lot of interest in socks lately, doesn\u2019t there?\u201d Her tone was still casual, almost indifferent.</p><p>I regarded my sister closely. She always had a list of three or four reasons any idea of mine wouldn\u2019t work. It had become practically a game with us. I\u2019d make some suggestion and she\u2019d instantly tell me why it was bound to fail. I missed having the opportunity to state my case.</p><p>\u201cSo you think a sock class would appeal to our customers?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help asking. Good grief, there had to be something drastically wrong with Margaret.</p><p>Personally, I was fond of knitting socks for reasons beyond the current popularity. The biggest attraction for me was the fact that a pair of socks was a small project. After finishing an afghan or a Fair Isle sweater, I usually wanted a project I knew I could complete quickly. After knitting for endless hours, I found it gratifying to watch a sock take shape almost immediately. Socks didn\u2019t require a major commitment of either time or yarn and made wonderful gifts. Yes, socks were definitely my choice for this new class. Because Tuesday seemed to be my slowest business day, it made sense to hold the sessions then.</p> <p>Margaret nodded in answer to my question. \u201cI think a sock class would definitely attract knitters,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>I stared at my sister and, for an instant, thought I saw the sheen of tears in her eyes. I stared harder. As I mentioned earlier, Margaret rarely cries. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d I asked, just in case, keeping my voice gentle. I didn\u2019t want to pry, but if something really was wrong, she needed to know I was concerned about her.</p><p>\u201cStop asking me that,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>I sighed with relief. The old Margaret was back.</p><p>\u201cWould you make a sign for the window?\u201d I asked. Margaret had much more artistic ability than I did. I\u2019d come to rely on her for the window notices and displays.</p><p>With no real show of enthusiasm, she shrugged again. \u201cI\u2019ll have one up before noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I walked over to the front door, unlocked it and flipped the Closed sign to Open. Whiskers glanced up from his perch in the front window, where he lazed in the morning sun. Red Martha Washington geraniums bloomed in the window box. The soil looked parched, so I filled the watering can and carried it outside. From the corner of my eye I saw a flash of brown as a truck turned the corner. A familiar happiness stole over me. Brad.</p><p>Sure enough, he angled the big truck into the parking spot in front of Fanny\u2019s Floral, the shop next to mine. He hopped out, all the while smiling at me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful morning,\u201d I said, reveling in his smile. This man smiles with his whole heart, his whole being, and he has the most intense blue eyes. They\u2019re like a beacon to me. I swear I can see those eyes a mile away, they\u2019re that blue. \u201cHave you got a yarn delivery?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only delivery I have for you today, but I\u2019ve got a couple of minutes if there\u2019s coffee on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d It was our ritual. Brad stopped at the shop twice a week, with or without a load of yarn\u2014more often if he could manage it. He never stayed long. He filled his travel coffee mug, took the opportunity to steal a kiss and then returned to his deliveries. As always, I followed him into the back room, pretending to be surprised when he eased me into his embrace. I love Brad\u2019s kisses. This time he started with my forehead, then gradually worked his way down my face until he reached my lips. As his mouth moved over mine, I could feel the electricity through every inch of my body. He has that kind of effect on me\u2014and he\u2019s well aware of it.</p><p>He held me just long enough to let me regain my equilibrium. Then he released me and picked up the coffeepot. He was frowning when he turned around.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem between Margaret and Matt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I opened my mouth to assure him everything was fine, but before I could utter a word I stopped myself. All at once I realized I didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister,\u201d he said in hushed tones. \u201cShe isn\u2019t herself lately. Haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSomething\u2019s definitely up with her,\u201d I agreed, remembering how she\u2019d declined the opportunity to wage verbal battle with me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to ask her?\u201d Brad inquired, forgetting to whisper.</p><p>I paused, afraid Margaret would take offense and snap at Brad the same way she had at me. \u201cProbably not.\u201d But then I changed my mind. My sister was half in love with Brad herself. If anyone could make it past that protective barrier of hers, he\u2019d be the one. \u201cMaybe, but not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should all get together soon.\u201d</p><p>Brad shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019d be better if Matt wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nibbled on my lower lip. \u201cDo you have any other ideas?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, Margaret tore aside the curtain to the back room and glared at us. Brad and I started, no doubt looking as guilty as we felt.</p><p>\u201cListen, you two lovebirds, if you\u2019re going to talk about me I suggest you lower your voices.\u201d With that, she dropped the curtain and stomped into the store.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Retirement was everything Elise Beaumont had hoped it would be, and everything she\u2019d feared. On the positive side, the alarm portion of her clock-radio had been permanently shut off. She woke when her body told her she no longer needed sleep, ate when she felt hungry and not when the school library set her break.</p><p>Then there were the negatives. For years she\u2019d scrimped and saved, wanting to build her own home on her own small piece of land. After months of searching, months of visiting housing developments, she found the area and the development she\u2019d always dreamed of. It was on the outskirts of the city, and if it didn\u2019t have an ocean view, it was still beautiful, overlooking a grove of conifers. She could imagine having coffee on her small patio, watching deer emerge from the trees in the early morning. She raided her investment account and put down a large chunk of cash. She\u2019d assumed the developer was a reputable one; to put it bluntly, he wasn\u2019t. She, along with a handful of others, had been cheated and misled. Then the company declared bankruptcy within a month, and as a result she had no home, no savings and mounting legal bills. It was a nightmarish situation that continued to get worse.</p><p>As she lay in bed, she recalled that for years she\u2019d wanted to travel beyond the Puget Sound area, where she\u2019d been born and raised. Well, she couldn\u2019t afford that now. But for the first time in her adult life she felt the urge to follow her creative bent. She planned to knit again and take an oil painting class. Having spent most of her career around books, she\u2019d toyed with the idea of writing a novel. Maybe a children\u2019s story...She was open to trying just about anything\u2014once the class-action suit against the builder was settled. Until then, she could only obsess about her lack of funds and the legal battle before her.</p><p>Her life was on hold until she was free of this mess. It was all a waiting game now as the attorneys filed the paperwork and the lawsuit worked its way through the court system. At best, it would be a year before she and the others saw even a fraction of their money. If they did, and that was a big if. All she could do was hope and pray that all wasn\u2019t lost.</p><p>The problems with the builder were only the start of her difficulties. Certain her house would be completed on time, she\u2019d let go of the lease on her apartment. That had been an early mistake. The vacancy rate in Seattle was low and not only would it be difficult to find a new place, she was terrified of using the better part of her pension on an overpriced apartment. At her daughter\u2019s suggestion, Elise had moved in with her. Just for a little while, she\u2019d promised herself. Except that it had already been six months....</p><p>No\u2014Elise refused to spend another second thinking about this financial disaster. It only depressed her. In her eagerness to have her own home, she\u2019d lost practically everything. At least she had her health, her daughter and grandchildren, her sanity.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Grandma,\u201d six-year-old John cried as he pounded urgently at her bedroom door. \u201cAre you awake? I want to come in, okay?\u201d</p><p>Elise slid out of bed and opened her bedroom door. Her freckle-faced grandson smiled crookedly up at her. His crop of carrot-colored hair stood nearly straight up, just the way Maverick\u2019s once had. Her youngest grandson\u2019s hair color often brought her ex-husband to mind. Elise hadn\u2019t seen him for more than brief periods over the past thirty years. How she\u2019d ever managed to meet, let alone marry, a professional gambler was something she couldn\u2019t explain even now. He\u2019d been her one wild, impulsive fling.</p><p>But...how she\u2019d loved him. Elise had been head over heels for that man. They were married within weeks of their first meeting\u2014which had happened in a grocery store, of all places. Before long, Aurora was born, but the problems had already started. At the time, Marvin \u201cMaverick\u201d Beaumont was working for an insurance firm, but he had an addiction to cards and gambling, and it\u2019d nearly destroyed them both. In the end, Elise felt she had no option but to leave him. Whenever she\u2019d threatened divorce, he\u2019d begged her to reconsider, begged her to give him another chance, but it was the same pattern over and over until Elise finally realized she had to get him out of her life. It still hurt. She\u2019d never loved another man with the same intensity as she had Maverick. She\u2019d tried, but no one else had made her feel the way he had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d made a genuine effort to socialize, with the hope of marrying again. The closest she came was when Aurora turned fifteen, but Elise discovered that Jules, a symphony musician she\u2019d been dating, had a wife and two daughters living in San Francisco. Devastated, she\u2019d avoided relationships ever since. There was something to be said for a simple life.</p><p>Looking perturbed, Elise\u2019s daughter rounded the hallway corner. \u201cJohn, I told you to leave your grandmother alone,\u201d Aurora chastised. She reached for his arm and dragged him away from Elise\u2019s door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I told the boys to let you sleep in this morning,\u201d she added, casting Elise an apologetic glance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, I was awake.\u201d Living with her daughter, a stay-at-home mom, and her family might not have been part of Elise\u2019s retirement plans, but for the moment this arrangement suited them both. Her furniture was in storage and her life on hold, but she had a roof over her head.</p><p>While Elise waited for the lawsuit to get settled, she paid Aurora and David rent. The amount was small at their insistence, but it was still a boon to the tight family budget. Elise also helped her daughter with the children. David, Elise\u2019s son-in-law, was a computer specialist who set up software systems for companies across North America and was often away for a week or two at a time. Elise and Aurora, always close, were company for each other, and Elise appreciated her daughter\u2019s encouragement and support.</p> <p>\u201cCan you take us to the park this afternoon?\u201d John pleaded.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Elise said, hating to refuse him anything. \u201cI have a few errands to run this morning and I don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ll take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come?\u201d John was such a dear boy, anxious to go and see and do. He\u2019d raced into the world a full month early and had yet to stop.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetie, you\u2019ve got kindergarten this morning.\u201d</p><p>His face fell instantly but he accepted her refusal with a good-natured shrug and quickly disappeared down the hallway to join his older brother.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d go down Blossom Street and check out that yarn store,\u201d Elise informed her daughter.</p><p>She could tell Aurora was pleased about her renewed interest in knitting. After a recent visit to her attorney\u2019s office, Elise had walked down the renovated street and noticed the yarn store, which she\u2019d mentioned to Aurora.</p><p>Elise was pleasantly surprised by the changes on Blossom Street. For years the area had been an eyesore, with its seedy-looking establishments. The renovations weren\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. Instead of tearing down the older buildings, the architect had refurbished what was already there and renewed a deteriorating neighborhood. The shops were appealing with awnings and flowers and sidewalk displays. The impression she\u2019d been left with was of a warmly traditional neighborhood, a lovely little world unto itself. It was hard to believe that just a few blocks over, high-rises stretched toward the sky. Just down the hill were the huge financial enterprises, insurance complexes and other major businesses that made up downtown Seattle.</p><p>While looking in the window of A Good Yarn, Elise had noticed a sign that advertised knitting classes. She might not be able to enjoy her retirement the way she\u2019d hoped, but she wasn\u2019t going to become a recluse afraid to spend a dime, either. Besides, knitting might keep her mind off her financial difficulties.</p><p>After a cup of tea in her room, Elise dressed for the day. She\u2019d maintained her slim figure and chose a peach-colored pantsuit that was both stylish and comfortable. Although it was early June and sunny, the weather remained cool and she would need the matching jacket once she got outside. She pinned a small pink cameo over the top closure of her white blouse. It was the nicest piece of jewelry she owned. Maverick had given it to her before they were even married and she loved it and wore it often.</p><p>To his credit, Maverick had stayed in touch with their daughter, although not as regularly as Elise felt he should. For her own part, she wanted nothing to do with him, but she didn\u2019t begrudge Aurora the opportunity to know her father; she never had. She considered their relationship entirely separate from her. She paused, frowning. Twice that morning she\u2019d thought about Maverick. It wasn\u2019t as though she ever really forgot him\u2014how could she with her grandson so physically similar\u2014but she rarely indulged her memories of him. She didn\u2019t want to think about him or remember the days and nights of love.</p> <p>After running a brush through her shoulder-length brown hair, she tied it back at the nape of her neck. Untouched by gray, it was her one vanity. Her hand froze as yet another memory wrapped itself around her heart. Maverick had loved her hair down. She\u2019d worn it in a tidy bun at the library but at the end of the day, the first thing he did was reach for the pins to loosen her thick tresses. \u201cRapunzel, Rapunzel,\u201d he\u2019d whisper and she\u2019d smile.... Irritated, she tightened her lips and cast the thought from her mind.</p><p>Aurora was pouring milk into bowls of cereal when Elise walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice, Mom,\u201d she commented.</p><p>Compliments embarrassed Elise and she dismissed her daughter\u2019s words with a shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day at school,\u201d Elise told the boys as she opened the front door.</p><p>They watched her leave, their faces glum, as if she\u2019d abandoned them to some malicious fate. Her grandsons were her joy but she hardly knew how Aurora managed. She marveled at her daughter\u2019s skill as a wife and mother.</p><p>Elise sometimes feared she\u2019d failed on both counts. She was never meant to be a wife, and her two years of married life had proved as much. Aurora was the one treasure she\u2019d managed to salvage from that shipwreck of a marriage. Her daughter, as tall as her father at six feet, was a blessing beyond compare. In more ways than Elise cared to admit, they\u2019d grown up together. Thankfully they\u2019d stayed close.</p><p>Maverick had faithfully paid his child support each month, and when the spirit moved him, he\u2019d phoned Aurora from wherever he was currently living, which seemed to be in a different part of the country each time. Soon after their wedding, he\u2019d given up any pretense of an ordinary job\u2014although he\u2019d been quite successful at insurance sales\u2014and devoted his energy to gambling. Roots were a detriment to a professional gambler. And if settling down wasn\u2019t conducive to a gambler\u2019s life, a family was even less so. While Elise was in labor, her loving husband had started up a poker game in the waiting room and completely missed the birth of his only child.</p> <p>Catching the #47 bus, Elise rode it down Pill Hill toward Blossom Street, getting off three stops before the Seattle Public Library, which had recently undergone a huge renovation. Through her work at the school library, Elise had met some of Washington\u2019s most influential librarians. They included Nancy Pearl, who\u2019d organized the \u201cIf All Seattle Reads the Same Book\u201d program. Cities, large and small, across the United States had followed Seattle\u2019s lead. Elise was delighted that this idea had become so popular. It demonstrated that the library remained an important part of the community.</p><p>Stepping off the bus, she clutched her purse close to her side. The area had once been known for its pickpockets and muggers. That didn\u2019t seem to be the case now, but one could never be too careful.</p><p>She walked past Fanny\u2019s Floral and stopped to admire a display of purple carnations. She\u2019d never seen carnations in quite that color before and was tempted to bring home a bouquet for Aurora. She probably shouldn\u2019t waste money on flowers, but still...Well, she\u2019d think about it.</p><p>A snoozing tabby cat was curled up in the display window of the yarn store. Elise opened the door and a small bell rang. Apparently accustomed to the sound, the cat didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d a pleasant-faced woman greeted her. Another, older woman stood by the counter and nodded in Elise\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she said, instantly warmed by the younger woman\u2019s friendliness. This was an attractive shop, well-designed and not overcrowded with yarn. Elise liked that she could see over the top of each display case. \u201cI\u2019ve come to inquire about classes,\u201d she said, distracted by the colors and textures all around her. There were projects displayed on top of the cases, cleverly arranged on wire frames. Her eye was drawn to a sweater with a dinosaur knit into the front. Both Luke and John would love that. Perhaps one day she\u2019d make it for her grandsons.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re enrolling for a sock class this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocks,\u201d Elise repeated, unsure this was a project that interested her. \u201cI\u2019ve knit with five needles before, but it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are knitted up on two circular needles,\u201d the woman told her. \u201cHere, let me show you what I mean.\u201d She led Elise toward the middle aisle, where a row of plastic feet displayed knitted socks. The patterns were intricate\u2014far more complicated than Elise cared to tackle. It\u2019d been years since she\u2019d picked up knitting needles and she wasn\u2019t eager to sabotage her efforts with a project beyond her capabilities.</p><p>She was about to say as much when the woman explained that the designs were part of the yarn itself.</p><p>\u201cYou mean I don\u2019t have to do anything but knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. The yarn is self-patterning.\u201d She went on to list the price of the class, the day and the cost, which included all the supplies she would need. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m Lydia Hoffman and that\u2019s my sister, Margaret. She works with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise Beaumont,\u201d she said and smiled at both women. On closer inspection it became more obvious that they were related. The older one, Margaret, was large-boned but the other, Lydia, was petite with delicate features. Yet their faces were similar in shape, with pronounced cheekbones and large dark eyes. When she realized she was staring, she added, \u201cI recently retired and thought I\u2019d take up knitting again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled at Lydia\u2019s enthusiasm. Margaret\u2019s attention had returned to whatever she was doing at the counter, which apparently involved catalogues and order forms.</p><p>\u201cA class seems like a good place to start,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Lydia nodded. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you decided to stop by.\u201d She continued toward the back of the shop, where a table and chairs were set up. \u201cIf you\u2019re free on Friday afternoons, I\u2019d like to invite you to our charity knitting sessions, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother class?\u201d Elise could only afford one.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. There\u2019s no cost. A number of my regulars come here to knit for different charitable projects and organizations. You\u2019d be most welcome, Elise.\u201d She talked about Warm Up America, the Linus Project and ChemoCaps for people undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>\u201cDo you supply the yarn?\u201d Elise asked, conscious once again of her limited budget.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cOr at least some of it. Patrons have donated leftover yarn for the Warm Up America blankets, and anyone who purchases yarn for one of the other projects can buy it at a discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Elise\u2019s schedule was nearly empty and she was looking for ways to fill it. So far, she\u2019d joined a readers\u2019 group that met once a month at a branch of the Seattle Public Library, and had volunteered to fold church newsletters. A strong supporter of the local blood bank, she\u2019d also volunteered to handle the desk every Monday morning until noon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like to sign up for the sock class?\u201d Lydia pressed. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Again Elise\u2019s spirits lifted at the other woman\u2019s friendliness. \u201cYes, I think I would.\u201d She opened her purse and removed her checkbook. \u201cHow many will be in the class?\u201d she asked as she signed the check.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to limit it to six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas there been a lot of interest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, but I only put the ad in the window Tuesday morning. You\u2019re the first person to join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first,\u201d Elise repeated, and for reasons she could only guess at, being first gave her a sense of pleasure.</p><p>She decided to buy those flowers for Aurora, after all.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, Bethanne Hamlin lamented as she pulled into the driveway of her Capitol Hill home. The house, built in the 1930s before it was deemed unsafe and unfeasible to use brick on top of an earthquake fault, had been her dream home. She\u2019d fallen in love with it the moment she saw it. The short steep driveway ended at the basement garage. Concrete steps led to a small porch, and the front door was rounded, like the door to a fairy-tale cottage, she\u2019d always thought. A gable jutted out from the second-floor master bedroom. The window seat there overlooked the entire neighborhood. Bethanne had often sat in that window and read or daydreamed. It was in this beautiful home that she\u2019d once lived her perfect life. Her fairy-tale life...</p><p>She turned off the engine and sat in her five-year-old Plymouth, searching for the resolve and the strength to enter her house with a smile on her face. Taking a deep breath, she slid out of the car, reaching into the backseat for her groceries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d she called out as she opened the front door, doing her best to sound cheerful.</p><p>She felt relief when silence greeted her.</p><p>\u201cAndrew? Annie?\u201d She placed the grocery bag on the kitchen countertop, filled the teakettle and set it on the burner. Before the divorce she\u2019d never been much of a tea drinker, but in the last year she\u2019d become practically addicted, drinking two or three pots a day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d she announced a second time. Again, no response.</p> <p>After a few minutes, the kettle began to whistle, and she poured the steaming water over Earl Grey tea bags in the ceramic pot that had once belonged to her grandmother. Then she carried it to the breakfast table.</p><p>Sitting in the small alcove, she tried to make sense of her life. Tried to make sense of everything that had happened to her and her children over the past two years. Nothing felt right anymore. It was as if the seasons no longer followed each other in proper succession. Or as if the moon had suddenly replaced the sun...She still had trouble understanding what had happened\u2014and why.</p><p>It\u2019d all started sixteen months earlier on the morning of Valentine\u2019s Day. The kids were awake and banging around inside their bedrooms, getting ready for school. A little earlier, when she could hear Andrew and Annie squabbling over the bathroom, she\u2019d thrown on her housecoat and started down to the kitchen to make breakfast. Then, as she reached the door, she\u2019d noticed her husband sitting up in bed, knees bent, face in his hands. Bethanne\u2019s first thought was that Grant had the flu. Any other morning, he was already up and dressed for work. He loved his job as a broker for a successful real estate company. He earned enough so that Bethanne could stay home with the children; from the time Andrew was born, and Annie thirteen months later, she\u2019d felt the children should be her career. Grant had supported her decision. He liked having her home, accessible to him and the children, and appreciated the elegant business dinners she frequently prepared for him and his colleagues.</p><p>\u201cGrant?\u201d she\u2019d asked, completely unsuspecting of what was to follow.</p><p>He\u2019d looked up and Bethanne had read such pain in his eyes that she sat down on the bed and placed her hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she\u2019d asked gently.</p><p>Grant couldn\u2019t seem to speak. He opened his mouth as if to begin, but no words came.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Annie shouted from the bottom of the stairs. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Torn between her husband\u2019s needs and those of her children, Bethanne vacillated, then squeezed Grant\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Actually it took ten minutes, and both kids had left the house by the time she returned.</p> <p>Grant\u2019s position was unchanged when she walked into the bedroom, his expression just as bleak.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she\u2019d whispered urgently, her mind whirling as she wondered what could possibly be wrong. Grant had been to see the doctor for a physical the week before; everything seemed fine, but there\u2019d been the routine tests. Perhaps Dr. Lyman had found something and Grant was only now able to tell her. She sat down next to him again, the mattress dipping slightly under her weight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Grant had announced in a voice so hoarse that he didn\u2019t sound like himself.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed his cheek and felt him stiffen. \u201cGrant, please\u2014tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d started to weep then, huge sobs that shook his whole body. In the twenty years of their marriage, she could only recall a handful of times that her husband had revealed such deep emotion. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he cried.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me!\u201d</p><p>He gripped her shoulders, his fingers digging painfully into her flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re a good woman, Bethanne, but...\u201d He faltered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d</p><p>At first she could only assume this was a hoax and she giggled. \u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t love me anymore? Grant, we\u2019ve been married for twenty years. Of course you love me.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as if he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, so sorry, but I\u2019ve tried. God knows I\u2019ve tried. I can\u2019t carry on with this...this charade any longer.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was dumbstruck, staring at Grant. This was the man she\u2019d loved and slept with all these years and suddenly, in the blink of an eye, he\u2019d become a stranger.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he begged, \u201cdon\u2019t make me say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d At that moment she was more perplexed than angry. Rather than take his words personally, Bethanne immediately went into her problem-solving mode. Whatever was wrong could be fixed, the same way you\u2019d have a broken faucet or a faulty outlet repaired. You just called a plumber or an electrician. Whatever was wrong simply needed the appropriate attention and then everything would go back to working as it always had.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t love you anymore,\u201d her husband said from between clenched teeth. He tossed aside the comforter and got out of bed. His obvious irritation took her aback.</p><p>\u201cGrant, what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>He climbed into his pants, hiked them up and closed the zipper. \u201cAre you really this dense, or do I need to spell it out?\u201d</p><p>In a matter of seconds he\u2019d gone from tears to tyrant. \u201cSpell out what?\u201d she asked, innocently turning up her hands to receive whatever he had to tell her. She was more shocked by his rudeness than by what he was saying.</p><p>He paused, one arm in the sleeve of his shirt. He spoke without looking at her and without emotion. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p><p>It hit Bethanne then; she finally understood. \u201cYou\u2019re having an...affair?\u201d She went numb and her mouth was instantly dry. Her tongue seemed to swell to twice its normal size, making speech impossible. In no way could this be true. She refused to believe it\u2014Grant would never betray her like this. She\u2019d know if he was cheating. Men had affairs in movies and in books. It was the sort of thing that happened to other women, other marriages, not hers. She\u2019d clung to a surreal sense of denial for those first few minutes as he continued to dress for work.</p><p>\u201cWhen? How?\u201d she managed to stutter.</p><p>\u201cWe met at the office,\u201d Grant said. \u201cShe\u2019s another agent, recently joined the company.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cI tried to make it work with you and me, but it\u2019s no good. I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen.\u201d There was a pleading quality in his voice, quickly replaced by anger. \u201cDamn it, Bethanne, don\u2019t make things any more difficult than they already are.\u201d As if he\u2019d planned this for days, he opened the closet door and extracted a suitcase, which he set on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...leaving?\u201d</p><p>He answered by opening his dresser drawers and lifting out his clothes. Bethanne winced as she watched him drop a stack of neatly folded undershirts on the bottom of the suitcase. Grant was extremely particular about his T-shirts, which had to be folded just so. He was meticulous about every aspect of his personal appearance and that perfectionism extended beyond his hair and clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhere...where will you go?\u201d Her head was crowded with questions, and it seemed the most inessential ones rose to the surface first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving in with Tiffany,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cTiffany?\u201d she repeated, and why she should find humor in the midst of the most horrible moment of her life, she would never know. All at once she was laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me for a woman named Tiffany?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her as if she were truly demented and just then perhaps she was. \u201cGo,\u201d she said, almost flippantly, dismissing him with a wave of her hand. \u201cI just want you to go.\u201d</p><p>As if to prove her point, she\u2019d marched all the way down to the basement and collected a second, even bigger suitcase, which she hauled to their bedroom. As she climbed down and then back up the stairs, she racked her mind, trying to remember if she\u2019d ever met this Tiffany. To the best of her recollection she hadn\u2019t. Grant\u2019s office was filled with women, but she\u2019d never suspected he was capable of such treachery. Although she was panting by the time she\u2019d dragged the large suitcase up two flights of stairs, she didn\u2019t pause for breath, her anger carrying her.</p><p>She flopped the empty suitcase carelessly on the bed, and a cloud of dust spread over the white comforter, which she ignored. Then she threw open the closet door, grabbed his suits around the middle and yanked them out, still on their hangers. Unceremoniously, she shoved them into the suitcase.</p><p>\u201cBethanne!\u201d he shouted. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she bellowed at the top of her lungs. Then, more quietly, she asked, \u201cHow long has this thing with you and Tiffany been going on?\u201d When he didn\u2019t reply, she demanded, \u201cHow old is she, anyway?\u201d Once she\u2019d started on this line of questioning, she couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cIs she married, too, or am I the only one being tossed aside?\u201d</p><p>Grant refused to meet her gaze.</p><p>\u201cA while?\u201d</p><p>Again Grant refused to look at her as she packed his suitcases. She\u2019d begun just throwing in his clothes but had quickly reverted to habit\u2014folding, straightening, arranging.</p><p>\u201cA month? Two months? How good is she in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethanne, don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d She wouldn\u2019t stop until he told her the truth.</p><p>Grant released a laborious sigh as if her relentlessness had broken him down. \u201cTwo years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years!\u201d she cried, consumed with rage. \u201cGet out of this house.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cGet out, and don\u2019t come back.\u201d In that moment she meant it. But not long afterward, she\u2019d desperately wanted him home again. It embarrassed her now to remember how frantic she\u2019d been to win back her husband\u2019s affection. She\u2019d been willing to do anything\u2014see a counselor, beg, bribe, reason with him. At one point, just before the settlement hearing, she would\u2019ve given up ten years of her life for Grant to return to his family.</p><p>But when Grant moved out of the house and in with Tiffany, he had no intention of returning. She\u2019d nearly been destroyed by that. Eventually she\u2019d had to accept it: Grant was never coming home. He didn\u2019t love her anymore and nothing she said or did would change his mind.</p><p>Her marriage was dead, and burying it had virtually obliterated her self-esteem. If not for her children, Bethanne didn\u2019t know what she would\u2019ve done. Andrew and Annie needed her more than ever, and only for them did she continue.</p><p>When she\u2019d finally made an appointment with an attorney, the man had been straightforward and helpful; what seemed like a fair financial arrangement had been settled upon. Grant refinanced the house for the third time and paid off their cars and their credit card bills with whatever equity he could extract, so they were both essentially debt-free. He was instructed to pay alimony for two years, plus child support until the children were out of high school. They would share college expenses. He hadn\u2019t been late with a check yet, but then the state made sure of that. Bethanne would have to find a job soon, but for a dozen different reasons, she delayed.</p><p>It was now six months after the divorce had been finalized, and the fog was only starting to clear. She told herself she had to live one day at a time as she learned to deal with what her family and friends called her \u201cnew reality.\u201d The problem was, she preferred her old reality....</p> <p>Bethanne sipped her tea, which had begun to cool. She was startled from her thoughts when the door off the kitchen banged open and sixteen-year-old Annie came in, red-faced and sweating. Tendrils of wet hair pressed against the sides of her face. She wore a halter top and spandex shorts, and had apparently been out for a lengthy run. Because Annie had always felt close to her father, she\u2019d taken the divorce particularly hard. Soon after Grant moved out, Annie had started running and would often go five and even ten miles a day. Unfortunately, that hadn\u2019t been the only change in her daughter\u2019s behavior. The new friends she\u2019d acquired were a bigger concern.</p><p>Bethanne worried endlessly about Annie and the company she kept. The girl\u2019s anger was focused on Tiffany, and Bethanne suspected that Annie\u2019s new friends encouraged her more outrageous acts. While Bethanne was no fan of the other woman, whom she\u2019d discovered to be fifteen years younger than her ex, she was afraid Annie might do something stupid in her zeal to retaliate against Tiffany, something that would involve the police.</p><p>Andrew had talked to Bethanne several times about various things he\u2019d learned Annie had done. These included signing Tiffany up for magazine subscriptions, leaving her name and number with sales staff and scheduling appointments, all in Tiffany\u2019s name. However, Annie remained scornfully silent whenever Bethanne tried to bring up the subject.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave me a note,\u201d Bethanne chastised mildly as Annie walked over to the refrigerator and pulled out a cold bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the girl mumbled unapologetically. She twisted off the lid, leaned back her head and gulped down half the contents. \u201cI figured you\u2019d know. I run every day.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne did know, but that was beside the point.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go at the employment agency?\u201d her daughter asked.</p><p>Bethanne sighed, wishing Annie hadn\u2019t mentioned it. \u201cNot good.\u201d She\u2019d known this job search would be difficult, but she\u2019d had no idea how truly painful the process would be. \u201cWhen I told the interviewer about my baking skills, he didn\u2019t seem overly impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should work in a bakery.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had already considered that, but being around food for eight hours a day didn\u2019t appeal to her.</p><p>\u201cAndrew and I were the envy of all our friends.\u201d Annie sounded almost nostalgic. \u201cWe had the best birthday parties and birthday cakes of anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to organize great scavenger hunts too, but there\u2019s little call for that these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom.\u201d She rolled her eyes as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look seriously once the summer is over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou keep putting it off,\u201d Annie chided.</p><p>Her daughter was right, but after all these years outside the job market, Bethanne didn\u2019t think she possessed any saleable skills. She was terrified that she\u2019d end up at a grocery store asking people if they wanted paper or plastic for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of selling cosmetics,\u201d she said tentatively, glancing at Annie for a reaction. \u201cI could set my own hours and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Her daughter glared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of women make a very nice income from it, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelling cosmetics is fine for someone else, but not you. You\u2019re great at lots of things, but you\u2019d make a terrible salesperson and we both know it. There\u2019s got to be something you can do. Where\u2019s your pride?\u201d</p><p>For the last sixteen months it\u2019d been swirling in the bottom of a toilet bowl. \u201cI\u2019d hate an office job,\u201d Bethanne said. She wasn\u2019t convinced she could ever adjust to a nine-to-five routine.</p><p>\u201cYou should do something just for you,\u201d Annie insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not even talking about a job.\u201d</p><p>Everyone Bethanne knew, including the counsellor she\u2019d briefly seen, had told her the same thing. \u201cWhen did you get so smart?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you\u2019d like to do just for fun?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll laugh and tell me it\u2019s pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, reluctant to say anything. \u201cI saw a yarn store the other day and was thinking how much I\u2019d like to knit again. It\u2019s been years. I made you a baby blanket, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie cried, flinching as though Bethanne had embarrassed her. \u201cOf course I remember it. I slept with that yellow blankie until I was ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to enjoy knitting, but that was years ago.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened, then slammed shut. Andrew, coming home from his part-time job at the local Safeway. He entered the kitchen, shucking off his backpack, and without a word to either of them, opened the fridge and stared inside. Apparently nothing interested him more than a soda, which he removed. He closed the door, leaning against it, and frowned at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, looking from Bethanne to his younger sister.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s talking about wanting to knit again,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only something I\u2019m thinking about,\u201d Bethanne rushed to add.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Annie told her firmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Andrew agreed and popped the top of his soda.</p><p>But Bethanne wasn\u2019t sure she could. It all seemed to require too much energy\u2014finding a job, organizing her life, even knitting. \u201cMaybe I will,\u201d she murmured tentatively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not putting this off the way you have everything else.\u201d Annie opened the pantry door and pulled out the Yellow Pages. \u201cWhere was that yarn shop?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne bit her lower lip. \u201cBlossom Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the name of it?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>Annie flipped to the back of the massive directory.</p><p>\u201cNo, but listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>With her finger on the page, Annie looked up, eyes flashing with determination. \u201cFound it.\u201d She smiled triumphantly at her brother, scooped up the phone and punched out the number before Bethanne could protest. When she\u2019d finished, Annie handed the receiver to her mother.</p><p>A woman answered. \u201cA Good Yarn,\u201d she said in a friendly voice. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hello...my name is Bethanne Hamlin. I guess my name doesn\u2019t matter, but, well, I was wondering if you still offer knitting classes.\u201d She paused to take a breath. \u201cI used to knit years ago,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut it\u2019s been a very long time. Perhaps it\u2019d be better if I visited the store.\u201d Bethanne\u2019s gaze rose to meet her daughter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGive me the phone,\u201d Annie demanded and without waiting for a response, grabbed it from her.</p><p>\u201cYes, that sounds great. Sign her up,\u201d Annie ordered. She reached for a pad and paper and wrote down the details. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there.\u201d Half a minute later, Annie replaced the portable phone.</p><p>\u201cYou signed her up for a class?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah...\u201d Bethanne suddenly felt panicked about spending the money. \u201cListen, this might not be such a good idea, after all, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her daughter cut her off. \u201cYou\u2019ll be learning to knit socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocks?\u201d Bethanne cried, vigorously shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s far too complicated for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Andrew said, \u201cyou used to knit all the time, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocks aren\u2019t difficult, according to the shop owner,\u201d Annie continued. \u201cHer name\u2019s Lydia Hoffman and she said they\u2019re actually quite simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Bethanne muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going, Mom, and I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d Andrew echoed.</p><p>Apparently their roles had reversed, although this was news to Bethanne. It must\u2019ve happened while she wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>In Courtney\u2019s opinion, this entire plan of her father\u2019s was ridiculous and unfair. Okay, so she\u2019d gotten into some minor trouble talking back to her teachers and letting her grades drop. It could\u2019ve been a whole lot worse\u2014like if the police ever found out who\u2019d started that Dumpster fire four years ago. Who could blame her, though? Her mother had just died and Courtney was lost, angry, confused. She was doing better\u2014not that she was over it. She\u2019d never get \u201cover it,\u201d despite what her more clueless friends suggested. But in time she\u2019d straightened herself out and worked hard to salvage her high-school years and now this. This!</p><p>Her senior year of high school would be spent with her Grandma Pulanski in Seattle. While the kids she\u2019d grown up with all her life graduated together, she\u2019d be stuck halfway across the country. Courtney loved her grandmother, but she couldn\u2019t imagine living with her for an entire year.</p><p>There was no one else. No other place for Courtney to go while her father was in Brazil working as an engineer on a bridge-building project. Where he was going wasn\u2019t safe for a teenage girl, or so he insisted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason, her oldest brother, was in graduate school and had a job teaching summer classes. Her sister, Julianna, was a college junior; she was working, too, at a vacation lodge in Alaska. Courtney was the youngest. College expenses for her brother and sister kept adding up. Plain and simple, her father needed the money; otherwise, he would\u2019ve waited until Courtney had graduated from high school. Except that when she did, there wouldn\u2019t be much likelihood of getting a scholarship. Unfortunately her grades weren\u2019t the greatest and her chances of receiving an enter-college-free card were about the same as winning the lottery. In other words, her dad would be stuck paying for her, too. Spending the year in Seattle was the obvious solution.</p><p>Everything would\u2019ve been different if her mother hadn\u2019t died in that freak car accident. It\u2019d happened four years ago and still felt like yesterday.</p><p>\u201cCourtney,\u201d her grandmother called from the foot of the stairs. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandma.\u201d There was no way she could sleep in with the television blaring at five o\u2019clock in the morning. Her grandmother needed hearing aids but refused to believe it. Everyone mumbled, according to Vera Pulanski. Everyone in the whole world!</p> <p>\u201cI have breakfast cooking,\u201d her grandmother shouted.</p><p>Courtney stared up at the ceiling and rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is the most important meal of the day.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been with her grandmother for exactly a week and this was the seventh day in a row that they\u2019d had this same conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat something later,\u201d Courtney promised. The thought of dry scrambled eggs made her want to gag, but that was how her grandmother cooked them. She had all these ideas from television about what was good for a teenager and what wasn\u2019t. Apparently, the only way to prepare anything safely was to cook the hell out of it. As a result, her grandmother\u2019s scrambled eggs tasted like rubber. Not that she\u2019d ever eaten rubber, but she was convinced these would qualify.</p> <p>\u201cI hate to throw food away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grandma.\u201d With all the meals she\u2019d skipped since she arrived, Courtney figured she should\u2019ve lost weight. She hadn\u2019t. The scale had glared accusingly up at her that very morning. Fresh from the shower and completely naked, she\u2019d stepped onto the bathroom scale, a relic if there ever was one. She\u2019d closed her eyes, then peered down at the numbers and those ridiculously tiny lines between them. Her grandmother didn\u2019t seem to know about digital. Not only hadn\u2019t Courtney lost weight, but it looked as if she\u2019d gone up a pound. She wanted to weep. Starting a new school would be bad enough, but facing strangers while she was fat was even worse.</p><p>\u201cCourtney?\u201d Again her grandmother yelled at her from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandma.\u201d Vera obviously wasn\u2019t backing off this morning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out for a while. I need to run a few errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Grandma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Sighing heavily, Courtney sat up, thumped her feet onto the floor and let her shoulders slump forward. \u201cCan I stay here?\u201d she pleaded. After her shower, she\u2019d put her pajamas back on, since she couldn\u2019t think of a reason to get dressed. Not a good reason, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really like it if you joined me. You spend far too much time in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Rising slowly, Courtney went over to the doorway and shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, her grandmother nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Vera Pulanski was a wonderful woman and Courtney had always enjoyed her visits to Chicago. But this was different. She\u2019d never had to live with someone this old before. Everything in the house would sell as an antique on eBay.</p> <p>With a decided lack of enthusiasm, she pulled on her jeans and an oversize black T-shirt that had her dad\u2019s company logo on the front. When she\u2019d walked down the stairs Vera smiled sweetly and stopped her on the last step. Raising her arms, her grandmother cupped Courtney\u2019s face as she studied her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful girl.\u201d</p><p>Courtney responded with a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the apple of my eye, my youngest grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always regretted that Ralph didn\u2019t live long enough to know you.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather had died when Courtney was a few months old. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, what I\u2019m about to say is only because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Courtney bristled, bracing herself for another lecture. \u201cGrandma, please, I know I need to lose weight. You don\u2019t have to say it, all right?\u201d Courtney couldn\u2019t keep the defensiveness out of her voice. It wasn\u2019t as if she could avoid looking in mirrors. She was overweight and well aware of it. The weight gain had happened after her mother\u2019s death; until then, she\u2019d been a size ten and suddenly, poof\u2014she\u2019d blown up into a sixteen. The thing Courtney resented most was being reminded of it by all those well-meaning folks who assumed it was easy to drop thirty-five pounds.</p><p>\u201cActually, that wasn\u2019t what I wanted to say.\u201d Her grandmother released Courtney\u2019s face. \u201cI think you need friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d She missed Chicago so much, she could cry just remembering everything and everyone she\u2019d left behind. Even her house, which had been rented out for the year.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to meet anyone holed up in your room, sweetheart,\u201d her grandmother said gently. \u201cYou need to get out more.\u201d</p><p>Courtney didn\u2019t have a single argument. She lowered her eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me and I\u2019ll introduce you around.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to object, but knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Her grandmother caught her by the hand and dragged Courtney toward the kitchen. The scrambled eggs were on the table and Courtney could\u2019ve sworn they were the same eggs her grandmother had cooked the day before.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go to the library and then the grocery store and after that, the yarn store.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Courtney was being kidnapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready now, dear, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, Grandma.\u201d The sooner she gave in, the sooner she could get back to her room.</p><p>\u201cLet me check to make sure the lock on the front door is turned,\u201d her grandmother said.</p><p>Actually, it was a full seven minutes before they left the house. After checking the front door, her grandmother went into the bathroom to refresh her lipstick. Then she decided she shouldn\u2019t leave the eggs out, covered them with a piece of wrinkled plastic and set the plate in the refrigerator, which confirmed Courtney\u2019s suspicions. Those were the same eggs as the day before.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready now?\u201d her grandmother asked, as if Courtney was the one holding up the process.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d her grandmother cried. \u201cI nearly forgot my purse,\u201d she said, giggling. \u201cMy goodness, I might have locked us out of the house.\u201d</p><p>Finally they were outside. The car, parked in the driveway, could\u2019ve been in a museum. From what Courtney\u2019s father had told her, the 1968 Ford Ranch station wagon was in prime condition. Well, it should be. The car was nearly forty years old and had only 72,000 miles on it. The door weighed a ton and creaked when Courtney opened it. Without another word, she slid onto the seat next to her grandmother.</p><p>Driving with Vera was not an experience one engaged in willingly. Once she\u2019d started the engine, she turned to Courtney. \u201cLook behind us. Is anyone coming?\u201d</p><p>Courtney twisted around. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, Grandma.\u201d Then it occurred to her that her grandmother hadn\u2019t asked this out of idle curiosity. \u201cGrandma,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you turn around and look?\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother squared her shoulders. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a hearing problem, child? I can\u2019t turn my head. I have this crick in my neck. It\u2019s been there for twenty years\u2014I never had such pain. The doctor said there\u2019s nothing they can do. Nothing, and so I suffer. I don\u2019t like to complain and I wouldn\u2019t, but since you asked...\u201d</p><p>Although the thought of being a passenger while her grandmother drove terrified Courtney, she didn\u2019t say a word. What was the point? She\u2019d managed to avoid car trips for the last few days, but she\u2019d realized her luck couldn\u2019t possibly hold.</p><p>Another question occurred to her. \u201cGrandma, what would you do if I wasn\u2019t with you?\u201d Courtney suspected, fearfully, that her grandmother would just put the car in Reverse and gun it.</p><p>Tight-lipped, her grandmother adjusted the rearview mirror, using both hands to move it one way and then the other. \u201cThat\u2019s what mirrors are for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we leave now?\u201d</p><p>Her questions had clearly offended her grandmother. \u201cSure,\u201d Courtney said with an enthusiasm born of guilt.</p><p>Her grandmother half turned to glance at her as they reached the first stoplight. \u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about your weight, Courtney, I could help.\u201d</p><p>Courtney eyed her suspiciously. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExercise. I swim in the mornings and you could join me and my friends.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like much fun, but then exercise wasn\u2019t supposed to be. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an expression, Grandma. It means sure, I\u2019d like that.\u201d This was an exaggeration in the extreme, but her grandmother was making an effort to be helpful and Courtney felt she had to respond appropriately.</p><p>Their first stop after leaving Queen Anne Hill, the Seattle area where her grandmother lived, was the library, which seemed ultramodern, especially in comparison to Vera\u2019s neighborhood. Her grandmother explained that it had only recently reopened after a renovation. While Vera picked up a reserved book\u2014the latest hardcover romance by a local author\u2014Courtney flipped through Vogue magazines, trying not to despair at all the thin, elegant models. And that was just the ads.</p><p>They drove to the grocery store next. Courtney didn\u2019t have the latest census figures for the population of the Seattle Metro area\u2014she was convinced it had to be in the millions\u2014but her grandmother surely knew fifty percent of them. More times than she cared to count, they were waylaid by her grandmother\u2019s friends, former neighbors, a dozen or more people from church, bridge club members.... Courtney must have been introduced to thirty people and she swore that not a single one was under seventy.</p><p>\u201cNow Blossom Street,\u201d her grandmother said as Courtney carried the groceries out to the car. \u201cI won\u2019t be long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Courtney bit her tongue to keep from reminding her grandmother that this was what she\u2019d said at the last place. Seven conversations later, they\u2019d driven off and now Vera was working her way into the angled parking space in front of the yarn shop. She rolled an inch or so, slammed on the brake, released it enough to roll another inch, then it was brake time again. Courtney should\u2019ve predicted what would happen, but it blindsided her. Her grandmother\u2019s bumper crashed against the parking meter hard enough to jolt her forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, darn,\u201d her grandmother mumbled.</p><p>If darn was the best swear word Vera Pulanski knew, Courtney would be happy to broaden her vocabulary.</p><p>Climbing out of the car, she closed the heavy door and followed her grandmother inside. Courtney immediately walked over to the cat in the window and started petting him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Vera. How are you?\u201d a young, petite woman said.</p> <p>\u201cLydia, I\u2019m glad to see you. This is my granddaughter Courtney. Courtney, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Courtney raised her hand in greeting.</p><p>\u201cDo you knit?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>Courtney shrugged. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI taught her one summer,\u201d her grandmother boasted. \u201cShe took to it right off the bat.\u201d</p> <p>Courtney didn\u2019t remember it that way, but she didn\u2019t want to be rude.</p><p>\u201cCourtney\u2019s staying with me this year while her father\u2019s in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to listen to another lengthy explanation of her father\u2019s important engineering role in South America, Courtney left the cat and wandered through the store. She\u2019d had no idea there were so many different varieties of yarn. A display scarf knitted in variegated colors was gorgeous, and there was a felted hat and purse, a vest and a sweater.</p><p>\u201cYou could knit that scarf up in an evening,\u201d Lydia said, lifting the end of it for Courtney to inspect.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled widely. \u201cIt\u2019s easy with size thirteen needles and one skein of yarn. You cast on fifteen stitches and knit every row. It\u2019s that easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d Courtney had money with her, but hesitated. A twenty probably wasn\u2019t enough to cover the cost of the needles and yarn, and she didn\u2019t want to borrow from her grandmother.</p><p>Five minutes later, while Courtney was studying a display of patterned socks, Vera placed her purchases on the counter by the cash register. Courtney didn\u2019t know what her grandmother was currently knitting, but she always seemed to have some project or other on the go. She hurried over.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the socks?\u201d her grandmother asked.</p><p>Courtney nodded. \u201cThose new yarns are really amazing, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could knit a pair of socks like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>Courtney considered the question. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat means yes,\u201d her grandmother translated. \u201cSign her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSign me up for what?\u201d Courtney wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThe sock class,\u201d her grandmother explained. \u201cIt\u2019s time you met people, went out, got involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to have you,\u201d Lydia assured her.</p><p>\u201cMy treat,\u201d her grandmother added.</p><p>Courtney smiled, trying to show she was grateful. Actually, the idea was growing on her. She just hoped at least one other person in the sock class was under ninety years old.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>\u201cRemember that you need two socks. How to achieve this feat? Knit both at the same time, and release the idea that they need to be identical!\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I try to spend at least part of every weekend with my mother. It\u2019s been difficult for her since Dad died. Difficult for all of us. I so regret that Brad never had the opportunity to meet my father. I feel certain they would have liked each other. My dad was open and friendly, and he always found something positive in everyone he met. He had a kind word and usually a joke or two; even when I was at my sick-and-despairing worst, he could make me smile. No one told a story better than my father. I sometimes wonder if I\u2019ll ever stop thinking about him, because it seems that he\u2019s on my mind more and more instead of less.</p><p>The adjustment to life without my dad has been hardest on Mom, though; she\u2019s aged ten years in the last fourteen months. She\u2019s emotionally shrunken\u2014I don\u2019t know what else to call it. She\u2019s become frail and sad and uninterested in much. And she\u2019s shrunk physically, too, as if her body is reflecting her inner state, which is one of grief, of diminished expectations. In fact, at her last doctor\u2019s appointment, we learned that Mom is a full inch shorter than she was a few years ago.</p><p>The results of her osteoporosis tests aren\u2019t back yet. All at once, Mom has a number of medical problems, and I attribute this decline in her health not only to grief but to loneliness. My father was her anchor, her companion.</p><p>Although it sounds like a clich\u00e9, it seems as though part of her is missing; without him, she can\u2019t function the way she once did. I understand that, and to some degree I experience the same feeling. Dad was such a vital part of the woman I am.</p><p>When I arrived early Sunday afternoon, I found my mother in the backyard pruning her roses, fussing over them. Her flower garden is her pride, one of the few things she still cares about. She prunes the roses, she tells me, so they\u2019ll grow stronger. I consider Dad\u2019s death in the same light. Losing him helped me discern what was important in my life, what was real. Mostly, I needed to find my own path to happiness and to accept the challenges of independence. It was losing my father that gave me the courage to enlarge my life, and I did this by opening my own store\u2014and through my relationship with Brad.</p><p>I stood in the open doorway watching her for a few minutes. Caught up in her gardening, Mom didn\u2019t hear me. She had on a big straw hat to shield her face from the sun and wore her green garden gloves. There was a bucket at her side in which she dumped the clippings. I didn\u2019t want to frighten her so I called her name softly.</p><p>\u201cLydia!\u201d Mom turned toward me as I stepped out of the house. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be here sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I, but I got sidetracked after church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Brad and Cody?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m meeting them in an hour. We\u2019re going to walk around Green Lake.\u201d The three-mile stroll was good exercise and I get far less of that than I should. Brad, on the other hand, is in marvelous shape and can run circles around me. Cody has a golden retriever named Chase\u2014because of his terrible habit of chasing after everything and everyone. Cody would probably bring his dog, but he\u2019d been warned to keep Chase on his leash. Maybe I\u2019d get a book on dog-training and work with Cody to teach him some basic commands. Anyway, this afternoon would be fun and I was half tempted to take my in-line skates, just so I could keep up with the two\u2014or rather, three\u2014of them.</p><p>My mother\u2019s hand trembled as she snipped another branch. I\u2019d noticed the shaking more often lately. \u201cWhat did you have for lunch, Mom?\u201d I asked. Her eating habits were atrocious, and Margaret and I worried that she wasn\u2019t getting the nutrition she needed. We also worried about her medications. My fear was that some days she took more than prescribed and on others she skipped them entirely.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I eat for lunch?\u201d Mom repeated as though she needed to think about this.</p><p>\u201cLunch, Mom?\u201d I coaxed gently.</p><p>\u201cTuna and crackers,\u201d she recalled and looked at me with such a triumphant smile that I smiled back.</p><p>Still, I had to ask, \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hungry. Now, don\u2019t pester me by insisting I eat when I don\u2019t have an appetite. Your father used to do that. I didn\u2019t like it then and I refuse to listen to it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mom.\u201d I\u2019d leave it for now, but we\u2019d have to check out some alternatives. Meals on Wheels, perhaps. Or a part-time housekeeper if, between us, Margaret and I could afford one. I\u2019d discuss it with her soon.</p><p>\u201cNext Sunday is Father\u2019s Day,\u201d Mom pointed out. \u201cWill you take me to the cemetery? I\u2019d like to put a vase of my roses on your dad\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Margaret and I will both come.\u201d I was speaking out of turn and hoped my sister would agree to accompany us. She\u2019d been so prickly and out of sorts lately. The closeness we\u2019d briefly shared had evaporated like a shallow rain puddle in the sun. Whatever was wrong, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to share it with me, and frankly, that hurt. We\u2019ve come a long way in our relationship, but it was situations such as this that reminded me how far we had yet to go.</p><p>As if the strength had gone out of her legs, Mom reached for a patio chair and sat down. Lifting the hat from her head, she wiped her forehead with one arm. \u201cMy goodness, it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the temperature gauge my father had hung on the side of the house, and it read seventy-four degrees, which surprised me because it didn\u2019t feel that warm. Of course, my mother had been working outside for at least an hour, more likely two.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go out for dinner, Mom?\u201d I asked, thinking that would be a treat for us both.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, honey. I\u2019m not hungry. I met Dorothy Wallace at the Pancake Breakfast the Knights of Columbus held after Mass and we ate our fill.\u201d</p><p>Translated, she had one small pancake without butter or syrup, followed by a lunch of tuna and crackers, and she\u2019d probably skip dinner altogether.</p><p>\u201cBesides, Margaret phoned and she\u2019s stopping by with the girls later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Some of my worry left me. Margaret would make sure Mom had a decent meal at the end of the day.</p><p>\u201cShe enjoys working with you,\u201d my mother continued. \u201cShe\u2019s not one to say it, but she does.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I should mention my concerns about my sister. I decided against it, although Margaret had been weighing heavily on my mind since my conversation with Brad earlier in the week. There was no need to bring Mom into this. She\u2019d certainly mention my concerns to my sister, and that would infuriate Margaret; she would resent me for discussing her with Mom, and then I\u2019d hear about it for weeks.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her smile was distracted. \u201cI\u2019d love a glass of iced tea.\u201d</p><p>I went inside and poured one for each of us, then added slices of lemon. Several other lemons had shriveled up and I tossed them without telling Mom. A quick look in the refrigerator had revealed a carton of milk a month past its expiry date and a package of liquefying spinach. I\u2019d tossed those too. When I returned to the patio, Mom had replaced the hat and was sitting with her back to the sun.</p><p>I joined her and handed her the glass, savoring the warm sunshine against my skin, the sound of birds in the distance along with the swish, swish of the sprinkler watering the lawn.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the shop,\u201d Mom suggested. \u201cDid you get in any new yarn this week?\u201d</p><p>She especially enjoyed the stories about my customers; so many of them had become my friends, especially Jacqueline, Carol and Alix, my original class members. We\u2019ve created a real bond, the four of us, and it\u2019s rare for me not to see them during the week. If nothing else, one or two always showed up for the charity knitting session on Fridays.</p><p>I talked nonstop for almost twenty minutes about the shop and described the three women who\u2019d recently signed up for the sock class. The one who interested Mom most was Courtney Pulanski, the seventeen-year-old granddaughter of Vera Pulanski, a regular.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of holding a potluck once a month,\u201d I said, wanting her opinion on this new idea\u2014partly to allow her to feel involved and partly because I trusted her instincts. Over the years, she\u2019d been a valuable sounding board to my father in his businesses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have room at the store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, if I do a bit of shuffling.\u201d When I first opened my doors, there was room to set up a large table for classes, but as I\u2019d brought in additional lines of yarn, much of that space had disappeared. Now the table, which sat six people, was surrounded by several displays.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want food around all that yarn?\u201d</p><p>My mother echoed my own reservations. \u201cI thought we\u2019d sit at the table where I hold my classes and put the food on a card table in the office.\u201d</p> <p>My mother raised one shoulder in a half shrug. \u201cIt might work, but what would be the purpose of these monthly pot-lucks?\u201d</p><p>Good question. \u201cWell, I want my customers to get to know one another. Plus, when one person shows the others what she\u2019s knitted, it inspires them.\u201d It was for this very reason that I often knit up patterns for display in the shop. \u201cYou could join us, Mom,\u201d I said enthusiastically. \u201cMargaret and I would love that.\u201d As often as possible, I try to include her. Both Margaret and I work at giving Mom little things to look forward to so she feels active and alive.</p><p>From the way Mom frowned, I doubt she heard me. \u201cHold a monthly show-and-tell session and keep the food out of it. If you want to eat, go to a restaurant afterward.\u201d</p><p>I liked that idea. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>I could tell she was pleased I\u2019d come to her for advice. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s something she missed, since she\u2019d so often taken that role with my father. We sat and chatted for another thirty minutes and then I left to meet Brad and Cody.</p> <p>They were in the parking lot at Green Lake waiting for me, Chase tugging at the leash.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I called as I climbed out of the car. Chase wasn\u2019t the only one eager for this outing.</p><p>Cody raced over to the car and briefly hugged me. \u201cCan we go now?\u201d</p><p>His father patted his head. \u201cOkay, sport, but don\u2019t get too far ahead of us, all right? And hold on to Chase.\u201d</p><p>Cody didn\u2019t take time to answer. He was off like a rocket, boy and dog together, Cody\u2019s young legs pumping with an energy I envied.</p><p>Brad and I started walking at a brisk pace. As always on a sunny weekend day, the place was crowded with people and dogs. We passed a man with a guitar who sat on the grass strumming folk songs and a toddler chasing after a butterfly. There were a couple of canoes close to the shore. Brad and I walked side by side, keeping an eye out for Cody and Chase.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d he asked, knowing I\u2019d spent part of the afternoon with her.</p><p>Right then, I didn\u2019t want to launch into a long discussion about my anxiety over Mom. That conversation wasbest reserved for Margaret, and I\u2019d initiate it soon. \u201cShe\u2019s about the same,\u201d I said, which was true enough. \u201cMy sister and the girls are visiting later today. Mom needs that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Margaret, has she said anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I asked cautiously.</p><p>Brad reached for my hand and we entwined our fingers. I smiled up at him, forgetting Margaret. It\u2019s times like these, when we\u2019re feeling close and connected, that I get lost in a sensation of such bliss I can barely contain myself. Like any woman, I hunger for love, marriage, a family. Because of the cancer, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have that chance. Every single day, I was grateful all over again for Brad, grateful to have him in my life, grateful to be loved by him despite my imperfections and flaws. He says the fact that I\u2019ve battled cancer not once but twice makes me a two-time winner. I am a winner and I feel so incredibly blessed.</p><p>\u201cI think I know what Margaret\u2019s problem might be,\u201d Brad said, jolting me out of my reflection.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I was a little reluctant to talk about Margaret at the moment; I preferred to revel in my own contentment.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I ran into Matt at the hardware store yesterday afternoon,\u201d Brad told me.</p> <p>My brother-in-law is a salt-of-the-earth kind of guy. I consider him a good balance for my sister, who usually has a pessimistic slant on things. Matt doesn\u2019t take life as seriously as she does. I find that he doesn\u2019t overreact the way she tends to and\u2014even more appealing\u2014he never holds grudges.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Matt have to say?\u201d The four of us had gone out on occasion, and Brad and Matt had hit if off. Margaret invited us over for dinner a few months ago, and we\u2019d played cards until the wee hours of the morning. I\u2019d hoped to see more of them socially, but so far we hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not working?\u201d Matt had been with Boeing for as long as I could remember, probably twenty years.</p><p>\u201cNot working as in he got laid off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That couldn\u2019t be right. Three months? Margaret hadn\u2019t said a word about this for three months? I was in shock.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he told me. He\u2019s been pounding the pavement, looking for work, but nothing\u2019s happening for him.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank. \u201cBut I thought...\u201d I didn\u2019t know what I thought. This was crazy. I\u2019m Margaret\u2019s only sibling, and if she couldn\u2019t talk to me, then who could she confide in?</p><p>\u201cMatt seemed to think I knew, so I played along.\u201d</p><p>The tingling feeling that usually precedes tears came over me. Sure enough, I felt my eyes prickling and my throat closing up.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to cry?\u201d</p><p>I sniffled and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019d think she could\u2019ve told me,\u201d I said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cAt least you know why she\u2019s been so tense lately.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t help. \u201cI\u2019d hoped my own sister would trust me, but I was obviously wrong.\u201d I swiped the tears from my eyes before they could roll down my cheeks. Now I understood, and so much of Margaret\u2019s behaviour at the shop lately started to make sense. Not only had she been moody, but she hadn\u2019t purchased new yarn in weeks, or bought anything from the French bakery across the street. In fact, now that I thought about it, I realized she hadn\u2019t spent any money at all unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I whispered, suddenly feeling guilty. \u201cI should\u2019ve figured it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>My sister isn\u2019t the easiest person in the world to read, but in my heart I felt I should\u2019ve recognized the signs. And maybe I should\u2019ve paid more attention to the news; layoffs at Boeing always merited an article or two. I hadn\u2019t even noticed....</p><p>\u201cAre you going to say anything?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>I considered my answer carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d For her own reasons, Margaret hadn\u2019t seen fit to share this information with me. I wouldn\u2019t force her to do so now, but I hoped that in time, she\u2019d feel she could. Until then, all I could do was love her, be patient with her short-tempered comments and wait for her to trust me.</p><p>\u201cYou will, you know,\u201d Brad insisted softly. \u201cI know you too well, Lydia. You won\u2019t be able to keep this buried for long. It just isn\u2019t in your nature.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed at him, but I realized he was probably right.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise discovered that she was looking forward to starting the sock class. Without letting her daughter know, she\u2019d purchased yarn to knit David, her son-in-law, the first pair. It was a small way of showing her appreciation for his kindness in allowing Elise to live with them during this legal mess. According to a recent update from the attorney, there hadn\u2019t been much progress yet; patience was advised. She still felt mortified that, after all her careful planning, she\u2019d ended up living with her daughter and son-in-law, no matter how temporary that arrangement was.</p><p>The afternoon before the Tuesday class, Elise sat on the patio reading, an activity that never failed to satisfy her. Her love of books went back to when she was a child. She was an early reader, and could remember sitting in her crib with a book in her hands, utterly content. That love of books had served her well through the years.</p><p>Today she was rereading Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, something she did every decade or so. There were books like that, the true classics she returned to time and time again. Austen, the Bront\u00ebs, Flaubert and her favorite, George Eliot. These writers described women\u2019s lives and emotions in ways that still resonated a century or more later. She\u2019d just reached the scene where Mr. Knightley chastises Emma when Aurora opened the sliding glass door and stepped onto the patio to join her. \u201cCan we talk for a few minutes, Mom?\u201d she asked tentatively. Aurora sat on the chair next to the chaise longue where Elise reclined with her legs stretched out. Her daughter held a tall glass of tea, ice cubes clinking. She was obviously nervous.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Elise carefully inserted her bookmark and closed Emma. Judging by the way Aurora leaned forward, this was important.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about Daddy,\u201d her daughter informed her, diving headfirst into the most unpleasant of subjects.</p><p>Elise was always cautious about anything to do with her ex-husband. Maverick was a slick and dangerous man, personable to the degree that it was difficult to refuse him whatever he might want. \u201cI suppose that would be all right.\u201d Her daughter knew the basic story of how Elise had met Maverick, fallen stupidly in love and married him. The marriage hadn\u2019t lasted eighteen months, two years on paper.</p><p>Oh, how that man could talk. Elise swore he could charm a rattlesnake. From the time she was a teenager, she\u2019d known she wasn\u2019t a particularly attractive woman. Maverick had adamantly claimed otherwise, and being young and naive, Elise had delighted in those compliments, swallowing them whole. She\u2019d believed him because she so badly wanted to be as lovely as he said she was. When she was with Maverick she felt beautiful, but it didn\u2019t take her long to realize she was living a fool\u2019s dream.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d Elise asked, trying to sound as neutral as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou loved him once, right?\u201d</p><p>That was a tricky question and difficult to answer. Maverick had come into her life when she\u2019d been at a vulnerable age, when hormones had overruled common sense. At the time, she\u2019d believed she was in love but later acknowledged that it had been lust they\u2019d shared and not love. Love lasts. What they shared didn\u2019t. Yet, all these years after the divorce, she still dreamed of him, yearned for him and wished with everything she held dear that their marriage had turned out differently. The relationship might have worked if Elise could have found a way to accept the man he was.</p><p>Unfortunately she hadn\u2019t and it was too late for them. Over the years he\u2019d flitted about the country and, in her view, wasted his life. In some respects she had, too, Elise recognized sadly.</p><p>\u201cMom, you did love him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Aurora repeated anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d So much that even now it frightened her to admit it.</p><p>Her daughter relaxed visibly. \u201cWe keep in touch, you know.\u201d</p><p>Elise was aware of that. Maverick lived among the dregs of society, as she liked to put it, making his living from card-playing and God knew what else. But apparently he was successful\u2014enough to support Aurora all her life and through college. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides his regular payments and then tuition, he\u2019d always sent extra for their daughter\u2019s birthday and at Christmas. The first seventeen years following their divorce, he wrote Aurora once a month but they were never long letters. Mostly he sent postcards to let her know where he was and if he was winning. Winning had always been important to Maverick. In fact, it was everything to him. He lived in search of the elusive jackpot that would set him up for life. To the best of Elise\u2019s knowledge, he\u2019d never found it.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep in touch with your father, that has nothing to do with me,\u201d she primly informed her daughter. Elise had read those postcards, too, and wished she hadn\u2019t\u2014because she was afraid it meant she still cared, still hungered for what was destined never to be.</p><p>\u201cDad and I talk every now and then.\u201d</p><p>Elise knew that too. When Aurora was a child, she\u2019d been so excited whenever her daddy called. As an adult, she reacted the same way. Aurora hadn\u2019t been disillusioned by her father yet, and Elise hated the thought that eventually her daughter would face the same disappointment she had. Maverick didn\u2019t intend to hurt those he loved. He was simply careless with the feelings of others; the people he claimed to love never came first with him. He just couldn\u2019t be trusted. If he said he\u2019d be home by nine, he meant he\u2019d be home at nine unless there was a card game going. His moods were dictated by whether he won or lost. If he won, he was elated and jubilant, swinging Elise in his arms and planning celebration dinners. If he lost, he suffered fits of anger and despair.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming, Mom,\u201d Aurora announced. She looked directly into Elise\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d Elise repeated as a numbing sensation spread through her. \u201cTo Seattle?\u201d</p><p>Aurora nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs there some big poker tournament taking place here?\u201d Not that she was likely to know about it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming to see me,\u201d Aurora added with more than a hint of defiance.</p> <p>\u201cHow...fatherly,\u201d Elise murmured sarcastically. \u201cOnce every five or ten years he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Elise clamped her mouth shut before she could say something she\u2019d regret.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I never understood about you and Dad.\u201d Her daughter seemed to be struggling to hold on to her composure. \u201cYou make me feel like I\u2019m being disloyal to you because I choose not to ignore my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do that?\u201d This was a painful revelation, and Elise swallowed hard. All she\u2019d wanted was to protect Aurora from certain disillusionment.</p><p>Aurora nodded and the tears that brightened her eyes were testament to the truth of her words.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never realized...I\u2014I did that.\u201d The guilt was nearly overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cBut you do. Never once in all the years I was growing up did I hear my father say a negative thing about you. Not once, Mom, and yet I can\u2019t remember you ever saying a kind word about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true.\u201d Elise had tried hard to hide her feelings toward Maverick from their daughter. Surely she\u2019d succeeded\u2014hadn\u2019t she? Gazing into her daughter\u2019s pain-filled eyes, Elise realized that she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Aurora\u2019s shoulders rose in a deep sigh. \u201cPlease, Mom, I don\u2019t want to argue about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either.\u201d Racked with self-recrimination, Elise patted her daughter\u2019s knee. \u201cYour father is...your father. I wish I\u2019d given you a better one, but that\u2019s my mistake, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Aurora cried. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything good to say about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one married to him, remember? I loved Maverick but we weren\u2019t meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he failed you. He admits it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe failed you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some ways, yes, he did,\u201d Aurora agreed, \u201cbut in other ways he was a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>Elise understood that Aurora had to believe this. Maverick was the only father she had, and his behavior, his long absences, were all she knew. If she\u2019d ever wondered why he traveled as much as he did, she\u2019d never asked her mother.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Elise said. The numbness had started to leave her. \u201cYour father is visiting Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d Aurora seemed to be waiting for more of a response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a single qualm about you seeing your father,\u201d Elise assured her. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even met his grandsons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to that.\u201d</p><p>Again Aurora stared at Elise as if expecting something more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to see him,\u201d Elise said. Any encounter with him would be impossible. If Aurora wanted permission to visit with her father, then that was fine with Elise. But when it happened, Elise didn\u2019t plan to be anywhere in the vicinity. \u201cHave him over for dinner or whatever. I\u2019ll conveniently be out for the evening or however long you need.\u201d</p><p>Maverick would thank her. Elise was fairly sure he wasn\u2019t any more interested in seeing her than she was in seeing him. They hadn\u2019t spoken in years. There\u2019d been no reason for them to have contact, which was the way Elise preferred it.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to avoid seeing Dad,\u201d her daughter said, her eyes fluttering in every direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat you do mean?\u201d Elise demanded as a sinking feeling settled over her.</p><p>\u201cDad will be staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the house?\u201d Elise was aghast. This couldn\u2019t be true, but she knew from the undeniable confirmation in Aurora\u2019s face that it was. The numbness was back in full force, and spreading down to her legs. \u201cDoes he know I\u2019m living with you?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter answered with a nod. \u201cI told him, but he still wants to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...how long?\u201d</p><p>Aurora hesitated. \u201cTwo weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d Elise exploded. The book fell onto the patio floor as she sat upright. \u201cThat\u2019s out of the question! You can\u2019t possibly believe the two of us can remain in the same house\u2014together\u2014for that length of time.\u201d She blamed Maverick for this. He\u2019d manipulated their daughter into agreeing to it, no doubt because he was down on his luck and penniless. Elise wanted to weep. \u201cI\u2019ll find someplace else for a while,\u201d she murmured, thinking out loud. Really, that would be her preference, but all her things were in storage and God only knew where she could move for that short a period.</p><p>\u201cMom, calm down.\u201d Then, in a softer voice, she added, \u201cPlease. There\u2019s no need to overreact.\u201d</p><p>Sliding her legs over the edge of the chaise, Elise felt like burying her face in her hands, an urge she resisted. This was going to be a disaster, but her daughter didn\u2019t seem to recognize that.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s never asked anything of me before,\u201d Aurora said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t refuse him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried the pity approach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped and seemed offended that Elise would suggest it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. Dad has always been generous and wonderful to David, me and the boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man isn\u2019t to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only the way you view him, but to me, he\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>Elise felt guilty all over again. She was determined not to say another negative word about her ex-husband. \u201cOkay, so he\u2019s going to visit for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Aurora nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure he knows I\u2019m living with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d From the tone of her daughter\u2019s voice, Elise suspected this was a complication Maverick hadn\u2019t expected. Well, whatever he was after, whatever he wanted, he\u2019d have to get it past Elise\u2014and she, thankfully, was wise to him. She wouldn\u2019t be so easily fooled.</p><p>\u201cWhere will he sleep?\u201d The three-bedroom house was adequate in size but there wasn\u2019t a guest room. Elise had taken the third bedroom and arranged it into a tiny studio-like apartment. She had a microwave, her own bathroom, a television area complete with rocking chair, and her single bed. That was all she needed. She had privacy, a small refuge from the world, and could retreat to her room in order to give her daughter and family their own space.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting Dad in with the boys.\u201d</p><p>That was a wise decision. Her grandsons, while an absolute delight, could be little hellions. Maverick was unaccustomed to being around children. Elise suspected he wouldn\u2019t last long sleeping in the same room as Luke and John.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the easiest situation,\u201d Aurora continued.</p><p>Elise rolled her eyes toward the sky. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d Then she instantly felt another wave of guilt.</p><p>\u201cI need you to work with me, Mom, not against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything to hurt you,\u201d Elise told her daughter, hiding her distress that Aurora would even imply such a thing.</p><p>\u201cBut you want to hurt Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Elise denied hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t have any feelings toward your father one way or the other.\u201d That was a lie and her face flushed with color as she said it.</p><p>\u201cMo\u2014ther,\u201d her daughter cried, challenge in each over-enunciated syllable. \u201cYou have so many unresolved issues with Dad, it would take days to list them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d Her daughter knew her well, but at this moment what mattered was maintaining a pretense of complete indifference. Somehow she\u2019d survive these two weeks.</p><p>Aurora sampled her iced tea for the first time, her knuckles white around the glass. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that with you, especially now. I need your word that you won\u2019t say or do anything, and I mean anything, to upset Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to keep the peace. I don\u2019t want to subject the boys to your anger toward Dad.\u201d</p><p>Elise was upset that her daughter could believe she\u2019d be the one to cause problems. \u201cYou have my word I will do whatever I can to make your father\u2019s stay as pleasant as possible.\u201d If that meant hiding in her room for the next two weeks, then so be it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t promise this lightly, Mom. It\u2019s the most important request I\u2019ve ever made of you.\u201d</p><p>Elise wondered again whether she should move out and save them all this grief. Sadly, she had nowhere else to go. She was stuck in the same house with the man she\u2019d both loved and hated for the last thirty-seven years.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>\u201cWell-fitting and carefully knitted handmade socks are the \u2018real\u2019 ones; the store-bought variety are just pale imitations.\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>This was my first sock class and I was excited about our one-o\u2019clock gathering. In the last year, I\u2019ve taught several classes, and I\u2019ve learned in the course of teaching that it\u2019s critical to have the right mix of personalities. I had my doubts about the women making up this class, but I didn\u2019t want to borrow trouble.</p><p>The personalities of the three women who\u2019d enrolled for this one reminded me of my first knitting class the year before. Elise, Bethanne and Courtney had nothing in common that I could see, except a desire to knit. I\u2019d felt the same way about the baby blanket class with Jacqueline, Carol and Alix. They were as different as any three women could be and yet we\u2019d all forged enduring friendships in a remarkably short time. I continued to marvel over that and hoped history would repeat itself, although I didn\u2019t really expect it. Generally I\u2019m not a pessimist\u2014unlike my sister\u2014but Elise Beaumont struck me as unyielding and circumspect, so self-contained. Bethanne Hamlin, judging by our brief meeting, was nervous and jittery, ready to run and hide at the slightest noise. Courtney Pulanski was a teenager. I felt sorry for her\u2014the poor kid looked aghast when her grandmother insisted on signing her up. Unfortunately, I just didn\u2019t see these three people as a good mix. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cast a glance toward Margaret, who was busy with a customer as I prepared for the class. This morning, first thing, I\u2019d given my sister an opportunity to open up to me about Matt\u2019s work situation, but she remained closemouthed. I found it difficult to disguise my disappointment, but I didn\u2019t feel I could let on what I knew. Nor did I want to pressure my sister into confiding in me. My heart ached for her\u2014and for me, too. I had a dozen questions I was dying to ask; among my other concerns, I wanted to know how my nieces, Julia and Hailey, were handling this. I\u2019ve always been close to them, and I believed they would have mentioned it to me unless Margaret had forbidden it. In some ways, I could understand my sister\u2019s reluctance, but that didn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed and Elise Beaumont walked into the shop. She wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d call a warm, friendly person, but she\u2019d been cordial enough on our first meeting. This morning, however, she radiated displeasure. She also looked as if she hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Had I known her longer I might have asked, but since she was a new customer, I decided against it. Oh dear, this class was not getting off to a good start.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d I hoped my greeting would draw her out, but she frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cI need to know how long this class will take.\u201d</p> <p>I reached for the flyer Margaret had made on the computer and handed it to her as a reminder. \u201cTwo hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019ll be all right.\u201d With a glum expression, Elise pulled out a chair and sat down at the table, placing her knitting bag in her lap.</p><p>I remembered that she\u2019d already chosen what she\u2019d need for the class\u2014a self-patterning yarn in light blue with specks of gray and black. Presumably she\u2019d be knitting her socks for a man.</p><p>No sooner was Elise at the table than Bethanne entered, dressed rather formally, in my opinion, followed almost immediately by Courtney, who couldn\u2019t have looked less formal in her jeans and oversize T-shirt. Without a word they each walked to the back of the store and took a seat at the table, as far apart as possible.</p><p>I stepped up to one end and smiled. \u201cI see we\u2019re all here. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy learning the craft of knitting socks with circular needles. We\u2019re in for a bit of a knitting adventure, but I know you won\u2019t be disappointed. I think it\u2019d be best if we began with introductions. Why don\u2019t you all tell us something about yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>My students stared up at me; they seemed to be waiting for someone else to start. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go first,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m Lydia Hoffman, and I opened A Good Yarn just over a year ago. I love knitting, and this gives me a chance to do something I really care about. I also love the opportunity to convert others.\u201d I grinned as I said this and gestured to Courtney to go next.</p><p>The teenager straightened and glanced at the other two women. \u201cHi,\u201d she said and gave a short wave. \u201cMy name is Courtney Pulanski. I\u2019m seventeen, and I recently moved in with my grandmother for my senior year of high school. My mother died a few years ago and Dad\u2019s working in Brazil as an engineer.\u201d She hesitated, then added, \u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re living with your grandmother your senior year?\u201d Elise repeated sympathetically. \u201cThat must be difficult.\u201d</p><p>Courtney swallowed hard. \u201cDad agonized over the decision and so did I, but it seemed to make the most sense. I\u2019m close to my sister and brother and we talk practically every day. Dad sends me e-mails, too, when he can, but he\u2019s been busy and, well\u2014I know he\u2019s thinking about all of us.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded. \u201cThat helps, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d the girl whispered and looked down, obviously fighting back tears.</p> <p>Wanting to remove the focus from Courtney, I smiled at Bethanne. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Bethanne said, leaning forward. \u201cMy name is Bethanne Hamlin. I\u2019m a wife and mother of two.\u201d She stopped a moment and her distress went straight to my heart. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not a wife but an ex-wife. My husband and I were recently divorced.\u201d She turned to Elise, as though anticipating a comment, and warded it off by adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get divorced. But now that I\u2019m no longer married, my daughter insisted I needed to do something for myself.\u201d She ended on a soft, forced laugh. \u201cSo here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve knitted before, though, right?\u201d I asked, certain that I remembered Bethanne telling me she\u2019d once been an avid knitter.</p><p>\u201cI completed several projects\u2014fairly simple ones\u2014when the kids were young. I have the yarn and the pattern for this class, and everything\u2019s lovely, but I\u2019m afraid I might be in over my head. Socks sound too complicated for me.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne seemed ready to give up before she\u2019d even begun. \u201cWith only the three of you in this class, I\u2019ll be able to give you individual attention,\u201d I assured her, \u201cso don\u2019t worry about that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was wondering, you know,\u201d Bethanne said hesitantly, \u201cif I find I can\u2019t do this, what\u2019s the refund policy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no refunds, sorry.\u201d I just couldn\u2019t afford it, and I didn\u2019t want to encourage a defeatist attitude. \u201cElise?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Elise Beaumont and some of you might recognize me from Harry S. Truman Elementary School, where I served as librarian for thirty-eight years. I retired a little while ago and was looking for a project that would hold my interest. I thought I\u2019d try my hand at knitting socks.\u201d She sat back when she\u2019d finished speaking.</p> <p>I gave the three a few seconds to digest the information they\u2019d shared, then said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re all here. While this class might be small in number, I generally find that to be an advantage. Once you get into knitting socks,\u201d I continued, \u201cyou\u2019ll wonder what took you so long. They\u2019re fun, and with the circular needle method they could almost be considered easy.\u201d</p><p>My students listened as I showed them a variety of yarns available for socks, from fingering weight all the way to the Double Knit weight. I wanted to start them with a basic sock, but I explained that the designs would be as varied and as different as the yarn itself. I chose a Nancy Bush pattern. Nancy\u2019s were among my favorites and I knew my students would like them as much as I did.</p><p>\u201cThe lesson today involves the Norwegian sock cast-on,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit different than what you might be accustomed to, but I have a good reason for recommending it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds complicated,\u201d Bethanne said, watching me closely as I twisted the yarn around the needle. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of heaven, you haven\u2019t even seen how it\u2019s done yet,\u201d Elise muttered, suddenly short-tempered. \u201cLet Lydia show us first and then you can complain.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne seemed to go deep inside herself and didn\u2019t utter another word.</p><p>\u201cLet me demonstrate, Bethanne. It\u2019s not nearly as complicated as it looks,\u201d I said, wanting to cover the awkwardness of the moment. Whatever had upset Elise, she clearly was taking it out on poor Bethanne. From the second she\u2019d walked in the door, I could tell she was aggrieved about something.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother suggested I do the Knit Two-Purl Two rather than the Knit One-Purl One for a crew sock,\u201d Courtney said.</p><p>I loved Vera, the girl\u2019s grandmother, who was an accomplished knitter and one of my regular customers. I wondered why she hadn\u2019t decided to teach Courtney herself, because she was more than qualified to do so.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother\u2019s right. The Knit Two-Purl Two method gives the sock more elasticity, but we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d</p><p>I talked for a few minutes about knitting a sock that would fit the foot properly. I also passed around a gauge to help the class figure out the proper number of stitches to cast on according to the weight of the yarn. The light, fingering style yarn required more stitches, the heavier yarns fewer.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone still with me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>All three nodded. I spent the remainder of the class teaching the Norwegian method of casting on and how to work with the two circular needles. Courtney picked up on everything right away. She finished first and looked up proudly while both Elise and Bethanne struggled with the needles and the yarn.</p><p>Most of my time was spent helping Bethanne. I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t lying when she said she\u2019d knit years earlier, but she could barely hold on to the yarn and needles now. I\u2019d never met a less confident woman and I have to admit Bethanne tried my patience.</p><p>My reaction to Elise\u2019s difficulty wasn\u2019t much better. She didn\u2019t mutter an unnecessary word following her chastisement of Bethanne and I sensed she regretted the outburst. I also had the distinct feeling that she found me lacking as a teacher. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable sensation.</p><p>After they\u2019d finished, gathered up their supplies and left, I felt as if I\u2019d put in a full day. I was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the class go?\u201d Margaret asked, joining me in the back office as I made myself some tea.</p><p>\u201cDreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not wanting to talk about it. It suddenly occurred to me that this might very well explain how my sister felt about discussing the troubles in her own life.</p><p>\u201cI can see this isn\u2019t going to be a good class,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Margaret was unaccustomed to a pessimistic outlook from me. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a feeling...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that feeling is?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cElise is cranky. Bethanne is panicky and convinced she can\u2019t remember how to knit. And Courtney is resentful.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I was going to regret offering this class.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>After her knitting class, Bethanne waited at the white wrought-iron table outside the French bakery. Grant had reluctantly agreed to meet her, but it didn\u2019t escape her notice that he\u2019d chosen a public place, as if he anticipated her making a scene. She had no intention of doing any such thing; all she wanted was some help and advice. She hoped they could discuss the situation in a civil manner. Surprisingly perhaps, she didn\u2019t hate Grant, and for the sake of their children, they needed to work together. Surely he recognized that, too.</p><p>Sipping an espresso, Bethanne hoped the strong hot coffee would bolster her courage. This would be an unpleasant conversation, especially when she brought up the subject of money.</p><p>Grant rounded the corner on foot and Bethanne wondered where he\u2019d parked. She saw him before he saw her. He was a striking man, and even though he\u2019d betrayed her in the most fundamental way, she couldn\u2019t stop loving him. It angered her that she still had feelings for him, but her love was mingled with anger and horror and disbelief. This man walking toward her now was a virtual stranger.</p><p>When Grant caught sight of her, he didn\u2019t smile; instead, he acknowledged Bethanne with a quick nod. She\u2019d worn a black tailored blazer over a light-green silk blouse and expensive black trousers, and her hair was neatly drawn back with a large silver clip. He didn\u2019t react to her appearance at all, even though he used to admire how she looked in this outfit. He pulled out the wrought-iron chair and sat down without a smile or any indication of pleasure at seeing her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d she asked, thinking this would be easier if they were both relaxed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cI only have a few minutes. Now what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne fought back emotion at the curt way he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s about Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said on the phone, and frankly I don\u2019t see what she\u2019s done that\u2019s so far outside of the norm. Okay, she\u2019s angry. It\u2019s to be expected and Tiff\u2019s been a good sport about putting up with the magazine subscriptions and the calls from the blood bank. You\u2019re the one who seems to think Annie\u2019s got this pent-up rage that\u2019s about to explode.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it, Grant, I know it. I\u2019m worried...even Andrew\u2019s worried. He wouldn\u2019t have come to me if he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, so you and Andrew are worried. I don\u2019t mean to sound callous here, but I don\u2019t think Annie\u2019s that overwrought. A certain amount of animosity is normal and she\u2019ll get past that soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t the one living with her,\u201d Bethanne argued. \u201cI am. Yes, on the surface she seems to be adjusting, but she isn\u2019t.\u201d Grant shook his head contemptuously and she found herself growing even angrier. \u201cWhen did you become an expert on the effects of divorce on teenage girls? What did you do, read a book?\u201d It would be too much to expect that he\u2019d talked to a counsellor.</p><p>Grant sighed and leaned back in his chair. \u201cI know she\u2019s taken up running, and that\u2019s a good way for her to vent her frustration,\u201d he said, ignoring her question.</p><p>\u201cI know...I agree, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re using the kids as a convenient way to get to me,\u201d he said, challenge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGet to you?\u201d She managed not to yell. Her anger threatened to erupt but for the sake of her children, and because they were in a public place, Bethanne forced it down. She\u2019d hoped to reach him, to show him that their daughter had a serious problem. She wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with Annie and she wanted, needed, his help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to feel guilty,\u201d Grant muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do here. You\u2019re manipulating me, and Annie\u2019s just as bad. God knows both kids are yanking my chain. According to the terms of the divorce, they\u2019re supposed to spend every other weekend with me. They refuse, and you let them! Well, I\u2019m sick of your games\u2014and theirs too.\u201d</p><p>It was true; Andrew and Annie strenuously resisted all her efforts to send them to Grant\u2019s place for the mandated weekends. She couldn\u2019t force them to go. Not at their age.</p><p>\u201cBut, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stood as if he\u2019d said everything he intended to say.</p> <p>Bethanne knew that unless she confessed what she\u2019d done, Grant would simply walk away. \u201cI...I read Annie\u2019s journal.\u201d She wasn\u2019t proud of that, but instinct had told her something was wrong. The few entries she\u2019d read had made her blood run cold. Annie had experimented with drugs and was sneaking out at night, meeting her new \u201cfriends.\u201d The boys Annie wrote about weren\u2019t the ones Bethanne had met and what went on during these secret meetings she was afraid to speculate.</p><p>Grant sat back down. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read her journal. Oh, Grant, you don\u2019t have any idea how furious she is at both of us. She\u2019s fooling around with...with things she shouldn\u2019t, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as if to say Bethanne should have expected this. \u201cShe\u2019ll get over it. This divorce was a shock, and we need to give her time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it?\u201d Bethanne repeated. Grant didn\u2019t even seem to care. The pain in her chest nearly suffocated her. She wondered if he\u2019d always been this callous and she just hadn\u2019t seen it or if he\u2019d changed completely in so short a time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal in this kind of situation.\u201d</p><p>Normal? Normal that he\u2019d abandon his family? Normal that he\u2019d inflict this pain on the very people he\u2019d vowed to love and cherish\u2014and then shrug it off as if it meant nothing? Normal that in her pain and rage Annie would risk destroying her own life? Hearing Grant talk so flippantly about their daughter nearly crushed her heart.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Bethanne murmured, and stared down at her coffee. \u201cBut I thought I should give you fair warning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2019s little problem with hate.\u201d She\u2019d planned to tell him that, according to Andrew, their daughter was going to step up her campaign against Tiffany, but she\u2019d let Grant deal with it.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cOne small thing.\u201d Bethanne circled the coffee cup with both hands and refused to meet his eyes. Discussing money with her ex-husband was distasteful.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked with a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>\u201cAndrew has signed up for football camp.\u201d Their son was a talented athlete and Bethanne was sure he\u2019d be offered a scholarship to either the University of Washington or Washington State.</p><p>\u201cYes, so I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the money for it.\u201d It was embarrassing to admit this, but she had no choice. \u201cIf you could pick up the cost of the camp, then I\u2019ll cover everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by everything else?\u201d he asked. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Already she was worried about a number of upcoming expenses\u2014expenses she didn\u2019t know how she could meet. \u201cI got a notice at the end of the school year that athletic fees will double in September. The school levy failed and\u2014well, with that plus the expense of his senior pictures, I thought it was only fair that you cover the cost of the camp.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to mention that when school started again in September, there\u2019d also be the cost of new clothes and a hundred other related expenses.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t afford the camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, but then there wouldn\u2019t be enough left over to make the house payment.\u201d</p><p>Grant didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cI was afraid of this,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Bethanne could only imagine what he meant. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to run to you every time I need money,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Surely he understood that the child support he\u2019d been ordered to pay didn\u2019t begin to cover what it cost to raise two teenagers.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, listen, I can\u2019t help you. Please don\u2019t come to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you alimony and child support. Have you got a job yet?\u201d</p><p>Eyes cast down, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured. Have you even tried looking?\u201d he asked sarcastically, as if he already knew the answer. \u201cEvery penny you\u2019re now collecting comes directly from me. I don\u2019t see you making any effort to support yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have tried, but I don\u2019t know what else to do, where to look.\u201d Admitting her weakness was humiliating. She longed to lash out at him, blame him, curse him, but it would do no good, so once again she swallowed what little was left of her pride.</p><p>\u201cStart looking for a job by reading the newspaper,\u201d Grant suggested in a condescending tone. \u201cIf nothing else, you can open a child-care center at the house. You always prided yourself on being a good mother.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne used to think she was, but she\u2019d also thought of herself as a good wife. Apparently not. She tried to shake off these feelings of failure.</p><p>\u201cUse your natural skills,\u201d Grant went on, \u201cin a way that isn\u2019t a constant drain on me.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the blow his words dealt her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be ugly here, but it\u2019s time you woke up and smelled the coffee.\u201d He smiled at his own feeble joke, since she was sipping an espresso. \u201cIn two years, Annie will have graduated from high school and the child support payments will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about college?\u201d That had already been determined in the divorce settlement, as she had every intention of reminding him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re splitting the college expenses, remember? That means not only will you need to be self-supporting, but you\u2019ll have to earn enough to pay your portion of the kids\u2019 expenses. I suggest you find yourself a career in short order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always have an excuse, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>This time it was Bethanne who stood, eager to leave, to escape from this cold, selfish man who\u2019d done everything in his power to destroy her. Now more than ever she was determined to prove him wrong.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Grant. Don\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll trouble you again,\u201d she said from between clenched teeth. She glared at him, hoping he could see and feel her contempt. How had she managed to live with him all those years and not know the kind of man he was?</p><p>Bethanne left the caf\u00e9, but once Grant had stalked off in the opposite direction she required a few minutes to compose herself before she headed down the street to where she\u2019d parked the car, her knitting stashed in the trunk. She\u2019d already tried to get a refund for the class, which was an unnecessary expense, but it was too late now. The money had been spent; she wouldn\u2019t waste it.</p><p>As she reached her car, she noticed a brand-new Cadillac turning the corner. It was the style and color Grant had mentioned wanting\u2014before the divorce. Her eyes flashed to the driver and, sure enough, it was her ex, driving a car so new it still carried the dealer\u2019s plates. He refused to help her with the cost of football camp for Andrew, but he could afford an expensive car he didn\u2019t even need.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>\u201cCourtney!\u201d</p><p>Courtney heard her name being called up the stairs but, still warm and sleepy, she chose to ignore it and linger in bed.</p><p>\u201cCourtney!\u201d the discordant voice persisted. \u201cYou asked me to get you up, remember?\u201d</p><p>She groaned, rolled over and opened one reluctant eye to stare at the antique clock on her bedstand. Her grandmother didn\u2019t have a digital clock in the whole house. The big hand was on the six and the little hand on the five. It was five-thirty!</p><p>\u201cCourtney!\u201d her grandmother shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard for me to go up and down these stairs, but I will if I have to. Now get up!\u201d</p><p>Tossing aside the warm covers, Courtney staggered out of bed and to the top of the staircase. \u201cI\u2019m up.\u201d She just didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness.\u201d Vera Pulanski paused on the third step and looked greatly relieved to be spared the agony of the climb. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready to leave in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Courtney stared blankly into space until she realized that wherever her grandmother was going, she intended on taking Courtney with her. \u201cIt\u2019s only five-thirty.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother turned back to face her. \u201cI know what time it is. I want to be at the pool when it opens at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d This was dreadful. Yes, they\u2019d discussed swimming but Courtney had no idea that she\u2019d have to get up at this ungodly hour. In fact, the entire discussion was a distant and rather unpleasant memory. Her grandmother had said that if Courtney wanted to lose weight, she should start exercising. She vaguely recalled that she\u2019d agreed to give swimming a try, more to satisfy her grandmother than anything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Needing to hurry, Courtney dug her bathing suit out of her bottom drawer and prayed it still fit. A lot of her clothes didn\u2019t anymore, and she had to go through several contortions to zip up her jeans. Most of her shirts no longer buttoned without leaving a gap, so she wore them open over a tank top. It wasn\u2019t so easy to hide her weight gain with jeans, though, and already the stitching was threatening to rip.</p><p>\u201cI have an extra towel.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s voice floated up the stairs again. \u201cDon\u2019t take any of the ones from the bathroom. They\u2019re part of a set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Grandma,\u201d Courtney yelled back. She stripped off her pjs and stepped into the one-piece suit, pulling it up over her thighs. It fit, but just barely. Pride demanded that she not look in the mirror. The consolation was that she probably wouldn\u2019t see anyone her age at the pool this early in the morning. She donned sweatpants and a T-shirt, slipped her feet into flip-flops and trudged down the stairs.</p><p>Her grandmother was waiting by the door and handed Courtney a towel, purple cap and goggles. \u201cThey\u2019re old,\u201d she said, referring to the goggles, \u201cbut they\u2019ll be all right until we can buy you a new pair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really into this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Actually, Courtney was impressed. She hadn\u2019t known that people as old as her grandmother went swimming.</p><p>More surprises awaited her. The Olympic-length pool was in the high school. The adult lap swim session started at six and lasted until seven-thirty every morning. The lobby was filled with older people who all seemed to know each other.</p><p>Courtney walked in with her grandmother and, from the greetings she received, one would assume Vera had been gone for months. Her grandmother painstakingly introduced Courtney to her swimming buddies. A dozen names flew by so fast she had no hope of keeping track, but she did try. As much as possible, she attempted to blend into the wall. The sun might be up and shining but no reasonable person should be, in Courtney\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you like living in Seattle?\u201d one of her grandmother\u2019s friends asked.</p><p>Courtney thought the woman\u2019s name was Leta. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great.\u201d She forced some enthusiasm into her voice. Well, it might be if she met someone younger than eighty. This whole knitting thing was a major disappointment, too. First, she\u2019d had no idea the class would be so small. There were only two other women and both were way older. One was around her grandmother\u2019s age and a real biddy. She looked like she\u2019d been sucking lemons half her life. The other woman was probably close to her mother\u2019s age\u2014if her mother had been alive.</p> <p>A sick sensation hit Courtney in the pit of her stomach as she thought about her mother. It shouldn\u2019t still hurt like this, but it did. Her brother and sister seemed to deal with the loss so much better than Courtney. No one wanted to talk about Mom anymore, and Courtney felt as if she was supposed to forget she\u2019d ever had a mother. She couldn\u2019t and she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Julianna, her sister, hadn\u2019t gained thirty-five pounds the way Courtney had. In fact, her sister had lost weight. Jason thought weight was a nonissue. The one and only time Courtney had talked to her brother about her problem, he\u2019d shrugged it off. His advice was to lose the weight if it bothered her so much. He said it like it was easy. If getting weight off was that simple, she would\u2019ve done it long ago.</p><p>\u201cWe have rules here at the pool,\u201d Leta said, moving closer to Courtney. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever written them down, but it helps if you follow them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know the middle shower is mine. I\u2019ve used it for eighteen years and if you get out of the pool first, I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d leave that shower for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Courtney made an effort to remember this.</p> <p>\u201cWet your hair before you get in the water,\u201d another of her grandmother\u2019s friends advised, joining Leta. \u201cDrench it real good, otherwise the chlorine will ruin your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a cap, don\u2019t you?\u201d someone else asked. \u201cI hate swimming and having my hands come up full of someone\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>Yuck. What a disgusting concept. \u201cGrandma gave me a cap.\u201d She hadn\u2019t planned to use it, but Courtney could see that she was likely to get booted out if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow fast a swimmer are you?\u201d Leta asked.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should use the middle lane,\u201d Courtney\u2019s grandmother suggested. \u201cMost of us swim in the first lane,\u201d she explained to Courtney. \u201cThe third lane is for the fast swimmers. Start in the middle lane and see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Courtney was waking up now, and everything was beginning to make sense. Sort of. Don\u2019t use the middle shower, but swim in the middle lane and wear a cap, but get her hair completely wet first. So far, so good.</p><p>Courtney just hoped all this exercise wouldn\u2019t make her hungry.</p> <p>When the doors opened, the group flowed into the pool area. The men turned right and made their way to one end, while the women went left toward their locker room.</p><p>Courtney followed her grandmother, Leta and the others. Vera already had her bag inside her locker when Courtney caught up to her. She took her time climbing out of her sweatpants, unwilling to have these older women view her chubby arms and legs. Her fear was that one of them\u2014or even her own grandmother\u2014would comment on the fact that her swimsuit was too tight.</p><p>She needn\u2019t have worried. The women were intent on getting into the water and no one gave her any attention, for which Courtney was grateful. Nevertheless, she waited until the locker room had cleared out before she stripped down to her swimsuit.</p><p>Taking the advice she\u2019d been given, she walked over to the shower area, turned on the faucet in the end shower and stuck her head inside. She wrung out her soaking wet hair and stuffed it inside the purple cap, thankful she didn\u2019t know a soul. Anyone from home who saw her now would be hysterical.</p><p>But this was no laughing matter to Courtney. When school started in six weeks, she wanted to walk into class looking good\u2014and she didn\u2019t care what she had to do to achieve that. If losing weight meant waking up before the birds, consorting with women five or six times her age and abiding by all the unwritten rules at the pool, then she\u2019d do it.</p><p>Leaving the change room took courage and she made a dash from the doorway to the water, attempting to look as cool and nonchalant as possible. The shock of the pool\u2019s temperature when Courtney stepped down from the ladder nearly made her gasp. It was cold. The sign might say 81 degrees, but she swore it was closer to 70.</p><p>Her grandmother and friends had already begun their routines. Observing them, Courtney realized they swam in circles inside each lane\u2014down one side and back up the other. Several of the women were walking in the shallow end, chatting as they went, and Courtney scooted past them, keeping her arms raised and out of the cold water. When she came to the lane divider, she had no choice but to go under. Freezing! The water surrounding the Titanic couldn\u2019t have been this cold.</p><p>Once she was positioned in the middle lane, Courtney braced her feet against the wall and pushed off. She was panting by the time she swam to the far side and grabbed hold of the pool\u2019s edge until she caught her breath.</p><p>Her grandmother and friends had no such problem. They might be eighty years old, but not only did they swim the entire length of the pool, they didn\u2019t pause before turning and going back. Not even to breathe.</p><p>Courtney went a total of ten laps, resting after each one. When she finished number ten, she stopped long enough to adjust her goggles, even though they were fine. It gave her an excuse to take an extra breather. She was now ready to start her eleventh lap and felt downright proud.</p><p>Her grandmother had explained that sixteen laps was half a mile. In that case, half a mile in the water was a hell of a lot further than on land. Doing a quick calculation, she decided she\u2019d already swum three-quarters of half a mile. This was great!</p><p>As soon as she got back to the house, Courtney planned to weigh herself. After such an intense workout she had to be down. It would be a relief to see that thin dial move in the opposite direction for once.</p><p>\u201cTime to get out,\u201d her grandmother told her before she could start the eleventh lap.</p><p>\u201cI want to do a couple more,\u201d Courtney protested.</p><p>\u201cNot on Wednesdays. The swim team comes in at seven.\u201d</p><p>A chill that had nothing to do with the water went through Courtney. \u201cSwim team? Please tell me this isn\u2019t the high-school swim team.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother lifted the goggles from her head and stared at Courtney in puzzlement. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>Of course it was a problem. It was bad enough to expose her body to her grandmother\u2019s friends, but she was horrified at the thought of anyone from the high school seeing her like this.</p><p>What a disaster. To complicate everything, she hadn\u2019t even brought her towel out from the locker room. She glanced through one of the large windows enclosing the pool. Just as she was about to leap out of the water and run for it, the foyer door opened and a line of impossibly thin girls filed in. Courtney didn\u2019t dare look at the guys who followed. The girls on the swim team were intimidation enough.</p><p>She froze, unsure what to do. If she climbed out now, she\u2019d expose her too-tight swimsuit and her fat to all those girls. They\u2019d certainly notice someone her age with all these old ladies.</p><p>\u201cCourtney,\u201d her grandmother said loudly, standing on the deck. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sank to the bottom of the pool and sat there for a moment, wishing she could just disappear.</p><p>Eventually she was forced to climb out of the water and reveal herself to the world. She kept her gaze on the floor as she shuffled into the locker room, now crowded with stick-figured teenagers.</p><p>For two weeks Courtney had been dying to meet someone her own age\u2014but not like this, when she was practically naked and at her worst. These swim-team girls didn\u2019t have an ounce of extra weight on them. They were perfect.</p><p>Head lowered, Courtney hurried to her locker.</p><p>\u201cYou need to shower,\u201d Leta said, stepping up next to her. \u201cI\u2019m finished, so you can use the middle one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shower once I get home,\u201d Courtney muttered. She grabbed her towel, wrapping it around her as if she were in danger of freezing to death.</p><p>\u201cYou should take a shower,\u201d her grandmother\u2019s friend continued. \u201cGet that chlorine off you.\u201d</p><p>No way would Courtney strip off her swimsuit in the shower, especially now.</p><p>She happened to glance up just then and saw two girls with their heads together, whispering. They looked directly at her. Sure as anything, Courtney knew they were talking about her. Turning her back, she buried her face in her hands. One day in the not-too-distant future, she\u2019d see these very girls in the high-school halls.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>\u201cTo grow as a knitter, don\u2019t be afraid to take chances. Knitting is a far safer sport than sky-diving. Very little is ever irrevocable!\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>By Saturday it was all I could do to keep quiet when it came to dealing with Margaret. I was hurt and angry that she\u2019d been so secretive about Matt for all these weeks. Now that I did know, I found myself watching her more closely. The longer she kept up this charade, the more offended I got. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saturdays were generally my busiest day of the week, but sales tended to slow down toward the end of the month, just before payday.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any special plans for the fourth?\u201d I asked Margaret when there was a lull shortly after noon.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She didn\u2019t exhibit a lot of enthusiasm one way or the other. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing definite yet.\u201d Brad and I hadn\u2019t made any formal plans, but I wanted to suggest we drive to the ocean, have a picnic and watch the fireworks there with Cody and Chase. The last time I visited Ocean Shores, a resort town about three hours away, I\u2019d been a teenager. I remembered that it\u2019d been shortly before they discovered my first brain tumor. The trip was one of the last carefree times I\u2019d had that summer and for years afterward.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably just have a barbecue in the backyard and watch the fireworks on TV,\u201d my sister added.</p><p>I stared at her. I couldn\u2019t help it. Seattle had two incredible fireworks displays every year. The first was at Myrtle Edwards Park on the waterfront and the second at Lake Union\u2019s Gas Works Park north of downtown. The fireworks on the lake were timed to patriotic music\u2014a stirring experience and one that always dramatized for me what we were really celebrating.</p><p>Margaret lived on Capitol Hill, not far from Blossom Street, which was a perfect location for viewing the Lake Union display. I couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d choose to sit in front of her television rather than stand outside her front door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Julia and Hailey?\u201d I adored my nieces, aged fifteen and ten, respectively. We\u2019d grown even closer in the past year, when my rather tense and complicated relationship with their mother had begun to relax. I used to think Margaret tried to keep the girls away from me out of spite, but in retrospect I understood that she was protecting them. She was afraid of letting her daughters love me too much, for fear I\u2019d get sick again. If I lost my battle with cancer and died, my nieces would be devastated.</p><p>Margaret focused on busywork, reorganizing one of the yarn bins. \u201cThe girls already have plans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia\u2019s going to Lake Washington with friends and Hailey\u2019s going camping with the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019ll just be you and Matt?\u201d</p><p>Margaret shrugged, her back to me. \u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>I waited a moment, then decided to say something. I\u2019d drop a hint to see if she responded. \u201cBrad said he ran into Matt recently.\u201d</p><p>Turning slowly, Margaret studied me and seemed to be searching for some clue that I\u2019d learned the truth. \u201cMatt didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need, I suppose,\u201d I said casually.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d my sister agreed.</p><p>\u201cWill you invite Mom over?\u201d I asked next. I hated the thought of her spending the holiday alone. We\u2019d somehow gotten through the year without Dad and all the terrible firsts that accompanied the death of a family member. The first Thanksgiving and Christmas were the worst for me, followed by Valentine\u2019s Day and then the Fourth of July.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to her. What about you?\u201d Margaret was hedging, and I could see that she\u2019d rather I dealt with Mom.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to talk to her?\u201d I asked, which was another way of saying I\u2019d be responsible for keeping our mother occupied over the holiday.</p><p>\u201cThat would be best,\u201d my sister said.</p><p>I found it an effort not to point out that it would make more sense for Mom to join Margaret and Matt. A backyard barbecue would be ideal for her and a lot less strenuous than a trip to the ocean, if that was indeed what Brad and I decided to do.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have a better time with you,\u201d Margaret murmured apologetically.</p> <p>Finally I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. \u201cYou could have told me, you know,\u201d I said softly, hoping to broach the subject of Matt\u2019s unemployment in a nonconfrontational manner.</p><p>\u201cTold you what?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t understand why Margaret continued to maintain the pretense. \u201cThat Matt\u2019s been out of a job for months. I\u2019m your sister\u2014you should be able to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Margaret glared at me but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cIs it some deep, dark secret you\u2019re ashamed of letting anyone know?\u201d I cried, unable to conceal the pain and anger I felt.</p><p>\u201cThis is Matt\u2019s business and mine. It\u2019s none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>I reached for my knitting and sat down. Knitting is a great tension reliever for me. My hands were moving quickly as I worked on my current project, a sweater I wanted to put on display.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything I don\u2019t tell you,\u201d I reminded her. The past year I\u2019d shared everything, and I do mean everything, with my sister. I\u2019d confided my fears, my joys, my hopes, my...my soul. My knitting increased in speed, keeping pace with my outrage.</p><p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Margaret returned evenly. She picked up her crocheting, jerking it so hard the ball of cotton yarn fell to the floor. Scrambling to pick it up, she tucked it under her arm and started in with the hook, her fingers moving as quickly as mine.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it different?\u201d I challenged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Brad. Your husband felt comfortable enough letting Brad know, but my own sister didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d I felt a sense of betrayal, even more so now that Margaret\u2019s attitude was out in the open. She hadn\u2019t shown the least bit of remorse, although I\u2019d hoped she would admit how much she\u2019d wanted to talk to me. Apparently that had never been the case.</p><p>\u201cWho Matt tells is his business.\u201d Margaret\u2019s eyes were focused on her project, a poncho for Julia. Her hand flew as she worked, her concentration fierce.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I tugged viciously on the ball of yarn, yanking it out of the wicker basket. It went tumbling to the floor.</p><p>Margaret scooped up the pretty blue yarn and placed it in my basket, and as she did I noticed that her hands were shaking. I resisted the urge to touch her, to let her know I cared and that I wanted to help if I could. I would\u2019ve done it but I feared her rejection, feared she\u2019d turn away from me again, and I couldn\u2019t have borne that.</p><p>\u201cFinding out about Matt\u2019s job explains a lot,\u201d I said, continuing to knit although I knew I\u2019d have to unravel every stitch. I slowed down as I gathered my thoughts. I\u2019d given up paying attention to the pattern and was working the design by memory. Knitting right now wasn\u2019t a good idea because I was bound to make errors, but I needed something to occupy my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, explains a lot?\u201d Margaret echoed, her tone hostile.</p><p>\u201cYour attitude at work, with me and with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t choosing my words as carefully as I should, but I went on, anyway. \u201cYou\u2019ve been prickly and abrupt with the customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me working here, all you have to do is say so,\u201d Margaret snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it have to be like this with us?\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m both, but I\u2019ve never felt it was necessary to draw any lines.\u201d Apparently she did. \u201cI asked you recently if everything was all right and you assured me it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, my life is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back tears. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you feel, then fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard my two nieces respond in just that way countless times and always been amused, but I wasn\u2019t now. Stuffing the half-knit sweater back into the wicker basket, I bolted to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m your sister,\u201d I said again. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time you started treating me like one?\u201d</p><p>To my absolute horror, Margaret covered her face and burst into tears. I watched her, aghast, hardly knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cMargaret?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>My sister whirled away and rushed to the back room.</p><p>Despite the two customers who\u2019d just come in, I followed her. Thankfully they didn\u2019t need yarn or attention just then, because I would\u2019ve abandoned them. Margaret was my first priority. Once again risking her rejection, I placed my arm around her. To my surprise, she turned to me and rested her head on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand it. I was afraid I\u2019d failed her in some way, but had no idea how.</p><p>\u201cI...couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt is feeling wretched.... He always believed he\u2019d retire from Boeing. He\u2019s been with the company all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said soothingly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Margaret straightened and wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d give me that Mary Sunshine routine of yours, and I just couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what routine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014your \u2018everything will be better in the morning\u2019 speech.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cAll you need to do is think happy thoughts, and all your problems will go away,\u201d she went on in an insulting saccharine voice.</p><p>Sometimes the truth is painful to hear and this was one of those times. Had Margaret come to me a few weeks earlier that is what I would\u2019ve said. Well\u2014not exactly, but something along those lines. Being positive and hopeful, choosing happiness: that was the approach I tried to bring to my life these days. Without intending to, I\u2019d probably sounded glib to Margaret as I burbled on about my own contentment.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. All I really want you to do is be my sister. I don\u2019t want advice. I don\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d She tried to smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing enough of that for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be some way I can help,\u201d I insisted. I was beginning to think I\u2019d already failed on all counts, but I was determined to try.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s teary eyes met mine. \u201cYou could listen.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and we hugged. \u201cWhy don\u2019t Brad and I join you on the fourth,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a barbecue together.\u201d</p><p>Margaret managed a quavery smile. \u201cAs you might\u2019ve noticed, I\u2019m not much fun to be around lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make the best of it. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Fresh tears filled her eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I hugged her again, grateful we\u2019d talked, and sorry I\u2019d delayed it so long.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise was as ready to see Marvin \u201cMaverick\u201d Beaumont as she could be. He was due to arrive that afternoon. Her daughter had been fussing with the house for days, cooking and cleaning as if she were expecting royalty. All this special attention irritated Elise no end. At any other time and for anyone else, Elise would\u2019ve been just as involved, elbow-deep in the preparations. To be fair, she\u2019d helped some, mostly by keeping the boys entertained so Aurora could do her straightening, vacuuming and polishing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d Aurora cried in a panic, rushing into the spotless living room where Elise was reading to her grandsons. \u201cWhere did you put the vanilla?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Elise set aside The Hobbit. \u201cIt\u2019s in the cupboard next to the stove, right-hand side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t there!\u201d More panic.</p><p>\u201cAurora,\u201d Elise said with infinite patience as she made her way into the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly where I said it was. Look again.\u201d To prove her point, she opened the cupboard, extracted the small bottle of vanilla and handed it to her daughter. \u201cWhat are you baking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarrot cake\u2014it\u2019s Dad\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>Elise had baked it for Maverick years ago and passed the recipe on to Aurora. As a matter of course, she no longer baked or ate carrot cake because\u2014well, because of the memories. He\u2019d always been so grateful, so loving afterward. Those were the times she most yearned to forget. Over the years, she\u2019d clung to the disappointments and the worry because that made it easier to justify the divorce. But Elise had loved that man, loved him until she was sure she\u2019d lose her mind if she stayed married to him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d Aurora said, and held her gaze a moment longer than necessary. Sighing, she added, \u201cI know this is difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Elise said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay out of your father\u2019s way as much as possible. All I ask is that you not try to drag me into this reunion.\u201d The next few weeks would be uncomfortable, but she suspected he\u2019d be just as eager to avoid her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d With that Elise returned to the living room where Luke and John were wrestling on the newly vacuumed carpet. They\u2019d already knocked over a stack of magazines, which she quickly righted. \u201cBoys, boys,\u201d she cried, clapping her hands. \u201cSettle down.\u201d Her grandsons reluctantly obeyed. John climbed into her lap and settled in the crook of her arm as she reached for the book. At six he wouldn\u2019t do this much longer, and she treasured these special moments.</p><p>Predictably, Maverick arrived an hour late with all the fanfare of Hannibal crossing the Alps. Voice booming \u201cHello,\u201d he came through the front door pulling his suitcase, arms laden with gifts. Luke and John were instantly at his side screeching and leaping up and down, seeking his attention and, of course, the gifts.</p><p>It\u2019d been...twenty years since Elise had last seen him. He\u2019d planned to attend Aurora and David\u2019s wedding, but his flight was cancelled because of a winter storm. Elise had always wondered if it was the blizzard or a poker game that had changed his plans. Both Luke and John were born in the middle of important poker tournaments; he\u2019d sent huge floral arrangements at their births, as if that would make up for his absence.</p><p>Elise had intended to retreat to her room when he arrived, but she found herself rooted to the spot, unable to look away. Maverick\u2019s red hair was shockingly white now. He had a well-trimmed beard, also white. He\u2019d maintained every inch of his six-foot frame and seemed to be in good health. Elise faltered, resisting the magnetic pull she\u2019d always experienced whenever he was close. She\u2019d learned in the most painful manner that Maverick was not to be trusted, least of all with her heart. Yes, she\u2019d loved this man, perhaps still loved him, but he was wrong for her. That was an undeniable, irrevocable fact, one she didn\u2019t dare ignore.</p><p>The next minute, Maverick was hugging both boys and Aurora. He made a production of doling out his gifts, as if it were Christmas morning and he was Santa. The boys dropped to the floor and tore into their packages, while Aurora carried her smaller box into the living room. She sat sideways in the recliner and opened the lid. Elise admitted to being curious, so she lingered in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d Aurora said in a soft voice. Elise watched as her daughter lifted out a single teardrop-shaped black pearl on a long gold chain. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful...just beautiful.\u201d Her voice caught, and looking up at her father with adoration, Aurora whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll treasure it always.\u201d</p> <p>This was better than any jewelry he\u2019d ever given Elise. Not that it mattered. Seeing how generous he was now, she could tell that Maverick was on a winning streak. Easy come, easy go. And it went with surprising ease, as Elise remembered all too well.</p><p>Against her will, she found her gaze drawn to his. Neither spoke for the longest moment. She felt an odd sensation as they stared into each other\u2019s eyes\u2014as if the years had disappeared and they were young again. In his she read such regret that she stepped involuntarily toward him. So time had brought disappointments to him as well as her.... It wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d expected to see.</p><p>Maverick broke the silence first. \u201cHello, Elise,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She inclined her head toward him, refusing to let him mesmerize her so soon after his arrival. \u201cMarvin.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cMaverick, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaverick, then.\u201d She knew he hated his given name although she\u2019d never understood why. She\u2019d married Marvin, loved Marvin, but he\u2019d never been content to be that man. Instead, he\u2019d sought out glamour and glitz and the instant gratification of a gambling win, and in the process destroyed their lives together.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve brought you a gift, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d accept one from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the thought, but you\u2019re right. A gift wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate.\u201d That was true, although she couldn\u2019t help wondering what he would have chosen for her.</p> <p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d he said as his gaze slid up and down her trim body.</p><p>Despite herself, Elise raised her hand to her hair, as if to check that it was still in place. His compliment flustered her, but she managed to regroup enough to say, \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, Grandpa, want to see where you\u2019re going to sleep?\u201d Luke asked, tugging at Maverick\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d he said, suddenly turning away from Elise. He lifted John into his arms as Luke raced ahead, and the three of them moved down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThis is our room,\u201d Luke said, opening the first door on the right.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s Grandma\u2019s room.\u201d John pointed to Elise\u2019s, which was almost directly across from it.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the bathroom for the boys.\u201d Luke hurried over to the third doorway.</p><p>\u201cGrandma has her own bathroom, and we\u2019re not supposed to use it no matter how bad we have to go,\u201d John explained. \u201cMom said.\u201d</p><p>Maverick chuckled.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, Grandpa, you know that dangling thing in the back of your throat? Did you know if you pull on it you barf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Peter Tully, what a thing to say,\u201d Elise chastised, but stopped when Maverick threw back his head and bellowed with laughter. Leave it to a man to find the topic of vomit amusing.</p><p>\u201cYou get to sleep on the bottom bunk, and Luke and me are gonna share the other one,\u201d John explained and dove onto the mattress. \u201cMom changed the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause John still wets the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not,\u201d John screamed, leaping off the bed and swinging wildly at his older brother.</p><p>Elise started to move into the room to break up the fight, but Maverick quickly took control, pulling the boys apart. He immediately got them involved in showing him the rest of the house. Seeing that she wasn\u2019t needed, Elise retreated to the security of her own bedroom.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, she sat with her feet up, watching television and knitting. Her mind wasn\u2019t on the news, but on her family; she felt irritated that she\u2019d allowed Maverick to isolate her from those she loved most.</p><p>Someone knocked politely at her door and Aurora stuck her head inside. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d join us for dinner,\u201d she said with a pleading look. \u201cDavid made a point of being home early tonight, and it would mean a great deal to me.\u201d</p><p>Elise would rather avoid this \u201cwelcome\u201d dinner, but there was little she could refuse her daughter, who\u2019d been so wonderful to her throughout this legal mess. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Gratitude glistened in Aurora\u2019s eyes.</p><p>To the best of Elise\u2019s memory, this was the first time Aurora had shared a meal with both parents at the same table. That was a sad commentary and, for her daughter\u2019s sake, Elise wished her marriage had ended differently. She didn\u2019t consider herself an emotional woman, but she found Aurora\u2019s happiness at something so simple poignant enough to bring her to tears.</p><p>When Elise finally entered the dining room, David had arrived home from the office and was pouring wine for the adults. Elise had a good relationship with David; as far as she was concerned, he was a model husband. She would be forever grateful that Aurora, unlike her, had had the sense to marry a decent, reliable man who actually worked at a real job.</p><p>Aurora was still bustling about the kitchen and Elise joined her. While David and Maverick chatted, drinking their wine, the women carried the salad, sliced roast, mashed potatoes and gravy to the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a feast,\u201d Luke announced grandly.</p><p>\u201cJust like Thanksgiving, except without the turkey,\u201d redheaded John added, dragging his chair closer to the table. \u201cI get to sit next to Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Luke insisted, and it seemed the boys were on the verge of breaking into another fight. Once more Maverick smoothly ended the conflict by promising to sit between them.</p><p>Despite Elise\u2019s worries, dinner was a pleasant affair. Maverick entertained them with tales of his travels. He\u2019d been all over the world, from Alaska to Argentina, from Paris to Polynesia, touring the places Elise had only read about in books. One day she\u2019d see them, too, she told herself, but the likelihood of that dimmed with every message from her attorney.</p><p>Before dessert was served, Elise arranged the dishes in the dishwasher and made the coffee. As soon as she could, she\u2019d return to her room and her knitting. Knowing Aurora would want to spend time with her father and husband, she carried the coffeepot to the living room, where the others lingered.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boys,\u201d she said to her grandsons. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>This elicited the usual whines and groans.</p><p>Elise had expected that. \u201cI\u2019ll read you another chapter from The Hobbit.\u201d</p><p>The whines dwindled somewhat.</p><p>\u201cLet me read to them, Elise,\u201d Maverick offered.</p><p>Elise was perfectly happy to let him assume the task but felt she should warn him. Once she started reading, it was difficult to stop. The boys wanted to hear more and more. They always bombarded her with \u201cAnother chapter, Grandma,\u201d or \u201cPlease, just to the end of the page.\u201d They begged and pleaded, and she could never say no. It was sometimes a full hour before she turned off the lights. Still, she took satisfaction in knowing that her grandsons had learned to associate reading with pleasure and hoped that books would remain as important to them as they\u2019d always been to her.</p><p>\u201cElise?\u201d Maverick asked again.</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d She left the small party and hurried to her room. With one ear on the television and the other focused on the room across the hall, she waited for the sure-to-follow battle, grinning wickedly to herself. Maverick was learning a valuable lesson about being a grandparent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she didn\u2019t hear any squabbling, she lowered the volume on her television.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Frowning, she rose and opened the door a crack. She heard Maverick\u2019s rich baritone voice as he read animatedly and with emotion. He was good; she\u2019d give him that. There wasn\u2019t a sound from the youngsters. No doubt they were enthralled by the reading as much as the story.</p><p>In spite of what Aurora thought, Elise wanted her daughter to have a good relationship with her father. True, her feelings on the subject were mixed. Although Maverick had promptly paid child support and always kept in touch, he\u2019d made no effort to be a constant part of their daughter\u2019s life. She didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d decided it was so important to make contact now.</p> <p>Elise returned to her rocking chair and twenty minutes later she checked again, her ear at the door. When someone knocked, she nearly leaped out of her skin. With one hand over her startled heart, she opened the door to discover Maverick standing in the hallway.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cThe boys?\u201d she managed to utter, expecting him to ask her advice on how to coax them to sleep.</p><p>\u201cOut like the proverbial light,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>Impossible! Luke and John didn\u2019t go down without a fight. It was part of their nightly ritual. She realized she was frowning again.</p><p>Maverick\u2019s mouth twitched with a smile. \u201cI read them one chapter and John wanted a second.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. That was their usual pattern.</p><p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s got a real dramatic streak,\u201d he said.</p><p>Elise forced back a smile.</p><p>\u201cHe said \u2018Grandpa, I beg of you, I beg of you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but I made them promise they\u2019d go right down, and they did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCount your blessings.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she was lost in him. Then, with a jolt of dismay, she recognized what she was doing. Resolutely, she lifted her chin and looked him square in the eyes. \u201cWas there something you wanted?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and she could see he was stifling a grin. He\u2019d always been able to see straight through her. \u201cJust to tell you good-night and that I enjoyed being with you again.\u201d</p><p>Elise wanted to groan. How was it that a man she\u2019d been divorced from for more than thirty-seven years still had power over her? She loathed her own weakness, loathed her inability to forget how much she\u2019d loved him. \u201cTh-ank you,\u201d she managed, stumbling over the words.</p><p>To her astonishment, Maverick pressed his hand to her cheek, his touch soft. His blue eyes brightened with intensity. Elise\u2019s knees felt as if they were about to buckle and her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hammering inside her chest, Elise stepped back, breaking the contact. Otherwise she didn\u2019t know what she might have done...</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she whispered and while she had the strength, she closed the door. Old feelings, it seemed, died hard. She reminded herself that she couldn\u2019t relax her vigilance with this gambler she\u2019d once married. Not for a minute. Not for even a second.</p> <p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s meeting with Grant had been a week ago, and she was still so angry that she hadn\u2019t slept an entire night since. The selfish bastard wasn\u2019t willing to spend three hundred dollars on his son. Bethanne knew the reason. Grant didn\u2019t have the courage to say it, but she knew.</p><p>This was payback. When Grant moved out of the house and in with Tiffany, their then-sixteen-year-old son had confronted his father and told him exactly what he thought of Grant\u2019s behavior. Grant hadn\u2019t taken kindly to Andrew\u2019s honesty, and their relationship had been strained ever since.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Mom?\u201d Annie asked, entering the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped, then smiled sheepishly. \u201cSorry, I was lost in thought.\u201d</p><p>Annie flopped down at the kitchen table beside Bethanne, who sat there with a cup of tea. \u201cThinking about Dad?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to deny it. \u201cHe\u2019s been on my mind lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d Annie admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still with her.\u201d</p><p>Annie never mentioned Tiffany\u2019s name. She was always her or the bitch. Her daughter\u2019s own relationship with Grant was confused. Annie loved her father and had been close to him, and longed to be close once again, but she felt hurt and betrayed. She was also unsure where she stood with him. Grant gave her the minimum of attention and expected Annie to be the one to call him, which she did on occasion. But the brunt of her daughter\u2019s anger was directed toward Tiffany because Annie believed the other woman had stolen Grant from his family. Bethanne didn\u2019t take that anger lightly, especially after flipping through Annie\u2019s journal, but she didn\u2019t know what to do about it, either. She prayed that eventually her daughter\u2019s bitterness would fade.</p><p>It was times like this that she missed her mother most. Martha Gibson had died suddenly of an aneurysm the year Annie was born, and Bethanne\u2019s father had declined physically and emotionally after that. He lived in a retirement community in Arizona, but it was up to her to maintain contact.</p><p>\u201cI think they might be getting married,\u201d Annie murmured, her voice barely audible.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Bethanne tried not to reveal any interest, but her head was spinning. If anyone in the family was likely to learn of Grant\u2019s wedding plans, it would be her daughter. He might not talk to Annie much, but he talked to her more than to Andrew or Bethanne. Married. That explained why her ex had turned into such a miser. She\u2019d bet every penny left in her bank account that he was buying Tiffany a huge diamond and planning the honeymoon. At least Tiffany was getting one; Bethanne never had. Grant and Bethanne got married while in college, and there\u2019d been money for no more than a wedding night in a three-star hotel on the Oregon coast. Monday morning they were both back in school.</p><p>\u201cI hate her, Mom. I know you said I shouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t help it. If it wasn\u2019t for her, Dad would be with us and everything would be like it used to be.\u201d Annie\u2019s voice cracked with the intensity of her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bethanne whispered, fighting her own anger, \u201cbut if it wasn\u2019t her, it probably would\u2019ve been someone else.\u201d This insight had been a small epiphany for Bethanne during the divorce proceedings. Her attorney had been going over the settlement, and it was all Bethanne could do to concentrate when the truth suddenly dawned on her. It wasn\u2019t her fault. She\u2019d been a good wife and a good mother. She\u2019d remained faithful and loving. Not once in the entire twenty years of her marriage had she even considered cheating on Grant. Her whole life had been about family. Without resentment or complaint, she\u2019d cooked her husband\u2019s meals, cleaned his home and raised his children. She\u2019d been a hostess for his parties, which were legendary.</p><p>Their huge Christmas, Super Bowl and Fourth of July parties, in particular, had been favorites with their friends, and Grant had loved playing host. It didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d done all the work, they were a team.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t to blame for the mess he\u2019d made of their lives and she refused to accept the guilt. Sitting in her attorney\u2019s office that day, she\u2019d recognized Grant\u2019s actions for what they were. Blaming her was Grant\u2019s way of justifying his lack of loyalty and fidelity, his failure as a husband and father. It obviously assuaged the guilt he was unwilling to feel. For a time she\u2019d assumed that responsibility, certain she must be the one who\u2019d failed. He wanted her to think she\u2019d become so wrapped up in the children\u2019s lives she\u2019d abandoned him. She hadn\u2019t, and she wouldn\u2019t listen to those cruel voices in the back of her head ever again. Voices that echoed his...</p><p>\u201cMom, Mom,\u201d Annie said, reaching across the table to touch Bethanne\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou\u2019re spacing out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the sock class?\u201d Annie asked, apparently trying to turn Bethanne\u2019s mind in another direction, away from the darkness that had overtaken her.</p><p>\u201cReally great.\u201d The second class had gone much better than the first. They\u2019d no sooner sat down at the table than Elise apologized for what she called her \u201ccrankiness\u201d the week before. She explained that she\u2019d received bad news and hadn\u2019t had time to digest it before the class. She was very sorry if she\u2019d offended anyone.</p><p>Bethanne had her own confession to make. She told the others why she\u2019d been tense the week before\u2014that she\u2019d been hoping to get out of the class because she regretted having spent the money. She no longer felt that way. She was still worried about finances, but Annie was right; she needed something for herself. Something completely unrelated to everything else in her life.</p><p>Even Courtney seemed to be in a better mood. She\u2019d announced proudly that she\u2019d lost two pounds. At first Bethanne thought the teenager meant she\u2019d lost the weight knitting, which seemed peculiar, but then she realized Courtney was saying that knitting had kept her out of the kitchen.</p><p>The two-hour class had sped by, and Bethanne felt wonderful afterward, grateful she hadn\u2019t dropped out. She\u2019d made progress on her socks\u2014or the first one, anyway\u2014and had truly enjoyed the companionship of the other women.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d like it.\u201d Annie\u2019s eyes flashed with triumph.</p><p>The phone rang and her daughter leaped up in her rush to answer. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s eyes zeroed in on Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s here.\u201d She held the phone against her stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d She hesitated, then whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the guy at the bank, phoning to tell me I\u2019ve overdrawn the checking account again.\u201d She\u2019d already done that twice, and it was embarrassing in the extreme.</p><p>Annie brought her the phone.</p><p>\u201cThis is Bethanne Hamlin,\u201d she said, trying to sound brisk and professional. According to the check register, she should have at least fifty dollars in that account, but she hadn\u2019t gotten it to balance since she\u2019d opened it. Math had never been one of her strengths.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, this is Paul Ormond.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if all the oxygen had been sucked out of her lungs. Paul was Tiffany\u2019s ex-husband. Tiffany had filed for a divorce at the same time as Grant. Apparently they\u2019d coordinated when to file, and she could imagine the two of them traipsing down to the courthouse, giggling and holding hands. Paul and Bethanne had been the spouses left behind to deal with the emotional devastation of the affair and its aftermath.</p><p>\u201cHello, Paul,\u201d she said with difficulty. She\u2019d met him only once, briefly, but she\u2019d considered calling him a couple of times. She\u2019d wanted to ask if he\u2019d known about the affair before his wife told him. Had Tiffany done it on Valentine\u2019s Day, like Grant? In the end, Bethanne hadn\u2019t bothered.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if we could talk,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cSure. I mean, that would be fine,\u201d she said awkwardly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her answer was met with silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cHow about later this afternoon? After five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her social calendar was empty. This had been a shock to Bethanne. Her friends had rallied around her and supported her through the divorce, but they no longer invited her to socialize with them. Most events in their circle were geared to couples, and as a newly single woman\u2014an unwillingly single woman\u2014she\u2019d become an outcast. Besides, she suspected Tiffany had taken her place at some of those dinners and parties. Just when she most needed her friends, they\u2019d disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWould you be willing to have dinner with me? My treat.\u201d He sounded hesitant, as if he expected her to decline.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d she said impulsively. \u201cWhere would you like to meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnthony\u2019s, say around six. I\u2019ll make the reservation.\u201d</p><p>The waterfront restaurant wasn\u2019t far from Pike Place Market and was well known in the area as one of the top seafood places.</p><p>Bethanne thanked him and ended the call, both puzzled and pleased. This wasn\u2019t a date, but it was as close to one as she\u2019d come in the last twenty-two years.</p> <p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Annie asked when Bethanne replaced the receiver.</p><p>For some reason, Bethanne was reluctant to explain. \u201cAn old friend,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to take you out?\u201d Annie asked, as if this were beyond imagining.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I shouldn\u2019t go?\u201d Bethanne instantly assumed she\u2019d made a mistake in agreeing to meet Paul.</p><p>Annie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why ask me? Who\u2019s the adult here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cI\u2019m the adult and I\u2019m meeting...an old friend.\u201d</p> <p>When it was time to leave, both Annie and Andrew were gone for the evening, so Bethanne propped a note for them on the kitchen counter, the way they did for her.</p><p>She had to find parking downtown, because she couldn\u2019t afford the lot prices. Fortunately, she located a place three short blocks from the restaurant. When she walked toward Anthony\u2019s, Paul Ormond was already there, standing outside waiting. He waved at her as she approached.</p><p>Paul was around thirty-five, she guessed, with dark hair and eyes, a pleasant face and a bit of a paunch. If she remembered correctly, he worked in the downtown area for an international shipping firm. He wore a suit and tie. Bethanne was surprised that the lovely Tiffany would have married such an ordinary-looking man. The impression she had of \u201cTiff\u201d was of a status-conscious woman, to whom a husband\u2019s appearance would be almost as important as her own.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d Paul said as he opened the door to the restaurant. When he stepped forward and announced his name to the hostess, they were immediately seated.</p><p>They both ordered a glass of wine and Paul stared out the window at Puget Sound. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering why I called you,\u201d he said after several minutes of silence. Oddly, Bethanne didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable, nor did she feel her usual urge to make small talk.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was kind of curious. The divorces have been final for quite a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that way to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2014\u201d She started to tell Paul that Grant had refused to pay for Andrew\u2019s football camp. It didn\u2019t matter, she had to remind herself. It just didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you find out about the affair?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was embarrassed to tell him the truth. \u201cNot until Grant told me. You know how they say the wife\u2019s always the last to know. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew almost from the first,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t make myself believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you and Tiffany married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix years,\u201d he said. \u201cFour good ones, at any rate. Then she met Grant.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI think I guessed what was going on when she wanted to delay having a family.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne knew from what Grant had told her that there were no other children involved. The whole thing was bad enough without hurting more innocents.</p><p>She took a sip from her glass of chardonnay, then another. \u201cAnnie told me this afternoon she thinks they\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>Paul arched his eyebrows. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Although her appetite had vanished with talk of the affair, Bethanne opened the menu. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get over it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that,\u201d Paul begged. \u201cI was hoping, you know, that everything was better for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is better,\u201d she said valiantly, \u201cit\u2019s just that...I don\u2019t feel it yet.\u201d If being alone hurt this badly all these months after the divorce, she couldn\u2019t imagine that pain would ever go away.</p><p>\u201cYour husband and my wife were cheating on us,\u201d he said with sudden anger. \u201cSo, why are we the ones feeling bad?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair. She was the injured party; Paul, too. While Grant and Tiffany were free of their responsibilities and probably partying every night, Bethanne was dealing with children whose security had been shattered, an aging house and more emotional pain than any one person should be expected to bear.</p><p>\u201cI told myself they have to live with what they\u2019ve done,\u201d Paul said, \u201cbut that\u2019s little comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no comfort.\u201d</p><p>Paul opened his menu, too. \u201cI was thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we don\u2019t talk about the divorce?\u201d Bethanne asked abruptly. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be getting on with our lives. Let\u2019s order dinner, okay?\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cHave you decided what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an appetizer. The smoked salmon, I think. And maybe a cup of chowder.\u201d</p><p>He called over the waiter and they placed their orders, with Paul choosing the chowder and a small dish of seafood pasta. \u201cSo, are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cGetting on with your life, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked, and at her startled look, he added, \u201cThe reason I want to know is that I need help. I guess I was hoping you were doing better than I am and might have some words of wisdom to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I joined a knitting class.\u201d</p><p>Paul grinned, and when he smiled he was almost boyishly handsome. \u201cThat\u2019s more of a women\u2019s thing, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of men knit, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken up golf, but so far I don\u2019t show any real knack for it.\u201d</p><p>Another silence, as they concentrated on their chowder, which had just been delivered. They both murmured appreciatively. It truly was delicious, and Bethanne found herself automatically deconstructing the ingredients, the way she used to when she was married and always searching for new recipes. Unexpectedly, that made her feel better, not worse, as if she\u2019d recovered a small part of the woman she used to be.</p><p>She tried her smoked salmon. Good, but she wouldn\u2019t have served it with the curried mayonnaise. Too many strong flavors.</p><p>Time to wade back into the conversational waters. \u201cHave you started dating again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she pointed to him. \u201cYou\u2019re my first dinner date in twenty-two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my first date in seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that cause for celebration?\u201d</p><p>Paul chuckled. \u201cI think it is.\u201d With that he gestured to the waiter and they ordered a second glass of wine.</p><p>Paul might not be the most attractive man she\u2019d ever met, especially compared to Grant, but Bethanne was struck by how genuine he was, how generous and caring. Even though he was in as much pain as she was, he\u2019d told her he was sorry that his wife had been the one to break up her family.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do for you?\u201d he asked, as they walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>Bethanne had only one burning need. A job. \u201cDo you know anyone who\u2019d be willing to hire me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019d do just about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have computer skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d The truth was, she didn\u2019t. Bethanne knew her way around the Internet, but mostly because her kids had shown her. She could manage basic word processing programs, but anything beyond that and she was at a loss.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get some training,\u201d Paul suggested.</p><p>He was right, but she hated the thought of it. This adjustment, trying to find employment after so many years out of the job market, was almost as difficult as the divorce.</p><p>Paul insisted on walking her to where she\u2019d parked her car. \u201cI had a good time tonight, Bethanne, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d They exchanged handshakes. \u201cIf you ever need someone to talk to, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>He perked up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne listened to the radio on the drive home. It was almost ten by the time she pulled into the driveway. She hadn\u2019t even made it to the house before the front door was thrown open and her children stood in the entrance glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cJust exactly where were you?\u201d Annie demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe were worried sick,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>Bethanne stared back at them in complete shock. \u201cI beg your pardon? Annie, I told you I was seeing an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t say you were going to be this late!\u201d Annie cried in disgust.</p><p>\u201cWe talked and...and the time flew,\u201d Bethanne answered before she thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this,\u201d Andrew muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter everything you\u2019ve said to us about knowing where we are and who we\u2019re with.\u201d Andrew shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThis is totally bogus,\u201d Annie muttered.</p><p>\u201cCould you please let me in?\u201d As they moved aside, she said, \u201cI left you a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you didn\u2019t give us the guy\u2019s name or tell us where you went. I\u2019m not sure about this, Mom,\u201d Andrew tried to explain. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem right that my mother\u2019s the one on a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal,\u201d Annie said, speaking more thoughtfully now. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t for me either,\u201d Bethanne agreed. \u201cHowever, this is my new reality.\u201d For the first time, she could say those hated words without flinching.</p><p>\u201cSo we should get used to it?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>Bethanne nodded. Her children had nothing to worry about; she was their rock, their security. Their mother. That wouldn\u2019t change no matter what their father did.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>If Courtney could trust her grandmother\u2019s antique scale, it showed that she\u2019d lost four pounds. Five if she balanced on one foot and stared straight down at the dial. This was the first time in months that she\u2019d managed to stay on any formal eating program. She felt good, really good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The exercising helped, she was sure of it. Her sister had e-mailed and suggested a low-carb diet, but Courtney preferred to make up one of her own. It was a very simple concept: she didn\u2019t eat anything that started with the letter P. That included pasta, peanut butter, pizza, popcorn and just about everything else she\u2019d craved in the last four years.</p><p>She routinely heard from Julianna, who e-mailed her from Alaska every day. Julianna\u2019s stories about life at the summer lodge\u2014her coworkers, the guests, the wildlife\u2014were endlessly entertaining. Jason sent her encouraging messages once or twice a week, and Courtney was grateful for them. She wrote both Jason and Julianna long e-mails in exchange. She hadn\u2019t mentioned her P diet but she boasted proudly, at least to her sister, about each pound lost.</p><p>Her father was in regular contact, too. This job in Brazil demanded a lot of his time, but she could tell he was trying hard to be there for her. She loved him for it. Now that she\u2019d finished feeling sorry for herself, she realized how difficult this situation was for him. He desperately missed his children and talked constantly about when he\u2019d return home. This year was destined to be the longest of all their lives.</p><p>The only problem with living in Seattle was that Courtney still hadn\u2019t met anyone her age. After that one disaster, when she\u2019d run into all those sleek-bodied girls from the swim team, she\u2019d avoided the pool on Mondays and Wednesdays\u2014which was when the team practiced.</p> <p>She swam laps three mornings a week and biked on the other days. She\u2019d even biked to her last knitting class, although her grandmother was convinced it wasn\u2019t safe to ride a bicycle in Seattle traffic. It hadn\u2019t been easy to go the full three miles, and she\u2019d felt justified in congratulating herself. Riding a bike up the steep Seattle hills was a challenge. She figured Lance Armstrong would\u2019ve been out of breath, too. At one point she\u2019d had to stop, climb off her bike and walk when it became too much for her. Her new goal was to make it all the way up Capitol Hill without stopping. That would take practice, but she knew she\u2019d eventually manage it.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out again?\u201d her grandmother asked when Courtney bounced down the stairs. She had on her shorts and T-shirt and held her helmet by the straps.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long, Grams.\u201d Last week Grandma had gotten shortened to Grams. She\u2019d decided that Grandma seemed kind of juvenile; besides, it was just too much of a mouthful.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful,\u201d Vera cried, glancing away from the television screen long enough to warn her.</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d</p><p>Courtney glanced at her watch. \u201cGive me an hour, okay?\u201d</p><p>Grams didn\u2019t answer and Courtney suspected she hadn\u2019t heard her, which was often the case. Placing the helmet on her head and donning her gloves, Courtney went out to the garage, where she kept her bicycle.</p><p>She was on the ten-speed and wheeling along at a fast clip, the wind in her face, when she noticed a familiar figure in the parking lot of the Safeway grocery store. Bethanne saw her at the same time and raised her hand in greeting. Courtney would\u2019ve biked past with only a wave but Bethanne called her over.</p><p>Courtney rode into the lot and approached Bethanne, who had obviously been shopping. A good-looking young man with broad shoulders and short dark hair had pushed her cart next to her car, ready to load the groceries.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Courtney said, a bit winded. She reached for her water bottle and took a swig.</p> <p>\u201cCourtney, I want to introduce you to my son, Andrew. He works here part-time\u2014as you can see.\u201d She gestured at his employee vest with its store logo.</p><p>At the last class she\u2019d mentioned her children but Courtney hadn\u2019t paid that much attention. Bethanne had two, she remembered\u2014a boy and a girl.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Andrew said without any real enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Great, she would meet him when she was all sweaty and hot and wearing shorts. She preferred to keep her legs covered and did most of the time.</p><p>\u201cCourtney\u2019s in my knitting class,\u201d Bethanne explained to her son. \u201cShe\u2019s the girl I told you about the other day. She\u2019ll be starting her senior year at Washington High this September.\u201d She turned to Courtney and added, \u201cAndrew will be a senior, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Washington?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had an extra ticket to the Mariners\u2019 game this evening?\u201d Bethanne asked her son, and then before he even had a chance to answer, she said, \u201cYou should invite Courtney. She hasn\u2019t met many kids here, and it would be a great way for her to get to know your friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Courtney rushed to tell him, embarrassed that Bethanne had put her son in such an awkward position.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come?\u201d Andrew asked her.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Although she sounded like it was no big deal, it was. Inside she was doing cartwheels but she dared not let it show.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pick her up, won\u2019t you?\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cIf I can have the car.\u201d From his tone, taking the car had been a contentious issue.</p><p>Bethanne grinned. \u201cAll right, all right, you can have the car.\u201d</p><p>Andrew got Courtney\u2019s address and phone number, and promised to call later in the afternoon once he was off work.</p><p>Courtney was so excited she couldn\u2019t bike home fast enough. Andrew was totally cool and cute and just the kind of guy she\u2019d hoped to meet. The game was hours away but she had a thousand things to do first.</p><p>By the time Courtney got back to the house, her grandmother had lunch on the table. She grabbed an apple, bit off a huge chunk and raced up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Grams shouted after her, \u201cwhere are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met someone. Bethanne\u2019s son.\u201d When Vera looked a little puzzled, she added, \u201cBethanne? From the knitting class?\u201d Courtney took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Mariners\u2019 game this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t for hours yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she yelled from the top of the stairs, \u201cbut I need to shower and everything. Oh Grams, what should I wear?\u201d Silly question. Grams was sweet, but she knew next to nothing about fashion. \u201cNever mind,\u201d Courtney said, \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>After her shower, Courtney changed clothes about fifteen times, weighing herself with each outfit and then doing a complete and thorough evaluation in front of the mirror. In the end she decided on jeans and a white tank-top with a yellow flowered overshirt. She weighed more in this outfit than one of the others, but the yellow shirt made her eyes darker and set off her dark-brown hair. It was her best choice.</p><p>Andrew phoned at five and said he\u2019d be by in thirty minutes to pick her up for the six o\u2019clock game. Courtney didn\u2019t want to appear too eager by waiting outside, but she didn\u2019t want him to have to come inside and get her, either. This wasn\u2019t like a date or anything. She compromised by watching for him out the living room window. As soon as he pulled up in front, she kissed her grandmother on the cheek and dashed out the door.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time,\u201d Grams called after her.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d This was so much better than sitting in her room or surfing the Internet for hours. And television in the summer was just plain bad.</p><p>Andrew leaned over and opened the passenger door for her. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, again without a lot of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHi! Thanks for including me.\u201d</p><p>Courtney was already in the front seat before she realized someone else was in the car. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, twisting around as she grabbed the seat belt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Annie, my sister. She\u2019ll be a junior this year. Annie, Courtney.\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s automatic smile faded as she recognized Andrew\u2019s sister. Annie was the girl from the swim team who\u2019d been staring at Courtney and whispering with her friend. All she could do was hope that Annie didn\u2019t recognize her with her clothes on. Apparently she didn\u2019t, because she made no reference to that day at the pool.</p><p>\u201cAndrew and Mom forced me into going to this game with him,\u201d the girl muttered.</p><p>That was in case Courtney assumed Annie had joined them for the fun of it, she suspected.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in Seattle?\u201d Andrew asked after casting his sister a hard look.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks. I\u2019m living with my grandmother.\u201d Courtney talked about her dad\u2019s work situation for a few minutes, and the importance of this Brazilian bridge. She said her brother was in graduate school and her sister in college and working in Alaska for the summer. She told them that she\u2019d hated to leave Chicago and her friends. She was sure she\u2019d given them more information than they wanted, but it was just so good to be with her own kind.</p><p>\u201cAre your parents divorced?\u201d Annie asked from the backseat.</p><p>Courtney went still. \u201cMy mom died in a car accident four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer,\u201d Andrew said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d All of a sudden, she didn\u2019t have anything more to say and Andrew and Annie didn\u2019t, either. The silence in the car seemed to vibrate.</p><p>\u201cI wish Dad had died.\u201d Annie spoke in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Andrew barked.</p><p>\u201cI mean it!\u201d Her anger was explosive.</p><p>\u201cOur parents were recently divorced, but I suppose Mom mentioned that,\u201d Andrew said by way of explanation.</p><p>\u201cJust in the first class.\u201d The other thing Courtney knew was that Bethanne needed to find a job.</p><p>\u201cOur father\u2019s a jerk!\u201d Annie said in a near-shout.</p><p>\u201cMy sister didn\u2019t take it well,\u201d Andrew added under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Annie snorted from the backseat.</p><p>They parked on a side street and climbed out of the car. Annie stared at her and Courtney held her breath, praying the other girl had forgetten where she\u2019d seen her. No such luck.</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d Annie said, eyeing her.</p><p>Courtney\u2019s heart fell. \u201cMaybe you saw me when your mother came to knitting class,\u201d she suggested hopefully, but a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach refused to go away.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Annie said triumphantly. \u201cYou were at the swimming pool, weren\u2019t you? The early-morning session with all the old ladies.\u201d Then she leaned close and said in a loud stage whisper, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about running into me again. I quit the team last week. Mom doesn\u2019t know yet and Andrew won\u2019t tell her because we have a deal.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s gaze narrowed on his sister.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to be sure I came along when he took you to the game,\u201d Annie gleefully reported. \u201cHe was afraid his girlfriend would find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, would you,\u201d Andrew snapped at Annie. He threw Courtney an apologetic glance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d she assured him, and it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s magic in pulling loops through loops, whether between the limbs of a knitted tree house, or shaped to fit the geography of a foot.\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I could hardly wait for Brad to make his neighborhood deliveries and come to the store. I\u2019ve read my share of romance novels, so I can say with authority that if ever there was a romantic hero, it\u2019s Brad. Because I\u2019ve lived with cancer from the time I was sixteen, I\u2019ve been absorbed by threats and fears. But despite my terrible scare last year, my life had never been better and for someone like me that\u2019s a little frightening\u2014as though feeling confident and happy is testing fate, somehow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think I mentioned that Dr. Wilson found something on a routine checkup and I was convinced the cancer was back. My attitude was fatalistic. It was during this time that I broke up with Brad. Without giving him a reason, I shoved him out of my life with the flimsiest of excuses. He didn\u2019t walk away easily. I loved how he fought for me, how he stood by me until I made it too painful for him to stay. Then, naturally, I learned I was fine, but at that point, I couldn\u2019t blame Brad for not wanting anything more to do with me. Thankfully he was willing to listen when I came to my senses. Once again, I had Margaret to thank; without her encouragement I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. That was all in the past now, and I felt so grateful to have Brad in my life.</p><p>On the phone the night before, he and I had talked about our Fourth of July plans. He wanted to wait until he saw me before we confirmed the barbecue at Margaret and Matt\u2019s. I always get as excited as a kid about this holiday. Mostly I was looking forward to being with Brad and Cody\u2014and away from work, because I could use the break.</p><p>The shop had been so busy lately, which was good but physically draining. I was on my feet a solid eight hours every day. Margaret did as much as she could, but she was preoccupied with the situation at home and hadn\u2019t been as much help. She tried, though, and I was doing my best to be supportive and understanding.</p><p>My Friday knitting sessions were consistently productive; Jacqueline, in particular, came every week and spent hours knitting squares for Warm Up America. Granted, she had the most free time, since Alix was working and Carol was staying home with little Cameron. Still, Jacqueline\u2019s generosity with her time and money impressed me.</p> <p>Then there was my sock class. The women were an interesting mix and I was getting to know them. They were loosening up a bit, and that was a good sign. I love the way knitting brings people together. As diverse as these women seemed to be, in personality, in background and in age, they were beginning to enjoy each other\u2019s company. The class got off to a difficult start because Elise was so short-tempered that first day, but her apology went a long way toward smoothing things over and I was grateful. The tone of the class was set by Elise, I noticed. She\u2019s a natural leader, and while I wish I could\u2019ve been the one dictating mood, I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Just after ten, I saw Brad\u2019s truck in front of the shop. I waited for him to stroll through the door and address me as \u201cBeautiful.\u201d It\u2019s part one of our private ritual\u2014which then moves into my office for part two, a little kissing and caressing. I preferred to do that away from Margaret\u2019s interested eye.</p><p>Not that it mattered. She was late\u2014again. It had become almost normal for her to show up thirty minutes after I opened for the day. I didn\u2019t want to nag her but I found it irritating that she\u2019d grown so slack about her responsibilities. Eventually I\u2019d need to speak to her about it, but now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>The bell over the door chimed and I relaxed. Everything was better when I could spend a few minutes alone with Brad.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, wheeling the boxes of new yarn toward me.</p> <p>\u201cHey, what happened to \u2018Morning, Beautiful\u2019?\u201d I teased. \u201cDid I sprout big ears overnight or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cBrad? Is everything all right?\u201d He wasn\u2019t his usual cheerful self, and that had me worried. I could see everything wasn\u2019t all right; I didn\u2019t really need to ask. The way he refused to look at me was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine\u2014I think.\u201d But he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIs it Cody?\u201d I asked, immediately concerned.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Cody\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>I love Brad\u2019s son. Every now and then, Cody would slip and call me Mom, and I loved the sound of it. If things went as I hoped, I\u2019d soon be his stepmother.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be best if we talked later,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to let him walk out the door without explaining.</p><p>Brad heaved a sigh and seemed to wish he was anyplace in the world but my yarn store. We\u2019d been involved with each other for a year, and in all that time I\u2019d never seen him like this.</p><p>\u201cForget this later business. Just tell me,\u201d I said again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be with you on the Fourth,\u201d he blurted out.</p><p>My disappointment was sharp, but I tried to hide it. \u201cOh. Any particular reason?\u201d</p> <p>He seemed to pretend he hadn\u2019t heard me and unloaded the dolly, stacking the boxes next to the cash register. Out of habit I signed my name on his automated clipboard.</p><p>\u201cBrad,\u201d I said urgently. \u201cWhatever it is can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him more serious or less sure of himself. \u201cYou\u2019d better sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I adamantly refused. \u201cI\u2019ll stand. Just say what you have to say.\u201d I could feel a numbing sensation starting in my feet and working its way up my ankles and calves. I think it was then that I knew. I could almost predict what was coming. I\u2019ve had this kind of conversation twice before; both times, the men who\u2019d claimed to love me decided it was over. Back then, I didn\u2019t blame either of them. Loving me was a bad bet, since my prognosis wasn\u2019t all that good. Twice, I\u2019d faced the possibility of death, and I couldn\u2019t expect them to face it with me. But now...</p><p>Brad rubbed his hand down his thigh and swallowed hard. \u201cI can\u2019t be with you on the Fourth because Cody and I will be with Janice.\u201d</p><p>I barely had a chance to digest this before he muttered, \u201cJanice phoned a couple of days ago and asked if we could talk.\u201d</p><p>I knew Brad had worked hard to maintain a good relationship with his ex-wife. The breakup of their marriage had been her idea, and she\u2019d been perfectly content to let Brad retain custody of their son.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Janice talked?\u201d I asked when he wasn\u2019t forthcoming with details. \u201cApparently she had a great deal to say.\u201d From the tightness around his eyes and mouth, this appeared to be an understatement.</p><p>Brad\u2019s shoulders rose in a deep sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s done a lot of thinking in the last few months and realizes she made a mistake when she left Cody and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little late for that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Brad didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cShe wants another chance.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, hardly able to believe Brad would seriously consider taking back his ex. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s mighty convenient, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I recognized instantly what was happening, even if Brad didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, his gaze flying to mine.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to mention that you\u2019ve asked me to marry you?\u201d I couldn\u2019t feel anything other than cynical about this. Of course Janice wanted him back! She was about to lose him for good.</p><p>Brad shook his head, but my guess was that Cody had told his mother about our plans to be married. \u201cShe knows,\u201d I told him, \u201cand she doesn\u2019t like it. She\u2019s toying with you. Now that we\u2019re talking marriage, she can\u2019t stand the thought of you and Cody with anyone else.\u201d Even if Janice didn\u2019t want to be married to Brad, she didn\u2019t want me or any other woman to have him, either.</p><p>Brad motioned helplessly with his hands. \u201cShe seemed sincere and genuinely regretful. If it was an act, then she should get an Oscar nomination.\u201d</p><p>Naturally Brad wanted to believe that; his ego required it. Any man\u2019s would. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, confused about what this meant for Brad and me. He didn\u2019t seem to know himself. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t love me and that you were just killing time until Janice came to her senses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d he asserted.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was his immediate reply, followed by a brief pause. \u201cI loved Janice when we were married and I still loved her when she walked out on me. But I don\u2019t anymore\u2014my feelings for her are gone. The truth is, she\u2019s Cody\u2019s mother and my son needs her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly does that mean for us?\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re about to retract the proposal,\u201d I said, striving for a bit of humor, \u201cand if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll have one hell of a fight on your hands, fellow.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not, but I\u2019m going to ask you to do something I have no right to ask.\u201d</p><p>I could predict what that would be. \u201cYou want me to voluntarily step aside and give Janice an opportunity to lure you and Cody back? Sorry, Brad, I can\u2019t do that. You either love me or you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her.\u201d His eyes pleaded for understanding. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I argued. \u201cAre you going to be at her beck and call for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Anyway this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for Janice,\u201d I said. Surely he could see my position. Surely he knew he was ripping my heart out.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a long, long time. \u201cI owe this to Cody. He loves his mother and wants us to be a family again.\u201d Brad closed his eyes, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to see the pain he was inflicting on me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lydia. I\u2019d give anything not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love Cody, too!\u201d I cried. The numbness had attacked my entire body now. I could barely function as I turned away.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, and he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll never be his mother,\u201d I said in such pain I thought I\u2019d be physically ill. Janice would always be the woman he\u2019d loved first, the woman he loved best. Hard as I tried, I would only be a shadowy imitation. Squaring my shoulders, I turned back. Brad hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cI...I guess you\u2019re glad I delayed our wedding plans, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he breathed. \u201cLydia, please, try to understand. I don\u2019t want this\u2014I didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d</p><p>We stood there, he and I, and the room seemed to grow smaller and smaller around us.</p><p>Pride demanded that I do my best to put a good face on this, although it took every ounce of resolve I possessed. \u201cSeeing that you\u2019ve made your choice, all I can do is wish you, Janice and Cody a good life.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t play this game, Brad. I won\u2019t play it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it can be. It will be. After a while, Janice will realize she\u2019s made yet another mistake and she\u2019ll want her independence once again. Only I won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? All I\u2019m asking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor whatever reason, you want to give Janice another chance,\u201d I broke in. \u201cFor Cody\u2019s sake or your own, I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s your decision, but I can\u2019t let you in and out of my life on her whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s right anymore,\u201d he shouted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut apparently I\u2019m second-best now.\u201d It was difficult to maintain my composure. \u201cDoes she want to move back in with you? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brad shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019ll keep her place and I\u2019ll keep mine. We haven\u2019t made any other decisions. I couldn\u2019t do that until I talked to you.\u201d</p><p>This was supposed to cheer me up? If so, it hadn\u2019t worked. Brad was obviously deluded about his ex-wife\u2019s motivations. I knew Janice loved Cody. We\u2019d talked several times, Janice and I, over the past months, and she\u2019d made it perfectly clear that despite her maternal connection with Cody, she didn\u2019t want the demands of a husband and family. I was completely dumbfounded by this sudden change of heart.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said, and my voice trembled so badly it was hard to speak, \u201cbut I can\u2019t and won\u2019t play tug-of-war with Janice over you and Cody. You can\u2019t ask me to share your life one minute, and then the next want me to step aside while you test the waters with your ex. I don\u2019t know what you expect me to say.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t respond but I could see that his teeth were clenched, his jaw rigid. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can to switch routes so we won\u2019t have to see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I was surprised by how calm I sounded, because on the inside I was crumbling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, unwilling to let him witness the pain I was in.</p><p>The man I loved turned and walked out of my life. The instant the door closed, I fell into a chair and covered my face with both hands. I took deep, shuddering breaths as I struggled to make sense of what had just happened. Moments earlier, I\u2019d been anticipating our Fourth of July barbecue with Cody.... My heart froze as I realized anew that not only was I losing Brad, I was losing Cody. Sweet Cody, who\u2019d taught me so much about love and what it meant to be a mom.</p> <p>The bell jingled with irritating gaiety. I dropped my hands and plastered a smile on my face, which became a frown when I saw it was Margaret. I said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, without explanation.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to work for me, then I\u2019d appreciate if you could make an effort to be here on time,\u201d I snapped. \u201cJust because I\u2019m your sister doesn\u2019t mean you can show up for work whenever you like.\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s jaw sagged at the unexpectedness of my attack. \u201cOkay, message received.\u201d</p><p>I stood and retreated to the back room but the trembling in my hands refused to stop. I had to pull myself together, or I\u2019d be an emotional wreck. Unfortunately it was probably too late.</p><p>\u201cDid you get out of bed on the wrong side this morning?\u201d Margaret asked, following me.</p> <p>I attempted to pour a cup of coffee and couldn\u2019t. Setting the pot back on the burner, I turned to face my sister, certain I\u2019d gone completely ashen.</p><p>\u201cLydia,\u201d she whispered, looking shaken when she saw me. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to speak but the words wouldn\u2019t come. Instead, a low moan escaped and then my body was racked by gut-wrenching sobs. So much for regaining my composure.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s arms were around me in a flash, and it was a good thing because I was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>\u201cLydia, Lydia, what happened?\u201d She paused, staring at me. \u201cIs it Brad? I saw him outside and he didn\u2019t say a word to me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t make myself speak. It felt as if this was the end of the world\u2014my world, anyway. I\u2019d been so happy, so excited. For the first time since I was a teenager, I felt truly alive and normal. I\u2019d found love\u2014only to discover how fleeting it can be.</p><p>\u201cI...need to go upstairs,\u201d I whispered after I\u2019d pulled myself together enough to speak. \u201cCan you handle the store for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I retrieved Whiskers from the front window and by chance looked out to see Brad sitting inside his truck. He had doubled over, his forehead pressed against the upper curve of the steering wheel.</p><p>Margaret came to stand behind me. She placed her hand on my shoulder and then glanced out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou and Brad?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s going back to his ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>Margaret turned me in her arms, and hugged me close and hard. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered and I\u2019m sure she was but not nearly as sorry as me.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise wasn\u2019t in the best of moods when she returned from her knitting class. Her nonexistent class. She\u2019d arrived at A Good Yarn to find that Lydia had fallen ill and the class had been cancelled. Margaret had tried to be helpful, but apparently she wasn\u2019t much of a knitter and had never made socks. She did say Lydia would extend the class by one week, which was only fair. Elise, however, had made a considerable effort to get to the yarn store on time and was sorely disappointed.</p><p>By way of apology Margaret had offered Elise, Bethanne and Courtney a thirty percent discount on anything they wanted to buy that day. Elise wasn\u2019t buying anything. She didn\u2019t need yarn, she needed help with the socks and was annoyed that she\u2019d have to wait until the following week to continue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d Aurora commented when Elise walked into the house. Her dour look must have conveyed her mood because her daughter frowned. \u201cWhat happened, did the class get cancelled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I wanted to learn how to turn the heel.\u201d She hadn\u2019t mentioned that the socks were a gift for David. She wished now that she\u2019d lingered downtown and perhaps visited a friend or gone to the library. Instead, she\u2019d rushed back to the house as if she had nothing better to do.</p><p>That sudden desire to return home worried Elise; she was afraid she was succumbing to Maverick\u2019s effect on her. She did everything she could to maintain the distance between them, but it wasn\u2019t easy. After all, they slept across the hall from each other and shared one if not two meals a day.</p><p>Maverick didn\u2019t lose an opportunity to sweet-talk her. Oh, Elise recognized it for what it was. This was simply a form of entertainment to him. She was a challenge, and he was determined to win her over, just to prove he could do it. He might view himself as an irresistible force, but Elise was equally determined to remain an immovable object. She absolutely would not fall under his spell\u2014unlike her daughter and everyone else in the household.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Aurora said under her breath. \u201cDad volunteered to watch the boys for me while I run some errands, but I\u2019m afraid they might be too much for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to help?\u201d</p><p>Aurora\u2019s eyes softened with gratitude. \u201cIf you would, Mom, that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>Elise longed to refuse, but didn\u2019t feel she could. Maverick would surely welcome this as another chance to exercise his considerable charm. That man would try to talk his way into heaven, and was probably counting on doing exactly that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Dad know you\u2019re here,\u201d Aurora said, hugging Elise. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Elise went to her room, but kept the door open, which she often used to do before Maverick\u2019s visit. Heaven only knew how long he intended to stay. He\u2019d said two weeks; he\u2019d been here one week already and hadn\u2019t given any indication that he was ready to head out. Each day was agony. She wanted him gone so she could relax and not have to stay constantly on guard.</p><p>Sorting through her dirty clothes, Elise carried her whites to the laundry room off the kitchen. She loaded the washing machine and waited until she heard the water running before she left.</p><p>As she walked into the living room, she saw Maverick standing there, a boy under each arm. Luke and John squealed with delight and he growled playfully, but stopped abruptly when he saw her. \u201cThe boys want me to take them to the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think you should,\u201d she said formally.</p><p>\u201cI will if you come along.\u201d</p><p>An automatic protest rose. But before she could utter a word, Luke and John begged her to accompany them. She felt she had no choice, particularly since she\u2019d promised Aurora she\u2019d help out with the kids. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll grab my sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cold,\u201d Luke told her.</p><p>Today was unseasonably cold for the end of June, but perhaps to a child who raced and played it was pleasant enough. Elise, however, required a sweater.</p><p>Maverick and the children were waiting out front for her. Elise called Aurora, who had a cell phone, and explained that they were all walking to the park, which was two blocks away.</p><p>The park was little more than a playground with a few pieces of equipment, an abundance of dwarf cherry trees, several well-maintained flower beds and a few benches. The boys loved the swing set and the slides. As soon as they got close, Luke and John tore off across the freshly mowed lawn toward the play equipment.</p><p>Maverick followed Elise to a nearby bench. She planned to sit and wait quietly until the boys wore themselves out. She didn\u2019t care what Maverick did and wanted to groan out loud when he settled down next to her. He watched the kids play, laughing aloud a couple of times and shouting encouragement. She had to acknowledge that he was an excellent grandfather. Although he\u2019d had very little experience with children\u2014as far as she knew\u2014he seemed to have a natural affinity for them. Women too, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you envy all that energy?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She would answer his questions but had no intention of starting up a conversation.</p><p>Maverick didn\u2019t say anything for a minute or so, which for him must be some kind of record. That man could talk more than anyone she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>When he finally did speak, she wished he hadn\u2019t. \u201cI was surprised to find you living with Aurora.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and gathered the sweater more tightly around her. He knew before he\u2019d arrived that she was living with their daughter and her family. \u201cWhat you really mean is that you\u2019re wondering why an independent woman like me is pinching my pennies.\u201d She hadn\u2019t heard from the attorney in a couple of weeks now and was beginning to fear she\u2019d never get her money back. Thinking about the situation made her feel angry and ill, so most of the time she tried to put it out of her mind.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed, \u201cI am wondering. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m in the middle of a class-action lawsuit with a developer. I bought a piece of land and put money down on a house after touring the model home. Then the development company went belly-up.\u201d The bile rose in her throat as she relayed the details of this disaster. \u201cTrust me, dealing with attorneys and lawsuits isn\u2019t how I thought I\u2019d be spending my retirement.\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing to admit how foolish she\u2019d been in not investigating the project thoroughly before she wrote the check. If she had, she would\u2019ve discovered that the developer was in a financial mess.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get the money back?\u201d Maverick asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, along with the other people he swindled,\u201d she snapped, angry that he wouldn\u2019t drop the subject. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t lose on the house, the attorney\u2019s fees are eating up. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not discuss this further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he wanted by the police?\u201d</p> <p>She wished he was; then perhaps there\u2019d be some recourse, but there wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could do except join the others in a lawsuit. \u201cNo. It was incompetence, not outright fraud. In the end, I have no one to blame but myself.\u201d Maverick didn\u2019t need to tell her she\u2019d been naive and trusting\u2014Elise was well aware of that fact.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>His offer touched her. She didn\u2019t want his kindness or his understanding, and at the same time she craved both. \u201cI should\u2019ve brought my knitting,\u201d she declared with such urgency that Maverick stood, seemingly ready to retrieve it on her behalf.</p><p>\u201cDo you need it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt helps calm my nerves, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>He sat back down. \u201cI\u2019ll go get it if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all right. Just don\u2019t be kind to me, Maverick. I don\u2019t want you to, so please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A scowl darkened his features, and then he seemed to go from anger to gentleness in one blink of his eyes. When he looked at her again, his expression was tender. \u201cI love you, Elise.\u201d</p><p>Now she was the one who vaulted to her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that to me! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Maverick, please don\u2019t. Did you love me when you spent the rent check on a double or nothing bet? Did you love me when there wasn\u2019t enough money to buy milk for the baby?\u201d</p> <p>He went very still, then whispered. \u201cYes, I did, but sweetheart, it was a good bet. I couldn\u2019t lose. And I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Elise groaned inwardly. \u201cYou say you loved me but you loved gambling more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He patted the bench, silently inviting her to sit down.</p><p>She waited a moment and then gave in. Maverick Beaumont had always been her weakness, but she was older and wiser now and not as easily swayed. Or so she told herself.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love gambling as much?\u201d she asked, curiosity forcing her to ask.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something. You might not believe it, but I swear to you it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve given it up. I was good at it, Elise, really good. I made a name for myself but it means nothing to me now. What\u2019s important is my family. I\u2019m through with cards.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and resisted the urge to remind him how often she\u2019d heard that before. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m in Seattle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of casinos around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be in any of them. I\u2019m looking for a place to buy close to Aurora so I can spend time with her and my grandsons. I missed out on so much while my daughter was growing up, and I feel that God\u2019s given me a second chance with these boys. I\u2019m different now, Elise. I swear to you I\u2019m a changed man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Maverick. As much as I want to believe you, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cI\u2019ve got my eye on a condo. I put down earnest money, but the unit won\u2019t be available until August first. Aurora told me I could stay as long as I needed, and David agreed. Once everything\u2019s been worked out with the title company and the place is vacant, I\u2019ll move in.\u201d</p><p>Elise wasn\u2019t sure she should let herself trust him. She wanted to believe what he said, but he\u2019d made so many promises before. His intentions always started out good, but after a week or two of staying away from the gaming tables, he\u2019d find a poker game and be willing to wager their food money on a roll of the dice. She\u2019d seen it far too many times.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Grandpa,\u201d Luke cried, running toward the park bench at breakneck speed.</p><p>John followed a few paces behind. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go back to the house.\u201d</p><p>This was a pleasant surprise. Generally, it took the boys an hour or more to wind down enough to even consider returning home.</p><p>\u201cWe want to play that game you taught us,\u201d Luke said, grabbing hold of Maverick\u2019s arm.</p><p>Elise\u2019s suspicions rose. \u201cWhat game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s with cards,\u201d Luke explained.</p><p>A fierce anger gripped her and her heart began to race.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she said to Maverick. \u201cWith cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Texas game,\u201d John told her excitedly.</p><p>\u201cTexas Hold \u2019em,\u201d Maverick said, and had the decency to glance sheepishly in her direction. \u201cNow, Elise, don\u2019t go looking at me like that. It\u2019s a harmless game.\u201d</p><p>She placed both hands on her hips and glared at him. \u201cDo you mean to tell me you\u2019re teaching our grandsons how to gamble?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>She should have known...should have known.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>After the evening\u2019s inauspicious beginning, the Mariners\u2019 game with Andrew and Annie Hamlin had turned out to be fun. Courtney had met five of Andrew\u2019s friends, and they\u2019d all seemed friendly. The one person who\u2019d been standoffish and distant, not to mention rude, had been Annie. It was more than obvious that she didn\u2019t want to be at the game and had somehow been thwarted by her mother and brother from doing something else. She\u2019d ignored both Andrew and Courtney and had barely spoken a word the entire evening. Which was why Courtney was rather shocked when Annie phoned on Friday afternoon and invited her to a movie that night.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure I guess,\u201d Courtney said. It wasn\u2019t like she had any other plans. And a movie was certainly preferable to her other option\u2014playing bingo at the VFW Hall with her grandmother. \u201cWhat did you want to see?\u201d</p><p>Annie seemed unprepared for the question. \u201cI don\u2019t really care, do you? I just need to get out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, anything is fine.\u201d But a nice romantic comedy would suit her; Courtney was in the mood to laugh.</p><p>After some perfunctory chitchat, they arranged a time and place to meet. Precisely at seven, Courtney\u2019s grandmother dropped her off at the entrance to Pacific Place, near the Pottery Barn, on her way to bingo, and Courtney waited outside until Annie arrived. Bethanne waved at Courtney as Annie jumped out of the car and slammed the passenger door.</p><p>The smile on Annie\u2019s face faded as soon as her mother\u2019s car was out of sight. \u201cYou can split now if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only needed you so Mom would think I was going to the movie.\u201d</p><p>Courtney didn\u2019t know whether to feel hurt or offended; what she didn\u2019t feel was surprised. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting friends.\u201d</p><p>The message was clear: Courtney wasn\u2019t one of those friends. Fine, but she had no intention of wandering around town all by herself. \u201cCan I come?\u201d</p><p>Annie gave her the once-over, then shrugged. \u201cOkay, but not looking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d Courtney asked defensively.</p><p>Annie shrugged again. \u201cNothing, I guess, but you need more makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, fine.\u201d Courtney had plenty in her purse.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Bethanne\u2019s daughter said, turning abruptly. She walked into Pacific Place.</p><p>Given no choice, Courtney followed her, weaving through the throng of Friday-evening shoppers. They passed a kiosk selling designer cosmetics, which Annie stopped to admire. \u201cYou\u2019d look good with this lipstick,\u201d she said, twisting open a display tube of bright purple. She checked the price, raised her eyebrows and put it back.</p><p>Courtney started to examine several little pots of eye glitter but didn\u2019t get a chance to see much. Annie had already walked away. Once again, she had to rush in order to catch up. Pacific Place was bright, noisy, crowded with shoppers jostling packages and bags.</p><p>Courtney realized Annie was headed for the ladies\u2019 room. Once inside, Annie stepped into a stall while Courtney stood in front of the sink. She set her purse on the counter and pulled out her cosmetics bag. She was stroking on more eye shadow when Annie left the stall in what appeared to be a completely new outfit.</p><p>The other girl\u2019s blouse had been replaced by a scanty halter top, with her breasts spilling out over the top. The jeans were now a thigh-high, skin-tight denim skirt.</p><p>\u201cShocked?\u201d Annie asked and laughed. \u201cMom would be, too, if she saw me.\u201d Her eyes narrowed as she studied Courtney. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell her, will you?\u201d</p><p>The question was accompanied by a glare that promised to make trouble for her if she refused. \u201cI won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Courtney nodded.</p><p>Annie\u2019s face relaxed in a smile. \u201cGood. Here\u2019s a gift for you.\u201d She tossed Courtney the tube of purple lipstick she\u2019d been looking at only moments earlier.</p><p>Courtney caught it just before it hit the floor. She was stunned; she could\u2019ve sworn she\u2019d seen Annie return it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a skill I have,\u201d Annie explained.</p><p>Courtney hoped she wasn\u2019t around when this little kleptomaniac got arrested. She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, keep the lipstick herself. After her mother died, she\u2019d been shoplifting at an expensive clothing store. Security had called the police and, worse, her father. Nothing was worth risking that humiliation again. Or the guilt...She\u2019d never forget the sorrow and disappointment on her father\u2019s face.</p><p>When Annie wasn\u2019t looking, Courtney threw the tube in the garbage.</p><p>Staring into a mirror, Annie teased her hair, reapplied her makeup with an expert hand and moved toward the door. She sighed when Courtney didn\u2019t immediately follow her. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>Hurriedly, Courtney stuffed her cosmetics bag inside her purse and started after the other girl, wondering where Annie was going now. It didn\u2019t matter. Courtney decided she had to go with her. She didn\u2019t know what Annie was up to but felt responsible. Maybe because of Bethanne; she wasn\u2019t sure. Or maybe it was simply because she recognized the signs\u2014an unhappy, self-destructive girl intent on finding trouble.</p><p>They left Pacific Place and walked a few blocks north. Annie chatted along the way, talking about music and school, and she seemed almost grateful for the company. When the Space Needle came into view, Courtney realized they were close to the Seattle Center.</p><p>Several kids had already assembled in a parking lot not far from the Center. A tall thin boy with long, greasy hair climbed out of his car, a beat-up old hatchback, when Annie approached.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d he asked, gesturing toward Courtney, whom he eyed suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Courtney,\u201d Annie said. \u201cShe\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Courtney raised her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Chris,\u201d he said as he grabbed Annie around the waist and pulled her against him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This guy gave Courtney the creeps, but he and Annie obviously had some kind of relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou got the stuff?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen what are we waiting for?\u201d she said with a saucy laugh.</p> <p>From the way the two of them acted, whispering and laughing together, Courtney assumed they were about to take off without her. They were both inside the vehicle when Chris leaned over the backseat and opened the rear passenger door.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Annie says you\u2019re cool, you\u2019re cool.\u201d</p><p>Courtney reluctantly clambered into the backseat; the moment she\u2019d gotten into the vehicle, Chris roared out of the parking lot. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, searching for a seat belt. There didn\u2019t seem to be one.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if you don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie told her.</p><p>They drove for a while, taking various back streets, and went up and down several others. Although she tried to keep track, Courtney got too confused. She did figure out that they must be somewhere near the waterfront because she saw warehouses and heard a blast from an incoming ferry. By now it was after eight.</p> <p>Chris parked and Annie slid out of the front seat. \u201cCome on,\u201d she shouted to Courtney.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA rave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a rave is?\u201d Annie sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d Courtney said, but she\u2019d never been to one. They were illegal in Chicago and probably Seattle, too.</p> <p>\u201cYou ever done ecstasy?\u201d Chris asked, looping his arm around Annie\u2019s neck.</p><p>Courtney stood back and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Annie assured her. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks...I, uh, think I\u2019ll just watch the first time.\u201d</p><p>Annie glanced at Chris, who shrugged. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>The warehouse was dark and the music so loud it was actually painful. After a few minutes, Courtney\u2019s eyes adjusted and she strained to see what was happening around her. Couples were dancing, some frenetically. Other people were on the side, guzzling drinks\u2014bottles of water, it looked like, and beer. They seemed oblivious to what was going on around them. A fog of smoke hung over the room, and Courtney recognized the pungent scent of marijuana.</p><p>Almost immediately Annie and Chris were on the dance floor. Courtney kept an eye on her. She knew Annie was angry and probably depressed; she\u2019d seen it the night of the baseball game. She\u2019d gone through a difficult time herself after her mother died. Her grades fell and she\u2019d started hanging around with the wrong crowd, getting into minor kinds of trouble. Only she\u2019d been younger, so boys hadn\u2019t been as much of an issue. And she\u2019d smartened up before things could escalate\u2014to raves and drugs. Still, she\u2019d done some pretty stupid stuff that she regretted now and she didn\u2019t want Annie to go through what she had.</p><p>Moving as far back as she could, while still watching Annie, Courtney nearly stumbled over a man squatting in the corner. Her eyes widened as she saw him insert a needle into his arm. After injecting the drug\u2014heroin? She didn\u2019t know\u2014he leaned his head back, then slumped to the ground.</p> <p>Annie staggered off the floor. \u201cDance!\u201d she demanded of Courtney. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a drag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Courtney moved closer to the dancers and lifted her arms up and down like a monkey. She felt stupid, awkward and out of place. Julianna would have her head on a platter if she ever learned about this. Forget her dad; Courtney\u2019s big sister would be furious. But Courtney was stuck now and had no idea where she was or how she\u2019d ever find her way home.</p><p>Annie was acting weird, weirder than before. She and Chris were deeply absorbed in each other. The music was loud and the entire place seemed to reverberate with it. Despite the darkened room, Courtney saw Annie\u2019s purse slip from her shoulder to the floor and ran over to grab it. Neither Annie nor Chris appeared to notice.</p><p>The more she watched the other girl, the more concerned she became. Annie was high. Out of control. She was flinging herself around the dance floor, clutching at Chris, sweating profusely. Nearly desperate, Courtney dug around in Annie\u2019s large purse, past the discarded clothes, until she found a cell phone. Annie needed help. She might not appreciate the interference, but Courtney felt she had to do something and fast. Scrolling down the address book, she paused at the second name. She had to phone either Bethanne or Andrew. Annie was more likely to forgive her for contacting her brother. She hit the key and pressed the phone to her ear, struggling to hear above the din of the music.</p><p>It rang four times before Andrew answered. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded irritably.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, it\u2019s Courtney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me from my sister\u2019s cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2019s in trouble and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to overstate the problem, nor did she feel she should downplay it.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she shouted, struggling to be heard. \u201cWe\u2019re somewhere on the waterfront, in a warehouse. It\u2019s a rave. Oh, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Courtney hurried back to the dance door. \u201cAnnie\u2019s topless,\u201d she said in horror. \u201cShe\u2019s doing drugs. Ecstasy, I think.\u201d She walked toward the doors, where it was marginally quieter.</p><p>\u201cIs she with Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Courtney had left the building now and was surprised to see that it was completely dark out.</p><p>Andrew swore. \u201cI think I know where you are. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over her.</p><p>\u201cStay with Annie,\u201d he instructed her.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Courtney, listen.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThanks.\u201d He clicked off, abruptly ending the conversation.</p><p>Courtney ran back inside and frantically searched the room until she found Annie. She had her legs wrapped around a man, her head thrown back and her arms flaying about to some earsplitting tempo. Chris was with another girl, a spike-haired brunette, and although Courtney couldn\u2019t be sure, it looked as if they were in the middle of sex. Courtney turned away, unwilling to watch. She alternated between rushing outside to flag down Andrew and checking on Annie. An eternity passed before she saw Andrew pull up outside the warehouse in Bethanne\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he shouted, running toward Courtney. He carried a plaid blanket he\u2019d obviously brought with him.</p><p>\u201cInside. She\u2019s with some guy I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to say it, but she was terrified of what Andrew would find when he located his sister. In all likelihood, Annie would never forgive her. Still, Courtney was convinced that Annie didn\u2019t know what she was doing, or with whom.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he told her, his eyes hard.</p><p>Although it was difficult, she did what he asked. She feared Andrew might need help, that Annie would fight him and others might get involved. She conjured up such frightening scenarios that by the time he appeared, carrying his sister, Courtney was ready to phone the police.</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Courtney asked anxiously. Annie seemed half-unconscious, her head lolling back. She was wrapped in the blanket, and Courtney admired Andrew\u2019s thoughtfulness in bringing it.</p><p>His mouth in a tight line, Andrew nodded. \u201cHelp me get her in the car,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Working together, they got Annie into the backseat. Courtney reached into Annie\u2019s purse, producing the blouse she\u2019d worn earlier in the evening, and managed to push Annie\u2019s arms through the sleeves. The girl offered no help and stared up at them, dazed and senseless. Once Courtney had buttoned it, Annie fell across the backseat. Andrew lifted his sister\u2019s legs so that she was completely prone and draped her with the blanket.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d She raised her head enough to ask Courtney in a slurred voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Courtney muttered, and climbed into the front seat next to Andrew.</p><p>\u201cLie down and shut up,\u201d Andrew told his sister.</p><p>She started to groan when they took off. Courtney thought she heard sirens in the distance; whether they had anything to do with the rave or not, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Courtney asked. She didn\u2019t need to clarify her question. Andrew knew what she meant.</p><p>\u201cAnnie and my dad were close,\u201d he said from between gritted teeth. \u201cMy sister hasn\u2019t adjusted to the divorce, as you could no doubt tell on Monday night. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to make my parents regret what they did. The thing she doesn\u2019t understand is how badly she\u2019s hurting herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to get angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d Andrew promised.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d Courtney believed she understood his sister far better than Andrew would ever know. Annie felt as if she\u2019d lost her father; Courtney knew what it was like to lose a parent. Her own life had changed irrevocably the minute her mother died. Nothing was or would ever be the same again. She wouldn\u2019t walk into the house after school and hear her mother\u2019s voice. There wouldn\u2019t be any more of the special traditions Courtney treasured. The world had become a smaller place, a crueler place, without her mother. She didn\u2019t criticize Annie for using drugs. Courtney had chosen another addiction to dull her pain\u2014food. It\u2019d taken her four years to find the resolve to break free of this self-imposed punishment.</p><p>Courtney turned toward him. \u201cI want to talk to Annie later, all right?\u201d she said.</p><p>Andrew looked away from the road long enough to make eye contact with her. \u201cShe needs professional help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Courtney just hoped Annie got that help before it was too late.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>\u201cMost of us knit these garments for someone special. In doing so, we let our love and loving thoughts for one another grow, a single stitch at a time.\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>Somehow I made it through the Fourth of July, thanks to my family. Matt and Margaret were so good to me, and Mom only asked about Brad once. I don\u2019t know what Margaret said, but his name was conspicuously absent from our conversations for the rest of the day.</p><p>Mom seemed especially quiet and even a bit confused. I spent as much time with her as I could, talking to her about the garden, the yarn shop, a TV show we\u2019d both seen. My thoughts were with Brad, though, and with Cody. I experienced my grief as physical pain, as an ache in my chest\u2014I think that\u2019s what people mean when they talk about a broken heart. I wanted to scream at the injustice of it: that Janice was with them and I wasn\u2019t. I tried hard to remember that Cody needed his mother.</p><p>After our barbecued chicken, coleslaw and corn\u2014an all-American feast\u2014I brought out a box of assorted pastries from the French Caf\u00e9. I\u2019d included some cream puffs and napoleons, which were Alix\u2019s specialties. I hoped to see her on Friday at the shop. Once we\u2019d finished dessert I took Mom home; she was too tired by then to wait for darkness to fall and the fireworks to begin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We gathered, Matt, Margaret and I, to watch the fireworks, and as they burst over the Seattle skyline, tears rolled down my cheeks. I\u2019d hardly ever felt more wretched or alone.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t good company. It\u2019d been almost two weeks, and I knew I could make it if I didn\u2019t think about the future, if I coped with one day at a time. If I could get through today, I told myself, I\u2019d find the courage to confront the next day and the next.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that Brad continued to work the same route. Tuesday morning he told Margaret he\u2019d requested a transfer but had been denied. I believed him. Last year, when I\u2019d ended our relationship, he\u2019d applied for\u2014and received\u2014a transfer and then later, when things were settled between us, he\u2019d requested his old route back. Now the powers that be were obviously tired of this. So we were stuck seeing each other on a regular basis.</p><p>After weeks of depression over Matt\u2019s unexpected job loss, Margaret seemed to have cheered up considerably. I didn\u2019t know if this was an act for my benefit. In any case, I chose to believe that because Margaret loves me, she was trying to bolster my mood and create a supportive environment. I valued her support and this new tenderness.</p> <p>I also needed Margaret as a buffer between Brad and me. He\u2019d been in the shop four or five times since our last conversation and, thankfully, my sister was available to deal with him. This saved me, because I wasn\u2019t ready to pretend our relationship was merely casual. I couldn\u2019t speak to him without letting my emotions show and that would\u2019ve humiliated me all the more.</p><p>Besides Margaret, one of my few comforts during this bleak time was the charity knitting group. They came Friday afternoons to work on a number of projects. When I first suggested this idea, my original class decided that they\u2019d knit patches for Warm Up America. The nine-by-seven-inch pieces are crocheted together by Margaret to form blankets. This is her contribution to the effort. The patches make for an easy project, and each requires only a small commitment of time. Jacqueline, Carol and Alix lead busy lives, so this worked well for them. They also liked the idea of being involved in the same projects.</p><p>Elise wanted to come, but hadn\u2019t yet. I\u2019d given her some donated yarn and she was knitting a blanket for the Linus Project at home. Alix had knit a couple of blankets for them, too, between classes at the Seattle Cooking Academy and her part-time job at the French Caf\u00e9.</p><p>Margaret was in the store when all three of the women from my original class showed up on Friday afternoon. She\u2019d become as fond of them as I had. The first to arrive was Jacqueline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d she announced as she swept into the shop. Jacqueline was always one to make an entrance. Margaret and I have come to love the way she broadcasts her arrival, although at one time it annoyed me. As always, Jacqueline looked like the society matron she is, every hair in place. She once told me never to discount the effectiveness of a good hair spray. I would\u2019ve laughed if she hadn\u2019t been serious.</p> <p>I\u2019ve given up trying to keep track of all the traveling Jacqueline and Reece do. In the past year, they\u2019d been on a cruise in the Greek islands, a walking tour of England\u2019s Lake District and most recently they went salmon fishing in Alaska. That, according to Jacqueline, was a longtime dream of her husband\u2019s. To my utter amazement, she loved it and even brought me some smoked salmon.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Jacqueline asked, gazing into my eyes. She didn\u2019t wait for a response before pulling me into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I lied.</p><p>She took her place at the table and brought out her knitting. Her patch was knit in super-wash, hand-dyed wool at fourteen dollars a skein, but that was Jacqueline. Price was rarely a consideration. And in her generosity, she always bought her own yarn for the charity projects, rather than accepting donated leftovers from me.</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019m the first one here,\u201d she said, looking around. This was unusual in itself. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got great news and I\u2019ll tell you first.\u201d She smiled widely. \u201cTammy Lee\u2019s pregnant again! Reece and I are beside ourselves.\u201d</p><p>I remember how she\u2019d once objected strenuously to her southern daughter-in-law and called her \u201cwhite trash\u201d and a \u201cbreeder.\u201d My friend had experienced a change of heart, largely due to Tammy Lee\u2019s patience and her loving personality\u2014as Jacqueline\u2019s the first to admit. Jacqueline adores little Amelia and I was sure she\u2019d feel exactly the same about this new baby.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl and she\u2019s due in February around Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Her eyes lit up. \u201cIsn\u2019t that perfect?\u201d She smiled again. \u201cI want to look through your baby patterns later. There\u2019s knitting to be done!\u201d</p><p>As we laughed, the door opened and Carol came in. I was mildly surprised to find she was by herself.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Cameron?\u201d I asked. The baby had been a miracle, one that had happened last year. Carol and Doug had tried desperately for a baby through in vitro fertilization. They had their son now, but he\u2019d been adopted\u2014truly a child of their hearts. That was thanks to Alix, whose roommate had been secretly and unhappily pregnant.</p><p>\u201cDoug has the day off, so Cam\u2019s with his daddy,\u201d Carol explained as she sat down next to Jacqueline. They exchanged greetings and she took out her knitting. It was wonderful to see her. With a toddler underfoot she couldn\u2019t participate every week. If she did stop by, it was during Cameron\u2019s nap-time. She\u2019d park the stroller by the table and stay only until her son woke up. Her child was the delight of her life; he brought her the greatest happiness imaginable. She\u2019d told me that she and Doug were closer than ever, both of them completely dedicated to Cameron. I wanted to tell her to hold on to this joy, to cling to it, because\u2014as I\u2019d learned two weeks ago\u2014happiness can disappear all too fast.</p><p>Carol\u2019s knitting needles clicked rapidly as she worked on her section of the blanket. She was a fearless knitter who loved a challenge. I\u2019d showed her the two-needle technique for socks and she\u2019d basically taught herself the rest. \u201cI heard from my brother the other day,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cHe\u2019s remarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he didn\u2019t invite you to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He let us know after the fact.\u201d</p><p>From the way she said it, I knew Carol was disappointed in him. She\u2019d confided in me earlier about Rick, and I gathered he was a self-indulgent and rather immature man. An airline pilot, he was a little too apt to engage in dalliances with flight attendants and other women he met on his travels. That had, of course, ruined his marriage to a woman Carol liked.</p> <p>\u201cI hope this marriage lasts longer than his first one,\u201d she added. \u201cDoug and I mailed them a gift. We rarely hear from Rick these days.\u201d In other words, she wasn\u2019t running to the mailbox looking for a thank-you card.</p><p>She was about to say more when the door opened again and in walked Alix.</p><p>\u201cWhuzzup?\u201d she cried to a chorus of greetings. Alix is...unique. When she first signed up for the class, I was afraid I\u2019d be dealing with a felon. The first thing Alix did was tell me she\u2019d be knitting the baby blanket to satisfy her court-ordered community service hours. Next, she wanted to know if that would count toward anger management. Despite some awkward moments early on, we\u2019ve all come to treasure her. Time and love have worn away the rough edges of her personality. Last year she started dating Jordan, a youth minister she\u2019d known since grade school. I knew the two of them were getting serious, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Alix announced their engagement in the near future.</p><p>Alix looked me in the eye. \u201cI know about Brad. I could have him hurt if you want.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if she was joking or not, so I laughed, or tried to. I told her the same thing I did Jacqueline. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and nodded.</p><p>Alix pulled out a chair and sat down with her needles and yarn. I sat at the end of the table, resuming a ChemoCap I\u2019d begun the week before. Smiling at my friends, I tried to imagine the Warm Up America blanket they\u2019d construct. Jacqueline with her lavender-and-pink super-wash wool patches; Carol\u2019s patches in a nice Paton\u2019s baby-blue yarn left from a sweater she\u2019d knit Cameron; and Alix\u2019s variegated green- and-yellow blend, leftovers one of my other customers had donated.</p><p>\u201cI made a genoise this morning,\u201d Alix said proudly. \u201cThose are really hard to do\u2014very delicate. It turned out perfectly. And it sold right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Jacqueline exclaimed. \u201cI want to order one for a business dinner we\u2019re having next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you\u2014it\u2019s free. I\u2019ll make it at home.\u201d Alix continued to live in the housekeeper\u2019s quarters at Jacqueline and Reece\u2019s place. She\u2019d originally been hired to help with the housework, but with school and her job, it\u2019d become too much for her. Jacqueline had hired someone else who came in during the days to do the housekeeping, but Alix was still staying with the Donovans to watch the house whenever Jacqueline and Reece traveled.</p><p>\u201cJust think of it,\u201d Alix said, \u201cI get my first real job as a pastry chef, and wouldn\u2019t you know, it\u2019s in the same spot I worked before. Only this time it\u2019s not a video joint, but a classy caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Reece and I didn\u2019t have a thing to do with her getting that job,\u201d Jacqueline reminded everyone. \u201cAlix was hired for her skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I was. Anyone who tastes my \u00e9clairs and cream puffs would know it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention those \u00e9clairs,\u201d Jacqueline pleaded, briefly closing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m on a new diet and I\u2019m avoiding desserts\u2014except at dinner parties, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of diets,\u201d I said, changing the subject, \u201cI\u2019ve got a teenager in my sock class, Courtney, who\u2019s knitting in an effort to lose weight.\u201d I laughed as I said it. \u201cHow it works, she says, is that while she\u2019s knitting, she\u2019s not in the kitchen hauling food out of the fridge. And she\u2019s definitely lost a few pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Jacqueline murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s worth considering. Keep us posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtney\u2019s a high-school senior,\u201d I said. \u201cDoes anyone remember meeting Vera Pulanski? This is her granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded. \u201cVera gave me her scarf pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtney\u2019s living with her this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d Alix asked. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, moving around so much. I should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone else interesting sign up for your classes?\u201d Carol asked, finishing her row.</p><p>I hesitated before mentioning Bethanne. \u201cA divorced woman who hasn\u2019t quite found herself.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help worrying about her. Bethanne had talked about needing a job, but apparently nothing I or any of the other women suggested was suitable. She seemed depressed to me, lacking direction and purpose. All that kept her going was her two teenage children, who\u2019d be out of the house within a few years. Bethanne would be completely alone then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Elise, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the retired librarian?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I put aside the ChemoCap and cast on stitches for a new patch in an acrylic and wool blend, a sample one of the reps had given me. \u201cI thought she was a bit of a prude when we first met, but I\u2019ve changed my mind. I think she\u2019s simply...self-contained. I got the impression she doesn\u2019t have many friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her about my Birthday Club?\u201d Jacqueline asked. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to join.\u201d</p> <p>I should\u2019ve guessed that my friend, the social butterfly, would be willing to draw Elise into her circle. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s part of the country club set,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a good excuse to go out once a month and celebrate. And if nobody in the group has a birthday that month, we choose a celebrity or a famous writer. So in June, we toasted Judy Garland and Dorothy Sayers. We have a lot of fun.\u201d She giggled like a schoolgirl, silly and joyous. Sometimes it was difficult to remember that this was the same stuffy socialite who\u2019d walked in my door a year ago. I attributed the transformation to the fact that my friend had rediscovered her love for her husband and become close to her daughter-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Elise,\u201d I said, but I\u2019d feel a little uncomfortable doing it. Elise was a difficult woman to read. She was guarded and didn\u2019t share much about her life, as if she was afraid to let people know who she was. However, she brightened whenever she mentioned her daughter and grandchildren.</p><p>During the last class, she\u2019d been even more withdrawn than usual. When I tried to get her to enter into the conversation, she\u2019d smiled weakly and apologized for being out of sorts. She\u2019d actually revealed something about herself that day. Her ex-husband was visiting, she told us, and had announced he was moving to the area. Elise didn\u2019t appear pleased at the prospect of sharing her family with a man who\u2019d been absent for most of his daughter\u2019s life.</p><p>The bell chimed and because it was Friday, I half feared it might be Brad. I\u2019d leave Margaret to deal with him; she\u2019d been busy with customers all afternoon. She seemed to sense that I needed this break, this time surrounded by friends. I sighed with relief when I saw Elise. \u201cI was just talking about you,\u201d I said and greeted her warmly.</p> <p>She looked shyly around the table. I introduced her, and Jacqueline was quick to move her knitting bag, clearing a space in the chair next to hers. \u201cLydia said you recently retired. I\u2019d say it\u2019s high time you joined the Birthday Club.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary.\u201d Elise seemed uncertain about Jacqueline\u2019s invitation. \u201cAt my age, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to make a fuss about getting older.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline smiled. \u201cAre you kidding? Every new year is a reason to celebrate. You\u2019ll love it, I promise. Our next meeting is Thursday lunch and I\u2019ll come and get you. Life is meant to be lived, that\u2019s what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I won\u2019t know anyone. And...what about the cost? How much is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know me,\u201d Jacqueline insisted. \u201cAnd your first lunch is my treat, since we missed your real birthday.\u201d When Elise continued to object, Jacqueline spoke in a decisive tone the rest of us were familiar with. \u201cYou\u2019re coming, understand? I won\u2019t listen to a single argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that would be all right,\u201d Elise said, but she didn\u2019t sound confident that this would be a pleasant experience.</p> <p>I was smiling, genuinely warmed by my friends. The bell chimed again and when I looked up there was Brad. Just as I\u2019d feared...The happiness drained out of me but I need not have worried.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s gaze went straight to me from across the room. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Alix frowned and leaned forward to whisper, \u201cI can still have him hurt. I know people. You say the word, and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>I still hadn\u2019t decided whether or not she was joking, but I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes away from Brad. I shook my head. He looked as miserable as I felt. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d I assured Alix. He was hurting enough already. We both were.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise\u2019s book club met at two o\u2019clock on the second Monday of every month and she loved it. The group was sponsored by the Seattle Public Library, and Elise had promised herself she\u2019d participate after she retired. She also planned to join Jacqueline\u2019s Birthday Club at least once, and was determined to enjoy herself.</p><p>The July book discussion revolved around the book Girl In Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland. It had been lively, and Elise left the meeting feeling invigorated. The group had brought a variety of perspectives to the novel, including some she hadn\u2019t previously considered.</p> <p>The bus dropped her off a half block from home. The house was quiet when she walked in and she tried to remember what Aurora had said about her plans.</p><p>The minute she walked in the door, Luke and John always demanded her attention. The silence this afternoon was disorienting.</p><p>\u201cAurora, I\u2019m back, and it was the best meeting yet,\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2014\u201d She paused in midsentence when Maverick stepped out of the kitchen wearing an apron and wielding a tomato-smeared wooden spoon.</p><p>\u201cAurora and the boys are out for the afternoon,\u201d he explained. \u201cLast-minute plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her excitement evaporated quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cooking,\u201d he explained, although that was obvious. \u201cLasagna to be exact\u2014it was always your favorite of my dishes.\u201d</p><p>Elise imagined he\u2019d dirtied every single pan and bowl. She remembered how he could wreak havoc in an orderly kitchen. \u201cDoes Aurora know about this?\u201d she asked sternly. He expected her to comment on the fact that he was supposedly doing this for her benefit, but she wasn\u2019t saying a word.</p><p>\u201cAurora suggested it.\u201d</p><p>Elise wondered about that, but couldn\u2019t very well argue with him.</p><p>\u201cYou will join me for dinner, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, smiling at her in a way that made refusing him difficult. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, she was tempted, but common sense overruled that brief thought. \u201cThank you, but no,\u201d she returned stiffly. \u201cI had a snack this afternoon at my book club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you read?\u201d he asked, delaying her in the hallway when he knew very well she wanted to escape.</p><p>\u201cA book.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as though he found that amusing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go to my room now, if you\u2019d kindly move aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just putting the lasagna in the oven. Dinner will be ready in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will Aurora and the boys be back?\u201d she asked, instead of arguing.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t say for sure. Eight o\u2019clock, she figured. She\u2019s meeting her friend\u2014Susan?\u201d</p><p>He made it a question, apparently unsure of the name.</p><p>\u201cSusan Katz has been Aurora\u2019s best friend nearly her entire life.\u201d Her voice hummed with indignation. Had Maverick taken more than a casual interest in their daughter, he would\u2019ve known that. \u201cSusan has two little girls around the same age as Luke and John. Did they go to Lake Washington?\u201d It was a favorite summertime activity for them.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>That told Elise her ex-husband was right\u2014her daughter and grandsons wouldn\u2019t be home until late. With busy schedules and complicated lives, it was difficult for Aurora and Susan to coordinate time together. They\u2019d probably stop somewhere for dinner on the drive home.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s out of town until Wednesday,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she took delight in informing him. \u201cIt\u2019s just you. I\u2019m not hungry. I intend to spend the rest of the evening in my room. Apparently you weren\u2019t listening.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cNo.\u201d He sounded discouraged. \u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Elise almost felt sorry for him. She was relieved when he turned away and went back to the kitchen. Feeling guilty at having dampened his spirits\u2014and feeling angry about feeling guilty\u2014she continued down the long hallway to her sanctuary.</p><p>An hour later, Elise sat in front of her television, half watching the evening news. Her fingers moved nimbly as she worked on her charity knitting project. She\u2019d knit fifteen patches for the Warm Up America blanket, plus a blanket for the Linus Project, and kept herself busy with that while she waited for the next sock-knitting class.</p><p>Binding off the patch, she was about to reach for the remote control when her stomach growled. Those snacks she\u2019d mentioned\u2014a few carrots and celery sticks from the veggie tray and a small piece of cheese\u2014had long since disappeared. Whether she wanted to admit it or not, she was famished.</p><p>As if this message had somehow been telegraphed to Maverick, he chose that precise moment to knock at her bedroom door. Once she\u2019d called out, he opened it.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping I could get you to change your mind. It\u2019s no fun eating alone.\u201d</p><p>The scents emerging from the kitchen, fresh basil and oregano blended with the enticing aromas of garlic and tomatoes, were her undoing. \u201cI suppose I could manage to eat a bit.\u201d This was fair warning to keep food in her room for future emergencies, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry,\u201d Maverick promised gleefully. He led her into the dining room, and it was as if he\u2019d planned this meal just for her. Fresh white daisies adorned the center of the table. There were two place settings, opposite each other, and he\u2019d used Aurora\u2019s loveliest china and crystal. He\u2019d already poured the wine. A merlot, she suspected, remembering his preferences. Although it\u2019d been years since they\u2019d dined like this, she remembered his every like and dislike. Elise recalled, too, that Maverick had cooked for her the night he proposed. Not lasagna that time but linguine with a shrimp and crab cream sauce. Oh, this was ridiculous! Why was she still thinking about a meal she\u2019d had decades ago?</p><p>Maverick pulled out the chair to seat her. \u201cYou were very confident, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she said stiffly, looking at her filled wineglass.</p><p>\u201cI was more confident about the scent of my cooking.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be with him like this and yet she did\u2014and it was more than the empty sensation in her stomach. Spending this kind of time with him was dangerous. Well, she knew that, but she was here now, and hungry, and she might as well have dinner.</p><p>Maverick brought a Caesar salad, redolent with garlic, into the dining room. When he was seated again, he lifted his wineglass. \u201cI\u2019d like to propose a toast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she said and heard the tremor in her voice. \u201cThis is thoughtful of you, but it\u2019s dinner and nothing more. There\u2019s no romance between us, and one meal isn\u2019t going to resurrect long-dead feelings.\u201d</p><p>Maverick arched his eyebrows. \u201cLong-dead?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been divorced more years than I care to think about,\u201d she felt obliged to remind him. If he wasn\u2019t counting, she was.</p><p>\u201cA toast,\u201d he continued, ignoring her outburst. \u201cTo Elise, the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back the chair, ready to walk away. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she warned him. Her throat thickened with resentment. How dared he say such a thing to her!</p><p>He lowered his wineglass as if nothing was amiss, and reached for his fork. Since\u2014apparently\u2014he intended to behave himself, she reached for her own. Although the lump in her throat made it difficult to chew and swallow, the effort was worth it. Maverick possessed many talents but he excelled in the kitchen. He could have been a noteworthy chef had he followed that path. Instead he\u2019d chased after a pot of gold, collecting nothing except dust and false dreams along the way.</p> <p>When they\u2019d finished their salad, he removed the plates and served the lasagna. It tasted as heavenly as it smelled, and Elise savored every bite, eating far more than she normally did.</p><p>They ate in silence until he finally spoke. \u201cThere\u2019s something we should discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what,\u201d she replied primly.</p><p>To her astonishment, he relaxed in his chair and broke into a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI used to love it when you got all uppity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d She already regretted agreeing to dinner. Would she never learn?</p><p>\u201cYou used to do that,\u201d he said, motioning toward her with his hand, \u201cwhen we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d get that haughty look on your face\u2014the same look you have right now.\u201d He grinned triumphantly. \u201cI loved it. Still do.\u201d</p><p>She scraped up the last forkful of noodle, sauce and melted cheese, not deigning to respond. In another minute, she\u2019d retreat to her room....</p> <p>\u201cI used to time myself\u2014see how long it would take me to get you to smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she sputtered, outraged by his remark. Everything, everything, was a challenge to him. A game.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember,\u201d he teased, his eyes sparkling. \u201cI used to wrap my arms around you from behind and kiss you till\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did no such thing.\u201d She remembered all too well, but chose to push those memories away. During their marriage, Maverick always got what he wanted\u2014always won his little games\u2014by using her love for him. Taking advantage of it, of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, you remember,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done my best to forget,\u201d she said without emotion. \u201cYou might not believe this, but living with you had very little to recommend it.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded and he sobered. \u201cNo one is more aware of that than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might claim you\u2019ve given up gambling but you can\u2019t do it. The allure is still there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true? You can\u2019t stay away from the cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can play,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI don\u2019t need to gamble.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s like an alcoholic claiming he can go into a tavern and not be tempted.\u201d Considering that he was teaching their grandsons poker, he was being more than a little unrealistic about his ability to control his gambling.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Elise. It\u2019s over. I refuse to squander the rest of my life on a roll of the dice or the luck of the draw. I want my family and I want you.\u201d</p><p>Shocked by his words, Elise nearly spewed wine across the tablecloth. With a supreme effort she swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re too late,\u201d she told him. \u201cThirty-seven years too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said as he saluted her with his wineglass, \u201cthat I\u2019m just in time.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>Bethanne turned off the vacuum cleaner and listened. Sure enough, the phone was ringing. She debated letting the answering machine pick up, but she\u2019d left job applications at a number of businesses and didn\u2019t want to miss a call from a prospective employer.</p><p>Hurrying into the kitchen, she drew in a calming breath and grabbed the receiver. \u201cThis is Bethanne Hamlin,\u201d she said in her most professional voice.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Deflated, Bethanne leaned against the kitchen wall. She didn\u2019t want to deal with her ex-husband again. Their last meeting, at the caf\u00e9 on Blossom Street, had left her reeling with resentment and anger. \u201cHello, Grant, how unpleasant to hear from you,\u201d she murmured sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over.\u201d</p><p>She bit back the words to tell him she would choose the time and place of their next meeting, but it would do little good. After twenty years of marriage she knew Grant\u2019s moods. She could tell from his tone that he was furious and wouldn\u2019t be put off.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said curtly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The unnamed problem was apparently urgent enough for Grant to take time off in the middle of the day\u2014something that hardly ever happened. She hung up and returned to her vacuuming.</p><p>Exactly seven minutes after his call, she heard the knob twist and then a heavy fist pounding against the front door. Grant mistakenly assumed he had the right to walk into her home. Well, she\u2019d fixed that. After the divorce was final, Bethanne had changed the locks, and it gave her a sense of satisfaction to thwart him now.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I intended to break in?\u201d he snarled when she unlocked the door and stepped aside to let him into the house.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to give you the opportunity,\u201d she snarled back. She wanted him to know that he was only there now with her express permission.</p><p>Grant charged into the kitchen, then whirled around to face her. \u201cDid you put Annie up to this?\u201d he demanded, his eyes spitting fire at her.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d He glared at her, fists clenched at his sides. \u201cWhere is she anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to our daughter, all I can tell you is that she\u2019s out.\u201d Bethanne folded her arms over her chest and relaxed, leaning her hip against the kitchen counter. She\u2019d tried to warn him, had done her level best to let him know what she\u2019d discovered. Grant had dismissed her worry, as he so often had in the past. In her view, that meant any mischief Annie had visited on Tiffany was his problem, not hers.</p><p>\u201cYou knew\u2014and you didn\u2019t say a word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I warned you about the way she felt\u2014the way she still feels.\u201d She sighed with exaggerated patience. \u201cIf you recall, I mentioned that I\u2019d read Annie\u2019s journal.\u201d Bethanne didn\u2019t know what her daughter had done on this particular occasion, only that Annie festered with rage.</p><p>Grant started to pace. \u201cAll you said was that she\u2019s angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThat was all you let me say. As I remember the conversation, you brushed aside my concern and said Annie would get over it in time.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s hurting and she blames Tiffany. I assume she had some bedwetting information mailed to her.\u201d She\u2019d read that in the journal and been privately amused. There\u2019d been plenty of other items Annie had requested in Tiffany\u2019s name. Immature and annoying behavior, yes\u2014but what had really shocked Bethanne was the pure hatred her daughter felt for the other woman. Her words were full of spite and anger, to the point that Bethanne knew something had to be done. Annie refused to discuss it, and Grant refused to listen. Bethanne had made an appointment with the therapist she\u2019d seen briefly after Grant\u2019s defection; she wanted to talk about the situation, get some advice, maybe arrange for Annie to see her, too.</p><p>\u201cHaving all that crap sent to the apartment is mail fraud, and it isn\u2019t a laughing matter. But that\u2019s not the half of it. She\u2019s gone way over the line this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow unfortunate you have to deal with more junk mail than usual,\u201d Bethanne said sarcastically, knowing it was a childish response. \u201cMy sympathies to you both.\u201d</p><p>Grant scowled at her. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for your support,\u201d he muttered. \u201cEspecially since I\u2019ve spent the last hour dealing with Tiff who\u2019s hysterical because someone poured sugar down her gas tank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bethanne gasped.</p><p>\u201cOne guess who\u2019s at the top of the suspect list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d This was much worse than Bethanne had expected. Grant was probably right, too\u2014it was a step up from requesting nuisance mail, but exactly the type of revenge Annie could wreak.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a serious offense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked to the cops yet, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really prosecute your own daughter?\u201d Grant had sunk lower than she\u2019d ever thought he would, but she\u2019d never dreamed he\u2019d turn Annie over to the authorities.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t me she\u2019s doing this to, it\u2019s Tiff.\u201d</p><p>Tiff, it was. Poor, poor Tiff. \u201cThen perhaps you should have Tiff discuss the matter with Annie and work this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnnie\u2019s done her best to make Tiffany\u2019s life and mine a living hell. You don\u2019t even want to know about the horrible garbage she\u2019s sent via the Internet. Why can\u2019t you control your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. Annie\u2019s your daughter, too, and her secure and happy life was uprooted because her father\u2019s brains are located below his belt buckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Bethanne, I don\u2019t have to put up with that kind of verbal abuse from you. We\u2019re divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then,\u201d she said, gesturing at the front door. \u201cGet out of my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason you have this house is because I gave it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGave it to me?\u201d she cried, outraged he\u2019d even suggest such a thing. \u201cGave it to me mortgaged to the hilt. There\u2019s not a penny\u2019s equity in this place, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who\u2019s making the payments?\u201d he challenged. \u201cDon\u2019t forget I\u2019m the one signing those alimony checks\u2014which allow you to keep this house. And that reminds me, do you have a job yet?\u201d This was asked with such blatant sarcasm, Bethanne cringed.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to control her anger. She didn\u2019t want to argue with Grant. There was no point.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said, apparently reaching the same conclusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to fight. We need to develop some sort of plan to deal with Annie\u2019s problem. This can\u2019t go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t angry with me. You deal with her.\u201d She wasn\u2019t being flippant. Annie\u2019s pain was caused by her father. Bethanne was making an effort to help, but anything she could do seemed more like damage control. Grant had to take some responsibility here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grant splayed his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Annie might do something to physically hurt Tiff,\u201d he mumbled and shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about Tiffany?\u201d Bethanne exploded.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I am. Someone who\u2019d deliberately sabotage her car is one step from doing something physically aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Annie?\u201d Bethanne asked, shocked that he could be so self-absorbed. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about her? Doesn\u2019t she deserve any concern?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m worried, but I can\u2019t deal with her. She hates me. At least that\u2019s the impression she\u2019s given me. If you know something I don\u2019t, then I\u2019d appreciate being filled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d Bethanne said in a shaky voice. \u201cShe desperately loves you and believe it or not, Annie needs her father. It was one thing to divorce me, but you weren\u2019t supposed to divorce your children. When was the last time you talked to your daughter? You used to at least call her every week or two. I understand that\u2019s stopped. Why? When did you last have a conversation with her\u2014or Andrew, for that matter? Need I remind you these are your children, too?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his shoes. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy?\u201d she cried. \u201cDo you honestly expect me to consider that a valid excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you as my conscience. Besides, Annie and Andrew refuse to have anything to do with Tiff. They won\u2019t even come to the condo because she might be there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk to Annie,\u201d she advised, setting her pride aside long enough to plead with him. \u201cCall her up and take her to lunch. She needs assurances that you still care about her and that you want to be part of her life. But only if you\u2019re sincere. Don\u2019t just pay her lip service\u2014that\u2019ll do more harm than good.\u201d</p><p>He nodded like a petulant child. \u201cAll right. I will. I\u2019ll call her in a couple of days.\u201d He hesitated, then gave her a wry smile. \u201cThanks, Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Andrew?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne resisted the urge to roll her eyes. \u201cAsk him yourself.\u201d</p><p>Grant cast her a chagrined look. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t keen to have anything to do with me, with or without Tiff around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShow up for a few of his football games in September, and my guess is he\u2019d be willing to remember you\u2019re his father again.\u201d</p><p>Grant seemed to consider that. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>In other words, if it didn\u2019t interfere with his schedule and he had nothing better to do.</p><p>She waited, thinking it was time he left, but Grant lingered as if there was something else on his mind. \u201cI understand you and Paul Ormond recently got together,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>He offered her a half smile. \u201cWord gets around. A guy from the office\u2014you don\u2019t know him\u2014saw the two of you at Anthony\u2019s the other night. What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he know me?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cI had your picture on my credenza.\u201d</p> <p>Past tense, she noticed. The irony of the situation didn\u2019t escape her. For two years he\u2019d snuck around behind her back, having an affair, and not once had she gotten wind of it. But she had one date in twenty-two years, and someone reported it to Grant.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Paul an item?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bethanne stopped herself just in time. It wasn\u2019t any of his concern who she saw\u2014or dated. Nor did he need to know that Paul had phoned two or three times since and encouraged her in her job search. They were simply friends, but she\u2019d never had a male friend before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s between Paul and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I should mind my own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling gleefully. \u201cI think you put it very well a few months ago. I have my own life now, Grant, and it is my life.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>Courtney felt wretched. An enraged Annie Hamlin sat in the middle of Courtney\u2019s bed. She\u2019d ranted for a good five minutes without taking a breath, still angry almost two weeks after the rave and everything that had happened.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to contact Andrew,\u201d Annie finished, whispering fiercely, apparently afraid of being overheard.</p><p>Courtney didn\u2019t bother to tell her not to worry, that her grandmother was half-deaf. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it because I wanted to, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew says I should thank you, but you can forget that.\u201d She glared at Courtney as if she\u2019d purposely set out to ruin Annie\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known you\u2019d be a goody-goody type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink what you like, Annie,\u201d she said, unwilling to let the other girl attack her. \u201cBut maybe it wouldn\u2019t do you any harm to hear what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Courtney sidestepped the question and got directly to the point. \u201cI know what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother died and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cAm I supposed to feel sorry for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now shut up and listen! Your father walked out on you and what you feel isn\u2019t that different from what I felt when my mom was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish my dad was dead.\u201d</p><p>Courtney grabbed the other girl\u2019s shoulders and her fingers dug into Annie\u2019s arms. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t! You\u2019re angry and the pain is ripping you up inside, but you don\u2019t wish that. You can\u2019t. My mother is dead and I\u2019d give anything to have her back. Dead is forever, you understand? You haven\u2019t got any idea what it\u2019s like to have your mother alive and laughing one day, and then on some slab in a morgue the next. You can\u2019t possibly know what that\u2019s like.\u201d Tears clouded her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years, and I think about her every single day. Some days it\u2019s every single minute. My mom didn\u2019t want to die, you know. She was meeting a friend for lunch and a truck blew a tire and swerved onto the other side of the road.\u201d She rarely talked about the accident, rarely mentioned it to anyone, but Courtney felt it was vital that Annie understand what she was saying. Courtney had argued with her mother, too. She\u2019d been furious with her a dozen or more times in that last year, but\u2014as she\u2019d just told Annie\u2014she\u2019d give anything she had now, or ever would, to have her mother back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I feel,\u201d Annie shouted, twisting free of her grip.</p><p>Courtney no longer cared if Grams was listening to the conversation. She tried another way to reach Annie. \u201cI used to pretend my mom was still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is supposed to make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a reality check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deal with any more reality than I already am. I just want my life back the way it used to be, with my mom and dad and\u2014\u201d She bit her lower lip and her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d In a flash Annie was off the bed. She grabbed her purse. \u201cJust don\u2019t do me any more favors, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Courtney muttered. She felt like a failure. It was a risk to contact Andrew that night, and Annie didn\u2019t seem to appreciate how difficult the decision had been. Her only reaction was embarrassment, and that had turned to anger at Courtney. If it hadn\u2019t been for her, Andrew would never have known she was at the rave. On the other hand, Annie could\u2019ve been in serious trouble. Kids had died from ecstasy; Courtney had heard of cases in Chicago.</p><p>\u201cCourtney,\u201d Grams shouted from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she shouted back, lazily unfolding her legs and moving off the bed.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right up there? Your friend left in a mighty big rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Courtney assured her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you have a friend,\u201d Grams said smiling up at her. \u201cI\u2019m heading out to the Missionary Society Meeting. Do you want to tag along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay if I took my bike out instead?\u201d She really didn\u2019t enjoy sorting and packing clothes to ship to China. Perhaps in a few years chatting with Grams\u2019s friends would be stimulating, but currently Courtney found it uninspiring. All they talked about were their aches and pains.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Grams asked.</p><p>After three years during which her father had given her practically free rein, being accountable to her grandmother was a drag. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stop off at the yarn store and deliver those patches you knit.\u201d That was a destination and a purpose Grams would approve of.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, that\u2019d be fine. Say hello to Lydia for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her helmet and gloves, Courtney bounded down the stairs. The frustration she felt was nearly overwhelming. She\u2019d tried to do the right thing for Annie and those insults were all the thanks she got. Biking might give her a chance to vent her annoyance.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that Courtney saw she\u2019d gained a pound when she stepped on the scale that morning. After a solid week of denial, she should\u2019ve lost at least that much and instead she\u2019d gained.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you be back?\u201d Grams wanted to know as Courtney came through the kitchen on her way to the garage.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got money with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother hanging around to listen to any other questions. She wanted to escape and longed to feel the wind on her face and the sun on her neck as she pumped those pedals. The hell with Annie. She\u2019d tried to help, tried to talk to her; she\u2019d told her more than she\u2019d ever shared with anyone about her mother, but it\u2019d been a waste of time.</p><p>Courtney was breathless when she reached Blossom Street. As she turned the corner, A Good Yarn came into view and so did the French caf\u00e9 on the other side of the street. The front window had a display of pastries.</p><p>Slowing the bike, she coasted to a stop outside the yarn store. Forcing her eyes away from the bakery window, she glanced into the front window of the shop and noticed Whiskers curled up, fast asleep. Lydia was busy with a customer; Margaret was, too. Even if Courtney did go directly inside, neither would have time to talk to her. Her gaze eagerly returned to the bakery.</p><p>Just last week Bethanne had talked about the chocolate \u00e9clairs and how delicious they were. Lydia had taken up the subject, raving about the croissants, but those \u00e9clairs were her favorite, too, she\u2019d said. She made it sound as if she ate them by the dozen. If so, she hadn\u2019t gained an ounce.</p><p>Courtney had practically starved to death all week and she\u2019d gained weight. It was hard enough to stay on this P diet; not seeing results was a case of adding insult to injury. Or was it the other way around? She could never remember.</p><p>She peered inside the yarn store again and then looked over at the bakery. The pastries weren\u2019t the only thing Lydia had bragged about. She\u2019d made sure everyone knew that a girl from her original knitting class was one of the bakers. Her name was Alix, and she\u2019d made a big deal about how it was spelled with an i instead of an e. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alix baked in the morning and waited behind the counter some afternoons. She also attended class at the culinary institute, so she must be good at making those delectable-sounding treats. The five-dollar bill in Courtney\u2019s pocket felt like it was on fire. \u00c9clairs didn\u2019t start with the letter P. Okay, pastry did, but she was willing to overlook that minor detail.</p><p>Driven by her desire to taste something sweet, Courtney walked her bike across the street and parked it against the side of the building. The girl behind the counter didn\u2019t seem the knitting type. Then Courtney read her name tag. Alix with an i. Yup, just like Grams always said, appearances could be deceiving.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Alix?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The other girl nodded. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not. I\u2019m in one of Lydia\u2019s knitting classes.\u201d</p><p>She immediately brightened. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to be Courtney, would you?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Courtney nodded. \u201cLydia mentioned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Do you know what\u2019s going on with her and Brad?\u201d</p><p>Courtney raised her eyes from the glass case, where the chocolate \u00e9clairs oozed rich custard and sat on a platter decorated with a paper doily. \u201cGoing on?\u201d she repeated.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, since they broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any more than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope they patch things up.\u201d Alix sounded genuinely concerned.</p><p>\u201cHow much for one of the chocolate \u00e9clairs?\u201d They weren\u2019t all that big, so perhaps she should order two.</p><p>Alix told her, and Courtney calculated how much it would cost for two, with tax. Plus a Coke, and not the diet variety, either. She was sick of drinking sugar-free soda. If she was going on a sugar high, then she might as well go the whole way. Why cheat herself out of a soda?</p><p>\u201cLydia said you\u2019ve been losing weight. My hat\u2019s off to you. It\u2019s hard,\u201d Alix said softly.</p> <p>Courtney nodded.</p><p>\u201cI make a mean low-fat, sugar-free chocolate latte.\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s mouth was watering for that \u00e9clair. \u201cA latte?\u201d She paused to consider her choices and realized she was being offered far more than an incentive to stay on her eating plan. Friendship had no calories, and it was the special on Alix\u2019s menu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that latte,\u201d she said with as much enthusiasm as she could manage.</p><p>Alix smiled. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll make my best one ever.\u201d</p><p>Courtney sighed with relief. Without Alix\u2019s encouragement she probably would\u2019ve given in and ordered the \u00e9clairs and eaten them so fast they\u2019d disappear before she\u2019d even tasted them. Then, they\u2019d reappear on her thighs.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said when Alix handed her the latte. \u201cI appreciate the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Come back whenever you want. And if you find out anything about Brad and Lydia, let me know, all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Courtney promised. Her first sip of the latte was divine. This was just as good as Alix had promised. And latte didn\u2019t start with the letter P.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>\u201cThe act of knitting is a meditation, for the work of the hands compels the mind to rest, and gives free rein to movements of the soul.\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>Tuesday morning when Margaret showed up for work, I knew right away that something was wrong. I hoped my sister would tell me. No matter what, though, I was determined not to pry it out of Margaret. Our relationship had been less strained, but I suspect that was primarily because of the situation between Brad and me.</p><p>We\u2019d arrived at an unspoken agreement. I didn\u2019t inquire about Matt\u2019s job search and she didn\u2019t mention Brad. It was an uneasy truce. I knew she was curious and no doubt concerned; I felt the same way about her. I kept quiet about the fact that Brad had phoned me one evening. When his name came up on Caller ID, I didn\u2019t pick up. I couldn\u2019t. It occurred to me later that the call might be from Cody, and in some ways, that would\u2019ve been even more difficult. I hadn\u2019t guessed how much I\u2019d miss him.</p><p>With the passing of time, I\u2019d begun to understand what Brad had meant about giving his son a family. As much as I love Cody, and I do, I had to accept that I\u2019ll never be his mother. Brad loves him, and despite his feelings for me or for that matter Janice, his son had to come first. I could only love and admire him more for the strength of his devotion to Cody.</p><p>When Brad divulged that he was talking to Janice, I was too hurt and angry to appreciate his sacrifice. But I came to realize that this wasn\u2019t about Brad and his ex-wife, it was about Cody. It\u2019d always been about Cody. Brad loves me, yet he was willing to let me go in order to give Cody back his mother.</p><p>Strangely, Brad\u2019s efforts to reconcile with Janice helped me grasp the depth of my own father\u2019s love for me. Dad made sacrifices daily; sacrifices I came to expect because I was so sick and so needy. Not until he died did I appreciate everything my father had been to me.</p><p>I would\u2019ve loved to discuss Brad and Cody with my dad. He was always so wise and loving; he would\u2019ve known just the right thing to say. Even now, I\u2019d give anything to hear his voice again, to feel the comfort of his presence.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we need to order more sock yarn,\u201d Margaret said, breaking into my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d The self-patterning yarn seemed to go out of the shop almost as fast as it came in.</p><p>My class was going well. I\u2019d wondered if holding it on a Tuesday afternoon was a mistake. It\u2019s the first day of my work week and there always seemed to be a hundred things that required my attention. But I decided it was actually an advantage; the small class size meant I could develop real relationships with all three women, just as I had in my original class.</p><p>During one class, Elise described the awkward situation with her ex-husband. Frankly, I was surprised she\u2019d told us that much. She\u2019d always been so restrained. I can\u2019t tell you how shocked we all were when she revealed that Maverick was a professional gambler. The minute that was out, the conversation became lively indeed. What an interesting combination! A librarian and a gambler. This was the stuff of romance novels\u2014but unfortunately there hadn\u2019t been a happy ending for Elise.</p><p>Bethanne Hamlin had ex-husband problems, too. But she was growing more self-confident every week. We could all see it; I\u2019d say it even showed in her knitting. She was experiencing some difficulties with her teenage daughter, but she\u2019d only touched on that subject briefly. I thought she might be afraid of saying too much because of Courtney, who\u2019d become friends with Annie.</p><p>Speaking of Courtney\u2014we all loved her. What a charming girl and such a typical teenager. She talked about her father a great deal and was as excited to get an e-mail or a letter from him as she would an invitation to the senior prom. I was grateful she seemed to be making friends. Although she didn\u2019t say anything about it, I had the feeling she liked Andrew Hamlin, Bethanne\u2019s son. Andrew was the school\u2019s football star, the quarterback, and I was sure he could date just about any girl at Washington High. I also figured Courtney probably didn\u2019t stand much of a chance with him. He\u2019d want slim, trim and stylish\u2014the cheerleader type. Courtney was losing weight, but she still had a few pounds to go.</p><p>On Tuesday, just before one, I heard the bell over the door and immediately glanced up to see Bethanne walk in. She hadn\u2019t even reached her seat before she pulled out her half-knitted sock and held it up for inspection.</p><p>\u201cNotice, I successfully turned the heel,\u201d she announced. \u201cI feel like I should get a gold star for this. It took hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you did it wrong,\u201d Margaret offered from the other side of the shop.</p><p>I was irritated by her comment, but smiled encouragingly at Bethanne. \u201cIt gets easier the more often you do it, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. Well, I was at first because it just didn\u2019t look right, but I followed the instructions and everything came out looking exactly the way it should. I knew one thing\u2014I wasn\u2019t giving up until I got it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you!\u201d I said, resisting the urge to hug her. I really was very proud of Bethanne. She\u2019d come a long way in this class and I wasn\u2019t just talking about knitting.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could do as well in my job search,\u201d she murmured dejectedly.</p><p>Elise arrived moments after Bethanne, and they sat across from one other and compared socks. Elise had knit socks before and turned the heel, but never on two circular needles, which requires a different technique.</p><p>\u201cThis is a lovely job,\u201d I said, studying Elise\u2019s work. Every stitch was perfectly formed. I felt she was a very purposeful knitter\u2014and I had the impression that was exactly how she went about her life, too.</p><p>Courtney was the last one to get there. She rode her bike and parked it outside the shop, chaining it to the light post. I could tell she\u2019d lost more weight. I wanted to say something about how good she looked, but I was afraid my compliment might embarrass her.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Courtney said, bursting into the shop like a sudden squall. She removed the helmet and shrugged off her backpack as she took her seat. Within a minute or two she was set up with her knitting, ready to learn.</p><p>\u201cHow did everyone do?\u201d I asked. We\u2019d already reached the most difficult stage of knitting socks and that was the gusset. In my opinion, the technique has been simplified by the two-needle method, but there are still knitters who prefer the four or five double-pointed needle approach. I know that socks can also be knit on a single 40-inch needle in what is known as the \u201cmagic loop\u201d method; personally, I\u2019m most comfortable knitting and teaching with the two circular needles.</p><p>I carefully examined everyone\u2019s half-completed first sock and found that my students had done very well. We always went through this procedure, almost a little ritual, even if I\u2019d already seen their work. There was something satisfying about it, maybe because of the way it formally acknowledged everyone\u2019s effort. Sitting with them, I described the next step of the process, then left them to knit.</p><p>\u201cI just wish getting a job was this easy,\u201d Bethanne commented, knitting the stitches from one needle to the other.</p><p>Elise looked at her. \u201cI\u2019ve been giving this matter of a job some thought. Where have you applied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere,\u201d she cried, and her voice fell with discouragement. \u201cEverywhere I can think of,\u201d she amended. \u201cThe truth is, I hate not being available for my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour children are old enough to be on their own, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Margaret said, feeling free to leap into the conversation despite helping a paying customer. \u201cI\u2019ve got two daughters,\u201d she continued, oblivious to my frown, \u201cand I leave them.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne considered that for a moment. \u201cDo you feel good about it?\u201d</p><p>Margaret shrugged. \u201cActually, their father\u2019s home this summer and I\u2019m glad of it. We\u2019d both rather he was working, but he\u2019s been able to spend time with the girls and gotten much closer to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be honest, I\u2019m afraid to leave Annie alone,\u201d Bethanne said. I saw Courtney give her a quick glance. \u201cAnnie\u2019s not...quite herself and...well, after the upheaval in their lives, I\u2019d rather be around to keep an eye on her. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want to work\u2014I do! But at the same time, I want to give an employer my best and I won\u2019t be able to do that if I\u2019m constantly worried about what\u2019s happening at home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I remembered how hard Brad found this situation as a single father. Cody was eight this year, and he hated the idea of going to day care, but he was too young to be on his own.</p><p>\u201cSo, Elise\u2014you said you\u2019d been thinking about this?\u201d Bethanne murmured.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given it my best shot,\u201d Bethanne said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for everything from waiting tables\u2014I\u2019m so grateful they didn\u2019t hire me\u2014to a receptionist for a dentist. And just about everything in between.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really weren\u2019t interested in that job at the dentist\u2019s either, were you?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Elise laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. No one will hire you with that attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need a job\u2014and soon\u2014otherwise I\u2019m going to end up homeless,\u201d she said grimly.</p><p>I knew that must be an exaggeration; still, I understood how worried she was about finances. I wished there was enough business so I could hire her myself, but there wasn\u2019t and I couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time we talked about this, you said your only real skill was throwing parties, especially kids\u2019 birthday parties.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been various discussions about the parties Bethanne had planned for her children through the years. She obviously did have a knack for it.</p><p>Bethanne nodded, with a woeful shrug. \u201cUnfortunately, no one\u2019s going to hire me to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cMy grandson\u2019s birthday is coming up soon,\u201d Elise continued. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s a talented woman, but she doesn\u2019t have a creative bone in her body. I\u2019d like to hire you to help her with Luke\u2019s birthday party.\u201d</p> <p>Bethanne immediately sat up straighter. \u201cYou mean to say you\u2019d actually pay me to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin reason, yes,\u201d Elise assured her. I gathered Elise didn\u2019t have much extra cash, so I found this extremely generous.</p><p>\u201cI have lots of wonderful ideas for little boys.\u201d Bethanne was excited now. \u201cWhat does Luke like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurrently, it\u2019s dinosaurs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll get dinosaur eggs, fill them with prizes and bury them. The boys can go on a dig, if that won\u2019t damage your daughter\u2019s lawn or garden. Otherwise I\u2019ll simply hide them.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled. \u201cThat sounds good. And I\u2019ll find out if it\u2019s okay to bury the eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Bethanne said happily. \u201cI could make a dinosaur cake, too\u2014it can\u2019t be that hard. Luke\u2019s probably way beyond Barney, but I\u2019ll bet he\u2019d enjoy a purple cake.\u201d</p><p>Last year about this time, I\u2019d knit Cody a sweater with a big dinosaur on the front and he\u2019d loved it so much, he\u2019d slept with it on. The memory brought a twinge of pain that I did my best to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help with the party,\u201d Bethanne said, but then her enthusiasm dwindled. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to support myself by throwing kids\u2019 birthday parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Elise said again.</p><p>\u201cAmelia\u2019s about to have her first birthday, and I know Jacqueline\u2019s hoping to make an event of it,\u201d I threw in for good measure. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you approached her with a few ideas, she\u2019d hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d Bethanne looked around the table for encouragement. Everyone nodded and made encouraging remarks\u2014even Margaret.</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d I\u2019d never seen Bethanne more animated. Jacqueline had the money to pay for something really special, too. \u201cCall her. I\u2019ll give you her number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Bethanne promised. Her needles clicked energetically as she started describing possibilities for little Amelia\u2019s party. \u201cHow about a teddy bears\u2019 picnic? Or a storytelling party? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Margaret walked over with the phone number written on a sheet of paper. My sister is nothing if not efficient.</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d Courtney offered. \u201cI mean, if you need an assistant, and Annie and Andrew are busy. Most days I have a bunch of free time and you wouldn\u2019t have to pay me or anything.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cThat is so sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m glad to do it.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne glanced from one woman to the next. \u201cThank you all so much. Especially you, Elise. You\u2019ve given me a wonderful idea and I just love it. This is something I\u2019m really, really good at, and I know I can make it a success.\u201d Impulsively she put down her knitting and sprang up to hug the older woman.</p><p>I was delighted by her brand-new confidence and wanted to cheer her on. \u201cI was impressed with the music video party you threw for Annie when she turned twelve,\u201d I said. Bethanne had told us about this a few weeks ago. \u201cI can just imagine how much fun those girls had dressing up as their favorite rock stars and then having a video made of them singing to a karaoke machine. What a wonderful keepsake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the pirate party for Andrew when he was seven,\u201d Courtney added. \u201cIt was so clever to actually bury treasure at the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fun drawing up the treasure maps,\u201d Bethanne said, smiling. \u201cOne for each boy. The treasures were quite elaborate, too. I\u2019d collected junk jewelry, and bought chocolate coins and eye patches. It was a great party. In fact, it was that party that made me realize how much I enjoyed this. Over the years, I\u2019ve helped some of my friends with their kids\u2019 parties, but I never dreamed anyone would actually pay me for doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Andrew\u2019s favorite party, he says. I mean, he still talks about it.\u201d Courtney grinned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have minded a party like that myself.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded. \u201cAnd it\u2019s absolutely perfect for little boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Bethanne nodded. \u201cGrant got involved, too. He bought a huge toy parrot and dressed up as Long John Silver.\u201d</p><p>I could see that remembering her husband in those better times was making her feel nostalgic.</p><p>\u201cI think Elise might really be on to something here,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cThere\u2019s a market for this kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened, interrupting her, and in walked a distinguished-looking older gentleman. I don\u2019t get many men in the shop. There are definitely male knitters, but most of the yarn I sell is to women.</p><p>Elise raised her head up when the bell chimed and went pale. \u201cMaverick,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHello, everyone,\u201d he said without the least hesitation. He seemed completely at ease in the shop, although not all men are comfortable in such a female environment. \u201cI\u2019m here for Elise.\u201d He looked in her direction and I noticed the way his eyes softened. \u201cI was in the neighborhood and figured I\u2019d give you a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll be a while yet,\u201d she said, blushing. Flustered, she dropped a stitch and then did a marvelous job of picking it up again.</p><p>I enjoyed watching the two of them. They might be divorced, but it was plain they still had strong feelings for each other. This was an intriguing development\u2014and not something Elise had mentioned. I suppose I\u2019d had an image of a professional gambler and to be honest, Maverick didn\u2019t fit the picture. With his white hair and beard, my first thought was that he resembled Charlie Rich, the country singer. On closer examination, I saw that he was taller and more solidly built.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush on my account,\u201d Maverick told her. \u201cI\u2019m parked outside. I\u2019ll wait there.\u201d</p><p>Elise gazed down at her knitting. \u201cAh...okay.\u201d</p><p>The class continued for another fifteen minutes and then gradually, one by one, my students left, chatting about next week\u2019s session. I found it interesting that the entire group had decided to knit socks for men. Bethanne\u2019s were probably for her son. Courtney had said hers would be a gift for her dad. And Elise? My guess was that her ex-husband would receive them.</p><p>\u201cThat was a wonderful suggestion Elise had for Bethanne,\u201d I commented to Margaret as I straightened the class area. I still felt good about what had happened; it seemed like a step toward real friendship.</p><p>Suddenly I saw that my sister was crying.</p><p>\u201cMargaret?\u201d</p><p>She brushed the tears away, obviously upset and embarrassed that I\u2019d seen them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, despite my earlier resolve. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got a notice in the mail yesterday,\u201d she said in a voice so low I had to strain to hear. \u201cMatt didn\u2019t know I saw it. He takes care of all the bills, and I just assumed we were managing all right. I\u2019ve cut back as much as I can. I know he has, too, but apparently...Oh, Lydia, we\u2019re so far behind on the mortgage payments that we\u2019re in danger of losing the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Every penny I had was invested in the store or I would\u2019ve immediately offered to help.</p><p>\u201cI tried to talk it over with Matt. I know he was just trying to protect me, but\u2014but I\u2019m his wife. He should tell me. When I told him that, he said I had enough on my mind without worrying about this too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you need?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe letter said we had until next Monday to come up with ten thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Margaret. I\u2019m so sorry, I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know...Matt says everything will work out, and...and I\u2019m sure it will. I didn\u2019t mean to burden you with our problems\u2014it\u2019s just that it was such a shock....\u201d</p><p>Although Margaret tried to sound hopeful, I didn\u2019t have a good feeling about this. My sister was about to lose her home and I couldn\u2019t do a thing to help.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise was deep in thought as she tore lettuce leaves for the dinner salad. Her grandsons were at the small neighborhood park with Maverick. Luke and John dragged him there every chance they got, and he was always agreeable. If he\u2019d been half as good a husband and father as he was a grandfather, the marriage might\u2019ve lasted.</p><p>Although she hated to admit it, Elise had begun to enjoy Maverick\u2019s company. Relying on him for anything, even casual friendship, was dangerous, as she very well knew. In fact, no one knew that better than she did. But over the last few weeks, he\u2019d managed to break down her determination to avoid him. Little by little, he\u2019d erased her resentment and doubt. He\u2019d done it not with extravagant promises or declarations but through his actions\u2014especially in the way he loved Aurora and his grandchildren. He respected Elise\u2019s feelings, never argued with her or defended himself. He seemed sincere. She didn\u2019t want to trust him, knew she shouldn\u2019t allow him into her life, but nevertheless found herself drawn to him.</p><p>The timer in the laundry room went off and Elise dried her hands before transferring the freshly laundered clothes from the dryer to a clothes basket. Aurora was meeting with Bethanne about Luke\u2019s birthday party. She\u2019d loved Elise\u2019s suggestion about hiring Bethanne and insisted on paying the cost herself. She and Elise had engaged in a good-natured argument about it and finally decided Elise would pay for the cake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Realizing Aurora would be pressed for time, Elise had started dinner. She\u2019d already prepared the sauce and grated cheese for a family favorite that went by the rather inelegant name of \u201cspaghetti pie.\u201d</p><p>In a few minutes she\u2019d folded her grandsons\u2019 play clothes. Rather than leave them in the laundry area, she carried them to the boys\u2019 room. Since Maverick\u2019s arrival, she\u2019d stayed away from that room. If she wanted him to respect her privacy, then it was important she afford him the same rights.</p><p>She opened the top dresser drawer and discovered that Aurora had given it to Maverick. Instantly she closed it and found that the second and third drawers were for Luke and John\u2019s clothes. She quickly and neatly put away the shorts and T-shirts. Elise knew what she should do next\u2014turn around and walk away. But she couldn\u2019t resist.... She\u2019d noticed the edge of a picture frame in Maverick\u2019s drawer. It was none of her business whose picture it was or why he\u2019d buried it at the bottom of a drawer.</p><p>Turning swiftly, she started toward the door, then pivoted back, heart pounding. On the small table next to the bottom bunk, she saw a book Maverick was currently reading, and a coffee cup. But no photographs.</p> <p>Suddenly she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Why torment herself like this? One peek would tell her whose picture it was, and her curiosity would be satisfied. Sliding open the drawer, she stared down. The edge of the frame stuck out from under his T-shirts. The frame itself was silver and slightly tarnished.</p><p>One look, she decided again. Okay, it would be a violation of his privacy, but a minor one. Not that she usually approved of such...such subjective morality. No, she\u2019d be honest about this. Looking at the photograph was wrong. But she was going to do it, anyway. She wouldn\u2019t touch it. All she\u2019d do was lift the shirts. Knowing Maverick, it was probably a picture from some blackjack tournament he\u2019d won.</p><p>Pulse hammering, she lifted the shirts with one finger\u2014and froze. Her lungs refused to function. The photograph was of her.</p><p>He\u2019d taken the picture shortly after she\u2019d learned she was pregnant with Aurora. They\u2019d been walking through a nearby park, and he\u2019d snapped it just as she turned from examining a rosebush. Her eyes shone with love and excitement. This was before the disillusionment had truly taken hold, before she\u2019d been forced to face the truth about the man she\u2019d married. But at that moment, her heart full of happiness unlike any she\u2019d known before or since, he\u2019d captured her image. She\u2019d been a woman in love, a woman dreaming of the future, of her baby, of being a family.</p><p>Elise stared at the woman in the photo and bit her lip, surprised by the flood of memories. Of emotions.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember when I took that?\u201d Maverick asked, standing just inside the bedroom.</p><p>Elise gasped, leaping back from the chest of drawers, hand flying to her heart. She was shocked that she hadn\u2019t heard him enter the house. Even more than shocked, she was embarrassed that he\u2019d caught her looking at her own photo. Hidden in his drawer. In his room.</p><p>\u201cI...I apologize,\u201d she murmured, unable to look at him.</p><p>\u201cFor what? Snooping?\u201d</p><p>Mortified, she kept her head turned away and nodded. \u201cI...I should never\u2014I am so sorry. I can only imagine what you must be thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p> <p>All she wanted was to escape. \u201cI don\u2019t recall your question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked,\u201d he said slowly and deliberately, \u201cif you remembered when I took that picture.\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer verbally, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve carried it with me all these years,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut then it started to fall apart so I bought this frame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re divorced,\u201d she reminded him sharply. She didn\u2019t want to remember what it felt like to abandon herself to loving him. She was acutely aware of how close he was, only footsteps away. She smelled the scent of his aftershave, the same brand he\u2019d worn when they were married. She didn\u2019t recall the name but the fresh, woodsy smell wafted toward her like an aphrodisiac. Against her will, she swayed closer, afraid for those few seconds that she\u2019d collapse at his feet.</p><p>Maverick walked into the room and stood before her. \u201cI told you this already,\u201d he said. He placed his index finger under her chin and raised her head until their eyes met. \u201cI loved you then. I\u2019ve loved you all this time. I love you now.\u201d</p> <p>The thickness in her throat made it impossible to speak, so she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough\u2014it isn\u2019t enough. But it\u2019s all I ever had.\u201d</p><p>She realized he would have kissed her if not for the arrival of Luke and John. The boys burst into the room like a tornado touching down, all arms and legs, fighting and furious. Apparently they\u2019d gotten into a squabble while putting their bikes in the garage.</p><p>With obvious reluctance, Maverick broke away from her and immediately took charge of the situation. Elise used the opportunity to escape. Returning to the kitchen, she gripped the counter with both hands, breathing hard. Her ex-husband had been about to kiss her, and that was shock enough, but knowing she would\u2019ve let him made her knees go weak.</p><p>Thankfully, she had something to occupy her hands. Elise finished the salad and vigorously stirred the tomato and meat sauce simmering on the stove. She then put on a large pot of water to boil the spaghetti noodles. Everything would go together in a casserole dish, along with the grated cheese.</p><p>When the garage door closed twenty minutes later, she sighed with relief; either Aurora or David was home.</p><p>It was her daughter who stepped in from the garage. When she saw that Elise had begun dinner, Aurora let out a cry of delight.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, thank you so much!\u201d She hugged her mother tightly.</p><p>\u201cThank me for what?\u201d she asked. \u201cDinner? I try to help as much as I can.\u201d As she spoke, she drained the spaghetti and assembled the ingredients, stirring in the cheese last.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, yes, thanks for that, but Mom, thank you for telling me about Bethanne. She\u2019s fabulous! She had a dozen different ideas, but we\u2019re going with the dinosaur motif.\u201d Beaming, she hugged her again. \u201cUntil I talked to her, I was planning to take everyone out for pizza and ice cream, and that would\u2019ve been fine. But for the same amount of money, Luke is going to have a spectacular party that he\u2019ll always remember.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s instincts had been right. Busy parents would be willing to pay for a party that was different and specially designed around their children\u2019s interests.</p><p>\u201cGayle from across the street went with me and she booked a party, too, even though Sonja\u2019s birthday isn\u2019t for another month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Elise smiled broadly. Opening the oven door, she slid the round casserole dish inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Maverick asked, coming into the kitchen. His gaze went directly to Elise.</p><p>\u201cOne of the women in my knitting group needs a job. It\u2019s complicated,\u201d she said, not wanting to go into the long drawn-out story of why it was so important that Bethanne find employment.</p><p>\u201cGayle was so excited she called three friends on the drive home,\u201d Aurora explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased,\u201d Elise murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou should be. Bethanne told me this was all your idea.\u201d</p><p>Elise blushed, and wanting to deflect the attention, said, \u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we having?\u201d Luke asked suspiciously. He was the finicky eater in the family.</p><p>Maverick peered into the oven and turned to face his grandson. \u201cIt looks like worms and blood to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaverick Beaumont!\u201d Elise cried, horrified he\u2019d say such a thing.</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes widened with delight as he raced into the other room to share the news with his brother.</p><p>\u201cBetter known as spaghetti pie,\u201d Maverick informed his daughter.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled and admired Maverick for being so clever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the table,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early yet,\u201d Aurora said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Mom collect a bouquet of flowers from the backyard and I\u2019ll use them as a centerpiece. My roses are beautiful this summer.\u201d</p><p>Any other time, Elise would\u2019ve objected and either given the task to Maverick or insisted on cutting the flowers herself. She should have then, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Together they went into the backyard, where Aurora\u2019s roses bloomed against the high wooden fence. For their first anniversary David had given her an antique rosebush and year after year it had flourished. Now, on this July afternoon, the fragrance of roses perfumed the air.</p><p>Elise inhaled deeply. \u201cI\u2019ll get the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Maverick stopped her by taking her hand and entwining his fingers with hers. \u201cLet\u2019s just stroll around the yard for a few minutes. Would that be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, barely recognizing her own voice. \u201cThat would be fine.\u201d</p><p>But it was more than fine.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Bethanne said excitedly, reaching for another tortilla chip, \u201cGrant was right.\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned. \u201cRight about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how I should find a way to support myself. He won\u2019t be financially responsible for me much longer, as he\u2019s frequently pointed out. A couple of months ago, he told me to use my God-given talents to find a job. He was talking about childcare and so on, and he meant it sarcastically. At the time I was so furious with him I couldn\u2019t see straight, but you know what? He was right.\u201d</p><p>Paul grinned, and once again Bethanne was struck by the fact that while he wasn\u2019t a handsome man, he was an appealing one, easy to talk to and be around. They\u2019d met for dinner after her first major birthday party, for Elise\u2019s grandson. Because there\u2019d been so little time, she\u2019d had to arrange the party quickly, but everything had fallen nicely into place. The little boys had loved the dinosaur egg hunt, not to mention games like \u201cpin the tail on the dinosaur,\u201d which she\u2019d created herself with Annie\u2019s help.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I got three new bookings from Luke\u2019s party? I\u2019m also going to do one\u2014a really elaborate one\u2014for a lady I met at the yarn store. They all want \u2018my special touch\u2019 for their kids\u2019 parties,\u201d she said. She dipped her chip in the thick salsa before bringing it to her mouth. The most thrilling part of all this was that with her clients\u2019 deposits, she had enough money for Andrew to attend football camp. She\u2019d nearly burst with pride when she handed it over to him.</p><p>\u201cI believe you did say something about upcoming parties.\u201d Paul raised a salsa-laden chip.</p><p>\u201cMore than once?\u201d She had the feeling she\u2019d probably repeated the same information a dozen times, but she couldn\u2019t help it. This was the most wonderful thing to happen to her in...years.</p><p>\u201cAs the kids got older, Grant used to think all the fuss I made over birthday parties was a waste of money,\u201d she explained. \u201cWho would\u2019ve guessed his wife would make a career of it.\u201d She stopped herself. \u201cEx-wife,\u201d she corrected. She sighed. \u201cWill I ever get used to saying that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t yet.\u201d</p><p>She refused to let that one slip destroy her mood. \u201cI was really glad you phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how everything went with the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy and excited, and this...this is just great. I love Mexican food.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He reached for his margarita and licked the salt from the edge of his glass before taking a sip.</p><p>The sight of his tongue unnerved her. Bethanne immediately looked away, then chided herself for being silly. But perhaps it was a natural reaction. It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d made love, she could hardly even remember.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss...\u201d She hesitated to say it aloud, so she leaned toward him and whispered. \u201cSex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d Paul\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>They both laughed as if it was the funniest thing they\u2019d heard in ages.</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d she pressed. \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBig time. What about you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, too. She couldn\u2019t ask that question of anyone else, and it made her appreciate their friendship even more. They felt safe with each other; safe in speaking honestly about their anger and pain. There was something healing in that kind of openness.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with Annie and Andrew?\u201d he asked, deftly changing the subject.</p><p>Bethanne was on her second margarita, which she knew had loosened her inhibitions, probably past the point of decorum. \u201cI\u2019ve had some long conversations with Annie since I learned she put sugar in Tiffany\u2019s gas tank.\u201d At first Annie had tried to deny it, but when she broke down and admitted what she\u2019d done, they\u2019d clung to each other, Bethanne\u2019s heart breaking for her daughter.</p><p>Annie had agreed to see the therapist, and after two visits, felt she had a better perspective on the family\u2019s situation and her own feelings. There\u2019d been several tearful discussions between mother and daughter. Annie seemed better now, more like her old self, and Bethanne sensed that her daughter could move forward, with or without her father.</p> <p>\u201cHas Grant had a chance to talk to Annie?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Bethanne had mentioned his most recent visit, although she\u2019d left out his inquiry about her relationship with Paul.</p><p>\u201cHe phoned the house.\u201d Bethanne shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he said, but Annie was on and off the phone in about two minutes, so it couldn\u2019t have been much of a conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, the insurance paid for the damage to Tiffany\u2019s engine,\u201d Paul told her.</p><p>\u201cDid she contact you?\u201d Bethanne asked. Paul rarely mentioned his ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cNo, but our agent told me about it. It\u2019s a good thing Tiff continued the coverage for vandalism.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. She wouldn\u2019t put it past Tiffany to have Annie arrested; even worse, she wasn\u2019t sure Grant would stand up for their daughter. Yes, Annie had been wrong and she needed to accept the consequences of her actions, but Bethanne couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her daughter being prosecuted. At the therapist\u2019s suggestion, Annie had written Tiffany a letter of apology and Bethanne hoped the matter would end there.</p><p>The waitress came by, and Bethanne ordered the fajita salad, while Paul chose the chicken enchilada plate. He waited until she\u2019d left the table before resuming the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Annie now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dealing with a lot,\u201d Bethanne replied. \u201cShe\u2019s coming through it, though, and I think the worst is over, but it\u2019s been a difficult time for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a friend,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSomeone who really understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but\u2014\u201d Bethanne stopped in midsentence. \u201cYes. She does.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look in your eye.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne sat back in her chair. \u201cShe already has one. Only, my daughter is a lot like her mother and isn\u2019t always aware of what\u2019s right in front of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be full of good news tonight,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She giggled. \u201cI\u2019m full of something, all right.\u201d Suddenly she reached across the table and grabbed his hand. \u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she cried, shocked into momentary silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Paul asked in concern.</p><p>\u201cPaul, I just realized that I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m actually happy. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever feel this way again, but I do. I really do.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>Bethanne leaned toward him. \u201cHas it happened for you yet?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBe honest,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he admitted with a faint smile, \u201cbut I can feel it approaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She felt better knowing that he was hopeful enough to anticipate the return of joy.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you makes me happy,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bethanne sipped her margarita and sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about you a lot, Bethanne. About us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d She choked a little as she swallowed her drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think of the two of us dating?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. She\u2019d never asked, but assumed she was older than Paul, possibly by as much as ten years. \u201cI...I like you as a friend, Paul, but as for this dating idea\u2014I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m afraid it might change our whole relationship and I wouldn\u2019t want that. I want things to stay the way they are.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged with apparent nonchalance. \u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take offense, please. I couldn\u2019t bear it if you did. You\u2019re my friend and I treasure our times together, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think about us dating, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but...Okay, okay, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He appeared to relax then. \u201cI\u2019m glad, Bethanne. You\u2019re exactly the kind of woman I can imagine myself with.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around to make sure no one was listening in on their conversation. \u201cThis is because I asked you about sex, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cThis has to do with the fact that I really enjoy being with you. Not you, the ex-wife of the man my ex-wife left me for, but you, the person I\u2019ve come to know and trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d After two margaritas, she found it difficult to frame a response.</p><p>\u201cThat surprises you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bethanne answered from her heart. \u201cThe truth is, I find your interest a very big compliment. For now, I\u2019m more comfortable just being friends, but I\u2019m willing to see where things go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman, Bethanne,\u201d he said in a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the lack of sex talking,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2014that could easily be fixed,\u201d he joked back.</p><p>Bethanne giggled. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we cut off the margaritas.\u201d</p><p>Paul smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty. The conversation\u2019s just getting good.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>It\u2019d been a pleasant surprise to hear from Annie, especially after the way their last meeting had ended, with Annie storming out of Courtney\u2019s bedroom. Courtney had wanted to ask Bethanne about her during knitting class. She hadn\u2019t, because she didn\u2019t want to put Annie\u2019s mother on the spot.</p><p>Courtney was afraid for the girl, afraid of what she might do. She\u2019d tried to talk to her, to help her, and explain that she understood\u2014she\u2019d gone through this horrible emotional pain herself. But Annie had made it abundantly clear that she wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>Then, on a Monday afternoon, after no contact in almost two weeks, Annie had phoned and invited Courtney to her house. Her grandmother dropped her off at the Hamlins\u2019 on her way to the church, where Vera volunteered at the library once a month. Before she moved to Seattle, Courtney had assumed her grandmother sat in front of the television and knit most afternoons. Boy, had she been wrong. Vera was at the pool four mornings a week and ate a robust breakfast. Then she worked in her yard and garden. She probably spent as many hours doing volunteer work, including various church committees, as she would\u2019ve spent on a full-time job.</p><p>As Grams drove off, Courtney stood on the sidewalk and examined Annie\u2019s house. She immediately liked the brick structure with its steep front steps, rounded door and the gable that jutted out over the small porch. It reminded her of homes in some Chicago neighborhoods.</p><p>Homesickness rushed through her. Chicago was where she had friends, where everything was familiar. Courtney hated having to rebuild her life in her senior year of high school. She\u2019d worked for eleven years to reach this point, and she\u2019d looked forward to being with her friends, some of whom she\u2019d known nearly her entire life.</p><p>She found it hard not to feel sorry for herself, but Courtney knew, and had long ago accepted, that this sacrifice was necessary. Julianna had recently reminded Courtney that next year, when she left for college, she\u2019d be experiencing the same kind of dislocation, so in essence Courtney was simply making the move a year earlier than she normally would. She\u2019d be that much more prepared for college, Julianna said, and Courtney appreciated her sister\u2019s insight. She relied on the contact with her family, especially Julianna, to ward off feelings of isolation.</p><p>Annie opened the door before Courtney had even rung the bell. \u201cI saw your grandmother pull up,\u201d she said. She wore tight shorts, a loose T-shirt and big fuzzy slippers.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t smiling. Their conversation had been short, and she wondered if it\u2019d been prompted by Bethanne or if Annie was sincere about wanting to see her. At the time, Courtney had been too grateful to question the other girl\u2019s motives.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Courtney asked, walking into the house.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d Annie turned and headed up the stairs.</p><p>Courtney followed her, although she wished she could look around a bit more. The house was beautiful, with cream-colored walls, furniture upholstered in dark reds and greens, shining wood floors, simple but expensive-looking area rugs. Fresh flowers graced the mantel. As she\u2019d expected, Bethanne had gorgeous taste.</p><p>Photographs lined the wall, and she paused long enough to look at the family portrait, obviously taken in better times. Andrew resembled his father, with deep blue eyes and a strong square chin, and Annie took after her mother. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d she asked, trudging up the carpeted stairs.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Annie responded. \u201cWhy? Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>Courtney decided to ignore the lack of welcome. \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Annie had reached the top of the stairs and frowned when she saw Courtney regarding the framed portraits. \u201cI told Mom to throw those away, but she wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>The glass in the most recent family photograph was cracked, and Courtney wondered if Annie had tried to destroy it. \u201cThere\u2019s pictures of my mother all over our house in Chicago, too.\u201d Or there had been before the house was rented. \u201cI used to come home, all excited about something, and rush into the house. Then as soon as I saw Mom\u2019s photo I\u2019d start to cry.\u201d Talking about it still had that effect on her, and she turned aside to blot her eyes with her sleeve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Annie didn\u2019t respond for a moment, and when she did speak, her voice was barely above a whisper. \u201cWhen Dad first left, I thought for sure he\u2019d be back. I hated him for leaving us. I wanted to...to punish him, and at the same time, I wanted him here, the way he\u2019d always been.\u201d She looked away as if she\u2019d said more than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cry at my mom\u2019s funeral,\u201d Courtney confessed. \u201cEveryone was sobbing and carrying on. Even my dad broke down.\u201d It was difficult to tell anyone this, even now, but she felt Annie would understand.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I must\u2019ve been in shock. So many people came to the funeral and there was all this talk about how good Mom looked. She didn\u2019t look good\u2014she looked dead.\u201d Her voice cracked as she said this and she lowered it, not wanting Annie to hear how emotional she got talking about her mom. \u201cI wanted everyone to go away. I didn\u2019t want all those people around me. That night\u2014\u201d she paused, swallowing hard \u201c\u2014after everyone left and we\u2019d gone to bed, I couldn\u2019t sleep. Then it hit me. We\u2019d just buried Mom. This wasn\u2019t like some TV show. She was gone. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I started to scream.\u201d</p> <p>Annie stared at her. \u201cYou must\u2019ve felt bad,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI did. So bad.\u201d Courtney nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop. I screamed and screamed. Everyone came rushing into my room, and all I could do was scream. I wanted my mother. I wanted her with me. I felt like I was the one who died, not her. I wished it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your dad do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad held me.\u201d Tears streaked her face and once again she wiped them away.</p><p>\u201cThen Jason and Julianna sat on my bed with Dad and me, and we all cried together. Up until then, I\u2019d been the youngest, you know? Julianna and I weren\u2019t that close\u2014Jason and I weren\u2019t, either\u2014but we became real brother and sisters that night. Our whole family changed. We\u2019re all so close now.\u201d She was embarrassed to have said this much.</p> <p>Annie looked as if she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Courtney wanted her to realize that while she\u2019d lost her father, he was still a part of her life, and she should be grateful for that.</p><p>\u201cMy room\u2019s over here.\u201d Annie gestured down the hallway.</p><p>Courtney gave the photos one last look and followed her slowly up the rest of the stairs and into the bedroom.</p><p>Annie was sitting on her bed when Courtney came in. Discarded clothes littered the floor and the dresser was piled with CDs, books, makeup and magazines. A picture of a boy was stuck in a corner of the mirror.</p><p>Courtney walked over to study the snapshot. Another one she hadn\u2019t initially noticed was taped to the bottom edge of the mirror. It was of Annie and the same boy at a school dance, standing beneath an archway of white and black balloons. Annie wore a pink party dress with a matching floral shawl and her date had on a suit.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Conner,\u201d Annie whispered, her voice quavering. \u201cWe broke up a couple of months ago. He said I\u2019d gotten to be a drag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u201d Courtney assumed Annie still cared about him, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have kept the photos.</p><p>Annie shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever see him anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while. He\u2019s going out with someone else now, but he\u2019s on the football team with Andrew, so it\u2019s unavoidable, you know? You like my brother, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Courtney whirled around at the unexpectedness of the comment and felt color flood her face. \u201cI\u2014I think he\u2019s nice.\u201d She was afraid to say more, for fear it would be misconstrued. Andrew was cute and popular and, according to Bethanne, one of the school\u2019s star athletes. Probably every girl there was already in love with him. Courtney didn\u2019t figure she had a chance, and she accepted that. She wouldn\u2019t waste her time pining over a lost cause. If she was lucky, maybe they could be friends....</p><p>Annie heaved a sigh. \u201cSpeaking of my brother, he said I had to thank you for what you did that night. He\u2019s right. I...I wasn\u2019t really angry at you afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You were angry with yourself more than anything. You got in deeper than you meant to, and then it was too late.\u201d</p> <p>Annie stared down at the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your mom,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my dad\u2014it\u2019s not the same. My dad wanted to leave. Your mother didn\u2019t. He walked away, and now it\u2019s as if Andrew and I are nothing more than...than collateral damage. All he cares about is her.\u201d Annie\u2019s face was red as she spit out the words.</p><p>Courtney resisted the urge to squeeze her hand, knowing the other girl might reject her comfort. After a moment, she added, \u201cYour father\u2019s gone and your entire life\u2019s been turned upside down. My life was too, Annie. It might not seem the same, but in some ways it was. I wouldn\u2019t be living in Seattle if my mother hadn\u2019t died, and my dad wouldn\u2019t be in South America risking his life, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my father could keep his pants zipped, my mother wouldn\u2019t be out singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 to a bunch of brats and\u2014\u201d Annie began to sob, then jerkily moved her hand across her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about my dad, all right? I hate him and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about anything,\u201d Courtney told her.</p><p>Annie seemed to relax, as though she was relieved to change the subject. \u201cThe thing is, I actually think it\u2019s cool what my mom\u2019s doing. She always loved putting on parties, and she\u2019s really enjoying this. And you know what? She\u2019s making money. We\u2019re getting a lot of phone calls, and Andrew and I help out whenever we can. I have a surprise for her. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Courtney said.</p><p>Annie leaped off the bed and sat down at her desk, turning on her computer. \u201cCome and look,\u201d she said, glancing over her shoulder.</p><p>Courtney stood behind Annie as she brought up a graphic arts display. It featured balloons in one corner and a brightly decorated cake in the center, under a banner that read PARTIES BY BETHANNE, Birthdays a Specialty. Below that was their phone number.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s for a business card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about the balloons, but it needs something there, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Courtney examined it again and disagreed. \u201cTake them out,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>With a click of her mouse, Annie deleted the balloons. She cocked her head to one side and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It looks cleaner without the balloons. Besides, Mom said someone phoned and asked about an adult birthday party and I think balloons are more associated with kids, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Courtney nodded. \u201cThis whole party idea has taken off, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Annie smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s been really wild around here. Andrew and I thought Mom should have her own business cards. I guess she\u2019ll need a Web site next.\u201d She returned her attention to the screen. \u201cAnything else I should change?\u201d</p><p>Courtney studied the graphic for another couple of minutes. \u201cYou might want to use a different font,\u201d she suggested, \u201cone of the less fancy ones. This one\u2019s pretty but it\u2019s kind of difficult to read. Try Comic Sans or Verdana. Or maybe Georgia.\u201d</p><p>Annie made the changes, deciding on Comic Sans, and sat back to examine the effect. \u201cHey, I like that.\u201d</p><p>So did Courtney. \u201cThis is really nice\u2014you doing this for your mom, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to work at one of her parties this weekend,\u201d she said, still focusing on the monitor.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to?\u201d Courtney didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d volunteered, too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. She said you might be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it if you will,\u201d Annie said and looked up, grinning.</p><p>A warm feeling touched Courtney. \u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re friends?\u201d she asked. It was an awkward question, but she needed to know.</p><p>Annie seemed to seriously consider it. After a moment she said, \u201cI\u2019d like that. And I know I already said this, but Andrew\u2019s right\u2014I do owe you. He says you saved my ass.\u201d Her voice fell to a whisper. \u201cSo...thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Courtney dismissed her gratitude. \u201cI did some pretty stupid stuff myself after Mom died. One day I started a fire behind the grocery store. I can\u2019t even explain why I did it.\u201d She lowered her head. No one knew about that, not even her sister. \u201cI was hurting so bad. It was stupid, and if anyone ever found out, I\u2019d probably still be in some detention center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to a rave, though, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I was younger than you. Trust me\u2014I got into my share of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s responding smile was weak, and she bit her lip. \u201cAccording to the therapist I saw, what happened to us is pretty common. I\u2019m not alone. Families split up, fathers walk away, and the kids just have to cope. I\u2019m not very good at that. And...and I thought my father loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d Courtney felt confident of that, although she could tell it was hard for Annie to believe.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Annie agreed reluctantly. \u201cBut he loves her more. It\u2019s all right, though\u2014I\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d Tears sprang to her eyes and she tried to blink them away.</p><p>\u201cCan you print out that design?\u201d Courtney asked, hoping to distract Annie. She pretended not to notice she was crying.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Annie turned back to her computer, reached for the mouse and clicked on the printer icon. The printer started to hum, and they both stared at it as a sheet of paper slowly emerged.</p><p>Courtney picked it up and studied the design. \u201cIt looks fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cI mean, I think it does, but it has to be perfect, you know? It has to look professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. Your mom\u2019s going to flip when she sees it.\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s smile was bright with unshed tears. \u201cThanks, Court.\u201d</p><p>Court\u2014that was what her friends in Chicago used to call her. For the first time since she\u2019d left home, she didn\u2019t have that empty feeling in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you two up to?\u201d Andrew asked, leaning against his sister\u2019s door.</p><p>He looked really good. He must\u2019ve just returned from football camp because he carried his gym bag, which was unzipped. His cleats were on top.</p><p>\u201cI designed Mom some business cards,\u201d Annie told him.</p><p>Courtney handed him the printout.</p><p>\u201cHey, this is good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised,\u201d his sister snapped.</p><p>His eyes met Courtney\u2019s, and he grinned. \u201cYou two want to go out for pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou buying?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I got paid this week.\u201d He gestured at Courtney. \u201cCan you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d One slice of pizza and a small salad would be fine. She\u2019d enjoy her friends\u2019 company and eat a reasonably healthy meal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was no longer trying to fill the hollowness inside.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>\u201cKnitters just naturally create communities of friends and newfound friends at work, after work, or on the Internet, sharing their passion for knitting.\u201d</p><p>Warm Up America! Foundation</p> <p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I\u2019d been spending a lot of time outside the shop, talking to the loan managers at three local banks. I had to do something to help Margaret, but because of my medical history I was afraid I\u2019d be refused a loan. My suspicions were right\u2014until I talked to a wonderful manager at the third bank I tried. My business had been open for a little more than a year, I was showing a profit, and my latest checkup with Dr. Wilson had revealed that I was cancer-free. Seattle First, a small neighborhood bank, looked everything over and agreed to give me the loan. This was a red-letter day in my life as a business-woman. I was able to apply for and receive a loan! Definitely cause for celebration.</p><p>Margaret knew nothing about what I was doing. She made an effort to put on a brave front, the same way I did when it came to Brad. Matt still didn\u2019t have a job in his field. He\u2019d worked as an electrical engineer for Boeing, but I wasn\u2019t really sure what he did. He\u2019d recently found a job painting houses; I knew he hated it, but it brought in a paycheck, and with the little bit I paid Margaret they were managing to stay afloat. Except for their missed mortgage payments...</p><p>I signed the loan papers the first Monday in August. The summer was flying by, and I hadn\u2019t accomplished any of what I\u2019d hoped. Earlier in the spring, Brad had promised to build me additional shelves for the yarn. We\u2019d spent a few very satisfying Sunday afternoons working everything out on paper, measuring and designing the cubicles so they\u2019d fit properly. I\u2019d looked forward to helping him build them; so had Cody.</p><p>I needed new shelves, but that would have to wait, along with an idea I wanted to borrow from another store. In almost every yarn shop, space is a major consideration. There are so many new yarns and hand-dyed wools available that displaying them could be difficult. The particular store I\u2019d visited in the north end of King County suspended hanks of brightly colored hand-dyed wool from the ceiling. It was clever and effective, and I\u2019d hoped to do the same thing in a small section of A Good Yarn. Brad had said he\u2019d place the screws in the ceiling for me.</p> <p>I was perfectly capable of doing that on my own, but I hadn\u2019t done it. For some reason, I didn\u2019t seem able to move forward. Every improvement Brad and I had discussed, I\u2019d put off. I just didn\u2019t have the heart for it.</p><p>Once I\u2019d deposited the check in my account and had a cashier\u2019s check made out to Margaret, I drove to my sister\u2019s house. We\u2019d talked briefly on Sunday and I\u2019d casually asked her if she had any plans for today. Nothing much, she\u2019d told me.</p><p>Margaret was outside watering her flower beds when I parked on the street. Absorbed in thought, she apparently didn\u2019t hear or see me.</p><p>\u201cHey, big sister!\u201d I called out in order to get her attention.</p><p>She started at the sound of my voice, and her hand jerked, sending a spray of water onto the sidewalk. \u201cWhat are you doing sneaking up on me?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis couldn\u2019t have waited until Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Margaret is always gruff when she\u2019s upset. Over the past year, I\u2019d learned a great deal about her personality. She\u2019ll never be a vivacious, friendly sort of person, and I don\u2019t think she really knows how brusque she often sounds. She\u2019d been a big help to me\u2014still is\u2014and while I pay her a salary, she could make a higher wage elsewhere. I wanted to do something for her and Matt, just...just because she\u2019s my sister. Just so she\u2019d know how much I love her.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Margaret asked, eyeing me suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cA glass of iced tea would be nice.\u201d</p><p>Margaret hesitated before agreeing with a sigh and a nod of her head. She walked over to the side of the house, turned off the water and marched up the porch steps.</p><p>I followed her into the house and immediately saw the cardboard boxes cluttering the living room.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make the payment deadline, so there\u2019s no use pretending we can,\u201d Margaret said before I could ask. \u201cWe have until Friday before the bank files an eviction notice. It\u2019s bad enough to lose the house, but I don\u2019t want to drag my family through the humiliation of being evicted.\u201d</p> <p>In the kitchen, too, I saw a number of boxes stacked in the corner. I was grateful I\u2019d managed to get the loan when I did.</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t worry about watering the yard,\u201d Margaret commented, \u201cbut I had to get out of here for a while.\u201d She took two tumblers from the cupboard. \u201cIt\u2019s just too depressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was best to talk to you right away,\u201d I said, leading carefully into the reason for my visit. \u201cInstead of waiting until morning,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me about what?\u201d Setting the glasses on the table, Margaret sat down across from me.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re working with me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she said cynically.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to fire me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I fire you? I need you. No, I\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p><p>Again Margaret had a suspicious look. \u201cHelp me do what? Pack up our belongings?\u201d</p><p>I decided it was pointless to discuss this when I was sitting with a cashier\u2019s check in my purse. I opened my handbag and handed it to Margaret.</p><p>My sister took the check, read it, then frowned across the table at me. \u201cWhere did you get this money?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou went to Mom, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. One thing my sister had in abundance was pride. She\u2019d absolutely insisted Mom not know about this. I\u2019d kept my promise and hadn\u2019t breathed a word to our mother.</p><p>\u201cI got a bank loan,\u201d I said, unable to squelch my glee. \u201cThink of it, Margaret. This is a huge step forward for me. A bank was willing to lend me money.\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the excitement out of my voice. \u201cThat says something, doesn\u2019t it? They seem to think I\u2019m a good risk.\u201d</p><p>My sister held the check with both hands as if she were afraid to release it. \u201cWhat did you tell the bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask too many questions.\u201d A slight exaggeration. I\u2019d been drilled by one officer and then another, and I\u2019d filled out as many forms as if I were being admitted to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYou used the shop as collateral?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s all I have.\u201d That was true. My entire future, all I have and all I ever hope to have, is tied up in my yarn store.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s eyes filled with tears and she tried twice before she was able to speak. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. It\u2019s already done.\u201d Knowing Margaret, I\u2019d expected an argument. That was one reason I\u2019d had the cashier\u2019s check made out in her name. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take that check, Margaret,\u201d I said using my sternest voice, \u201cand give it to the mortgage company first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be before I can pay you back,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>I should have explained this earlier. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you the money.\u201d</p><p>Stunned at first, Margaret said nothing, then shook her head. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. The money is a gift.\u201d I\u2019d thought very carefully about this. If I made the ten thousand dollars a loan, it would always come between us. My relationship with my sister was too important to risk problems over money. As far as I was concerned, this was the best way to handle it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying you back every cent,\u201d my sister said, still on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d I said, stretching my arm across the table to take her hand. \u201cI repeat\u2014the money is a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne I fully intend on repaying with interest once Matt\u2019s back on the job.\u201d</p><p>I could see that arguing with her was pointless. \u201cDo whatever you feel you have to, but this isn\u2019t a debt or a loan or anything. It\u2019s a...a gift of love, from me to you. One day, who knows, I might need your help. I have in the past.\u201d Maybe not financial support, but emotional. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember last year when I had that cancer scare? You were with me every single day. I couldn\u2019t have made it through that time without you. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>Big tears finally spilled down her face and she struggled to speak. \u201cThank you,\u201d she managed in a hoarse croak.</p><p>I finished my iced tea and went home with a good feeling, grateful for the opportunity to help my sister. Although my store is officially closed on Mondays, I\u2019m almost always there. I use Mondays to clear off my desk, process paperwork, place orders and get caught up on business.</p><p>Whiskers greeted me as I came into the shop, weaving between my legs and making a general nuisance of himself. My cat objects to being alone for long periods. I\u2019d been away for a good part of the morning, and Whiskers wasn\u2019t happy with me. I crouched down and petted him, running my hand along his fur from ears to tail. He purred his appreciation as I murmured endearments.</p><p>That was when I saw the business-size envelope on the floor, some distance from the mail slot. Someone had apparently slipped a letter under my door. I couldn\u2019t imagine who or why. I straightened and walked over to pick it up.</p><p>Almost immediately I recognized Cody\u2019s printing. LYDIA was penciled across the front, with the Y and D almost double the size of the other letters.</p><p>Heart pounding, I tore open the note. It was a simple message. I MISS YOU. CAN I SEE YOU SOME TIME? Without meaning to, I crumpled the paper in my hands. Since my last meeting with Brad, when he\u2019d announced that he was going back to Janice, I hadn\u2019t said a word to him. Not a single word. He\u2019d come into the shop any number of times on business, but Margaret had always been there to run interference.</p><p>I doubted Brad knew anything about this note. He\u2019d abided by my wishes and not contacted me. I suspected even more strongly that the one time Brad\u2019s name had come up on my Caller ID, it hadn\u2019t been Brad at all, but his son. Cody hadn\u2019t phoned since, probably on strict orders from his father.</p><p>As I looked out the window, I noticed the UPS truck parked across the street. He wasn\u2019t inside. Before I could change my mind or reconsider the wisdom of what I was about to do, I unlocked the door and walked outside to see him. I wasn\u2019t sure where he was making his delivery, but I knew that sooner or later he\u2019d reappear.</p><p>I surveyed the neighborhood and was about to cross the street when he stepped out of the floral shop next door to me.</p><p>\u201cBrad,\u201d I said, stopping him. \u201cCould we talk for just a moment?\u201d I made an effort to sound unaffected.</p><p>He seemed surprised, but nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were many things I wanted to say.

When?\u201d He sounded shocked, distressed\u2014and hopeful\u2014all at once.</p><p>\u201cI found it this morning.\u201d I looked down for fear of what he\u2019d read in my eyes. \u201cHe wanted to know if he could talk to me sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe misses you,\u201d Brad murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI miss him, too.\u201d And I missed Cody\u2019s father, but I didn\u2019t mention that. \u201cI know this is hard on him and I...I don\u2019t want to confuse Cody or upset Janice, so if you think it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t call him, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Brad\u2019s eyes held mine. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>My heart felt like it was about to break. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to talk to Cody?\u201d My disappointment obviously showed, because Brad quickly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf Cody wants to talk to you and you\u2019re willing, then I can\u2019t see that it would do any harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered, overwhelmed and grateful. \u201cPlease recognize that I want Cody to have his family intact. When you first came to me, I was angry and hurt, but I\u2019m over that now\u2014over you.\u201d This seemed to be my day for exaggeration. I was far from over Brad, but I had to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>He hesitated, as if he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dating again and...well, the two of us ignoring each other like this is silly.\u201d The dating part was an outright lie. I was nowhere near ready for a new relationship.</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>I shook my head, unwilling to lie further. I\u2019m not very good at it\u2014and it\u2019s not really a skill I hope to develop. I knew that if he questioned Margaret she\u2019d cover for me, but I doubted he\u2019d approach her; she\u2019d been curt with him ever since our breakup. \u201cIf Cody wants to phone, please let him.\u201d</p><p>This time, Brad didn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s been asking to, but I wasn\u2019t sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t want to make Janice uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019ll mind.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a slight, though genuine, smile. Being separated from Cody had been so hard, and the opportunity to at least speak to him lightened my heart. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to hearing from him, then,\u201d I said, as if we were no more than business acquaintances. That was all we ever would be, now that Janice was back in his life.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d he said automatically\u2014as if I were just like any other customer.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered, returning to the safety of my yarn store. Not until I turned the lock and retreated to my office did I realize how badly my hands shook.</p><p>This had been an eventful Monday for me. I\u2019d received a bank loan, helped my sister and lied to the man I loved.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise had never learned to drive. A driver\u2019s license was good for ID purposes, but hardly necessary. Seattle had perfectly good public transportation. The bus generally got her wherever she needed to go, and on rare occasions, Aurora would drive her or she\u2019d take a taxi.</p> <p>That all changed with Maverick\u2019s arrival. He was more than willing to drive her anywhere she wanted. Then he\u2019d wait for her with limitless patience. For the past two weeks, he\u2019d sat outside the yarn store while she attended her knitting class. She spoke so often about Bethanne, Courtney and Lydia that he knew almost as much about her friends as she did. She shared her concerns about Bethanne\u2019s job and her hopes that Courtney\u2019s senior year would be a good one. She\u2019d also told him about Jacqueline, with whom she\u2019d now attended two Birthday Club lunches.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a ride,\u201d he suggested Friday afternoon when they\u2019d finished lunch.</p><p>Aurora, David and the boys were on a rare family outing to the Woodland Park Zoo. It was just the two of them, Maverick and Elise.</p><p>\u201cA ride where?\u201d she asked. No longer did she avoid his company and, in fact, she often sought him out. No longer did she instinctively distrust him\u2014although she never forgot that he was a gambler. She didn\u2019t like it, feared he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his promise, but decided to enjoy whatever time she had with him before he gave in to his compulsion again.</p><p>She did love to hear his stories, though. While she didn\u2019t approve of gambling, she had to admit the tales of his exploits intrigued her. He\u2019d been all over the world, to Europe, to Australia, to the Caribbean. He\u2019d gambled in many of those places, but he\u2019d also experienced real adventures\u2014a boat trip down the Nile, driving through the Australian Outback, being briefly\u2014and erroneously\u2014arrested in Paris. He\u2019d met famous people and told her anecdotes about them. Elise found she could listen to him for hours. She envied, just a little, his emotional extravagance. Unlike Maverick, Elise had always been cautious and frugal, with her money and her life.</p><p>The ideal way to live, she thought, was probably a combination of his approach and hers....</p><p>\u201cI was thinking it might be nice to take a drive to the mountains,\u201d Maverick said. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I went up to Mount Rainier.\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late in the day for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Come on, Elise, aren\u2019t you bored sitting around the house knitting?\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cI happen to enjoy my knitting, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it with you. You can knit in the car, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I suppose.\u201d Suddenly, she didn\u2019t want to yield to his plans. She no longer seemed to have any resistance to him, and that frightened her. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll pass, but thank you for thinking of me,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>Maverick grew quiet then, his disappointment unmistakable. He washed his lunch plate and tucked it inside the dishwasher. Then he disappeared for a few minutes, returning with a spy novel he\u2019d been reading, and sat down in the family room off the kitchen.</p><p>As she wiped the counters, Elise glared at him. She refused to let him manipulate her.</p><p>\u201cYou can go without me, you know,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Maverick lowered his book and glanced at her over his reading glasses. \u201cI know.\u201d He went back to his novel, apparently engrossed in the plot.</p><p>With Maverick reading, Elise walked down the hallway to her room and reached for her knitting. She was finished with the first sock and working on the second one. On Tuesday she\u2019d purchased yarn for another pair of socks; these, she\u2019d knit for her daughter.</p><p>She finished two complete rounds until, with a disgusted sigh, she set her knitting aside and marched into the family room. \u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>His face broke into a broad smile. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d come around.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d blatantly used guilt to get his own way\u2014and she\u2019d let him. He was quite a master of manipulation; with barely a word, he\u2019d coerced her into doing exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Within ten minutes, they were in the car and on their way out of the city, heading toward Mount Rainier National Park. Although Maverick had suggested it, Elise didn\u2019t bring her knitting. She had enough to concentrate on.</p><p>Maverick was a fascinating conversationalist, able to talk about anything, able to switch topics instantly. This was a gift she didn\u2019t have and one her ex-husband often used to ensnare his opponent on the other side of the gaming table. At least, according to his stories...</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me what happened,\u201d he said as they continued down the two-lane highway that led to the park.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the debacle with the house, then let me inform you, the subject is closed.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear the idea of exposing her foolishness to his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay financially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, once the lawsuit is settled.\u201d She felt irritated that he was asking her these awkward questions now, while she was virtually his captive. The only thing she could do was change the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I was up in Paradise,\u201d she murmured, staring out the window. Maverick was a skillful driver and the scenery was breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Maverick said, shooting her a look. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you remember, too. We were on our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly. Time to change the subject again. \u201cYou were gone this Wednesday. For several hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had personal business and before you ask, I wasn\u2019t gambling. You have my word on that.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have brought it up, and regretted that she had.</p><p>\u201cParadise was a misnomer,\u201d she said after a stilted pause. \u201cOur honeymoon was ruined by those dreadful mice.\u201d</p><p>Maverick burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt was no laughing matter,\u201d she said with a shudder. Maverick had managed to get them reservations in the National Park\u2019s beautiful and romantic lodge. In the middle of the night, Elise had awoken to a faint scratching sound. Her mistake was turning on the light. To her absolute horror, she saw five or six deer mice crawling in Maverick\u2019s overnight bag. She\u2019d let out a scream that had startled her husband\u2014and probably half the lodge\u2014into sudden wakefulness. Maverick had peanuts in his suitcase and the mice had gone after those, carrying them out one by one in what was practically an assembly line.</p><p>The following morning Elise had complained to the man at the registration desk about the unsanitary conditions and the fact that there appeared to be an infestation of mice. He\u2019d informed her that the lodge was prohibited by federal law from killing any of the wildlife in the area\u2014including mice. The only place they were allowed to set traps was in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cRemember how I distracted you?\u201d Maverick asked in a sultry voice.</p><p>Leave it to a man to mention sex. Or to hint at it, anyway. She refused to give him the satisfaction of a reply.</p><p>\u201cYou remember,\u201d he said, his amusement obvious.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly do not.\u201d She hugged herself even tighter.</p><p>He laughed at her stubborn refusal to admit the passion they\u2019d shared. \u201cHow long has it been, Elise?\u201d</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably in her seat. \u201cLonger for me than for you, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>She turned around to glance at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t fool me, Maverick. I was married to you, remember? I know you. You had an extremely healthy sexual appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we split up, you used to let me come to your bed.\u201d</p><p>Her face went instantly crimson. \u201cThat was a mistake.\u201d The year following their separation and divorce, he\u2019d showed up at the apartment every few nights and talked his way into her bedroom. Then he\u2019d abruptly stopped and Elise knew why. He\u2019d found some other woman who welcomed him. One who was happy to overlook his flaws and take what he offered without questions or recriminations.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake on my part,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we talk about something else?\u201d she asked in a bored voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou used to be such a prude\u2014until I got you between the sheets.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI guess you still are a prude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it right this minute! Or I swear I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll open this door and jump out of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that got a reaction, didn\u2019t it?\u201d He chuckled softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sixty-five years old and I find this discussion embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead yet, and I doubt you are, either,\u201d Maverick said smoothly.</p><p>Elise was determined not to answer.</p><p>They drove in silence after that and then, for no apparent reason, Maverick started laughing. Despite everything, Elise grinned. Then Maverick reached over and gave her hand a gentle squeeze.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was delightful. They drove through Rainier National Park and dined on steak and baked potatoes in the lodge.</p><p>The house was dark and quiet when they finally returned. Worn out from an entire day at the zoo, Luke and John were sound asleep. Aurora and David must have been tired, too, because not a sound came from their part of the house.</p> <p>Maverick escorted Elise to her bedroom door. \u201cThank you for a wonderful afternoon and evening,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Elise kept her gaze averted. \u201cDinner was lovely.\u201d Everything about the day had been lovely. \u201cJust...thank you.\u201d About to turn away, she didn\u2019t expect him to kiss her. But he did. He leaned forward and pressed his mouth to hers. His lips were warm and moist and his arms slid around her waist, pulling her close. When he ended the kiss and released her, Elise\u2019s knees nearly buckled.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Elise,\u201d he whispered, touching her face as if memorizing the feel of her skin.</p><p>She mumbled a reply that was completely unintelligible and nearly fell into her room. Her hands shook as she undressed and carefully hung up her clothes.</p><p>The tap on her bedroom door came just as she\u2019d finished brushing her teeth.</p><p>She closed her eyes, swaying, not sure what to do. She could ignore him and go to bed\u2014or she could open her door. Deciding quickly, she walked to the door.</p> <p>As she\u2019d expected, Maverick stood in the hallway. His eyes met hers in the light from her room. \u201cAre you going to let me in,\u201d he asked, \u201cor turn me away?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind helping you, Mom, but I\u2019ve got a life too,\u201d Annie muttered as Bethanne carried party supplies out to the car. The trunk was nearly full.</p><p>Annie followed her with a china tea set for an Alice in Wonderland party. The birthday girl was turning nine and Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland was one of her favorite books. Bethanne had designed an entire birthday party around that theme, including games, prizes and finger foods. Since her first dinosaur party for Elise\u2019s grandson, she\u2019d come up with dozens of new party ideas.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do once school starts?\u201d Annie asked, unwilling to drop the subject.</p><p>That was a good question. Bethanne had come to rely on her children and on Courtney for help with these events. Following football camp, practices had begun a few weeks earlier, and Andrew was busy most days. Annie was busy a lot of the time, too. To date, Courtney had been her most reliable helper. Thankfully her children didn\u2019t expect or want to be paid, and Courtney, too, refused any monetary compensation. Bethanne was grateful for their generosity, and since she was just getting this operation underway, every cent she could, she invested in the business.</p><p>\u201cSchool starts in two weeks,\u201d Annie reminded her.</p> <p>Bethanne closed the trunk. \u201cI know.\u201d She could\u2019ve done without that reminder. School was looming, and she\u2019d truly be on her own with the business then. She could probably get help with the actual parties, but she\u2019d have to complete the preparations herself. Still, all the work was worth it; giving Andrew a check so he could attend football camp had been the highlight of her summer. Nothing could diminish the sense of pride and accomplishment she\u2019d felt.</p><p>\u201cAndrew will be totally engrossed in football, so you won\u2019t be able to rely on him,\u201d Annie went on, oblivious to everything else.</p><p>As much as possible Bethanne would book parties around her son\u2019s games. She wanted to attend every one she could.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m on the swim team again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d Bethanne kept her voice carefully neutral. She\u2019d been disappointed when her daughter dropped out of the swim team, and she was delighted that Annie had rejoined it. Yes, it did seem that the old Annie was back. According to Grant, the harassment against Tiffany had ceased. Painful as this period had been, Annie appeared to be past it.</p><p>\u201cI called the coach and he said he\u2019d welcome me back, but I have a lot of time to put in if I\u2019m going to catch up with the other girls.\u201d</p><p>This was why Annie had been gone so much recently, Bethanne realized. Her daughter hadn\u2019t informed her about the swim team, and Bethanne didn\u2019t really understand why. Maybe Annie had wanted to wait, make sure it all worked out.</p><p>\u201cI think swimming is a good idea,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d her daughter asked. \u201cWhen we\u2019re back in school and doing all our extracurricular stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many parties have you got booked for September?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, please,\u201d Bethanne cried. \u201cI have to leave now if we\u2019re going to pick up Courtney, otherwise we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you need a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it on the way,\u201d she said, hurrying inside for her purse and car keys. She didn\u2019t miss Annie\u2019s exasperated expression.</p><p>Annie was already in the front seat and buckled up by the time Bethanne returned.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Annie demanded as Bethanne backed out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hire someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtney.\u201d The girl was trustworthy and a natural with kids, and she seemed to have more free time than her own children did. Bethanne would insist on paying her.</p><p>Annie and Courtney had become good friends, just as she\u2019d hoped. She had no idea what they talked about, but it wasn\u2019t unusual for them to spend two and three hours at a stretch in Annie\u2019s bedroom. Bethanne would\u2019ve guessed they didn\u2019t have much in common, but apparently she was wrong.</p><p>\u201cCourtney!\u201d Annie exploded right on cue. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with Courtney?\u201d she asked mildly, reviewing her party list. Food, dishes, decorations, costumes...Eventually, she\u2019d like to upgrade to a party van, too. She\u2019d need the extra space, plus she could have her logo and phone number painted on the side.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie continued, \u201cyou can\u2019t hire Courtney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Bethanne asked, stopping for a red light.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t fair to her! This is her senior year and she\u2019s in a new school. She wants to join the yearbook staff. Did you know she was chosen to be yearbook editor at her high school in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>Annie said this in awe. Bethanne suspected that her daughter was less impressed by the fact that Courtney was yearbook editor than by her willingness to walk away from the honor for her family\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cCourtney came to Seattle and she doesn\u2019t know anyone,\u201d Annie went on.</p><p>\u201cShe knows you and Andrew,\u201d Bethanne countered.</p><p>\u201cAndrew is so self-absorbed he isn\u2019t going to be much help to her,\u201d Annie said with a dismissive gesture. \u201cMom, if you ask Courtney, I know she\u2019ll say yes, so you can\u2019t ask her. It would be completely unfair. Courtney needs a chance to make friends, and to do that she needs time. Besides\u2014\u201d she gave an exasperated sigh \u201c\u2014she\u2019s already off on the wrong foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The light changed, and Bethanne drove through the intersection.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear?\u201d Annie cried as if this were a disaster of catastrophic proportions. \u201cCourtney registered for classes without talking to me and it\u2019s awful. She signed up for all the wrong ones. She\u2019s in first-period PE!\u201d</p><p>As Bethanne recalled, there\u2019d been some discussion about this during their most recent knitting class. Courtney didn\u2019t have a lot of options in registering for her classes. After the basic requirements were met, the only electives left were the least popular ones.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll find someone else to hire,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cNot Courtney.\u201d Privately, she thought Courtney should make the decision about whether or not to accept the job herself. On the other hand, she didn\u2019t want the girl agreeing to it out of a sense of obligation or friendship, and Annie was probably right in thinking that would happen.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes\u2019 silence, her daughter said, \u201cI phoned Dad last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was unexpected, but Bethanne knew better than to reveal any emotion. Annie wouldn\u2019t have mentioned the call if there wasn\u2019t something she wanted her mother to know.</p><p>\u201cWe talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Bethanne said, and she meant it. The fact that Annie had reached out to him revealed a new maturity in her daughter. \u201cI want you to have a relationship with your father.\u201d</p><p>Annie laughed softly. \u201cDad\u2019s still pretty mad about some of the stuff I pulled. I told him to get over it.\u201d</p><p>That was a fitting comment, since Grant had said virtually the same thing about Annie during that conversation at the French Caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cI bragged about how successful your party business is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Bethanne said, grinning at her daughter. She was curious to know whether Grant had commented on her business accomplishments, but she wouldn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still upset about what I did to her car, even though the insurance company covered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss that,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cThat\u2019s in the past, you\u2019ve apologized and it\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Annie said on the end of a sigh. \u201cBut about Tiffany\u2014well, there\u2019s no easy way to say this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just say it,\u201d Bethanne advised.</p><p>\u201cShe and Dad are flying to Vegas this afternoon to get married. They\u2019ve got everything arranged with one of those wedding chapel places. He seemed to think I should know. I guess because he wanted me to tell you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known it would happen sooner or later, but still...</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d her daughter asked, watching her closely. Her sweet face was tense with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d And she was, although there was regret and melancholy mingled with her acceptance. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be different?\u201d she asked with a nonchalant shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s been living with Tiffany ever since he moved out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t going to freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>Annie took a moment to consider the question. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, you know. It\u2019s like Dad isn\u2019t even part of my life anymore. I don\u2019t even see him because she refuses to let me in the house. As if I\u2019d want to visit,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cYou know, Mom, I don\u2019t really care.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d Bethanne murmured. \u201cBut it\u2019s important that you maintain a connection with your dad. Your relationship with Grant has nothing to do with Tiffany\u2014or me.\u201d</p><p>After the party, she had an overwhelming urge to talk to Paul, but she waited until Andrew and Annie were out for the night. They were attending a rock concert at Key Arena\u2014some rapper whose lyrics Bethanne couldn\u2019t make out. From what she knew of rappers, that was probably for the best.</p><p>Paul answered on the second ring. \u201cI was going to give you a call,\u201d he said. He sounded genuinely pleased to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come over for dinner?\u201d She wanted to see him although she didn\u2019t intend to cook. \u201cI\u2019m going to order pizza.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll rent a movie,\u201d he said, then hesitated. \u201cNow tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know something\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethanne, you\u2019re avoiding the subject.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to wait until you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted, \u201ctell me now.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Grant hadn\u2019t had the courage to tell her; instead he\u2019d done it through their daughter. Even then, Annie had been the one to phone him, otherwise none of them would\u2019ve known until after the fact.</p><p>\u201cTonight, while we\u2019re eating pizza and watching a DVD, Grant and Tiffany will be in Vegas. Three guesses why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d</p> <p>Paul didn\u2019t comment for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it a big bottle,\u201d she said.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>Courtney arrived for her orientation class at Washington High School early on Monday, August 15. She\u2019d already received her class assignments, and according to Annie, she\u2019d failed miserably in choosing her electives. She was doomed to become a social outcast if what Annie said was true.</p><p>She spent the morning at the high school. The purpose of the orientation was to ensure, among other things, that she\u2019d be familiar enough with the building to make her way from class to class on the first day of school. The summer was almost over, and Courtney prayed the year would pass just as quickly.</p><p>At noon, once she was finished with orientation, she headed home. Grams had volunteered to drive her, but Courtney had refused, taking her bike instead. It was parked behind the building, close to the football field. When she went to retrieve it, she noticed the football team practicing. She stopped and decided to watch for a few minutes. Annie had boasted that Andrew played quarterback, although it was hard to recognize him beneath all that equipment.</p><p>The three of them had gone out for pizza that one night, but Andrew didn\u2019t stay with Annie and Courtney long. Very soon after they\u2019d arrived at the restaurant, Andrew had run into a group of his friends and abandoned the girls. Not that it really mattered...She\u2019d seen him a few times since, mostly at Annie\u2019s place, but she doubted she\u2019d said a dozen words to him.</p> <p>Sitting in the stands, Courtney saw Andrew throw a pass deep into the end zone. The receiver leaped into the air and miraculously came down with the football. Excited to have scored the touchdown, Andrew raced to the end of the field and threw his arms around the receiver.</p><p>A whistle blew and the team formed a huddle around their coach. After a couple of minutes, all the players sent up a cheer and trotted toward the locker room.</p><p>Andrew had removed his helmet and was talking to a friend when he glanced up into the stands. He must have seen her because he stared as if trying to determine whether this was someone he knew.</p><p>Courtney felt uncomfortably conspicuous. She waved and stood up to leave.</p><p>Andrew started toward the chain-link fence, obviously intending to speak to her. Embarrassed now, Courtney walked down the steep concrete steps and met him at the fence.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize you at first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure that was you, either.\u201d Courtney smiled, happy just to see him. She hoped he\u2019d notice the fact that she\u2019d lost weight\u2014almost fifteen pounds. She was beginning to discern a difference in how her clothes fit.</p><p>\u201cThey had orientation for new students this morning,\u201d she explained, nervously pointing at the building behind her. She had to make clear to Andrew that she hadn\u2019t come down here because of him. She liked him\u2014okay, really liked him\u2014but she didn\u2019t want him knowing it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the school always does that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bicycle\u2019s back here.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, apparently disinterested. \u201cHave you got your class assignments yet?\u201d</p><p>Courtney told him what she remembered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in second period Honors English,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d This was good news as far as Courtney was concerned. She\u2019d know at least one person in that class. To hear Annie talk, she\u2019d gotten the very dregs of the elective courses.</p><p>Another player shouted at Andrew, and he looked over his shoulder. \u201cBe there in a minute,\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed. \u201cListen, I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell you, but I\u2019m grateful you called me that night about Annie. She\u2019s feeling a lot better since she started hangin\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I needed a friend, too.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged goodbyes and see-you-laters. As Andrew walked away, a blond girl raced onto the field. She gave a loud shriek, and when Andrew turned, she leaped into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. Although Andrew was sweaty and hot from practice and still in his uniform, she planted an openmouthed kiss on his lips. Naturally, the girl was thin and beautiful.</p><p>Courtney turned away to find a second girl almost directly behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hi,\u201d she said, giving Courtney a look that would have frozen motor oil.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Despite the chilly greeting, Courtney felt this was her opportunity to make friends. \u201cI\u2019m Courtney Pulanski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelly Johnson. I\u2019m with Melanie.\u201d</p><p>It seemed Melanie was the one with a lip lock on Andrew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Andrew and Annie\u2019s,\u201d she said, hoping this would smooth the way for her. They were basically the only teenagers she knew. She\u2019d met a lot of people since she\u2019d arrived in Seattle, but most of them collected social security. Bethanne and Lydia were two exceptions, but Bethanne was probably close to her father\u2019s age, and Lydia had to be at least thirty.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Shelly said with the same lack of welcome. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d</p><p>This was interesting. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Courtney thought giving the other girl some background might warm her reception. \u201cI recently moved here from Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be going to this school?\u201d</p><p>Courtney nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as Andrew,\u201d she said, and her gaze narrowed suspiciously, as if she was trying to read Courtney\u2019s intentions toward Annie\u2019s brother.</p><p>Courtney wanted it understood that she didn\u2019t consider herself competition for Melanie. \u201cI\u2019m actually more Annie\u2019s friend than Andrew\u2019s,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Just so you know, Mel and Andrew have been dating for a year. Mel\u2019s the head cheerleader and she\u2019ll probably be Homecoming Queen. It\u2019s perfect because Andrew\u2019s for sure gonna be King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Courtney echoed. It was all so perfectly perfect. She didn\u2019t understand how she could be deemed a threat to this perfect romance.</p><p>As soon as she could, Courtney left and biked back to her grandmother\u2019s. She felt a surprising sense of energy as she rode, although she was definitely out of sorts.</p><p>\u201cI have your lunch ready,\u201d Grams told her when she walked into the kitchen. A bowl of soup waited on the table, along with a tray of sliced carrots and celery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Courtney snapped, stomping toward her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCourtney Pulanski, there\u2019s no need to get snippy with me,\u201d her grandmother said sternly.</p><p>Courtney was instantly contrite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Courtney shook her head, not knowing what to say. She could hardly even put words to what she felt. It was that familiar ache of loneliness, that sense of not fitting in. She missed her friends and her family and her old high school. More than anything in the world, she just wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re tired?\u201d her grandmother suggested.</p><p>A nap was her grandmother\u2019s solution to just about every problem. That or a bowel movement. Rather than respond, Courtney continued up the stairs to her room.</p><p>Once inside, she closed the door and logged onto the Internet. Her spirits lifted immediately when she saw an e-mail from her father. He sounded well, which was a huge relief. She felt a constant, nagging worry about him. She\u2019d heard far too many stories about kidnappings in South America to be comfortable with her dad working there. She answered his e-mail right away and described the orientation class, exaggerating her enthusiasm for the start of school. Courtney didn\u2019t want her father to be concerned about her, didn\u2019t want to add to the burdens he already carried.</p><p>After reading her other mail\u2014from Julianna and two of her Chicago friends\u2014she lay down on her bed and stared up at the ceiling, assessing her chances for success this year. At the moment everything seemed bleak.</p><p>It was the way Melanie had looked at her, Courtney decided. Andrew\u2019s girlfriend had given her the eye as she claimed possession of Andrew. She viewed Courtney as an unknown and unwelcome threat. Funny how much you could derive from a single look.</p><p>Shelly, the friend, didn\u2019t even pretend to be friendly. Their entire conversation had been an attempt to gain information so she could assure the perfect \u201cMel\u201d that Courtney was a nobody.</p><p>Courtney did wonder why Annie had never mentioned Melanie. Maybe she didn\u2019t like her brother\u2019s girlfriend. Or maybe it simply hadn\u2019t occurred to her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to bring you your lunch?\u201d her grandmother shouted from the foot of the stairs.</p><p>Courtney reluctantly slid off the bed and stepped out into the hallway. \u201cGrams, I told you, I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d And the last thing she wanted was for her grandmother to climb the stairs. Vera had made her feelings about that quite clear.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will later.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s face darkened. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone upset you?\u201d</p><p>Courtney slowly came down the stairs, her hand on the railing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother looked as if she didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have some soup, after all,\u201d Courtney said, and Grams brightened.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear about your classes.\u201d She bustled into the kitchen, with Courtney following.</p><p>They sat at the table and chatted while Courtney ate her tomato soup and carrot sticks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeta thinks once you\u2019re settled in school, you should join the swim team,\u201d Courtney\u2019s grandmother said in an encouraging voice. \u201cWe all agree you\u2019re like greased lightning in the water.\u201d</p><p>Courtney hid a smile.

It\u2019s only one stitch at a time.\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I was looking forward to my next sock class\u2014although it was technically my last. Elise, Bethanne and Courtney had each completed one pair of socks using two circular needles and had already started on a second. Once again I was enthralled with the way three women, from dissimilar backgrounds, could be brought together by the simple enjoyment of knitting. I\u2019d been a silent witness to it all, and marveled anew at how their lives had become entwined.</p><p>Elise was the one who\u2019d suggested Bethanne start her own party business, and Courtney had become a special friend to Bethanne\u2019s daughter, Annie. Best of all, they\u2019d become friends to each other. And to me...</p> <p>Margaret had been in good spirits ever since the worry of losing their home had been removed. I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d told Matt about the money, but it didn\u2019t matter. Not once had she brought up the subject of the ten thousand dollars, and frankly, I was relieved. I\u2019d gladly make those loan payments and never say a word. My family had sacrificed so much for me through the years that it felt good to be giving something back. To Mom, who needed my time and attention more than ever, and to my sister.</p><p>Elise arrived for class first, and I noticed the white Lincoln Continental parked in front of the shop with the distinguished older man sitting behind the wheel. I found her ex-husband\u2019s devotion rather touching, and there was a certain reassurance in knowing that love can be renewed\u2014not that I expected any such thing in my own life.</p><p>I love Brad and Cody; time wouldn\u2019t change that. Cody and I talked once or twice a week. He told me his dad said he could phone me anytime he wanted. He rarely mentioned his mother, as if he knew talking about Janice and his dad was painful to me. The only concrete information I\u2019d learned was that his mom still had her own place. I figured that probably wouldn\u2019t be for long.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, everyone,\u201d Elise said. She positively glowed\u2014there was no other word for it.</p><p>I had to stop what I was doing and look again. \u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d I commented.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter said the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see Maverick\u2019s here,\u201d Margaret announced, looking out the display window.</p><p>Elise blushed with pleasure. \u201cI told him it\u2019s utter nonsense to sit outside and wait, but he says he doesn\u2019t have anything better to do. He reads the newspaper.\u201d She sat down at the table and brought out her knitting. \u201cI ended up giving him the socks I knit, so once I finish these for Aurora, I\u2019ll make a pair for David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Maverick surprised?\u201d It wasn\u2019t any of my business, but I was curious. The first socks I\u2019d knit with the circular-needle method were for Brad. He\u2019d nearly worn them out, so I\u2019d knit several more pairs. I wonder if he still wore them. If Janice knew who\u2019d made those socks, she might ask him to throw them in the garbage. Or do it herself, I thought darkly.</p><p>Elise was explaining that Maverick loved the socks and yes, he\u2019d been completely surprised, when the door opened and Bethanne breezed into the shop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d she asked. \u201cI get so involved with what I\u2019m doing that I lose track of where I need to be.\u201d She hurried to the back of the shop, where Elise sat by herself.</p><p>Bethanne had changed so much since that first class in June. She was confident, optimistic, happy. There was a mystery man in her life, too. She\u2019d mentioned his name in passing, Pete or Paul, but I\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>Courtney was almost directly behind Bethanne. I was concerned about her; for the past two weeks she\u2019d been quieter than usual. I knew she was feeling stressed about starting a new school and I hoped the transition would be smooth. I wouldn\u2019t broach the subject, but if she wanted to bring it up, I\u2019d be ready and willing to listen.</p><p>\u201cThis is officially our last class,\u201d I said and to my delight the announcement was greeted with boos and jeers. \u201cWould you like to continue?\u201d All three instantly agreed, which was exactly what had happened with my original class. \u201cThen I propose that we turn this into a knitting support group.\u201d I\u2019d been thinking about beginning a new one, and this was the perfect opportunity. \u201cI\u2019ll let the other classes know, so we might have a few other knitters joining us now and then.\u201d I explained that they\u2019d continue meeting each week\u2014same time, same place. They were welcome to bring in whatever they wanted to knit and I\u2019d be available to help anyone who had a question or a problem. I no longer charged for this, because I\u2019d seen the benefits of having people come to the shop on a regular basis.</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds ideal,\u201d Elise said, speaking for the group. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed this class more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>I suspected she was so in love with her ex-husband that the whole world seemed shiny and bright. I didn\u2019t know whether there was any kind of arrangement between them. Maybe they were just living in the present, not worrying about the future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come every week I can,\u201d Bethanne assured the others. \u201cThe only reason I couldn\u2019t is if I have a function, but I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019ll be too many birthday parties on week-day afternoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve finished your socks, right?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou gave them to your son?\u201d</p><p>Color crept up her neck and invaded her cheeks. \u201cActually, no. I gave them to a...friend.\u201d</p><p>Margaret walked over to the table, carrying a stack of pattern books. \u201cPaul?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. We\u2019re just friends. He\u2019s the ex-husband of the woman my husband left me for.\u201d There were a few gasps. \u201cHis ex-wife and my ex-husband are married now,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, \u201cand we get together once in a while to talk things over. How we feel about it and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did they get married?\u201d Courtney asked and seemed surprised.</p><p>\u201cJust recently. It wasn\u2019t unexpected, but it helps to have someone to discuss this with. Paul\u2019s great.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHe\u2019s a few years younger and well, he\u2019d like us to have a more...romantic relationship. I promised to consider it, but in the end I decided we\u2019d be more valuable to each other as friends. I told him the only way I\u2019d go out with him was if his mother came along to chaperone.\u201d</p><p>Elise and Courtney laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m encouraging him to see someone closer to his own age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Margaret asked. \u201cAre you ready to date?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shook her head. \u201cNot yet. Dating means I\u2019d have to shave my legs and wear panty hose. That\u2019s more bother than it\u2019s worth at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t shave your legs?\u201d Courtney asked with an appalled look. \u201cI do practically every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, too.\u201d Then Bethanne shrugged. \u201cI got out of the habit in my thirties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Court?\u201d I asked, feeling comfortable enough with the teenager to shorten her name. \u201cWill you be able to join the support group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come until school starts,\u201d she said, \u201cand I might even be able to come after that, but I\u2019d need to discuss it with my advisor. I think my Tuesday schedule should be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Elise said, \u201cwho says we have to meet at the same time? We could make it after school, instead, and then Courtney could join us for sure. Does that work for everyone?\u201d</p><p>An immediate chorus of agreement followed. \u201cThree o\u2019clock it is,\u201d I announced.</p><p>The bell chimed and one of my all-time favorite knitters came into the shop. \u201cJacqueline!\u201d I cried, cheered to see her. It\u2019d been a couple of weeks since we\u2019d talked. She was a regular at the Friday charity sessions, but she\u2019d been on a trip with her husband.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back from New York City and here for a yarn fix,\u201d she informed me. Everyone at the table knew Jacqueline, so introductions weren\u2019t necessary.</p><p>She had that look in her eye, a look I recognized. Those of us who are addicted to yarn seem to share it. Jacqueline was among my best customers; she could afford to buy as much yarn as she wanted and she did, without restraint. She\u2019d told me recently that Reece had set aside a room in their house for her yarn stash. I envied her all that space. Jacqueline had every intention of knitting each skein\u2014once she found the project best suited to it. I, too, had a million projects waiting. We both had more yarn tucked away than we could possibly knit in an entire lifetime, or even two.</p><p>Jacqueline sat down next to Elise and admired her work. She tended to dominate the conversation, but no one really minded. Her enthusiasm for yarn and knitting was contagious.</p><p>The phone rang and my ever-efficient sister answered it. I wasn\u2019t paying much attention but when she replaced the receiver and walked over to the table, where I sat with the class, I noticed the color had drained from her face.</p><p>Margaret placed her hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s Mom,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cWe need to get to Swedish Hospital right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d My heart was instantly in my throat.</p><p>\u201cShe collapsed\u2014the neighbor found her on the patio. No one knows how long she was there.\u201d</p><p>I leaped up from the chair, ready to rush out, when I realized I had a store full of customers. Several women were browsing among the yarn displays and one was flipping through patterns. Not to mention my class...</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Jacqueline insisted. \u201cI\u2019ll mind the business until you get back. Just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything to help?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d That was Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cI can stay, too,\u201d Courtney said.</p><p>I was overwhelmed by gratitude for their kindness and compassion. \u201cThank you. Thank you all so much.\u201d These women were more than my customers and my students. They were my friends.</p><p>Margaret had her purse by the time I went to collect mine. When I came out of the office, Brad had just arrived with a delivery. He stood near the door.</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave,\u201d Margaret was telling him as she signed for the yarn. \u201cIt\u2019s Mom. She\u2019s been rushed to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, frowning with concern. \u201cIs she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything yet.\u201d I couldn\u2019t control my reaction, my need for comfort, for him. I reached out to Brad. I needed his arms around me one last time, for courage and strength. He seemed to understand that intuitively, and when I moved toward him, he drew me into his embrace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Margaret said in a low voice.</p><p>He released me, and I thanked him wordlessly, then rushed out of the store.</p><p>The staff at Swedish was wonderful, although it took what seemed like hours before we were able to talk to anyone. I berated myself over and over for not being more available to my mother. She was never demanding of my time and grateful for whatever I gave her. I did visit two or three times a week, but clearly that wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Margaret saw her as often as she could, too. But Mom needed more than scattered visits from her two daughters. I was nearly choking on guilt and so, I suspected, was my sister.</p> <p>Margaret hated being inside a hospital. It was because of the smell, she said, which immediately made her feel anxious. I\u2019d spent practically my entire youth in one and had grown so accustomed to it that I no longer noticed. Margaret had a firm grip on my arm, and for once she was relying on me.</p><p>We were asked to wait in a sitting room until the doctor could update us on Mom\u2019s condition. The chairs were comfortable, and a television was on, playing a soap opera\u2014ironically it was General Hospital. I didn\u2019t pay attention, didn\u2019t hear a single word. My mind whirled with guilt and fear and recriminations. I was certain I\u2019d failed my mother and that everything was somehow my fault.</p><p>A physician appeared and, as if our movements were synchronized, Margaret and I stood simultaneously.</p><p>The doctor came straight to the point. \u201cYour mother is in serious condition. She\u2019s in a diabetic coma.\u201d</p><p>This was a shock to both of us.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got her stabilized and I expect her insulin levels to even out, but this is a disease that is not to be taken lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one in the family is diabetic,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cWe had no idea Mom could come down with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives alone?\u201d</p><p>We both nodded.</p><p>Again the physician was straightforward. \u201cWell, I\u2019d suggest you investigate placing her in assisted living.\u201d</p><p>He wanted us to take our mother out of the only home she\u2019d known for the last fifty years. I didn\u2019t know if I could do that\u2014but I realized we had no choice.</p> <p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>The house was quiet when the light tap sounded at Elise\u2019s bedroom door. She was waiting for Maverick. She was so in love with this man that she\u2019d lost all sense of propriety. She knew what he was, knew it to the very depths of her heart, but now\u2014just like all those years ago\u2014it didn\u2019t seem to matter.</p><p>The knock came, and she opened her door to let him in. He pulled her into his arms and they kissed. They\u2019d made love just once\u2014the night after their excursion into the mountains\u2014and when it was over, they\u2019d both cried, holding each other in the aftermath of passion. Their first sexual reunion had been a combination of excitement, embarrassment, fear and anticipation. They\u2019d felt awkward with each other, but they\u2019d also experienced tenderness and joy. They\u2019d spent most nights together since then, simply holding each other close. After sleeping alone all these years, Elise hadn\u2019t thought it possible to bring a man to her bed, a single bed at that. Anyone seeing them cramped against the wall would\u2019ve found the sight comical, she was sure. She fell asleep in his embrace and then in the early hours of the morning, Maverick slipped back into the boys\u2019 room.</p><p>No one was the wiser. At least, not as far as she knew. She suspected David and Aurora had guessed, but neither mentioned it. Elise pretended her daughter was oblivious to the late-night shuffle between Maverick\u2019s room and hers.</p><p>\u201cThis is silly, you know,\u201d Maverick murmured, pulling back the sheet so they could get into bed together. He let her go first and then followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s silly, our being together?\u201d He was right, but she found it alarming that he\u2019d admit it.</p><p>\u201cOur being together is the only thing right about this situation,\u201d Maverick insisted in a husky whisper. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is sneaking around in the middle of the night. Good grief, Elise, I\u2019m sixty-six years old. The last time I did this, I was a teenager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d she said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re accustomed to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me make an honest woman of you.\u201d</p><p>Elise slid under the sheets until she was down far enough to rest her head against Maverick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you suggesting we...get married? Again?\u201d While it might sound appealing, she wasn\u2019t convinced that was really the solution.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to live in sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d She\u2019d had her freedom for the past thirty years. \u201cCan I think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He rubbed his leg against hers. \u201cI love you, Elise. I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>She believed Maverick did love her, but that didn\u2019t mean she could trust him. If she was a gambling woman, she would\u2019ve bet that, given the opportunity, he\u2019d be back at the gaming tables.</p><p>Maverick kissed the top of her head. \u201cI talked to the real estate agent about the apartment complex this afternoon,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He\u2019d left the house after lunch and been gone almost four hours. He never told her where he went, but this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d mysteriously disappeared. Elise had her suspicions, but didn\u2019t press him for details. Some things it was better not to know.</p><p>But it was too hard not to say something, not to ask for even a hint. \u201cYou were away for a long time,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re worried, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t gambling.\u201d</p><p>Elise closed her eyes. She struggled, once again, to take him at his word. Too often, she\u2019d looked the other way rather than confront the truth. It distressed her to realize that nothing had really changed about him\u2014or her\u2014in all these years.</p><p>\u201cI swear to you I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She placed her arm around his middle. He\u2019d been her one folly in life. She knew what he was when she\u2019d married him the first time. Her love hadn\u2019t changed him then and it probably wouldn\u2019t now.</p><p>\u201cThe deal went through on the condo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving in next week.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond, unwilling to reveal her disappointment or her sudden feeling of loss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve stayed longer than I should have,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI never intended to intrude on Aurora and David for more than a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to overstay his welcome any more than Elise wanted to burden her daughter and family. But there was nowhere else for her to go. She was beginning to think she might never get her money back. The courts moved so slowly that by the time the case was settled, she\u2019d be dead and buried, she thought cynically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to move in with me,\u201d he said, his voice a throaty whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not sure.\u201d The temptation to give in was stronger than anything she\u2019d felt in years.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to remarry if you don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMore than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d He tightened his hold on her. She lay there quietly, comforted by his arms around her, and eventually realized he was asleep.</p><p>It was a long time before Elise managed to doze off. In the morning when she woke, he was gone. Aurora was already up and in the kitchen, dressed in her housecoat. Elise poured herself a cup of coffee. She knew David had left for work; he was usually on the road by seven. The house remained quiet. Before long, the boys would be up and so would Maverick. Elise savored these few minutes alone with her daughter.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Aurora said tentatively. \u201cDid you know Dad\u2019s moving?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded. \u201cHe told me...last night.\u201d Embarrassed, she kept her back to Aurora as she added cream to her coffee, stirring more than necessary.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dad seem to be getting along quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...We are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all gone so much better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but then your father always was a charmer,\u201d Elise said tartly. She turned around and her face heated up at Aurora\u2019s speculative look. \u201cOh, all right, if you must know, your father and I are sharing a bed.\u201d Elise didn\u2019t understand what possessed her to blurt it out like that. It made their love sound sordid and wrong, when sleeping with Maverick was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Aurora tried to hide her amusement by taking a sip of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret. David and I guessed right away.\u201d</p><p>This was embarrassing. Might as well go for broke. \u201cHe wants me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>If she knew the answer to that, she wouldn\u2019t be discussing it with her daughter. \u201cI...I\u2019m not sure what to do. Your father\u2014well, you know your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, Mom, not really. I have an image of him, but what Dad\u2019s really like...I guess it\u2019s somewhere between reality and my fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been here all these weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aurora said with a deep sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s been wonderful with the boys. They adore him and I do, too\u2014but then I always did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. There\u2019d been a time when Elise had resented her daughter\u2019s love for her father, but no more. \u201cI\u2019ve made so many mistakes in my life,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow your heart, Mom,\u201d Aurora said quietly. \u201cFollow your heart.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>Bethanne was almost afraid of her newfound happiness. Her fledgling business showed real promise. With every birthday party she designed, she booked two and often three more. But Annie was right. She couldn\u2019t continue to do this without paid employees and additional help. With school starting in a few days, she wouldn\u2019t have any choice but to hire an assistant.</p><p>What she needed, according to Paul, was a start-up business loan. He seemed so confident she\u2019d get one that her doubts fell away. Because she\u2019d never established credit on her own or even filled out a loan application, he\u2019d promised to look everything over before she visited the bank.</p><p>They were meeting Monday at noon on the Seattle waterfront at Myrtle Edwards Park. She\u2019d packed a thick deli sandwich, fruit and a drink as a small thank-you for his thoughtfulness. She was too nervous to eat and intended to go directly to her local bank following their meeting.</p><p>She had a picnic table staked out early and sat there, enjoying the late-summer day. The sun\u2019s reflection on the water made it a deep greenish-blue and the wind off Puget Sound was fresh with the briny scent of the sea. A Washington State ferry could be seen leaving the dock, heading for either Bremerton or the town of Winslow on Bainbridge Island.</p><p>Bethanne rarely had reason to take the ferry, but in the painful aftermath of divorce, she\u2019d taken one to Bremerton. She\u2019d stood outside in the coldest, wettest part of the winter, tears streaming down her cheeks. The wind and the rain pummeled her, and she prayed with desperation that she\u2019d catch cold and die because death seemed preferable to this horrible pain. How grateful she was now that her prayer hadn\u2019t been answered. It felt as though the sun was shining on her life these days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t see Paul until he stepped up to the table. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly preoccupied,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she gasped. Impulsively she reached out and hugged him\u2014and was shocked when he wrapped his arms around her. They talked almost every day and saw each other two or three times a week. He\u2019d become her confidant and her friend, and they relied on each other for moral support. She didn\u2019t want that to change, and she\u2019d assumed he understood her feelings. Gently she disengaged herself.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my favorite party girl?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great\u2014I think.\u201d She\u2019d know more after he reviewed her loan application. \u201cI brought you lunch,\u201d she announced and pointed to the small cooler she\u2019d carried from her car.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d he protested, slipping into the seat across from her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I wanted to thank you for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, don\u2019t you know?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe he was unaware of how much he\u2019d helped her in the past few months. He\u2019d been her friend when she\u2019d badly needed one. He\u2019d been a major source of encouragement when she\u2019d started her party business. Most importantly, Paul had showed her she was alive again when the divorce had nearly destroyed her. Paul, and her friends at A Good Yarn, had shaped the new Bethanne. The new, improved Bethanne, with dreams and courage and a promising future. She told him all this, and then couldn\u2019t seem to stop talking.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He laughed and held up both hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue I was such a hero.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re my hero.\u201d</p><p>He sobered then, the laughter vanishing from his eyes. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>The intensity of his look made Bethanne uncomfortable, so she opened the small cooler and brought out the thick corned beef sandwich she\u2019d prepared. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll get this ready while you read over the loan application.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said agreeably.</p><p>As she set up his lunch, Bethanne noticed that her hands were shaking. The last few times she\u2019d been with Paul, she\u2019d recognized the subtle changes in their relationship. The sexual tension between them was all too evident, and that frightened her more than applying for the bank loan. As much as possible, she wanted to keep this relationship safe. She feared that acting on sexual impulses would ruin the friendship, and Bethanne couldn\u2019t bear that.</p><p>She spread out a napkin and peeled the wrap from around the sandwich while Paul scanned the loan application.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t work after you were married?\u201d he asked, glancing up.</p><p>\u201cWell, I did until Andrew was born. I have it down there.\u201d She pointed out where her previous employment was listed on the application. She\u2019d worked in a boutique, doing the display windows. She\u2019d enjoyed her job for the two years she\u2019d worked there.</p><p>\u201cThat was more than eighteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but if you take a look at the volunteer work I\u2019ve done, I think it shows I\u2019m qualified and responsible.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded.</p><p>Bethanne relaxed. \u201cOkay, be honest now,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were a bank officer, would you give me the loan?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was enough to make her heart stop. \u201cPaul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted me to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hard sell. There are disadvantages\u2014and advantages. The fact that you\u2019ve never had your own credit is a negative. So is the fact that you haven\u2019t had a paying job in the last eighteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make the loan application more attractive?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShow the bank your business records for the work you\u2019ve done this summer.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was afraid he\u2019d say that. She wasn\u2019t much good at this sort of thing and really needed to take a class to learn basic accounting. All her receipts were crammed in a shoe-box. Perhaps Andrew and Annie might be able to help. She recalled that her son had taken a bookkeeping class as a junior, but he was so busy these days with football and his part-time job. And now school was starting again.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. What do we have here?\u201d That ironic male voice was easily recognizable to Bethanne.</p><p>She smiled serenely. \u201cHello, Grant.\u201d</p><p>Her ex-husband stared at Bethanne and Paul. He didn\u2019t look good; his shirt was wrinkled\u2014not badly, but it wasn\u2019t pressed the way she used to do it. Grant had always been meticulous about his appearance. He needed a haircut, and that was another surprise. He used to have regular appointments. Bethanne knew, because she was the one who\u2019d set up those appointments. They\u2019d been apart for two years, so one would think he\u2019d manage to survive without her by now.</p><p>\u201cYou know Paul, don\u2019t you?\u201d Bethanne said casually, gesturing toward Tiffany\u2019s ex-husband. Paul lowered his sandwich to the napkin, looked up at Grant and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve met,\u201d Grant muttered.</p><p>\u201cI understand congratulations are in order,\u201d Bethanne said, hoping to cover the awkward silence. \u201cAnnie told me you and Tiffany recently got married. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re very happy,\u201d Bethanne said sincerely. A short while ago, those words might have been filled with sarcasm, but they weren\u2019t now. She felt no animosity toward Grant. She\u2019d once loved him, heart and soul, but he\u2019d betrayed that love and whatever she\u2019d felt for him had been destroyed. That didn\u2019t mean\u2014or it no longer did\u2014that she wanted vengeance. Or that she begrudged him happiness just because he hadn\u2019t found it with her. The moment she\u2019d realized that, she\u2019d finally released him and the bitterness that surrounded their divorce.</p><p>\u201cI see Paul\u2019s lucky enough to have you packing his lunch these days,\u201d Grant said. He looked longingly at the sandwich. \u201cYou made the best corned beef sandwiches I ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping Bethanne with some paperwork,\u201d Paul explained.</p><p>Bethanne wanted to elaborate, but stopped herself. This really had nothing to do with Grant. Other than the fact that he was the father of her children, they had little in common any more. The twenty-year history they shared had become irrelevant.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Grant offered them both a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely afternoon, which is why Paul suggested we meet in the park,\u201d she added.</p><p>Grant seemed uncomfortable. \u201cI saw you here and thought I\u2019d drop by and say hello.\u201d He turned to Paul. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne doubted he really meant that. She studied Grant and instinctively knew he wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asked and immediately wished she hadn\u2019t. Even if there was a problem, he wasn\u2019t likely to talk about it in front of Paul.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s just great,\u201d he said but his words rang hollow.</p><p>The two men stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cAndrew said you paid for his football camp.\u201d Grant turned his attention back to her.</p><p>Bethanne hadn\u2019t realized Andrew was speaking to his father. This was a good sign, and she was encouraged that father and son had made an effort to overcome their differences.</p><p>\u201cYou challenged me to find a way to support myself,\u201d Bethanne said with a laugh, \u201cand I have. If nothing else, I should thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if accepting her appreciation. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s working out for you,\u201d he said without irony.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She tried to resist the urge to brag but didn\u2019t quite succeed. \u201cI have six parties booked for this week and more calls coming in every day. Annie and a friend of hers created business cards for me, and the kids have been my assistants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. A family effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you every success,\u201d Grant said. Without another word, he walked away.</p><p>Paul glared after him.</p><p>\u201cPaul, Paul, Paul,\u201d she whispered and touched his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let it go.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt just takes time.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed somewhat, but Bethanne could see he was still agitated by the encounter.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I believe it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cis because I see it in you. Did I ever mention how much I admire you?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cOnce or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid this will upset you, Bethanne, but it\u2019s the truth\u2014I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d He reached for her hand.</p><p>Bethanne closed her eyes. She loved Paul, but not in that way.</p><p>This was something she didn\u2019t want\u2014or need.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Now that Maverick was living in his condominium, Elise missed him. She\u2019d made the difficult decision to remain where she was for now, but she was miserable without Maverick. She missed everything about him. It\u2019d been that way after the divorce, too. The scent of him, the feel of him, the incredible joy of watching him with their infant daughter...</p><p>The ache inside her seemed to grow day by day. And yet it wasn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t see him. Maverick was at the house almost daily for one reason or another. Each and every visit, he attempted to lure her to his home, to convince her he was a changed man and that she could trust him. So far she\u2019d resisted, but her resolve was weakening. She could feel it crack under the pressure of her own needs, but she dared not give in.</p><p>Elise half-expected Maverick this morning. He knew as well as she did that Aurora intended to take the boys shopping for school clothes. The house would be theirs if they chose to take advantage of it.</p><p>Half an hour after her daughter left, Elise was anxiously pacing the kitchen. When the bell rang, she dashed to the front door and threw it open. Maverick was right about her\u2014in one area, especially. Elise had a thriving sexual appetite. She\u2019d supressed it all these years but, beginning the night he had told her he was leaving, she\u2019d given it free rein. She liked nothing better than to take her ex-husband to bed in the middle of a hot afternoon. Her cheeks flushed at the thought. If anyone ever learned about this secret part of her nature, she\u2019d die of mortification. She\u2019d simply die.</p><p>She loved how much Maverick loved her. All they needed was each other. And yet...could they live with each other?</p><p>Elise was afraid that joining her life with his would end the same way it had before. It was inevitable that he\u2019d succumb to his compulsion to gamble again, and she couldn\u2019t handle that.</p><p>Despite her hopes, it wasn\u2019t Maverick at the door. \u201cBethanne!\u201d Elise held open the screen door. Something must be very wrong, because her friend was so pale. \u201cCome in, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me just showing up like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Elise led the way to the living room. She offered to make coffee or tea, but Bethanne declined with a quick shake of her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bethanne sat down on the sofa, plucking a tissue from her purse. \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t cry and look at me. I haven\u2019t said a word and I\u2019m already an emotional wreck.\u201d</p><p>Elise sat across from her. \u201cStart at the beginning. Tell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne bit her trembling lower lip. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve been to six banks now, and each one rejected my loan application.\u201d While Elise listened, Bethanne reviewed the first five banks and the rejections, which were all because she was considered a poor loan risk.</p><p>\u201cThen I talked to Lydia, and she mentioned a neighborhood bank that gave her a loan recently. She told me there were things about her history that made her look like a poor risk, too. On paper, anyway. But you and I both know that Lydia\u2019s a fabulous businessperson. She has more financial sense in her little finger than I do in my entire body. But I\u2019m willing to learn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you can learn,\u201d Elise assured her. She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing Bethanne this upset\u2014not even when she\u2019d first talked about the divorce. \u201cDid you apply with this bank Lydia recommended?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cAt Lydia\u2019s insistence, I used her as a reference.\u201d She stopped talking long enough to blow her nose. \u201cI just heard back from them yesterday afternoon. After a lot of debate, they decided to refuse me the loan. Elise,\u201d she cried, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>If Elise had the money herself, she\u2019d lend it to her. In some ways, she felt responsible; she\u2019d been the one to suggest the party business and she was proud of Bethanne\u2019s success.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Bethanne took a moment to collect herself. \u201cJust by listening to me,\u201d she whispered, unable to keep the emotion out of her voice. \u201cI...I admire you so much and I\u2019m so grateful I met you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d Elise blushed at the praise. All she\u2019d ever done was encourage Bethanne. Elise had been a single mother herself, and knew the hardships that entailed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Elise, you\u2019re such a good friend.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to tear up. Naturally, she\u2019d had friends through the years, but she\u2019d come to realize that those relationships were superficial. There was no real grief in leaving them behind. Somehow, it was different with the knitting group. Her reserve had slowly begun to dissolve; she even found herself talking about Maverick. Of course, she hadn\u2019t shared the fact that they were sleeping together\u2014that was far too intimate a detail\u2014but she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her friends had guessed. Until this summer she\u2019d hardly ever mentioned his name.</p><p>\u201cI found out something wonderful about Lydia,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cOne time she told me she didn\u2019t owe a single penny to anyone. She was proud of that. All the yarn in her store\u2019s paid for and\u2014until she got this loan\u2014she was pretty well debt-free.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded; she approved of doing business on a pay-as-you-go basis. Far too many young people got caught in the credit trap. It was too easy to use a credit card and pay later. Except that the debt always grew so much faster than anyone seemed to expect. She\u2019d seen it with her own daughter and son-in-law, warned them as gently as she could and then shut up.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask Lydia why she needed a loan. But later Margaret pulled me aside and said Lydia had given the money to her.\u201d</p> <p>Elise couldn\u2019t hide her surprise. Not at the fact that Lydia had given her sister money, but that Margaret would freely volunteer this information.</p><p>\u201cI think she felt sorry for me and wanted to encourage me and I think\u2014I think she wanted me to know what a wonderful sister she has,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cMargaret needed the money?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cShe told me her husband\u2019s been out of work for the last six months and they\u2019d gotten behind on their house payments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod bless Lydia,\u201d Elise whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s hurting so badly,\u201d Bethanne added.</p><p>\u201cAnd now her mother\u2019s in a nursing home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s come to that?\u201d The last Elise heard, Margaret and Lydia were researching assisted living facilities.</p> <p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be there more than a week or two,\u201d Bethanne said, \u201cbut it\u2019s expensive, even as an interim solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem to be a good time economically for any of us, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope I can survive for the next few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d Elise told her. \u201cThis business is just too promising to be ignored for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne stared down at the carpet, then sighed deeply. \u201cI so badly want to believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get someone to help you with the bookkeeping?\u201d Elise asked, moving on to practical matters.</p><p>The younger woman nodded. \u201cPaul\u2019s been going over everything with me.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell sounded and before Elise could answer, Maverick strolled into the room, looking about as debonair as she\u2019d ever seen him. Her heart skipped a beat. His gaze went from Elise to Bethanne and back again.</p><p>\u201cI can come another time,\u201d he said.</p><p>An automatic protest rose in her throat, but she needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t. I should go,\u201d Bethanne insisted. \u201cI came because I had to talk to a friend. All I really needed was for Elise to tell me I\u2019m not a failure.\u201d</p><p>She stood and Elise led her to the front door. Before Bethanne left, they hugged. \u201cCall me anytime, understand?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cThank you so much for listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Tuesday.\u201d And then Bethanne was gone.</p><p>Elise turned to find Maverick standing in the foyer watching her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been rejected for six bank loans and is about to give up.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very good to her.\u201d</p><p>Elise dismissed his words. \u201cShe\u2019s been wonderful to me.\u201d</p><p>Maverick slowly advanced toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re one hell of a woman, Elise Beaumont.\u201d He slipped his arms around her waist and brought her close with a gentleness that melted her worries.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maverick...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her and whispered promises that made her knees weak.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>She refused with an adamant \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise, I need you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d The minute she was in his apartment he\u2019d find a way to convince her to move in. She loved him. Despite his flaws and weakness, she loved him.</p><p>But she still wasn\u2019t sure she could trust him.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>The second-period bell rang, and the high school erupted into chaos as students poured out of their classrooms. Courtney thought she knew her way around the building. During the orientation session, she\u2019d paid close attention to where her classes were scheduled, but now she felt hopelessly lost.</p><p>The one bright spot in the day, she hoped, would be Honors English, because she knew Andrew Hamlin was in the class. Not that she expected him to speak to her or anything. But at least he\u2019d be a familiar face.</p><p>The bell rang again, and the halls were suddenly deserted. Courtney pressed her books to her chest and looked around, completely disoriented. Eventually the hall monitor found her and pointed her in the right direction. Knowing she was already late, she ran down one corridor and then another to Honors English.</p><p>The class had already begun when she opened the door and attempted to slip inside unnoticed. That would\u2019ve been asking too much, she realized, when she discovered the entire class watching her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled at the teacher. \u201cI got lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to find your way tomorrow?\u201d Mr. Hazelton asked sternly.</p><p>She nodded, kept her head lowered and found an empty seat as far back in the room as she could. Once she was settled, she searched the class for Andrew and saw that he was three rows to the left of her, near the front.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, the bell rang and Courtney checked her schedule to confirm that this was her lunch hour. She dreaded going into the cafeteria. In Chicago, she would\u2019ve been eating with her friends, laughing and exchanging gossip. Here, she\u2019d stand out like a searchlight in fog. The new kid. Friendless and alone.</p><p>She dawdled until the classroom was empty, then gathered up her things and headed out. To her astonishment, Andrew was waiting by the door.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked. His books were tucked close to his side; Courtney immediately noticed how tanned he was\u2014and how cute.</p><p>\u201cAbout as well as can be expected,\u201d she told him. It seemed everyone was moving in the same direction, and Courtney followed the flow. So did Andrew. She stopped at her locker long enough to drop off her books. She was gratified that Andrew chose to wait for her again. \u201cI certainly know how to make a grand entrance, don\u2019t I?\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>Andrew grinned, which made him even more appealing, and Courtney forced herself to glance away. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Annie yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was looking for you earlier.\u201d</p><p>That was encouraging.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get to school?\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing to admit she\u2019d taken the bus. Her grandmother had needed her car and besides, Courtney had never driven it. All summer she\u2019d used her bicycle for transportation and it\u2019d worked out great. But things were different now. Only nerds rode bicycles to school. So it was either walk or take the bus. Given those choices, she\u2019d opted for the school bus but had been the only senior on board.</p><p>\u201cThe bus,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d offer to drive you, but I have to come in early because of football.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d do that for her?</p><p>\u201cMom dropped Annie off,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask my grandmother to do that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in agreement. \u201cLet me work on it. I know a guy who doesn\u2019t live that far from you. If you were to offer Mike gas money, he\u2019d probably be willing to pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Courtney smiled delightedly, relieved and a little astonished at her good fortune. This was a perfect solution and she\u2019d pay whatever his friend wanted. Not only would she avoid the humiliation of the bus, she\u2019d have an opportunity to make a friend.</p><p>As they entered the cafeteria, she expected Andrew to join his friends. Instead, he got in the lunch line behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking great, by the way,\u201d he said.</p><p>She\u2019d worked hard this summer and it felt so good to have him, of all people, notice how much weight she\u2019d lost. \u201cThanks. You are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s football,\u201d he explained. \u201cI bulk up every year.\u201d He slid his tray behind her as they advanced in the line. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Mike and get back to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>She chose a chef\u2019s salad with low-fat dressing and skipped the soda, selecting bottled water instead. If there was an award for righteousness, she should receive it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCourtney,\u201d Annie shouted and hurried over to her as soon as she\u2019d finished paying for her salad. \u201cCome and meet my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She started to walk away and realized she\u2019d abandoned Andrew. Turning back, holding her tray with both hands, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d He nodded, sauntering across the room to join a group of seniors.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find someone to give me a ride to school,\u201d Courtney told Annie, nearly bursting with the news.</p> <p>\u201cMom said he should,\u201d Annie informed her. So much for that, Courtney thought, squelching her disappointment. Bethanne was responsible for this. Well, it shouldn\u2019t matter. Instead of obsessing about the fact that Andrew hadn\u2019t come up with the idea himself, Courtney should be grateful\u2014and she was. Just not as happy as she\u2019d been before.</p><p>\u201cAnnie!\u201d a girl called out. \u201cOver here.\u201d</p><p>Annie hesitated, and when she turned toward the other girl, Courtney sensed reluctance. Courtney followed her to a table occupied by two heavily made-up girls. They had various body parts pierced and were dressed mostly in black leather. Courtney felt completely out of place; for their part, Annie\u2019s friends eyed her as if she\u2019d descended from outer space.</p><p>\u201cThis is Courtney,\u201d Annie said, introducing her. \u201cWe met over the summer. Tina and Shyla.\u201d Annie gestured first to one and then the other.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Courtney said.</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d Shyla smiled; Tina didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou trying out for the cheerleading squad?\u201d Tina, the girl dressed entirely in black, asked. Her nose was pierced in five places.</p><p>That these friends of Annie\u2019s figured Courtney was skinny enough to make the grade was a compliment, but she knew they didn\u2019t mean it that way.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Annie frowned at the other girls. \u201cCourtney\u2019s my friend. Come on, guys, she\u2019s new here.\u201d</p><p>Tina turned her gaze from Courtney and stared at Annie. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of you lately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy, you know,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cWith Courtney?\u201d Shyla asked.</p><p>Annie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYeah. What about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you decided who your friends are,\u201d Tina suggested, \u201cbecause it\u2019s either her kind or us. If you want to be the cheerleader type, just say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do,\u201d Annie muttered. \u201cCome on, Courtney, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Annie marched off, and once again, Courtney followed. She could almost feel the daggers. She didn\u2019t want to get caught alone in the girls\u2019 room with those two anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cYou were never really one of us, you know,\u201d Tina taunted.</p><p>Annie ignored her and led Courtney across the cafeteria.</p> <p>They found a recently vacated table, where Courtney set down her tray. \u201cAnnie, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ve outgrown them, anyway.\u201d But she looked more than a little perturbed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t allowed to finish before Annie snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t take it personally, all right? This isn\u2019t about you.\u201d</p><p>Courtney shrugged, unsure what to say.</p><p>Annie frowned as the two of them sat alone at the end of a table. After they\u2019d eaten their salads, Annie took out an apple and munched on that, but they barely exchanged another word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d Courtney asked when the bell rang.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Annie didn\u2019t sound too enthusiastic about it, though.</p><p>When Annie left, Courtney returned her tray to the kitchen area, where she saw two other girls with their heads together, whispering and looking at her. She recognized Shelly and Melanie, Andrew\u2019s supposed girlfriend and her sidekick. She wanted to wave and let them know she realized they were talking about her, but decided it was better, not to mention easier, just to ignore them.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was uneventful. She wasn\u2019t late for any other classes and that, at least, was an improvement. Still, her stomach was in knots when school was over and she headed to the bus line. She hoped the ride situation would work out with that friend of Andrew\u2019s.</p><p>As she climbed onto the bus, Courtney saw Annie with the two discontented girls from the cafeteria. They stood in a tight circle talking. No one was smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou getting on or not?\u201d the guy behind Courtney asked when she paused on the steps.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured, hurrying into the bus. As she took her seat, she looked out the side window and saw Andrew talking to Melanie. He had his arm around her waist and she was gazing up at him with wide-eyed wonder. It was enough to make Courtney puke. Leaning against the window, she closed her eyes. She\u2019d do her best to get through this year; there was no other alternative.</p><p>She had no expectations and apparently no friends.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise\u2019s disillusion came soon after school started for her grandsons. She\u2019d expected it all along, knew Maverick wouldn\u2019t be able to stay away from gambling. The entire time he\u2019d been in Seattle she\u2019d been waiting, listening, expecting the worst. If she was surprised by anything, it was that Maverick had held out as long as he did. She learned the truth the day her book club met.</p><p>\u201cYour father said he\u2019d be by to drive me to the library this afternoon,\u201d Elise told Aurora after she\u2019d waited as long as she could. Until now, Maverick had always been punctual. She\u2019d known it was a mistake to rely on him, but it had been too hard to resist. Now she had to scurry in order to make the book club meeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he has a perfectly good explanation,\u201d her daughter said, ever eager to defend her father.</p><p>Still the niggling doubts had begun to form. Maverick mysteriously disappeared for several hours once a week. He swore he hadn\u2019t been gambling, but he hadn\u2019t felt inclined to enlighten her as to where he spent his time, either. She hadn\u2019t pressed him; she knew it was because she was afraid of what she\u2019d find out.</p><p>Elise had other worries, too. Aurora had been acting differently toward Maverick. She hadn\u2019t been able to put her finger on exactly how the father-daughter relationship had changed, but it had. She\u2019d noticed it a few weeks ago\u2014whispered conversations, intercepted glances, a sense of confidences shared. Elise felt excluded, although she tried not to.</p><p>Aurora offered to drive her, but Elise declined. \u201cI\u2019ll take the bus. It\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Elise murmured. Her daughter was right about Maverick. He probably did have a credible excuse, only Elise supposed that was exactly what it would be. An excuse. A lie...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Dad\u2019ll be there to pick you up,\u201d Aurora said as she walked Elise to the front door.</p><p>She nodded, but she suspected otherwise. During the bus trip, she tried\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to forget her fears. She got off automatically and transferred to the second bus. After all these years of traveling by Metro, Elise knew the schedules as well as her own address.</p><p>She arrived late, and the meeting itself was a blur. By the time the group broke up, she knew it had been pointless to attend. She hadn\u2019t been able to concentrate, and contributed little to the discussion.</p><p>Her doubts and suspicions regarding Maverick were simply impossible to ignore. She knew his history, and yet she\u2019d so badly wanted to believe him that she\u2019d played a dangerous game of pretend. Loving him again had come so easy\u2014too easy.</p><p>On the short walk to the bus stop, she passed a number of card rooms. She passed them whenever she took this route but had never before felt even the slightest inclination to glance inside. But now the need to find Maverick consumed her. She wanted to burst into these places, slamming open the doors, hoping to catch him in his lie. But through sheer willpower, she resisted. That was a degrading thing she\u2019d done early in their marriage, dragging their infant daughter into bowling alleys and taverns, looking for Maverick. Praying she\u2019d find him before he lost the money they needed for rent.</p><p>The memories bombarded her, and when she stepped off the bus late that afternoon, she was emotionally exhausted. She wasn\u2019t surprised to see Maverick\u2019s car parked in front of the house. She made a decision then: she couldn\u2019t do this anymore.</p><p>He didn\u2019t meet her eyes when she walked in the door, which was another sure sign he\u2019d been up to no good.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cElise.\u201d He cast a look toward their daughter, who promptly left the room. \u201cI figure you and I should talk. I apologize for not being here to take you to your readers\u2019 group.\u201d He paused for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew you probably would be,\u201d she said, setting her purse on the small table in the hallway. Her throat was dry as she walked into the kitchen and took a pitcher of iced tea from the refrigerator. Hand trembling, she reached for a glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can talk about this,\u201d he said, standing not more than two feet behind her. When she glanced around, she saw that he\u2019d folded his hands like a repentant child.</p><p>She shrugged as if it was of no importance. Compared to missing their daughter\u2019s childhood\u2014missing their entire marriage, for that matter\u2014this was minor.</p><p>\u201cYou were counting on me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe bus was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Elise.\u201d He held out his hands. \u201cI hate it when you\u2019re angry with me. I\u2019m not a grade-school child who\u2019s come to you about an overdue book. I\u2019m your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-husband,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so we\u2019re divorced, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gambling this afternoon.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She knew, and she suspected that was where he\u2019d been every week, although he\u2019d denied it.</p><p>\u201cWould you listen for once?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s nothing more to be said. You made your choice all those years ago, and you\u2019ve made the same choice again. Gambling is more important than me, than our marriage, more important than anything. I\u2019m not surprised. Why should I be? It\u2019s only history repeating itself.\u201d Putting down the glass after a single swallow, she walked through the hallway to her room.</p><p>Maverick followed her, leaping back as she shut the door. Despite her anger, Elise hadn\u2019t intended to slam it in his face. She leaned her shoulder against it, feeling too weak to stand without support.</p><p>Maverick paced outside in the hallway; she could hear the sound of his footsteps. \u201cAll I ask is that you listen. Please, honey, just listen.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. He hadn\u2019t called her honey since before the divorce.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Elise. I know you don\u2019t believe that, and I don\u2019t blame you, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>The declaration was all too familiar. Unable to stop herself, she jerked open the door. \u201cI do believe you love me,\u201d she said with great calm, \u201cbut you love cards more.\u201d She watched Maverick\u2019s face twist with pain and feared it was a reflection of her own. Unable to look at him, she gently closed the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019ve got to believe me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for you.\u201d</p><p>Elise stood facing the door. That, too, was a common excuse of his. It was never for him, never about what he wanted. He\u2019d squander what little they had on the promise of more. Except that promise had almost always proved to be empty.</p><p>Granted, he\u2019d obviously made a certain amount of money through the years\u2014to meet his child support obligations, to travel\u2014but she was sure he\u2019d lost far more than he\u2019d ever won. That was the pattern with gamblers.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon I was playing poker,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about it first, but I knew you\u2019d be upset. You get this...this look and it rips me up inside. Makes me feel like I\u2019ve disappointed you again. I couldn\u2019t bear to see it.\u201d</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t stopped him, though.</p><p>\u201cI wore the socks you knit me and felt close to you the entire time I was playing. They brought me luck.\u201d</p><p>Elise wished she\u2019d given those socks to David the way she\u2019d originally intended.</p><p>\u201cI won the tournament, Elise,\u201d he said triumphantly.</p><p>She refused to answer him. Winning was possibly the worst thing that could\u2019ve happened. It only made the situation worse. Maverick would feel encouraged. He\u2019d wager more and more until he\u2019d lost everything, including his pride. In those early years, she\u2019d seen him down on his luck too many times, sick at heart, emotionally depleted.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know how much I won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my lucky socks,\u201d he shouted through the barrier of the door.</p><p>Refusing to listen, she turned on her television, blocking out anything else he had to say. She didn\u2019t notice when he left, but she checked ten minutes later and he was gone.</p><p>Aurora watched her closely as Elise entered the kitchen. She put on a fine performance, if she did say so herself. Thankfully Maverick was out of the house, but she guessed he\u2019d be back for dinner.</p><p>\u201cDad asked me to talk to you,\u201d Aurora said. Elise was setting the table for their evening meal. She included a place for Maverick; her daughter would ask too many questions if she didn\u2019t. David was in the family room reading the paper and the boys were playing in the backyard.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gambling again,\u201d Elise told her, in case Aurora hadn\u2019t figured it out.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d She was suddenly afraid that her daughter had been in on the deception.</p><p>Aurora looked at her. \u201cAs far as I know, this was the first time since he got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Aurora,\u201d Elise said frantically, clasping her daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYour father has a gambling addiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a professional gambler.\u201d Aurora\u2019s voice was unemotional. \u201cYes, I agree, he can get carried away, but he loves it.\u201d</p><p>Elise hated that her own daughter couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t recognize the problem. \u201cGambling is a disease\u2014not unlike being an alcoholic or using drugs\u2014and it\u2019s just as destructive to a marriage and a family.\u201d She wanted to remind her that Maverick\u2019s love of gambling had destroyed their own family, but she bit back the words. She\u2019d said what she needed to say.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t as bad as you make him sound,\u201d Aurora insisted.</p> <p>Not wanting to argue, Elise dropped her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s your father and you love him. I\u2019m not going to say anything against Maverick\u2014except to plead with you to open your eyes and admit the truth.\u201d</p><p>Aurora\u2019s gaze implored her. \u201cHe loves you, Mom, he really does.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cI know.\u201d Maverick did love her as much as he was able to love anyone\u2014but it wasn\u2019t enough. It hadn\u2019t been enough thirty-seven years ago and it wasn\u2019t enough now.</p><p>\u201cHe promised me he\u2019d stop as soon as this tournament is over,\u201d Aurora said.</p><p>Elise had heard all that before, too. \u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d If this wasn\u2019t so tragic, she\u2019d laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d Aurora bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing this out of love for you. To help you. That\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>Elise burst into such loud, derisive laughter that David, who\u2019d turned on the evening news, glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThen advise him not to love me so much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFurthermore, I don\u2019t want or need his help. Can\u2019t you see that\u2019s only an excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it might be best if we didn\u2019t discuss your father again.\u201d She spoke as if this had been a pleasant everyday conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d let me know when he\u2019ll be at the house, because I\u2019ll make a point of staying in my room or not being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Elise was saddened to see her daughter hurt. Aurora might be married and a mother herself, but that little-girl part of her continued to search for a happy ending. Like every child, she needed her father and craved the security of knowing that her parents loved each other.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Grandma,\u201d Luke shouted as he ran in from outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elise asked, crouching down so they were at eye level.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d he cried. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d Aurora warned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Grandpa said I could tell if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned up at her daughter. She\u2019d wondered if Aurora was holding something back, but hadn\u2019t been sure what.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa\u2019s going to the Carry Bean for a poker tournament!\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked. \u201cThe Caribbean?\u201d she asked Aurora as she straightened. Maverick had already broken his promise. One moment he swore he was through; the next, he booked his passage to play in another tournament.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>\u201cKnitting is just the best ever hobby! Creative, therapeutic, stress-busting, relaxing and rewarding, it\u2019s the perfect way to both express your creativity and to gently unwind. Make it part of your everyday life.\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>Margaret had been working a lot of hours at the shop while I made the arrangements for our mother\u2019s continuing care, since I\u2019m the one with the most experience in dealing with medical bureaucracy. I needed to get the paperwork set up at the nursing home first and then I\u2019d organize her finances so Mom could make a smooth transition to the assisted living complex we\u2019d found.</p><p>This time-consuming work gave me a new appreciation for everything my parents had gone through when I was first diagnosed with cancer. Hours of sorting through bank statements, old receipts, insurance information. Hours spent on the phone and in meetings. Hours on the computer. Hours\u2014days\u2014away from the shop. Then there was the time I spent with the real estate agent and cleaning Mom\u2019s house before we listed it. That couldn\u2019t be put off. We needed the money to finance her care.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Friday afternoon as I counted out the money from the till that I realized my gross intake for the second week of September was almost half of what it\u2019d been for any week in August. A quick check of my nightly deposits showed a substantial decrease in revenues. I\u2019d known that spending so much time away from the shop would be detrimental to business, but I had no idea it would have this much impact.</p><p>Margaret just isn\u2019t a natural salesperson, nor does she share my appreciation for yarn. I knew all that, but I couldn\u2019t ask anyone else. She\u2019s familiar with the shop and my regular customers in a way no one other than me is. And she\u2019s my sister.</p><p>While I tallied the figures again, a sense of doom came over me. I had loan payments now, and they made a significant dent in my income. I\u2019d wanted to repay the bank as quickly as possible, so I\u2019d asked for an eighteen-month payment schedule. I could always go back to request an extension, but it wouldn\u2019t look good if I had to do that after only the second payment. Although nothing was said, I had the impression this shortened loan period was one of the reasons the bank had agreed to give me the money.</p><p>I sat at my desk, feeling sick to my stomach. The summer months are usually slower, but my sales had doubled from the previous year. Now, not only did they seem to be slipping, I had a huge financial obligation to worry about. There were cost-saving options, such as decreasing orders, but I didn\u2019t want to do this. Part of my success, I believed, was that I carried a wide range of yarns from the inexpensive to the more exclusive.</p><p>I was so preoccupied with these worries that I didn\u2019t hear the knock at the shop door until the pounding grew louder. Leaping out of my chair, I hurried into the main part of the store; normally I\u2019d simply explain that we were closed, but right now I didn\u2019t feel I could turn down a single sale.</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t a customer. Brad stood at the door with his hands cupped around his face, peering inside. As soon as he saw he\u2019d gotten my attention, he backed away from the glass.</p><p>The last time we\u2019d talked had been almost a month ago. I\u2019d had brief conversations with Cody but they seemed as painful for him as they were for me. When I\u2019d talked to Cody at the end of August, his mother must have been standing close by, because he sounded tentative and cautious, almost as though he was afraid of saying the wrong thing. He hadn\u2019t called me since.</p><p>Unlocking the door, I sighed. I didn\u2019t have the physical energy or emotional resources to talk to Brad, so I decided not to allow him inside. Instead, I stood in the opening and waited.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, hoping I\u2019d found the right tone to convey my feelings.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Brad said, hands in his uniform pockets. \u201cHadn\u2019t seen you at the store in a while.\u201d</p><p>I could\u2019ve stated the obvious and told him I hadn\u2019t been at the shop more than an hour or so each day, but that seemed unnecessary. I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cMargaret said you found a place for your mom?\u201d</p><p>He made it a question. I answered as if it was. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to move her next week.\u201d If I could finish all the paperwork, arrange for all the necessary medical records, finalize the sale of Mom\u2019s house and complete my dealings with her lawyer and her bank.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I didn\u2019t want Brad\u2019s sympathy; his concern would be my undoing. I was tempted to ask about Janice, but didn\u2019t. If they were getting along well, I didn\u2019t want to hear it. At the same time, I didn\u2019t want to know if their reconciliation wasn\u2019t working out. Just then, at the end of a long day in an emotionally crowded week, I couldn\u2019t deal with another crisis. \u201cHow\u2019s Cody?\u201d It hurt my heart to ask because I missed him so much\u2014missed our talks, missed hearing about his dog and the tricks he\u2019d taught Chase. Difficult though our conversations often were, I needed them. I loved that child.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing great,\u201d he said quickly, which I suppose was Brad\u2019s way of informing me that his happy little family was flourishing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive him my love, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been worried about you,\u201d he added as he stared down at the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cWorried about me?\u201d I asked, forcing surprise into my voice. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, wearing a crooked half smile. \u201cI know you, Lydia. When you\u2019re under stress, it shows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow would you know? You haven\u2019t seen me in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have seen you\u2014I just haven\u2019t made a point of seeking you out. You\u2019re tired and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, cutting him off. I didn\u2019t need Brad Goetz to tell me what I already knew.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you out for a drink,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re dating someone else now, but this is just as friends.\u201d</p><p>Actually, I could hardly believe Margaret hadn\u2019t enlightened Brad, hadn\u2019t told him I\u2019d lied about meeting someone new. I\u2019d done that out of pride, and I regretted it.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one hard and fast rule when it comes to men,\u201d I said, smiling as I spoke. \u201cI avoid the married ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice and I are divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you or are you not reconciling?\u201d I snapped. Damn it, he couldn\u2019t have it both ways.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer at first, then muttered, \u201cJanice and I are talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, having a drink with me would be inappropriate. I appreciate the offer, Brad, but...I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Brad said goodbye rather abruptly and left. I stood in the doorway, my arms crossed, and watched him walk away, feeling empty and alone. I closed and locked the door again, then returned slowly to my office.</p><p>When someone tapped on the door ten minutes later, I half suspected Brad had come back. I turned and retraced my steps to peer through the glass.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Brad. Instead, Alix Townsend stood on the other side. She held a plate of chocolate \u00e9clairs, which guaranteed I\u2019d open the door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she greeted me cheerfully as I let her in.</p><p>I\u2019d dropped in at the charity knitting session that afternoon and she hadn\u2019t been there, so I\u2019d guessed she was working at the caf\u00e9. Her classes were usually in the morning.</p><p>\u201cI saw you and Brad talking just now. You don\u2019t have to tell me what happened unless you want to\u2014but I thought these might help.\u201d</p> <p>I hid a smile. Brad might have succeeded in getting past my threshold if he\u2019d brought chocolate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any worries a chocolate \u00e9clair won\u2019t cure,\u201d I said, leading the way to the office. \u201cI\u2019ve got coffee on, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a cup.\u201d Alix followed me into my tiny office, where she settled on a corner of my desk, moving papers aside and making herself at home. I didn\u2019t mind. That was Alix\u2014why sit on a chair if there was a desk? Why walk if you could run? I loved her exuberance, her loyalty and her frequently unconventional behavior.</p><p>I poured her a mug and felt slightly guilty because it looked so dark. I hoped it wasn\u2019t bitter.</p><p>\u201cSo Brad came to see you,\u201d she said, unable to hide her curiosity, after all.</p><p>In retrospect, my attitude toward him seemed coldhearted. Unkind. Part of me wanted to call him back, to begin the conversation all over again. I wouldn\u2019t, though. Leaving things as they were was for the best. \u201cLydia?\u201d Alix asked. She reached out to touch me.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything happening?\u201d Although she\u2019d brought the \u00e9clairs for me, Alix scooped one off the plate and took a bite. When the custard filling oozed out from the sides, she grabbed a tissue from the box on my desk.</p><p>\u201cNothing really. How about with you and Jordan?\u201d</p><p>Alix raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d She picked up the plate and offered me an \u00e9clair.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need a second invitation. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to talk about Brad, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk about you, either,\u201d Alix informed me. \u201cHe makes a delivery to the caf\u00e9 every now and then, and he\u2019s his old chatty self until I mention your name. Then he shuts up tighter than a coffin.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the image. \u201cWe both have our reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d She hopped down from the desk. \u201cGotta go. Jordan and I are seeing a movie with the youth group tonight. I just thought I\u2019d come over and say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d I said. I walked her to the door, unlocking it and letting her out. As soon as she was gone, I relocked the door, found Whiskers waiting for me and headed up the stairs to my apartment\u2014first remembering to turn off the lights and retrieve Alix\u2019s plate. I could\u2019ve been having a drink with Brad, I mused nostalgically, but for emotional protection, I\u2019d decided on my own company. I\u2019d spend the night with my television, my cat and my \u00e9clairs.</p><p>Whiskers meowed as though to remind me I wasn\u2019t alone. He was absolutely right.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>Bethanne had three parties scheduled that week and she\u2019d carefully gone over the budget for each. Finances would be tight until her alimony check arrived and she received full payment for the parties. Paying for all her supplies out of her dwindling checking account meant she\u2019d have very little cash until the weekend, which meant, in turn, that she\u2019d have to delay buying groceries. She didn\u2019t dare use her VISA to buy party stuff; she\u2019d reached her credit limit. Still, she could manage until she deposited the various checks. The problem was, she found herself writing checks and hoping they wouldn\u2019t clear for a few days. It was a complicated balancing act, since her expenses still exceeded her income.</p><p>Unfortunately, Annie and Andrew constantly needed money for one thing or another. Their school expenses were legitimate and she couldn\u2019t defer them. These amounts, plus household bills and business costs\u2014a balancing act, indeed.</p><p>The phone rang, and although she hoped it was another party booking, Caller ID showed that it was her bank. She grabbed the receiver, praying that somehow the loan officer had recognized the error of his ways and was calling to offer her a loan.</p><p>A few years ago, Grant had taken her to Vegas and they\u2019d brought travelers\u2019 checks that equaled more than what she wanted to borrow now. Vegas? The trip was a complete surprise and Bethanne had been so pleased and excited. In light of what she\u2019d learned since, she suspected Grant had arranged it out of guilt.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered in her most cheerful voice. \u201cThis is Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>Her smile quickly died as the bank manager explained that a check she\u2019d written to the local service station had bounced. In the past, the bank had provided overdraft protection, for a fee, to cover small amounts, but wouldn\u2019t any longer. In addition, the service station charged a seventy-five-dollar fee for bounced checks.</p><p>\u201cSeventy-five dollars,\u201d she cried, outraged at the unnecessary expense. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...much is this going to cost me?\u201d A tank of gas was normally about twenty-five dollars; now there were bank fees, penalties and the seventy-five bucks the service station had heaped on.</p><p>The total was staggering. \u201cHow much?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWhen would it be convenient for you to make a deposit?\u201d the bank manager asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t have it; she simply didn\u2019t have it. The only thing left to do was take a ring or two down to the pawnshop and see what she could get. \u201cI\u2019ll bring some money this afternoon,\u201d she said meekly, feeling chastised.</p><p>The manager wasn\u2019t an ogre\u2014he was only doing his job\u2014but Bethanne was in a panic. She rushed upstairs to her jewelry box and sorted through what she had, which wasn\u2019t much.</p><p>Why, oh why, hadn\u2019t Grant given her a diamond bracelet instead of that stupid trip to Vegas? A bracelet she could cash in, but the trip had been a waste. Grant lost all the money they\u2019d taken with them. That hadn\u2019t stopped him from returning, she noted bitterly. He\u2019d married Tiffany in Vegas. Bethanne found herself hoping he\u2019d lost big\u2014in more ways than one.</p><p>This negative thinking wasn\u2019t good for her, but she felt desperate. Other than pawning her jewelry, she had very few options. Annie and Andrew had bank accounts and could probably lend her what she needed. She supposed that was better than asking Grant. But...she couldn\u2019t do either of those things. The bank could repossess the house before she\u2019d approach her ex-husband for another dime. Asking family, especially her kids, or her friends was out of the question. She had her pride\u2014and, apparently, very little else.</p><p>After much deliberation, Bethanne chose her wedding band\u2014it wasn\u2019t doing her any good in a jewelry box\u2014and a small sapphire ring, plus a pair of gold earrings. Surely that would give her enough to at least cover the check, the fees and the penalties.</p><p>She was sickened by how little money she got for all three, but it was enough to pay the necessary minimum at the bank. This had been a valuable lesson. She couldn\u2019t write checks for money she didn\u2019t have, no matter how soon she\u2019d have it.</p><p>As she walked out of the bank, she nearly collided with her ex-husband in the parking lot. Her face instantly went beet-red, as though Grant could read on her forehead the reason for her visit.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d Grant said, taking her by the shoulders in order to steady her.</p><p>\u201cGrant.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. \u201cHi...I was just\u2014\u201d She closed her mouth, refusing to embarrass herself. This wasn\u2019t his concern.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d he said, stepping back to admire her.</p><p>The new hairstyle had been an extravagance she regretted. Annie and Courtney had talked her into it. The stylist had done wonders with her hair and suggested she color it. When Bethanne explained she couldn\u2019t possibly afford that, the two girls had insisted they could do it.</p><p>They\u2019d selected one of the more expensive brands\u2014another ten bucks\u2014in a deep brunette with auburn overtones. Considering that she\u2019d put herself in the hands of teenagers, it\u2019d turned out surprisingly well.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Bethanne said casually.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Grant asked.</p><p>As if that was any of his business. \u201cMaking a deposit. What about you?\u201d He didn\u2019t need to know the details, but at least she\u2019d told him the truth.</p><p>\u201cA withdrawal,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t sound too happy about it. \u201cSwitching money from savings to checking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor little ol\u2019 me?\u201d she asked in her most saccharine drawl.</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cCould it be that your new wife is straining your finances?\u201d she asked, not hiding the gleam in her eyes.</p><p>Grant snickered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound like he was joking, which should\u2019ve pleased her, but Bethanne was bothered by the dark circles under his eyes. \u201cIs everything okay with you, Grant?\u201d she asked. His well-being no longer had anything to do with her, and yet she couldn\u2019t prevent the automatic rush of concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould it make you happy if I said it wasn\u2019t?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to answer. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m blissfully happy.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne hadn\u2019t realized what a poor liar he was and wondered why she hadn\u2019t seen through him during the years he\u2019d been having that affair. She supposed it was because she hadn\u2019t wanted to know. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grant,\u201d she said. She was sincere.</p><p>He shrugged in an offhand way.</p><p>It was ironic, really, that they\u2019d have their first decent conversation in a parking lot months after their divorce.</p> <p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the relationship with the Boy Toy?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr is it the Toy Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Paul?\u201d she said sharply. So much for decent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother us that I\u2019m older, anymore than it bothers you that Tiffany\u2019s fifteen years younger,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, I can see anyone I choose. You didn\u2019t want to be married to me, and Tiffany didn\u2019t want to be with Paul. He and I have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got the new hairstyle for him, didn\u2019t you? Are you trying to look younger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back to the house,\u201d she said, eager to leave. She thought of mentioning the Homecoming Dance at the end of the month but decided against it. Grant would learn soon enough that their son had been voted part of the Homecoming Court.</p><p>Grant nodded, hands in his pants pockets. \u201cIt was good to see you, Bethanne.\u201d He offered her a slight smile. \u201cI do mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It was good seeing you, too.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne started toward her car, but stopped to look back. Grant was still standing in the same spot, staring after her.</p><p>She almost gave him a friendly wave. She didn\u2019t wish her ex-husband ill. Okay, sometimes she did, but she\u2019d also made real progress toward forgiveness this summer.</p><p>She hated being alone, but in reality nothing had changed. Grant might\u2019ve been living at the house two years ago and sharing her bed, but he\u2019d been emotionally involved with another woman. And that meant he hadn\u2019t been fully committed to his family\u2014as he\u2019d proven since.</p> <p>Yes, her financial situation was uncomfortable, but she was a fast learner. Yes, she was bound to make mistakes, but she had a new life and a good friend in Paul. She was close to her children.</p><p>The odd man out was Grant, who seemed to have some regrets. He\u2019d hinted at it, then claimed, rather unconvincingly, that he was happy. She doubted he\u2019d tell her the truth.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>Courtney hadn\u2019t heard from her father in a week. She was growing frightened; that just wasn\u2019t like him. He might go a day or two without e-mailing her, but never a week. While Ralph Pulanski, Jr. had been silent, the e-mails had flown between Courtney, her sister and their older brother. They were as worried as she was. The three of them clung to each other.</p><p>Courtney hid her fears from her grandmother as much as she could. Grams was doing a lot of knitting these days\u2014to comfort herself, Courtney figured. Mostly she and Grams said reassuring things to each other, like \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine,\u201d and \u201cMaybe his computer broke down.\u201d</p><p>Jason had tried to reach their father through the construction company that employed him, but he\u2019d learned nothing concrete. According to the executive Jason had talked to, the area was known to be secure and there was no reason for alarm. The company would try to get in touch with him; that was as much as they\u2019d promise at this point.</p><p>Julianna, who was back at school and on a tight budget, broke down and phoned Courtney. They talked for twenty minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI miss you so much,\u201d Courtney told her sister, struggling not to weep. She clutched the telephone receiver to her ear, as if that would bring Julianna closer.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d</p><p>Her sister would ask. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Courtney tried to brush off the question because they had bigger concerns than her inability to make friends, other than Annie Hamlin, and her sense of being alone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that,\u201d Julianna said sternly in a voice so like their mother\u2019s that it took Courtney\u2019s breath away. \u201cI want to know how you\u2019re really doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful.\u201d It was the truth. \u201cI thought if I lost weight I\u2019d be instantly popular,\u201d Courtney confessed. \u201cI thought boys would be asking for my phone number, but it isn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d Of course, there was only one boy who interested her, and that was Andrew Hamlin. Unfortunately, he had a long-standing girlfriend.</p><p>Annie claimed Melanie was living in a dreamworld, and Andrew was no more going steady with her than he was with Britney Spears. The evidence, which Courtney had seen for herself, said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five pounds is a lot to lose, and I\u2019m proud of you. You feel better, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealth-wise, you mean? Yeah, I guess.\u201d She did feel better now that those pounds were off. She, too, was proud of that accomplishment, but she\u2019d hoped for certain things that hadn\u2019t come to pass. In fact, everything remained exactly as it was before. When you came right down to it, all that had changed was the number on Grams\u2019s antique scale. Oh, and some of her pants were looser around the waist.</p><p>\u201cCall if you need me,\u201d Julianna said. \u201cI mean it, Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Keep in touch about Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d her sister promised.</p><p>Courtney was grateful for her sister\u2019s call. She wished they could talk regularly. Although Julianna was older and had been away from home for nearly three years, she was close to their dad. Caught up in her own woes, Courtney hadn\u2019t spent enough time considering her sister\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Wednesday morning, eight days since her last communication with her father, Courtney didn\u2019t feel like going to school. Grams said she understood, but encouraged Courtney to go anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t resolve anything sitting by the phone all day,\u201d Grams said with perfect logic.</p><p>After sleeping fitfully for two nights, Courtney had hoped to rest, but she knew her grandmother was right. While she might not have made a lot of friends yet, she was better off at school than hanging around at home, waiting and worrying.</p><p>Mike, Andrew\u2019s friend, picked her up to drive her to school. Courtney paid him ten dollars a week and appreciated not having to take the bus. The only problem was Mike himself, who seemed inordinately shy. He rarely said a word, either on the way to school or on the way home. At first she\u2019d tried to carry the conversation, but after a week of minimal responses, she\u2019d given up.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you know it? This was the morning Mike discovered he had a tongue.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from your dad?\u201d he asked as she climbed into his fifteen-year-old Honda.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to be sarcastic, but that was a stupid question if she\u2019d ever heard one.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re worried,\u201d he concluded.</p><p>Courtney closed her eyes and leaned her head against the passenger window, just praying there\u2019d be an e-mail from her father when she got home from school.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for the English test?\u201d he asked next.</p><p>She straightened abruptly. \u201cThere\u2019s a test?\u201d Preoccupied as she\u2019d been with her father, she hadn\u2019t paid attention. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. Perhaps if she showed up at the office and claimed she had the flu, they\u2019d believe her and let her go home.</p><p>Home. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t think of her grandmother\u2019s place as home. It was Grams\u2019s house, not hers.</p><p>Mike parked and they walked wordlessly into the school. Once in the building, they went their separate ways, Mike to the left and Courtney to the right. She had, at best, five minutes to leaf through her book of poems and her English notes before the bell rang. Dickinson. Whitman. Who else?</p><p>She stood outside her homeroom, leaning against the wall, as she flipped desperately from one page to the next.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Andrew sidled up to her, books under his arm.</p><p>Surprised, Courtney nearly dropped her own book. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize we had a test today,\u201d she declared, her nose in the book as she tried to take in as much information as possible.</p><p>\u201cIn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish\u2014poetry. Nineteenth-century American. I think.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to know about it, either.</p><p>\u201cMike told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cHe\u2019s in regular Senior English, we\u2019re Honors. Mr. Hazelton didn\u2019t mention a test. I don\u2019t even think we\u2019re studying the same material.\u201d</p><p>A wave of relief washed over her. \u201cThank you, God.\u201d She raised her head toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd they say school prayer is dead,\u201d Andrew teased.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They stood there for a few minutes before going to their homerooms. Rather than discuss her worries about her father, Courtney merely shrugged. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>What a dumb question. She realized it as soon as the words were out of her mouth. Andrew had just been named part of the Homecoming Court, exactly as Shelly had predicted. As head cheerleader, Melanie had also been a nominee. On the afternoon before the big game, the king and queen would be chosen at a school assembly. Again according to Shelly, Melanie and Andrew would take the prize.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Andrew said. He didn\u2019t seem that excited about his nomination. \u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still missing,\u201d Courtney blurted out. She couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. \u201cAndrew, I\u2019m so worried! I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if something happened to my dad.\u201d Tears sprang to her eyes and she tried to hide them by staring down at the floor.</p><p>To her shock, he placed his arm around her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she cried, sobbing openly now. \u201cI need my father.\u201d He, more than anyone, held the family together. He was her father and she\u2019d already lost her mother, and if her father was dead she couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She looked up at him with wet eyes, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happened to my mother,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\u2019d feel just like you do right now, but I will tell you this. No matter what happens, you\u2019ll find your way through it. Isn\u2019t that what you told Annie?\u201d</p><p>Courtney sniffed and nodded. She grabbed a tissue from her purse and blew her nose, embarrassed by all the attention they\u2019d attracted. It didn\u2019t seem to bother Andrew, though, and she pretended it didn\u2019t bother her, either.</p><p>\u201cThat was good advice,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cAnnie was close to losing it when you signed up for that knitting class with my mom. I\u2019m so glad you did, because she needed a friend. She\u2019s still got a few problems, but she\u2019s so much better now, thanks to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Courtney was too stunned to respond.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t thank you properly, but maybe I can help you with your dad. Do you think it\u2019d be all right if I came to your grandmother\u2019s house after football practice?\u201d</p><p>It required a monumental effort to simply nod. The final bell rang for homeroom.</p><p>\u201cGotta go,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cSee you later.\u201d He hurried down the hall.</p> <p>Courtney dashed into her own classroom, marveling that one person could experience so many emotions in such a short time.</p><p>As soon as Mike dropped her off at Grams\u2019s after school, Courtney raced upstairs to her computer and logged on.</p><p>\u201cAny word?\u201d her grandmother shouted from the foot of the stairs.</p><p>Her heart fell when she hurriedly scanned her in-box. Nothing from her father. \u201cNo,\u201d she called back, dispirited.</p><p>The phone rang and normally Courtney would\u2019ve answered it, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk to anyone. Not even Andrew. Despite what she\u2019d said about getting through whatever you had to, she didn\u2019t think she could. She couldn\u2019t lose her father. There weren\u2019t enough chocolate chip cookies or skeins of yarn or comforting words to see her through that.</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes, of course, I\u2019ll get her right away.\u201d She could hear her grandmother\u2019s voice. \u201cCourtney, phone,\u201d she yelled even as Courtney walked down the stairs. \u201cSomeone wants to talk to you.\u201d Smiling, she held out the receiver.</p><p>The minute Courtney heard her father, she burst into tears of joy. The phone connection wasn\u2019t the greatest as her dad poured out his story of being stranded in the jungle for five days with no way to get in touch. There\u2019d been torrential rains while they were surveying but he was safe. He was sorry to have caused his family so much worry.</p><p>The tears had yet to dry on her cheeks when Andrew arrived. Courtney was on the phone with Julianna and had just finished talking to Jason.</p><p>\u201cI have company and I need to go,\u201d she told her sister, glancing self-consciously at Andrew. He stood awkwardly in the living room, being fussed over by Grams.</p><p>\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d Julianna pressed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a B,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed. It was clear she\u2019d told her sister far more than she should have.</p><p>\u201cThen get off the phone and entertain your company,\u201d Julianna teased.</p><p>Grams was a gracious hostess. She\u2019d seated Andrew on the sofa and chatted away with him as though he was a longtime family friend.</p><p>Courtney walked shyly into the room, and Grams smiled over at her. \u201cI was just telling Andrew that you heard from your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to my sister.\u201d Embarrassed, she pointed to the ancient black phone at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIs this the young man you mentioned?\u201d Grams asked, lowering her voice as if Andrew couldn\u2019t hear the question. \u201cThe one you\u2019re knitting the socks for?\u201d</p><p>Courtney wished she could snap her fingers and vanish, like the witch on that old TV series Grams sometimes watched. Her face felt hot and she glared at her grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cShe knit a lovely pair for her dad,\u201d her grandmother was saying. \u201cThose were navy blue, but these are green and\u2014\u201d She looked quizzically at Courtney. \u201cOh, dear, was that supposed to be a surprise?\u201d Getting up with uncharacteristic agility, Grams scurried to the kitchen.</p><p>Andrew stood, his eyes holding hers. \u201cYou\u2019re knitting me socks?\u201d</p><p>Courtney nodded. \u201cI\u2019m just finishing up the gusset on the second one, but it\u2019s nearly done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the coolest thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me. It\u2019s really...sweet.\u201d</p><p>Sweet. He thought of her as sweet. That was the last thing Courtney wanted.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s invitation to visit was a welcome reprieve in the middle of Elise\u2019s week. Bethanne had asked if she\u2019d help check her budget. Elise was no expert, but she was willing to do what she could. She was also grateful for an excuse to get out of the house.</p><p>Neither Aurora nor David ever mentioned Maverick in her presence. Unfortunately her grandsons, oblivious to the tension between their estranged grandparents, dragged his name into practically every conversation. Maverick was playing in some poker game in the Carry Bean, as the boys called it. She wished him well, but she couldn\u2019t be part of his life. Their second attempt at being a couple was as much of a failure as the first. No, it was over for good.</p><p>The bus dropped her off a block from Bethanne\u2019s. She liked the other woman and found that they had more in common than anyone might expect. As divorced mothers, they\u2019d been left to deal with the children and the house and everything else. Well, no need to dwell on that old history now, she decided.</p><p>The Hamlins\u2019 neighborhood was a busy one, and the house itself was charming. Elise walked up the steps and rang the doorbell, admiring the garden as she did. She\u2019d just leaned over to take a closer look at a huge, coppery chrysanthemum when a smiling Bethanne opened the door. A pot of tea and a plate of brownies waited on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this,\u201d Bethanne said, handing over a spiral notebook. \u201cI asked you because this whole party business was your idea and...well, because you seem so clear-headed and sensible to me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve gone over these figures a dozen times and after a while, everything starts to blur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had listed her monthly expenses in one column and the total alimony and child support she received from Grant in another. On a separate page, she\u2019d set out the anticipated income from the parties she\u2019d booked, including the deposits already paid, and the costs for each.</p><p>Elise looked over all the lists and glanced up to see Bethanne watching her. \u201cYou need to charge more for your parties,\u201d she said decisively. Before Bethanne could protest, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your hourly wage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I just add twenty percent to the cost of each party and that\u2019s what I charge.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not near enough. Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re putting your creative genius behind each event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreative genius,\u201d Bethanne repeated. \u201cOh, I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Elise refused to diminish Bethanne\u2019s talent. \u201cYou\u2019re offering something unique. No party is like any other. Each one\u2019s exclusively designed around the child\u2019s interests. But if you feel you might be pricing yourself out of a job...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she murmured. \u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to pay me an outrageous fee on top of all their other expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen standardize the parties. Make up a list of your favorites, the ones you\u2019ve already created, and offer those when people call to inquire. Establish a price for each one, and give them the option of a standard party or a customized one.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOf course...of course. I should\u2019ve thought of that.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI can buy supplies in bulk and save money that way, too. Not to mention time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might also contract with a local bakery, for the cakes.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other and both spoke at the same moment. \u201cAlix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d Elise repeated, \u201cwould be perfect. Plus she\u2019d be bringing business into the French Caf\u00e9 and that\u2019s a feather in her cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous.\u201d Bethanne jumped up and gave Elise an impulsive hug. \u201cThank you, thank you, Elise. You\u2019re the real genius here.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled with pleasure. Before she left, she reminded Bethanne to pay herself better. \u201cStart with twenty dollars an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your hours should include your preparation time, plus cleanup and driving.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne promised she would.</p><p>Later, on the bus ride home, Elise felt the satisfaction of having helped a friend. But it wasn\u2019t a one-way street by any means; she\u2019d learned from Bethanne too. The younger woman\u2019s lack of bitterness and anger toward Grant impressed her. When Elise had commented on her calm acceptance, Bethanne said she considered it a gift that had come to her because of the divorce.</p><p>In Elise\u2019s view, divorce didn\u2019t mean anything except gut-wrenching emotional agony. But Bethanne had found nuggets of wisdom buried in the pain and suffering Grant\u2019s betrayal had brought into her life.</p><p>When Elise entered the house, she thought no one was home. Then she heard the sound of the television. Since it was a bright, sunny afternoon, she couldn\u2019t imagine why the entire family would be staring at the TV.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, as she stood just inside the family room.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Luke beckoned her in. \u201cGrandpa\u2019s on TV,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Aurora glanced over her shoulder. \u201cSit with me. Dad\u2019s playing poker on national TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Elise whirled around so fast, she nearly lost her balance. Television or not, it didn\u2019t matter. Gambling was gambling. There\u2019d be no stopping Maverick now that he\u2019d made it all the way to national television. He\u2019d live on that high for months to come, thinking he was invincible\u2014that he couldn\u2019t lose.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d A short time later, Aurora tapped gently on her bedroom door. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Elise was determined to say something about allowing the children to...to admire their grandfather when it was obvious he had a problem.</p><p>\u201cYou looked upset when you got home.\u201d</p><p>Elise had made no effort to hide her feelings, but the entire family had been so absorbed in watching Maverick that it surprised her anyone had noticed.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if we didn\u2019t discuss your father.\u201d She\u2019d said this before and needed to say it again. Only a couple of hours earlier she\u2019d marveled at Bethanne\u2019s attitude toward Grant. Elise wanted to find that same kind of peace with Maverick, and hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Aurora sat on the edge of Elise\u2019s bed. \u201cI think we should discuss Dad one last time.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s nod was reluctant.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know if he won or lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She reached for her knitting, needing something to occupy her hands.</p><p>\u201cHe wore his lucky socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as luck.\u201d Aurora was more like her father than Elise had known. \u201cThey\u2019re simply hand-knit socks,\u201d she said, more sharply than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cDad didn\u2019t want you to know.\u201d Her daughter spoke in a voice so low Elise had to strain to hear.</p><p>Frowning, she paused in her knitting and raised her head. \u201cKnow what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Aurora clasped her hands together and stared down at the carpet. \u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a rare form of leukemia. Don\u2019t ask me to repeat the medical name, because I don\u2019t know if I can even pronounce it. Those afternoons he was away? He was going in for blood transfusions. He only has about a year left. Two years possibly, but no one\u2019s placing any bets.\u201d She smiled sadly when she realized what she\u2019d said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDying?\u201d It felt as if Elise\u2019s heart had stopped beating.</p><p>\u201cHe came to Seattle because he wanted to get to know me and the family while he still could.\u201d Tears shone in her eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t gamble until that one day, when he entered the poker competition. He swore to me he hadn\u2019t, and I believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did he do it then?\u201d Elise demanded. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me it was for my sake, because I refuse to believe it.\u201d</p><p>Aurora shook her head as if she didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDying,\u201d Elise repeated slowly. Everything became very clear to her in those few moments. Her mind scanned the last months. She should\u2019ve understood that something was wrong; in his whole life, Maverick had never been content to sit and do nothing, yet he\u2019d spent hours sitting in the car, waiting for her. She\u2019d accepted that without question, as she had his sudden need to see his daughter.</p><p>\u201cA year...\u201d</p><p>Aurora nodded. \u201cHe loves you, Mom. He\u2019s told me that a dozen times, and I know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Elise swallowed the thickness in her throat. \u201cI love him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>Without invitation Luke wandered into the bedroom, feet dragging. He fell into his mother\u2019s lap, sighing dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cGrandpa lost.\u201d</p><p>Elise stretched out her arms to her grandson, and Luke slid away from his mother and walked over to her. Holding the boy close, she shut her eyes and mused that her ex-husband was no luckier in cards than he was in life.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p> <p>On a Friday evening in mid-September, when both Andrew and Annie were busy with school activities, Paul phoned and suggested a movie. Bethanne agreed, although he wanted to see a fast-paced action-adventure she normally wouldn\u2019t have chosen. Whenever there were violent scenes Bethanne had to close her eyes. But every time the hero seemed to be facing certain death, he managed to escape. Still, the loud pounding music heightened her anxiety. Could things possibly end well?</p><p>During a brief lull in the action, she thought about Grant. She hadn\u2019t told Paul\u2014or anyone\u2014that she\u2019d run into him in the bank parking lot. The episode had an almost unreal quality to it.</p><p>Bethanne realized with a sense of something approaching sorrow that the affair\u2014and the divorce\u2014had cost him dearly. His children were, for all intents and purposes, estranged from him. Annie talked to her father now and then, but her attitude was more insolent than it should have been. Andrew was still refusing to have much to do with him, despite a couple of attempts by his father to patch up the relationship. Bethanne hoped that in time Andrew would find it in his heart to forgive Grant.</p><p>Bethanne experienced a familiar sadness over the loss of her marriage. Grant had changed, but she didn\u2019t know when those changes had taken place, hadn\u2019t even recognized what was happening. The man he was now wasn\u2019t the man she\u2019d married or the husband who\u2019d stayed with her in the labor room and walked the floors when the children were sick. Perhaps she\u2019d contributed to whatever went wrong. That wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d been willing to acknowledge before. Caught up in her own small world, involved with their children, perhaps Bethanne hadn\u2019t paid enough attention to her marriage. Eventually she and Grant had become strangers to each other.</p><p>Glancing over at Paul, she discovered he was studying her instead of watching the screen. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded, but could tell he didn\u2019t believe her. They went for coffee following the movie\u2014which did end happily. At least the hero had survived.</p><p>They sat across from each other in a booth at Denny\u2019s, and the waitress smiled admiringly at Paul as she brought their coffee. There was a lot to admire, to find attractive about him. The waitress\u2019s smile clarified what Bethanne had been feeling lately.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be deep in thought,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Paul asked absently as he reached for a sugar packet. He looked up as he stirred it into his coffee.</p><p>She shrugged and experienced a brief surge of sadness. \u201cYou\u2019re not dating anyone, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cNo. I mean, we\u2019re not dating. We\u2019re seeing each other as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the frown? I thought that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem, Paul.\u201d She decided to be direct. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to rely on each other. I consider you safe and I\u2019m fairly sure you feel the same way about me.\u201d</p><p>He seemed about to argue with her, but had the good sense to wait.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something soon, there\u2019s a danger of us becoming so emotionally dependent, we\u2019ll pass up other opportunities, with other people.\u201d Although she made it sound like a possibility, Bethanne feared it was already a reality, especially for him. \u201cI don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either,\u201d he agreed, but with reluctance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we went out into the dating world without training wheels.\u201d Bethanne tried to make a joke of it. She wished she\u2019d thought this through more carefully.</p><p>The waitress refilled their coffee and Paul reached for his, sipping it pensively. \u201cIs there someone you want to get involved with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but this isn\u2019t about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it about? I don\u2019t understand, Bethanne. I hoped\u2014I hoped we could become more than friends, damn it,\u201d he said, sounding frustrated. \u201cI was afraid of this. You\u2019re worried about the age difference, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014okay, a little, but that\u2019s not the point. Much as I care about you, I don\u2019t think our relationship is emotionally healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to repeat everything she\u2019d already said. \u201cLet\u2019s stop relying on each other for a while. I\u2019m not doing you any favors. You should be seeing other women, finding someone who can be everything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that,\u201d he argued. \u201cYou\u2019re the one person who understood how I felt when Tiffany left me. We\u2019re the injured parties, and it\u2019s only natural that we\u2019d have a lot in common. Now you\u2019re saying we should walk away from all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not explaining myself well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. I\u2019m getting the message loud and clear. You want us to stop seeing each other but I don\u2019t understand why, especially now. It\u2019s...it\u2019s like before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Tiffany!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do I have this knot in my gut? Why do I feel the same things I did when she told me she was in love with another man? This is just another rejection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d She\u2019d done a terrible job of conveying her feelings. \u201cI want us to stay friends. I also want you to get out there and date someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you, too. But I think we should stop seeing each other for a while.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and reached across the table to squeeze his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful man, Paul, and I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me. But it\u2019s time for us to let go a little. To explore relationships with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a rejection?\u201d he asked sardonically. \u201cIt sure as hell sounds like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing more independent doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t talk or give each other emotional support. I want us to have a healthy relationship. I want us to be real friends.\u201d Bethanne glanced around the Denny\u2019s, afraid their conversation was entertainment for half the restaurant. She leaned toward him. \u201cI want you to date a wonderful woman who\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was you.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how easy it would be to fall in love with you. I\u2019m halfway there already.\u201d</p><p>Her words obviously pleased him, as some of the intensity left his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy conscience,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m not the right woman for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be the judge of that,\u201d he said again, just as stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, there\u2019s a corollary.\u201d</p><p>He scowled, then slowly said, \u201cIn other words, I\u2019m not the right man for you, either.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI should\u2019ve said something earlier, but I didn\u2019t have the courage to let you go. Your friendship\u2019s been really important to me.\u201d She paused to take a deep breath. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll find a woman you\u2019ll have children with. You\u2019ll make a terrific father.\u201d Both Andrew and Annie, who\u2019d met him a number of times, thought the world of him.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I still plan to see you. And call you.\u201d He would, too, especially at first, but when he opened his eyes to other relationships those calls would probably become farther apart. If that happened, it would be hard.</p><p>\u201cYou were absolutely wonderful for my self-esteem,\u201d she told him, feeling almost tearful. \u201cAfter Grant left, I was convinced no man would ever find me attractive again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, then added softly, sweetly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you see other men?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going out into the great unknown all by myself.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne managed a smile.</p><p>\u201cI imagine that, given time, I will,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready just yet.\u201d She\u2019d take it slow, get on her feet financially, build her business. That was her first priority, aside from taking care of her children. One thing she\u2019d learned through all of this was that she didn\u2019t need a man in her life. After twenty years as Grant\u2019s wife, she was finding her own identity. That might be a clich\u00e9 these days, but like all clich\u00e9s it was based in truth.</p><p>Part of that new identity was seeing herself as a business-woman. Two days earlier, she\u2019d been contacted by a friend of a friend who wanted to know if Bethanne did catering. She didn\u2019t, but she knew someone who did. That conversation gave her an idea. Bethanne was good at organizing parties and social events. So far, all she\u2019d booked were children\u2019s birthday parties, but she wanted to expand, do more, connect with other professionals. The possibilities were endless and would be beneficial for all concerned. She might even end up becoming a wedding consultant. What was a wedding except one big party?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll date someone else if you will too,\u201d Paul agreed after a lengthy silence.</p><p>That was all the assurance Bethanne needed. \u201cI think that would be wise for us both.\u201d</p><p>Like a youngster with an assignment, Paul propped his elbows on the table and said, \u201cAny suggestions where to start?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smothered a giggle. \u201cWhat about your office?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cEveryone there\u2019s already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet someone you know has offered to set you up with a blind date.\u201d</p><p>Paul dismissed that idea with a shake of his head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t blame him. \u201cI saw one of those decorator pillows once that read I\u2019ve had so many blind dates I need a Seeing Eye dog.\u201d</p> <p>They both laughed, but Paul quickly sobered. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to find anyone who can make me laugh the way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, try,\u201d she challenged, rather than allowing the compliment to sway her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhen you decide you\u2019re ready, where are you planning to meet single men? Clubs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hardly,\u201d she said, dismissing his comment with a wave of her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t have the shoes for it.\u201d He laughed, as she\u2019d wanted him to. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my eyes and ears open. Eventually I\u2019ll meet someone, through a friend or my business or just by chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t looking now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should.\u201d His smile was infectious. He turned, craning his neck to take a good look around the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cPaul! You\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d he teased. \u201cWhat about that guy over there\u2014the one with the baseball cap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, stop it,\u201d she hissed, keeping her voice low. \u201cStop it right this minute. Unless you want me to introduce you to a couple of women.\u201d Turnabout was fair play, so she caught their waitress\u2019s eye. The young woman picked up a coffeepot and brought it over to their table. Her badge said her name was Cindy.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cindy,\u201d Bethanne said warmly. \u201cThis is Paul. He\u2019s single and available.\u201d</p> <p>Cindy smiled shyly in Paul\u2019s direction and added a quarter inch of coffee to their mugs.</p><p>\u201cWould you be interested in dating a man like Paul?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d</p><p>Cindy had proven Bethanne\u2019s point. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d she cried triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cCindy, what are you doing tomorrow after five?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Disappointment flashed in her eyes. \u201cWorking, but I get off at nine.\u201d</p><p>Soon Paul and Cindy were discussing where they\u2019d go.</p><p>She left, smiling, and Paul leaned closer. \u201cI want a contingency plan. I\u2019ll do as you suggest, but if it doesn\u2019t work out, I want you to know I\u2019m coming back for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she chastised, and then just gave in. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He grinned and lifted his mug in silent salute.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>\u201cI do love a good yarn, fiction and fiber. The only thing that equals my joy in knitting is the pleasure of reading!\u201d</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I visited Mom Sunday afternoon, and it was such a lovely autumn day that it seemed pointless to go back to an empty apartment. Sundays were the hardest for me. This particular Sunday, for some reason, felt lonelier than most. My love for Whiskers can take me only so far.</p><p>Mom looked better than she had in months, and seeing her smile cheered me considerably. Leaving her home of nearly fifty years must have been painful. I was grateful she\u2019d accepted the upheaval in her life without an argument. After two weeks in a nursing home, the assisted living facility probably seemed like an extended vacation.</p><p>I think Mom understood, once she entered the hospital, that everything would change from that moment on. I could tell she was grateful to have less responsibility, although I don\u2019t expect she\u2019ll ever admit it. I know she missed her rose garden; I did, too.</p><p>We had lunch together in the dining room, and she introduced me to her new friends. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her I\u2019d already met Ida and Francine last week and the week before that, too. Interestingly enough, Ida and Francine don\u2019t appear to remember me, either.</p><p>Before leaving work on Friday evening, Margaret had invited me over for Sunday dinner but I\u2019d declined. We see each other nearly every day and frankly, as much as I love my sister, I needed a break. I think she felt the same way since she readily accepted my explanation of \u201cother plans.\u201d</p><p>A number of subtle and not-so-subtle changes had taken place in the relationship between my sister and me. Margaret was knitting more, and I\u2019d begun crocheting. It was almost as if we were both anxious to prove our willingness to see the other\u2019s point of view.</p><p>With Sunday afternoon stretching before me, I drove to Green Lake. I\u2019d missed walking the three-mile path around the lake with Brad and Cody and Chase. A dozen times or more, I\u2019d stopped myself from driving there, but I decided not to stay away any longer. If Brad and Janice were on the path, I\u2019d smile and greet them and simply keep going. Physical exercise is good for me and I refused to be deprived of an enjoyable walk just because there was a chance of an awkward encounter. I\u2019d have to deal with it\u2014and so would Brad.</p><p>It was a perfect day with the leaves just starting to turn and a light breeze coming off the water. I changed into my tennis shoes in the parking lot and stowed my purse in the trunk of my car. Carrying my car keys, I headed down the path.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t gone more than a quarter of a mile when a golden retriever shot past me, dragging his leash. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t quick enough or alert enough to grab it. Somebody would be frantic about this runaway dog. For an instant I thought it was Chase, Cody\u2019s dog, but it couldn\u2019t be. Chase wasn\u2019t that big. But within a few seconds, I heard Cody\u2019s voice and I knew I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cChase! Chase! Get back here.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look over my shoulder and saw that Cody was fast gaining on me. When he noticed me he halted abruptly, looked back, forward and then back again.</p><p>\u201cLydia,\u201d he shouted and ran toward me, his arms open wide.</p><p>I caught him and hugged him close.</p><p>\u201cI have to catch Chase,\u201d he said, his eyes pleading with mine.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I urged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave, okay?\u201d he pleaded, half running.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I promised, but I wasn\u2019t convinced, despite my earlier determination, that I was ready to see Brad and Janice together.</p><p>If I did come face to face with Janice, she\u2019d probably gloat. It hadn\u2019t taken me long to discover that she was completely self-absorbed and had little interest in being a mother. I suspected that if I did find her with Brad, she\u2019d be delighted to let me know she could have her husband and son back any time she wanted. She\u2019d certainly proved that to be true. One snap of her fingers, and Brad was there.</p><p>I hated myself for being so negative. I felt like returning to the parking lot and making my escape, but I didn\u2019t want to break my promise to Cody.</p><p>Before I was ready to deal with it, I heard Brad shouting for his son. \u201cCody!\u201d He didn\u2019t sound too pleased to be chasing after him.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder, surprised\u2014and grateful\u2014to see that he was alone. Janice was nowhere in sight. Intent on catching up with Cody, Brad jogged past me, eyes straight ahead, and had gone two or three feet before he looked back. Like Cody, he stopped, mentally debated what to do, then started toward me. But his arms weren\u2019t open and waiting for a hug.</p><p>\u201cLydia.\u201d My name was breathless as if he\u2019d jogged a lengthy distance.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re looking for Cody and Chase.\u201d Polite conversation was all I could manage.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing here?\u201d I finished for him. \u201cWalking,\u201d I said, answering my own question.</p><p>He seemed dumbstruck.</p><p>\u201cCody\u2019s about three minutes ahead of you, and Chase about half a minute ahead of Cody,\u201d I said, pointing down the path. He didn\u2019t need to waste time chatting with me when he had a son and a dog to catch.</p><p>Brad continued walking backward, facing me. The way he stared made me uncomfortable. I looked away, almost wishing Janice would hurry so we could get this whole awkward scene over with.</p><p>\u201cChase got away from him,\u201d Brad stated, as if I hadn\u2019t figured that out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grown,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cChase or Cody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d I was walking at a clipped pace; he\u2019d begun to walk parallel to me along the narrow path.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCody\u2019s grown a full inch this summer. His jeans are all high waters. When I took him school-shopping, I\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly.</p><p>Sure enough, Chase was loping toward me, with Cody behind him, holding tight to the retriever\u2019s leash.</p><p>\u201cLydia,\u201d the boy cried, almost too excited to speak. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI wish no one would ever do that again.\u201d Cody ran up to me and wrapped both arms around my waist. Brad was now holding the leash; he had far more control over the dog. Chase was actually sitting quietly, tongue lolling.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mother?\u201d I asked, not wanting to be caught unawares. If Janice walked up now, there might be some explaining to do.</p><p>Cody shrugged. \u201cYou know Mom.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t, not really.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of our lives again.\u201d Brad filled in the blanks for me.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d He hadn\u2019t mentioned it earlier, and that hurt. If he\u2019d cared even a little for me, the fact that Janice had changed her mind was worth a mention, even casually.</p><p>\u201cNot long ago. I planned on letting you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d I kept my tone as cool and even as possible.</p><p>\u201cDad felt bad,\u201d Cody said. \u201cAnd I did, too.\u201d</p><p>Bad that Janice had left? Or\u2014</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d like to know what happened,\u201d Brad said, his voice defiant.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps later,\u201d I said, my head spinning. \u201cI need to think about this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can walk with you,\u201d Cody inserted, eager to be with me. \u201cDid you come here every week? We didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cMom thinks the wind and sun aren\u2019t good for her skin, and she didn\u2019t think Dad and I should come without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I stayed away, too.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the first time Cody had alluded to his mother. \u201cMaybe you should tell me what happened,\u201d I said, looking at Brad.</p><p>\u201cCody,\u201d Brad said to his son, handing over the leash. \u201cGo on ahead with Chase. Make him heel, okay?\u201d</p><p>The boy showed his disappointment. \u201cI want to talk to Lydia, too, Dad. I missed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Cody looked at me, and I nodded in agreement. He gave a boyish grin and took off, walking sedately. \u201cHeel, Chase. Heel!\u201d</p><p>We both watched them for a minute and I smiled at Cody\u2019s earnest effort to restrain the dog.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Brad said flatly. \u201cJanice is gone.\u201d</p><p>That was a pretty minimal explanation. \u201cCould you give me a few details?\u201d</p><p>Brad pushed his hands into his pants pockets. \u201cYou were right. Janice didn\u2019t want me back, nor was she particularly interested in being a mother to Cody. She just didn\u2019t want you and me together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cCody once told her he wanted you to be his mom, and Janice got all bent out of shape. She went into panic mode and decided she couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped loving Janice a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t feel qualified to comment.</p><p>\u201cI had to try to make a go of the reconciliation for Cody\u2019s sake. A child deserves a mother and a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Cody, too,\u201d I cried, \u201cand I understood why you did what you did. But you completely discounted my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe angry with me if you want,\u201d Brad concluded, quickening his pace. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m sick to death of women and their demands. I loved Janice and she pulled every string she could to manipulate me, using my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s my fault?\u201d I was a second away from reminding him that he\u2019d been the one to shove me aside. As I\u2019d told him, I knew why he\u2019d done it and I loved the way he loved his son, but I had a hard time getting past the pain it had caused me.</p> <p>\u201cNow you want your pound of flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I certainly recognized the allusion but didn\u2019t understand how it applied to me.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you want is for me to come crawling back to you because Janice decided she needed her freedom, after all.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down my pent-up anger.</p><p>\u201cI notice it didn\u2019t take you long to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to do?\u201d I asked, even though it had been a lie. \u201cDid you want me to sit at home and pine for you?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated. \u201cNo, and you didn\u2019t, which is just perfect.\u201d He made a sweeping gesture with his hands. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve had it with women and relationships. It\u2019s just too damned hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one you dumped,\u201d I pointed out. Whether he wanted to admit it or not, Brad had hurt me badly. Now I was supposed to pretend nothing had happened? None of my concerns appeared to interest Brad.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Lydia. With Janice, with you, and with every other female on the planet. I don\u2019t understand women. I never have and I doubt I ever will. Living the rest of my life alone would be easier than dealing with an irrational female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not irrational!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say. But I\u2019m not crawling back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not chasing after you, either.\u201d I wanted to make that clear right then and there.</p><p>He smiled sardonically. \u201cI know, and frankly that suits me just fine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p> <p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>According to Grams, Courtney wouldn\u2019t be able to ride her bicycle much longer. Two or three weeks at the most. The autumn rains would start in mid-October, and it wouldn\u2019t be safe to ride on slick roads. Soon it would be dark by midafternoon.</p><p>Courtney would miss riding as part of her exercise and weight-maintenance program. It helped her vent her frustrations and stay out of the kitchen. She\u2019d managed to maintain her twenty-five-pound weight loss, which was no small feat. Making better food choices had become easier, but her gaze often lingered on sweets and on the candy machine. That stuff was pure poison for her.</p><p>The best development since school started was that she\u2019d made a few friends, including Mike, her chauffeur. That was what he called himself, and with great flair. He was shy but she\u2019d discovered that he had a subtle sense of humor that seemed to come out of nowhere. Every now and then, always unexpectedly, he\u2019d crack a joke that was hilarious. Until recently, she\u2019d hoped Mike would ask her to the Homecoming Dance, but it was plain he\u2019d set his sights on someone else.</p><p>She was only now becoming acquainted with the students in her classes. Most days, she hung around with Monica and Jocelyn, girls from her trigonometry class. Jocelyn and Mike liked each other and were perfect together, so Courtney played the role of matchmaker.</p><p>Annie was her closest friend. They talked on the phone often and saw each other at school, but they didn\u2019t have any classes together. Courtney liked Andrew, too. A lot.</p><p>Taking a sharp corner on her bike, Courtney rolled onto her grandmother\u2019s street and coasted to a stop. She climbed off, wheeling the ten-speed around to the garage. Helmet looped over her arm, she headed toward the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Courtney?\u201d Grams called from the living room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she shouted back as she stopped at the sink to get a drink of water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got company, dear.\u201d</p><p>Courtney set the glass down and tried to remember whether she\u2019d noticed any cars parked out front. She couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d be visiting.</p><p>When she walked into the living room and saw Andrew sitting on the sofa, she nearly dropped her helmet. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, hardly able to find her voice.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, grinning back at her.</p><p>\u201cLook, dear, he\u2019s wearing the socks you knit him.\u201d Grams seemed utterly delighted by this. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you young people to discuss whatever you want to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Pulanski.\u201d</p><p>Vera hesitated on her way to the kitchen. \u201cI have some oatmeal cookies in the freezer I can defrost if you\u2019re interested, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>He shared a look with Courtney. \u201cThanks, anyway, Mrs. Pulanski. Maybe another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need anything, do you?\u201d Grams turned to Courtney.</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her grandmother nodded and, good as her word, she left the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Courtney asked. No need to beat around the bush. She was hot and sweaty, and if he\u2019d let her know he intended to come over, she would\u2019ve stayed home instead of riding her bike.</p><p>\u201cI came to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cAbout ten minutes ago. I had fun chatting with your grandmother. You were a cute baby.\u201d</p><p>Courtney rolled her eyes. \u201cShe showed you baby pictures of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Courtney would never forgive that.</p><p>Andrew chuckled. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t funny.\u201d Maintaining a suitable distance, she sat down on the ottoman and hoped she hadn\u2019t perspired too much.</p><p>Andrew released a deep sigh and then sent a quick look in her direction. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d</p><p>She thought about recent gossip that had circulated around the school. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t hear many rumors, and even when she did, she rarely knew the people involved.</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMelanie and I aren\u2019t going out anymore. We haven\u2019t in quite a while, but it got a little complicated over the summer and\u2014well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Andrew seemed to be waiting for a comment from her. Courtney wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d was the best she could come up with.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>Not really, but...\u201cBreaking up is hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on my end. Melanie and I don\u2019t have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean for Homecoming?\u201d</p><p>Andrew shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean anything. If I\u2019m crowned king, I\u2019ll have my date and if Melanie\u2019s named queen, she\u2019ll have hers. No big deal either way.\u201d</p><p>Being new at the school, Courtney wasn\u2019t sure how this worked.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to the Homecoming dance?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He seemed surprised. \u201cI thought Mike asked you.\u201d</p><p>Courtney stretched the truth just a little. \u201cI think he\u2019s building up his courage, but he hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d She immediately felt bad for overstating the likelihood of his asking her, but she didn\u2019t want Andrew to think she was entirely without prospects\u2014which at this point, she was\u2014or that she was angling for an invitation from him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting down to the wire, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>The dance was a week away, and almost everyone already had a date. Courtney was convinced Mike would ask Jocelyn. Monica agreed and suggested that rather than be left out, the two of them attend the dance together, dates or not. A lot of girls did that, and guys, too.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cIn fact, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a friend come by without getting the third degree?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Courtney felt a knot in her stomach. \u201cYour mother put you up to this, didn\u2019t she?\u201d She got to her feet and started pacing. No wonder he was so vague! Courtney remembered that it was Bethanne who\u2019d suggested Andrew find her a ride to and from school. She\u2019d also coerced him into taking her to the Mariners\u2019 game that first time.</p><p>\u201cMy mother had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go all psycho on me,\u201d he muttered. He vaulted to his feet, raking his fingers through his hair. \u201cListen, there\u2019s probably a better way to ask you to the Homecoming dance, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s head reared back. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to the dance?\u201d She hadn\u2019t dared to even hope for this. Was he serious? He wasn\u2019t teasing her, was he? That would be too cruel.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut listen, there might be a bit of a problem with Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rose in a sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s the jealous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the breakup wasn\u2019t mutual?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head sadly. \u201cNo. Not exactly. She\u2019s pretty upset and, well\u2014I felt I should warn you.\u201d</p><p>Courtney frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this earlier?\u201d</p><p>Andrew smiled apologetically. \u201cI was afraid if I did, you might refuse to go to the dance with me.\u201d He studied her, an expectant look on his face.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a joke. He was serious. Andrew wanted to take her to Homecoming. \u201cOh, Andrew,\u201d she whispered, trying to keep her voice from trembling. \u201cI\u2019d be honored to be your date.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a thing to wear\u2014oh, if she\u2019d ever needed her sister, it was now.</p><p>Andrew brightened. \u201cAnnie said you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, but she did give me some advice.\u201d Andrew grinned, raising one foot. \u201cShe suggested I wear the socks. Did it work?\u201d</p><p>Courtney laughed. \u201cTell her it did,\u201d she said, smothering a laugh.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>Bethanne was in the midst of party preparations for an eight-year-old boy. Todd was a fan of old-fashioned Western movies and TV shows, the cowboy and Indian shoot\u2019 em up kind. Bethanne had developed a party for him revolving around his favorite hero, the Lone Ranger. The invitations were out, and everyone was asked to come dressed as a cowboy. Bethanne planned to bring her guitar and she\u2019d made arrangements to have a few bales of hay delivered. The parents had agreed to a campfire in their large backyard, and after various games, the boys would eat sitting around the fire and then she\u2019d lead a singalong. In order to get in the mood, she\u2019d tie a red bandanna around her neck and wear her cowgirl boots. She\u2019d even bought a tin sheriff\u2019s badge to pin to her plaid shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Humming to Reba McEntire, she stirred the pork and beans warming on the stove. They were canned, but she\u2019d added liquid smoke to give them the flavor of having been cooked on a campfire.</p><p>The games were more involved, since she wanted to stick to the western theme, and she planned to talk over her ideas with Andrew when he got home from school. Everything else was settled, including the menu.</p><p>Bethanne liked Elise\u2019s idea of making a schedule of standard party ideas, so she wouldn\u2019t need to start from scratch with every child. Who would\u2019ve believed her creativity would get her this far? Her one drawback was the lack of start-up cash. It was hard to balance all her expenses and still make the house payments, but she was learning the importance of following a budget. Money was tight, but both her son and daughter understood that this was important. They all had to sacrifice if the business was going to survive.</p><p>The telephone rang, and Bethanne reached for it. Tucking the portable phone against her shoulder, she continued stirring. Pork and beans was the least expensive grocery item on her list, but she didn\u2019t want to risk scorching them.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Bethanne,\u201d she said. When she could afford it, she intended to get a separate line for the party business.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hamlin, this is Gary Schroeder from Puget Sound Security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked briefly a few weeks ago about a loan application you\u2019d submitted,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t caught you at an inconvenient moment.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne tried to remember this particular loan officer, but drew a blank. She\u2019d been ushered in and out of each financial institution in record time, so it was little wonder she didn\u2019t recall meeting him.</p> <p>\u201cThis is fine.\u201d The timer on the oven told her the birthday cake was finished.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be better if you stopped by our loan department at your earliest convenience,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Bethanne rationed her gas usage and preferred not to take unnecessary trips. \u201cIf you could tell me what this is about, I might be able to manage that,\u201d she said. With the phone still pressed against her shoulder, she opened the oven door, slid out the top rack and tested the cake by inserting a toothpick into the center.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a check waiting for you, Ms. Hamlin,\u201d the loan officer replied warmly.</p><p>\u201cA check? The bank reconsidered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can discuss that when you arrive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in thirty minutes,\u201d she said, her heart pounding hard. This was incredible! She couldn\u2019t imagine what had convinced the bank to finally approve her loan. Whatever it was, she was ready to throw her arms around this man she couldn\u2019t even remember meeting.</p><p>With the cake cooling on the counter and the beans in the fridge, Bethanne drove to the bank and parked in their nearby lot.</p><p>She found the desk with Gary Schroeder\u2019s name and approached him, thrusting out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Bethanne Hamlin,\u201d she announced, then realized she still had her apron on. \u201cOops,\u201d she said, untying it. \u201cAs you can see, I left in kind of a hurry.\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward the chair. \u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne sat, perched on the edge of the chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming so promptly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I did understand you correctly, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She gazed at him earnestly. \u201cYou did approve my loan?\u201d</p><p>His mouth thinned. \u201cActually, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped. \u201cThen why did you drag me all the way down here? I\u2019m a busy woman, Mr. Schroeder. I have a business to run and\u2014\u201d The disappointment was so overwhelming she couldn\u2019t finish. Not only had she wasted her time, but the gauge on her gas tank was hovering at empty. Raising her hopes like this was unfair! She stood up, ready to walk away, but Mr. Schroeder stopped her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have an account with our bank,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d she broke in. \u201cI have no intention of opening one now if this is the kind of trick you pull on your customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hamlin,\u201d he said, lifting one hand in a conciliatory gesture. \u201cI apologize for upsetting you, but this is a rather...unusual situation. Please, sit down.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne reclaimed her chair and tried to swallow the lump forming in her throat.</p><p>\u201cEarly this morning, I received a call from a man who asked if you\u2019d applied for a business loan with our institution. I can assure you it isn\u2019t our policy to give out such information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man, who requested not to be identified, said he\u2019d like five thousand dollars deposited into your account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014as you said\u2014I don\u2019t have an account here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I explained. He then asked if it would be possible to get you the loan amount you\u2019d requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m confused,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I was confused myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what does this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that this person, who again asked that his identity not be revealed, wants to give you the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the money,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne leaned forward in her chair. \u201cLet me see if I understand this. Someone I don\u2019t know wants to hand over five thousand dollars cash\u2014to me. What\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no catch.\u201d</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t sure she could believe this. \u201cYou\u2019re positive about that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWith the proviso that if the opportunity arises, you will do the same for someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see\u2014well, I think I do. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d he continued, opening a file. \u201cI have a cashier\u2019s check for you in the amount of five thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw sagged open as the reality set in. She stared at Gary Schroeder, unable to comprehend who would do such a thing. Then it came to her. She knew of only one possible person who\u2019d want to help her like this, and while she couldn\u2019t be sure, she felt she had to ask.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend.... The money doesn\u2019t happen to come from a man by the name of Paul Ormond, does it?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Schroeder shook his head. \u201cAs I explained earlier, your benefactor has requested anonymity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t Paul?\u201d</p><p>He smiled kindly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne tried to think who else her benefactor might be. It didn\u2019t seem at all likely that Grant would do this. She realized he had regrets about the divorce, but if he\u2019d found it in his heart to give her this money, he\u2019d certainly want her to know what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cGrant Hamlin?\u201d she asked, just in case.</p><p>Again the loan officer shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you any more, but I will let you know this. The man who contacted us is not related to you in any way. I suggest you put your questions about his name out of your mind for now. Invest these funds wisely and validate this person\u2019s faith in you.\u201d</p><p>With the check clutched in her hand, Bethanne nodded and got slowly to her feet. \u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cI most certainly will.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t guess who had such faith in her ability, but she would take this gift and use it wisely, as the loan officer had advised. And, in keeping with her benefactor\u2019s proviso, she\u2019d pass on his generosity when she had the chance.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>\u201cGrandma, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Courtney said, staring at the express mail envelope. It was addressed to her with no indication of the sender\u2019s identity. As soon as she\u2019d seen the contents, she\u2019d forgotten that Grandma had become Grams months ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d her grandmother asked, standing next to her in the foyer. The letter had been waiting for Courtney on the stair railing.</p><p>Courtney handed it to her grandmother as she slid her backpack from her shoulders and let it drop to the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cashier\u2019s check,\u201d Vera Pulanski murmured, sounding as shocked as Courtney.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do this?\u201d Courtney asked, unable to think of anyone else who might be responsible.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d her grandmother exclaimed. \u201cMy goodness, child, if I had that kind of money, let me tell you I wouldn\u2019t be spending it on a dress. Let\u2019s see the card again.\u201d</p><p>Courtney reached for the envelope and pulled out the type-written note. It read: BUY A DRESS AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE AND HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME AT HOMECOMING. It was signed YOUR FAIRY GODFATHER.</p><p>Vera shook her head hopelessly. \u201cI have no idea. It\u2019s got to be someone who knows you...Could it be your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was sent locally. Dated yesterday\u2014Wednesday. And why would Dad do something like this anonymously?\u201d</p><p>Vera merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell Andrew,\u201d Courtney sank down on the bottom step and picked up the phone. She was so excited she couldn\u2019t dial the number fast enough. Grams, of course, had that old-fashioned rotary phone, black and cumbersome. Annie was the one who answered.</p><p>\u201cAnnie!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what just happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone sent me money for Homecoming. It\u2019s a huge sum of money. Huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow huge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>Annie released a low whistle. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Is Andrew home?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure why it seemed so important to tell him about this. She supposed it was so he\u2019d know she planned to do him proud. Since he\u2019d asked her to the Homecoming dance, they\u2019d talked several times a day. Just last night, they\u2019d spent almost two hours on the phone.</p><p>Once word got out at school that Andrew Hamlin had asked her to be his date, she\u2019d attracted a lot of attention. Some of the most popular kids were talking to her now\u2014the very ones who hadn\u2019t seen fit to even acknowledge her a couple of weeks ago. She wasn\u2019t taken in by their interest, which struck her as false and opportunistic. While she was friendly and polite, these were not people she wanted as friends.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Annie said, sounding as disappointed as Courtney. \u201cAndrew isn\u2019t back from football practice, but I\u2019ll tell him to phone you the minute he walks in the door.\u201d</p><p>Courtney should\u2019ve realized Andrew would still be at school. \u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201d She had a dress, but it was a hand-me-down from her sister, who\u2019d mailed it as soon as Courtney told her about the date. Rather frilly, it was a pretty pale-blue, much better suited to Julianna than her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so cool that you\u2019re dating my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t dating,\u201d Courtney reminded her friend. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gone out on a single date, and there\u2019s nothing to say we will after tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Annie insisted. \u201cAndrew and I talk, you know.\u201d</p><p>Courtney bit her tongue to keep from questioning her about anything Andrew might\u2019ve said. She knew that wouldn\u2019t be right, despite her curiosity. Maybe she\u2019d have a clearer sense of her future with Andrew after the dance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Annie would be there, too, with a good friend of Andrew\u2019s from the football team. Everything had worked out so well. Courtney could hardly believe it. Monica had been asked by a friend of Mike\u2019s, and all four couples intended to go out after the dance.</p><p>\u201cAs your grandmother would say,\u201d Annie continued, \u201cAndrew\u2019s smitten.\u201d</p><p>Smitten. What a perfectly lovely word. \u201cOh, Annie, I think he\u2019s just...wonderful.\u201d No adjective satisfactorily described her feelings about Andrew Hamlin. Being with him made leaving Chicago for her senior year almost worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d send you that kind of money?\u201d Annie wondered.</p> <p>\u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d Courtney was beyond conjecture.</p><p>\u201cYour dad?\u201d Annie suggested. \u201cOr your brother?\u201d</p><p>Courtney automatically shook her head. \u201cNo, neither of them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s the most fabulous gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d The doorbell chimed just then. \u201cThere\u2019s someone at the door. Grams is in the kitchen, so I\u2019d better get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell Andrew you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She could hardly wait to talk to him.</p><p>Hurrying to the door, Courtney opened it and gasped out loud when she saw her sister, suitcase in hand. \u201cJulianna!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to let me in?\u201d her sister asked. \u201cCourtney, my goodness, look at you! You\u2019re gorgeous. Who would\u2019ve thought those pounds would make such a difference.\u201d</p><p>Tears of joy sprang to Courtney\u2019s eyes as she threw open the screen door. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, hugging her tightly.</p><p>In seconds they were both laughing and weeping simultaneously. The commotion was enough to bring their grandmother out from the kitchen. Soon her squeals of delight mingled with theirs.</p> <p>\u201cMy, oh my, this is lovely,\u201d Grams said, pulling Julianna into the living room. \u201cBut\u2014how did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy plane. The most amazing thing happened. I got an express letter that said my baby sister\u2019s been asked to Home-coming by the star football player. Which I knew, of course. The letter suggested Courtney might need a little help getting ready for the big dance.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother raised both hands. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, I had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an airline ticket in the envelope,\u201d Julianna explained. \u201cAlso included was a long list of instructions. The first was that a car service would arrange to drive me to O\u2019Hare, and that another car would be waiting to pick me up at Sea-Tac. It would then drive me to Grams\u2019s house, but I was warned I couldn\u2019t say anything to either of you in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I, for one, am surprised,\u201d Courtney whispered, her cheeks still wet with tears.</p><p>\u201cI was given a cashier\u2019s check for my expenses, but it\u2019s far more money than I\u2019ll need. I\u2019m thinking we should make an appointment for your hair and your nails as soon as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair and nails, too?\u201d Courtney whispered, so overwhelmed she could barely speak.</p><p>Grams looked utterly perplexed. \u201cI wish I\u2019d thought of it, but even if I had, I never would\u2019ve been able to afford all this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur carriage awaits,\u201d her sister announced grandly. \u201cWell, the car. But the driver\u2019s in livery.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI mean, a uniform\u2014but isn\u2019t this just like Cinderella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s the car waiting?\u201d Courtney felt as if she had, indeed, been dropped into the middle of her favorite fairy tale. At the good part, though, when the godmother materializes and waves her wand around. Or godfather, she corrected, and it was a check, not a wand.</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s going to take us all to dinner,\u201d Julianna said. \u201cWe have reservations at Morton\u2019s on 4th Avenue. From there, the driver will drop Courtney and me at the mall and take you home, Grams. We\u2019re supposed to arrange a time and place for him to meet us when we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Courtney shrieked, giving way to her excitement. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must admit this is some Fairy Godfather you\u2019ve got,\u201d Julianna teased.</p><p>\u201cLet me grab my sweater,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like cooking tonight, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Courtney led her sister upstairs so they could leave her suitcase in one of the spare rooms. \u201cHow long can you stay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust until Saturday afternoon. I have to get back, and whoever arranged this seemed to know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Jason?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t him,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a dime to his name. In fact, he\u2019s always trying to borrow from me\u2014as if I had anything extra.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang just as they were leaving the house. Courtney debated whether she should answer it, and then decided it might be Andrew. With her grandmother\u2019s ancient phone, Caller ID wasn\u2019t an option, even if she\u2019d been willing to spring for it. So phone calls were always a mystery.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered, hoping it was Andrew.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Oh, Andrew, the most wonderful thing\u2019s happened! But I don\u2019t have time to explain everything right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she laughed, giddy with joy, \u201cmy sister\u2019s here and there\u2019s a car waiting to take me shopping for a Homecoming dress, and Andrew\u2014oh, Annie can tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis must be the day for good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Everyone was waiting on the porch, but she had to know.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be official until tomorrow, but I\u2019ve been elected Homecoming King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Andrew! Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in this world would make me prouder than to have you with me on Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Running light-heartedly out to the car, Courtney couldn\u2019t stop smiling. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done that could have merited such generosity, but she\u2019d be forever grateful to whoever had decided to become her Fairy Godfather.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been happier in her life.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>\u201cWhen in doubt, grab a ball of yarn and Get Creative!\u201d</p><p>\u2014Sasha Kagan, Sasha Kagan Knitwear.</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>It was more than a week since I\u2019d seen Brad. My anger had cooled and I wished I could take back some of what I\u2019d said. I hoped he felt the same way. Tuesday morning when I removed the Closed sign from my door, I took the opportunity to glance up and down the street. It was too early to see Brad\u2019s UPS truck, but I was hopeful nonetheless. I hadn\u2019t figured out what I\u2019d say, but I knew I\u2019d be far less emotional than last week at Green Lake.</p><p>It had been an incredible few days. Friday afternoon, Courtney came by to introduce me to her older sister. They had a fantastic story about a fairy godfather who\u2019d stepped in to ensure that her date for Homecoming would be as perfect as it could possibly be. I couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d do anything like that. I think Courtney somehow expected me to know, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>On Saturday it was Bethanne who arrived with an equally fantastic story of a mysterious benefactor who\u2019d given her the money she needed, no strings attached. A gift, not a loan. The only stipulation was that she help someone else if she was ever in a position to do so.</p><p>Exuberant, she dashed across the street with a business idea that involved Alix\u2014a contract to provide birthday cakes and other desserts for the various events Bethanne arranged.</p><p>I was thrilled for both Bethanne and Courtney. If this fairy godfather had any extra fairy dust available, I could use some myself\u2014not that I expected any magic in my life.</p><p>The bell chimed, and Margaret walked in promptly at ten. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I responded. I thought of asking her about her good mood but hesitated, wondering if she\u2019d volunteer the information herself. Often it\u2019s still difficult to know how best to approach my sister.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you had a good weekend,\u201d I finally ventured, somewhat cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWe sure did.\u201d She was practically skipping as she entered the store. I trailed behind her to the office.</p><p>\u201cDid you do anything fun?\u201d I asked. I was thinking maybe dinner out or a movie.</p><p>\u201cBetter than anything you can imagine!\u201d She gave me a huge smile. Not a typical Margaret smile, either, which often seemed more of a grimace, but a wide, unstinting smile that changed her whole face.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said, dying of curiosity.</p><p>She opened her purse and removed an envelope, which she handed me with a dramatic flourish.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it and see.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll admit I was eager enough to tear it open. Inside was a card and a check. I noticed the amount and gasped\u2014it was for the entire bank loan of ten thousand dollars. The card was a thank-you note written to me by my brother-in-law and signed by both Margaret and Matt.</p><p>\u201cWhat...how\u2014\u201d I stammered, hardly able to form a question.</p><p>\u201cMatt has a wonderful new job.\u201d</p><p>My guess was that this new job had nothing to do with painting houses. \u201cThe money...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA signing bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked it over, Matt and I, when you first gave us the money. Matt was so touched that you\u2019d do this for us. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you what a difference it made to be able to keep the house. We\u2014we\u2019ve never gotten this far behind, and it was a blow to both of us. We\u2019re terribly grateful for what you did, but we always felt the money had to be a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I couldn\u2019t seem to get out more than one word at a time\u2014and it takes a lot to leave me speechless.</p><p>\u201cThe truly astounding part is that Matt hadn\u2019t even applied with this particular engineering firm. Their Human Resources department contacted him on Thursday and asked him to submit an application immediately, which he did. They didn\u2019t have it longer than a day before he heard back and the negotiations began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s marvelous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is\u2014more than you know. I\u2019ve hardly ever seen Matt so excited. He was like a little kid when he got the news. He started work yesterday. I wanted to say something on Friday, but we decided to wait until everything was in place\u2014and we could give you this.\u201d She pointed to the check.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d I said, hugging my sister. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, there must be a hundred things you need. Keep the money, repay me when you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she returned sternly. \u201cThis is yours, and neither Matt nor I will hear of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I whispered, \u201cthe fairy dust is flying all over the place.\u201d I don\u2019t think my sister realized what a turning point that loan was for me, in more ways than one. Perhaps for the first time since I became an adult, I\u2019d truly stepped outside myself. I know that sounds odd, but it has to do with the rather insular life I\u2019d lived for so many years. What I mean is, when I was a teenager and in my twenties, my whole life revolved around my sickness and consequently around me. Not until I opened the shop on Blossom Street did I begin to understand how self-absorbed I\u2019d become. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This had been an especially difficult summer for me as I learned to consider needs and concerns other than my own. It was a financial stretch to help Margaret and Matt, but I badly wanted to give back to my sister and her family for all the sacrifices they\u2019d made on my behalf.</p><p>Later, with Mom, I came to understand that our roles were now reversed. It was time for me to take care of her. The paperwork, finances and everything else involved in getting Mom settled in assisted living had been time-consuming and often frustrating. But my parents had always handled those details for me, during my bouts of cancer. I received the very best treatment available because my parents fought for me. Now it was my turn.</p><p>My third emotional lesson was perhaps the most painful. It came when Brad told me about Janice. I\u2019d just about dissolved into a puddle of self-pity because the man I loved had broken off our relationship. Only later, when I looked past the pain I was suffering, did I understand that Brad had done this out of love for his son. Reconciling with Janice wasn\u2019t what he wanted, but he loved Cody enough to put aside his own wants in an effort to give him the family he needed. I failed to be as noble. Granted, once I recognized his motives, I felt less hurt, but I wasn\u2019t nearly as gracious or understanding as I could have been.</p><p>The bell above the door jangled and I had my first customer of the day. I half expected Margaret to rush out. She seemed occupied with order forms, so I placed the check on my desk and hurried into the shop.</p> <p>Brad stood just inside and my heart seized at the sight of him. Margaret\u2019s smile had nothing on mine. \u201cHello, handsome,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>We stood there smiling at each other for the longest moment, until he held his arms out to me. I didn\u2019t need a second invitation. My feet barely touched the ground as I ran into his embrace. Anyone who happened to be strolling past my shop window would\u2019ve seen two people in love. Brad and I were entwined, arms around each other, kissing, kissing, kissing.</p><p>When we finally managed to break apart, it was with reluctance. \u201cYou\u2019re so right,\u201d I cried, running my hands over his face, needing to touch him. \u201cI behaved like a jealous fool, and I lied, I lied. There\u2019s no one else. Brad, forgive me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too\u2014for what I said last week. I could no more walk away from you than I could one of Alix\u2019s chocolate \u00e9clairs.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed and poked my finger into his ribs. Then because it felt so good to be with him again, I wrapped my arms around him and held on tight.</p><p>\u201cSo there isn\u2019t another guy?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere never was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. You\u2019re the one and only love of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked into his eyes and whispered, \u201cThat could be arranged.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that. It\u2019s time, Lydia. Time for you and me. I came too close to losing you. I love you, Lydia. I\u2019ve never stopped. Cody loves you. Chase loves you, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I brought my lips to his, interrupting him. He didn\u2019t need to say another word.</p><p>His hold around my waist tightened as he lifted me from the floor. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll marry me, Lydia Hoffman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d I wanted to qualify my response with a warning or two. The cancer could return. I wasn\u2019t sure I could have children or that it was advisable. But I said none of this. Our marriage wasn\u2019t about me\u2014it was about Brad, Cody and me. Chase, too, for that matter. We were going to be a family.</p><p>\u201cLydia?\u201d Margaret said, stepping out of the office, her voice tentative.</p><p>I smiled over at my sister. \u201cHow would you feel about being my maid of honor?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She turned to Brad, then to me. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAre you up for a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I am!\u201d she cried.</p> <p>I draped my arms around Brad and pressed my head to his shoulder.</p><p>I swear there was fairy dust floating all over that room.</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Maverick had, according to Aurora, returned from the poker tournament in the Caribbean, but he\u2019d made no effort to contact Elise. She didn\u2019t ask, but she thought Aurora had told her father that Elise knew about his cancer. Countless times in the few weeks before their last encounter, Maverick had invited her to come to his apartment, but she\u2019d repeatedly refused.</p><p>In light of that conversation, he didn\u2019t invite her again, and she didn\u2019t blame him. She regretted that outburst now. When she could stand the silence no longer, Elise decided to go and see him.</p><p>The building was a new one, in a lovely area close to Aurora\u2019s, as well as Seattle\u2019s downtown area. She noticed that it was also close to a number of medical facilities.</p><p>The heaviness that had settled over her once she\u2019d learned of Maverick\u2019s leukemia grew more burdensome each day. She felt hurt that Maverick had kept this information from her and yet she understood why he\u2019d been so reticent. Late at night, as they\u2019d cuddled up together in her single bed, Elise had often sensed that he wanted to tell her something. A dozen times she\u2019d felt it, but she\u2019d suspected that he wanted to confess he\u2019d been gambling again. She hadn\u2019t been willing to hear that, so she\u2019d pretended to be asleep. Their private nighttime moments were too precious to ruin.</p><p>The doorman was kind enough to show her where to press the button connected with her ex-husband\u2019s telephone. Maverick answered on the second ring, sounding tired.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Can I come up?\u201d Elise asked in a subdued voice.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A buzzer rang and the lobby door opened. Maverick\u2019s condo was on the fifteenth floor. When she stepped out of the elevator, he stood in his doorway, waiting for her.</p><p>She nearly faltered when she saw his welcoming smile. All she\u2019d done for weeks was harangue him with her bitterness. She felt such guilt, such an awareness of opportunities missed. Seeing him now, knowing he was dying, she burst into uncharacteristic tears. She couldn\u2019t help it. Her shoulders quaked and she covered her mouth with both hands.</p><p>Her emotion had an immediate effect on him. Maverick wrapped his arms around her and brought her into the apartment. He closed the door with one foot, still hugging her.</p><p>\u201cElise, Elise,\u201d he whispered, cradling her face between his large hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? My gutsy girl doesn\u2019t weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...feel...so...bad.\u201d His sympathy, his soft crooning, only made her feel worse.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d His gaze searched hers.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2014oh, Maverick, I\u2019ve been so bitter and so spiteful toward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you plenty of reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never the right wife for you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor was I the right husband for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she sobbed. At one time she\u2019d tried to deny it, but she loved Maverick, heart and soul. When she\u2019d learned about his visit, she hadn\u2019t wanted to see him because she\u2019d recognized the truth\u2014and it had terrified her.</p><p>Gathering her close, Maverick kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you. Always.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him through tear-filled eyes. \u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I never remarried?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered and had never wanted to ask. His question implied that he\u2019d had opportunities, and maybe other romances; she had no difficulty believing it. But none of that mattered. Not even the gambling mattered anymore.</p><p>\u201cAll those wasted years...all those empty, empty years,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cNow...now it\u2019s too late.... Aurora told me\u2014she told me you\u2019re...dying.\u201d It was difficult to say the word.</p><p>A deep sigh expanded his chest. \u201cI was afraid she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I needed to know.\u201d But she\u2019d made it impossible for Maverick to tell her himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Her sobbing increased. She couldn\u2019t tolerate the fact that she was about to lose Maverick so soon after finding him again.</p><p>His hold on her tightened. \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been immersed in grief she might have smiled at his wry tone.</p><p>She took a long, shuddering breath. \u201cI know...but I regret so much. I\u2019m not sure where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both have regrets, my darling.\u201d</p><p>Elise clung to him. That he could refer to her as his \u201cdarling\u201d after the way she\u2019d treated him said a great deal about this man she loved. This forgiving, passionate and often reckless man. A man who saw the best in others, who laughed at himself\u2014a man who loved her.</p><p>\u201cI...do want to move in with you,\u201d Elise announced. \u201cIf you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile before she saw it. \u201cI\u2019d rather you married me again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin and gazed deeply into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll probably keep gambling as long as I\u2019m able to.\u201d</p><p>She agreed with a half nod. Gambling was an important part of his life. She loved Maverick; loving him meant accepting him for the man he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost the poker tournament,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor your sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw me on television?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAurora and the boys told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond place wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>His spirits were unusually high. \u201cYou have a good attitude about it,\u201d she murmured. But then, he\u2019d always been an optimist.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married as soon as we can,\u201d he said. \u201cNext month? Maybe over Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, he said, \u201cWe have a lot to do to get ready for the wedding. I want to buy you a diamond ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaverick, no! \u201c</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAre we going to start our marriage with an argument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but a plain gold band will do nicely.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLet me take care of that. I also want to hire Bethanne to arrange everything for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s equipped to manage that yet,\u201d Elise said, although she was grateful he\u2019d thought of her friend.</p><p>Elise offered no resistance when Maverick silenced her with a kiss. In his arms, she had no doubts or questions. If he wanted to hire Bethanne, then that was what they\u2019d do. After all, their wedding was really just a party\u2014wasn\u2019t that what Bethanne had said about weddings? A celebration. She smiled at the image of a dinosaur-shaped wedding cake or Alice in Wonderland decorations.</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s ask Bethanne,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have Aurora be my maid of honor,\u201d Elise said, arms around his middle and smiling up at him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to invite your knitting group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my reading club?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAs many of your friends as you desire.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. All this expense was an extravagance. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she insisted one last time. \u201cI\u2019d be happy just to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is for me,\u201d Maverick said.</p><p>With that she acquiesced. However, she did feel it was only fair to remind him that she came with encumbrances. \u201cMaverick,\u201d she began, \u201cdon\u2019t forget I\u2019m in the middle of that lawsuit and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a legal and financial mess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work itself out. Just promise me you won\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He studied her intently.</p><p>Elise walked farther into the apartment and collapsed onto the edge of a brown leather sofa. \u201cHow can I not worry? You have no idea how much money I\u2019ve lost. I can\u2019t just forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can\u2019t worry yourself sick over it, either. What will be will be. Nothing you do now is going to change anything. It\u2019s in the hands of the courts\u2014isn\u2019t that what you told me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll take care of your financial concerns.\u201d</p> <p>At her automatic protest, he said, \u201cElise, I want to help you. I\u2019m a rich man.\u201d</p><p>She blinked twice. Rich? Maverick?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a gambler, Maverick. No one makes money gambling.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply. \u201cI wasted too much of my life seeking that pot of gold, I\u2019ll admit that now. There were plenty of other occupations I could\u2019ve been successful at\u2014but nothing interested me in the same way.\u201d He gave an amused little shrug. \u201cI was born with card sense.\u201d</p><p>Elise remembered that he\u2019d made every single child-support payment on time. She\u2019d often wondered how he\u2019d been able to manage it. She\u2019d been willing to acknowledge that he must\u2019ve had moderate success\u2014but rich?</p> <p>\u201cYou lost that poker tournament in the Caribbean,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But the money for the second-place prize was eight hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Elise gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what you say, those socks you knit brought me luck.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t already been sitting, Elise\u2019s knees would\u2019ve gone out from under her. \u201cEight hundred thousand dollars?\u201d she repeated in a voice that resembled a squeak. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d She had no idea there was that kind of money in gambling.</p><p>\u201cApparently you aren\u2019t aware of the recent popularity of poker.\u201d</p><p>Dumbfounded, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve placed the majority in a trust fund for Aurora, David and the boys. Plus, I did a bit of what my mother called planting seeds of faith.\u201d</p> <p>Her head snapped up and she looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cIt was you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who gave Bethanne the money she needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d His voice was nonchalant but his lips were curved in the slightest of smiles.</p><p>\u201cI do. It had to be you.\u201d Everything fell into place. Maverick had waited for her during each knitting class and on the way home she\u2019d given him an update on each of her friends.</p><p>\u201cYou flew Courtney\u2019s sister out here for the Homecoming dance. How did you ever find her?\u201d</p><p>A twinkle flashed in his eyes. \u201cPulanski isn\u2019t a name you hear every day, now, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Margaret\u2019s husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got that job on his own merits,\u201d Maverick insisted, but the smile was growing as he continued. \u201cTaking advantage of an old connection. A word dropped in the right ear. Although the signing bonus is another story.\u201d</p><p>Elise knew nothing about any of that. \u201cYou do this sort of thing often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn occasion. I like to practice what people refer to as random acts of kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly these weren\u2019t so random, were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but I figure whatever I give to others comes back tenfold. Not necessarily to me but to people who need it. People Bethanne or Matt or Courtney meet, maybe tomorrow, maybe ten years from now. Kindness is something that should always be passed on.\u201d</p><p>Elise regarded him with open admiration. \u201cHave you always been this wonderful and I just never noticed? Or is it a new development?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to answer that honestly, do you?\u201d</p><p>She brought her palm to his face and let her love shine through her eyes. \u201cOh, Maverick, I love you. Rich or poor, I love you. We\u2019re going to have a very good life together\u2014for however long God gives us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way I feel right now,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthat\u2019ll be a very long time.\u201d</p><p>Elise hoped he was right.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>COURTNEY PULANSKI</p><p>The Next Year</p><p>Courtney hurried from her last class to her dorm room, hoping there was a card in the mail from Andrew. They e-mailed at least once a day and sometimes more. In their last communication, he\u2019d suggested she check her mailbox in the near future. That was a sure sign he\u2019d dropped something off for her at the post office. He was attending Washington State University on a football scholarship and Courtney was a freshman at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><p>To Courtney\u2019s amazement, her senior year had proved to be the best part of her high-school experience. She\u2019d arrived in Seattle overweight, lonely and miserable, certain she was destined to have a wretched year.</p><p>Over the next thirteen months, Courtney had developed a close relationship with her grandmother. She\u2019d learned a lot during the time her father had spent in South America. Grams had shared bits and pieces of family history that no one else knew. At first Courtney had thought Grams\u2019s house was full of old things, and it was, but some of those things were family treasures. They weren\u2019t antiques that would sell for big cash on eBay or interest the appraisers on The Antiques Road Show. But each object had the power of family history behind it. Every now and then, Grams would dig out something to show her, like the cute outfit she\u2019d knit for her father as a baby or his high-school graduation announcement.</p><p>Grams had introduced Courtney to her friends, and it was like having ten grandmothers. To this day, whenever she was in a women\u2019s change room, she never took the middle shower, in honor of Leta. She still swam two days a week.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant change her grandmother had brought to Courtney\u2019s life was signing her up for that knitting class. Courtney had been feeling abandoned and alone, and within weeks, she\u2019d made three friends. Three good friends. The other members of the class were older, but the bonds they\u2019d built were strong even now, more than a year later. She had an extended family of knitting friends, too, with Jacqueline, Carol and Alix, as well as Margaret. They\u2019d all been supportive and encouraging at the time she\u2019d needed it most.</p><p>Courtney walked across the lawn and hurried up the steps to the dorm. She stopped long enough to collect her mail and quickly sorted through the envelopes. Sure enough, there was a card with Andrew\u2019s distinctive handwriting and the WSU return address. She was proud of him, proud he\u2019d been awarded a major scholarship. She didn\u2019t really expect their long-distance romance to last. They were both young, as her grandmother often reminded her\u2014too young to be serious. Grams was right about that. Andrew, however, was her connection to that wonderful year. First and foremost, they were friends, and she wanted to maintain that closeness. Forever, she hoped, even if their romantic interest waned. Andrew said he felt the same way.</p><p>Inside her room, Courtney tore open the envelope and discovered a humorous card with a cat sleeping in the sun on a bed of roses. The cat resembled Lydia\u2019s Whiskers, who often slept in the shop window. Opening it, she read: Wake up and smell the roses. Below that, he\u2019d scribbled a few lines of encouragement about an upcoming test.</p><p>This was one of the reasons she liked Andrew so much. He was so thoughtful, and unlike other star athletes she knew, he wasn\u2019t stuck on himself. He regularly did little things to let her know he was thinking of her.</p><p>Courtney stayed in touch with Annie, too. It was just Annie and her mom at home this year, and the changes in the family dynamic had required an adjustment, according to Annie. Courtney missed her a lot. When they\u2019d first met, Annie had been angry and bitter. The brunt of that anger was directed toward the woman whose name Annie refused to mention\u2014her father\u2019s second wife. Annie had blamed this woman for everything. Oh, she\u2019d been plenty pissed at her dad, too, but they seemed to be working that out. At least she saw him every week for lunch or dinner, which Courtney was glad to hear. Annie\u2019s father had made a big mistake, as far as Annie was concerned, and now he had to live with it. Annie claimed he and \u201cthat woman\u201d deserved each other\u2014but she still loved her dad.</p><p>Sitting on her bed, Courtney read Andrew\u2019s note a second time, then logged on to her computer to leave him a message. She discovered an e-mail from her father waiting for her. He\u2019d rented out the house in Chicago for a second year, and Courtney felt fine about that. She\u2019d kept some things of her mother\u2019s but she no longer thought of the place as home. He was still in Brazil, working on another bridge project, and seemed to be enjoying the adventure. The money didn\u2019t hurt either. She answered him, and then e-mailed Lydia about the progress her friends had made knitting.</p><p>Once the girls on her floor discovered that Courtney could knit, they\u2019d wanted her to teach them. Soon every girl in the dorm had a pair of knitting needles in her hands. Actually, two circular needles, since the most popular pattern so far had been socks. Courtney had knit a dozen pairs in the last year. Her father loved his and wore them constantly. Even her older brother bragged about his socks, and Andrew had three or four pairs now. Annie was knitting, too; Bethanne had taught her.</p><p>A knock sounded at her door. \u201cCourt, do you have a minute?\u201d Heather, one of the other girls on her floor, peeked inside.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said and stood up from her computer, leaving the e-mail to Lydia unfinished.</p><p>Heather stepped into the room with a ball of fingering weight yarn tucked under her arm and her knitting in her hands. \u201cI hate to bother you,\u201d she said guiltily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no bother.\u201d They sat on the edge of the bed while Courtney examined the other girl\u2019s project.</p><p>\u201cI think I dropped a stitch,\u201d Heather murmured.</p><p>Courtney could see that she had. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got a crochet hook in my desk. They work wonders.\u201d After retrieving the hook, she sat down with the half-completed sock.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look,\u201d Heather said, turning her head to stare in the opposite direction.</p><p>Courtney smiled. \u201cI did the same thing to Lydia the first time I dropped a stitch. She told me we all lose a stitch now and then. Just like life, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Heather agreed. \u201cWe get so busy that it\u2019s easy to let some things slide. We can either pick them up again, or let them stay lost.... I never thought about knitting like that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either,\u201d Courtney confessed, \u201cuntil I took Lydia\u2019s knitting class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Courtney caught the loose stitch and carefully brought it up through the rows until she could slip it back on the thin needle. When she\u2019d finished, she returned the sock to Heather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou learned a lot from those other knitters in Seattle, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Courtney said. More than she could possibly explain to anyone who hadn\u2019t taken part in those weekly sessions.</p><p>Elise was close in age to her grandmother\u2014certainly older than anyone else she called a friend\u2014yet that was how Courtney viewed her. They all kept in touch, and Elise phoned her every few weeks. Bethanne did, too. Courtney almost wished her father had stayed in Seattle longer so she could\u2019ve introduced the two of them. She knew, from Lydia and Elise, that Bethanne was seeing men from time to time; it wasn\u2019t something Annie talked about. Bethanne\u2019s booming party business kept her busy these days, which Annie did like to mention.</p><p>All her Blossom Street friends\u2014Bethanne, Lydia, Elise and the others\u2014had helped Courtney deal with the grief of losing her mother. Five years had now passed since her mother\u2019s death, and while the pain wasn\u2019t as raw as it had once been, Courtney had never completely filled the emptiness in her life. But she\u2019d seen how Bethanne\u2019s love for Andrew and Annie had carried her through the divorce. Maybe, years from now, when she had children of her own, she\u2019d find that same kind of strength and completeness. Bethanne\u2019s love for her kids, Elise\u2019s for Aurora, Lydia\u2019s for Cody\u2014these mother-child bonds reminded her of what she, too, had once had. That feeling was one of gratitude as well as sadness. Courtney recognized anew how deep her mother\u2019s love had been.</p> <p>Lydia and Margaret reminded Courtney of her relationship with her own sister. She was close to Julianna in much the same way Lydia and Margaret were close. They supported each other and they bickered. Courtney found it entirely natural. She\u2019d once heard Lydia explain that it hadn\u2019t always been like that, but seeing how well they worked together now, this was difficult for Courtney to believe.</p><p>After a couple of months, when they\u2019d all considered each other friends, Lydia had talked about her experience with cancer. Courtney would never have guessed that Lydia had gone through chemotherapy and radiation. When she\u2019d said this, Lydia had been absolutely thrilled and claimed it was proof she had \u201cstepped outside herself.\u201d Courtney wasn\u2019t sure what that meant but was happy about Lydia\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Court,\u201d Heather said, collecting her knitting and leaving the dorm room.</p><p>\u201cGlad to help,\u201d she said and sat back down at her computer.</p><p>She read over her e-mail to Lydia. \u201cI realized again that living in Seattle was a blessing in more ways than I could count. A Good Yarn\u2014\u201d That was where she\u2019d stopped when Heather came in. But she knew exactly what to say next.</p> <p>CHAPTER 47</p><p>BETHANNE HAMLIN</p><p>\u201cMom, phone!\u201d Annie shouted from the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhich line?\u201d Bethanne called from the kitchen, her hands buried in hamburger.</p><p>\u201cBusiness line. Do you want me to take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Bethanne nearly groaned. The party business was doing so well that she was booked months in advance. She washed her hands, then walked into the room that had once been Grant\u2019s office\u2014her office now\u2014where she kept the schedule for the upcoming parties.</p> <p>She answered the call, scheduled an appointment for a consultation and went back to the kitchen, where she was shaping small meatballs around green olives for a six-year-old\u2019s Halloween birthday bash. Not long afterward, Annie drifted downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYou need any help with those?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot now, but I will later.\u201d Annie had been a valuable asset the previous summer and still was, even in her senior year of high school. Bethanne had hired her on a part-time, as-needed basis, which was good for both of them. She had several other assistants, but working with Annie kept them close and connected. \u201cThat\u2019s why I pay you the big bucks, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Mom.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang again and Bethanne looked from her hands to her daughter. \u201cDo you want to get that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I have to earn those high wages you\u2019re supposedly paying me, don\u2019t I?\u201d Annie joked. She reached for the receiver and answered \u201cParties by Bethanne\u201d in a professional tone.</p><p>Her daughter was almost an adult; every once in a while Bethanne realized that with a jolt of recognition\u2014and pride. A year from now she\u2019d be alone, with both her children in college. The thought no longer terrified her. When the time came she\u2019d be able to afford it, which thrilled her. And she certainly wouldn\u2019t be lonely or at loose ends.... In fact, she\u2019d been giving some thought to expanding her business in untraditional ways. One plan involved Lydia\u2014a knitting party, in which Bethanne would serve food and drinks, and Lydia would teach everyone how to knit. The idea was still in its infancy, as was another idea for a children\u2019s storytelling party that Elise would help her with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Paul,\u201d Annie told her. \u201cDo you want to phone him back later?\u201d</p> <p>Bethanne still saw Paul on occasion, but it had been a couple of months since they\u2019d talked. \u201cTell him I\u2019ll call him back. I\u2019ve got an errand to run and I\u2019ll be home after six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLydia\u2019s,\u201d she answered, finishing up the meatballs and arranging them on a baking tray.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Annie held the phone against Bethanne\u2019s ear. \u201cYou tell him all that.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne quickly agreed to meet Paul for coffee at the French Caf\u00e9 across from A Good Yarn. \u201cSee you at six,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI think Paul\u2019s going to tell me it\u2019s serious with Angela,\u201d she said, and the news cheered her. His relationship with this new woman in his life sounded promising.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re going to Lydia\u2019s?\u201d Annie asked next, eyeing Bethanne suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly nosy,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cInquiring minds want to know.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne laughed and shook her head. She should\u2019ve realized that keeping anything from Annie was an exercise in futility. \u201cIf you must know, I need another ball of yarn for my current project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your current project is?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne heaved a sigh of resignation. \u201cA sweater for my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pink cashmere sweater is for me?\u201d Annie cried, absolutely delighted if the smile on her face was any indication.</p><p>\u201cYes, for you, but no longer a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I love that sweater and I\u2019m so excited you\u2019re knitting it for me.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne knit almost every night; it was her one true relaxation. At the same time, she was practical enough to like the fact that she could produce something both useful and beautiful. It seemed like a hundred years ago that her teenage daughter had taken the initiative and signed Bethanne up for the knitting class. She\u2019d graduated from socks to sweaters and was planning to knit an afghan to give Andrew for Christmas.</p><p>Bethanne left the meatballs baking in the oven, instructing Annie to take them out in half an hour. As she drove to the yarn store, she found herself thinking about the day Grant had walked out. That had been the worst moment of her life, but every day since had been better than the one before. She was independent and happy; her children were doing well.</p><p>Both Andrew and Annie had worked on improving their relationships with their father, and they were at peace. She knew Grant wasn\u2019t happy, and in many ways she felt sorry for him. However, he\u2019d made his choices, and she couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t concern herself with him anymore. She had her own life to live.</p><p>Luckily there was a space directly in front of A Good Yarn and Bethanne took it, hopped out of her car and placed the appropriate coins in the parking meter. She only had a few minutes before Lydia closed the store.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I wouldn\u2019t make it in time,\u201d she said, walking through the door.</p><p>\u201cBethanne!\u201d Lydia sounded delighted to see her. Coming around the counter, Lydia hugged her, then brought out the skein of pink cashmere she\u2019d put aside. \u201cIt\u2019s the same dye lot as the original,\u201d Lydia assured her. She stepped back to the cash register. \u201cIt\u2019s so wonderful to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a free Friday afternoon next week, so I\u2019ll drop in for the charity knitting session. How\u2019s everyone?\u201d She hadn\u2019t been in two weeks and missed seeing the women who\u2019d become so special to her.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s great,\u201d Lydia told her. \u201cJacqueline is still in seventh heaven over her new granddaughter. She brought pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore pictures?\u201d Bethanne said with a laugh. She paid for her wool, glancing around the store. It was easy to see that the little shop on Blossom Street continued to thrive. She loved the new designer yarns and the increased inventory. Lydia had scored a success, and Bethanne hoped her own fledgling business would emulate it.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell everyone you\u2019ll be by next week?\u201d Lydia asked, handing Bethanne her purchase.</p><p>\u201cWith bells on,\u201d she promised and tucked the skein in its A Good Yarn bag inside her large purse.</p><p>Lydia smiled. \u201cYou look really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Bethanne said, and blushed a bit at the attention. She\u2019d gotten plenty of that lately and wasn\u2019t quite sure why. She felt good and suspected it showed. Life felt good. Her world had been thrown into upheaval, and had taken a long time to right itself.</p><p>When she left the yarn store, she saw that Paul had arrived at the caf\u00e9 and had a table. He stood when she entered, waving. She waved back, saw Alix at the counter and sent her friend a smile before joining Paul.</p><p>\u201cAngela will be here in a few minutes,\u201d he explained, indicating the third mug on the table.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Bethanne asked, pulling out her chair and sitting down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela\u2019s engaged,\u201d Bethanne repeated in shock\u2014before she comprehended his meaning. \u201cTo you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so,\u201d Paul said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Bethanne half stood to hug him. \u201cThat\u2019s just fabulous!\u201d Her instincts had been right, and this news was all the validation she needed. Falling in love with each other would have been easy, but it would\u2019ve been like taking refuge in a safe harbor rather than venturing out into riskier seas. She\u2019d needed courage to take the stand she did. Paul hadn\u2019t wanted to get involved with anyone else, and in the beginning he\u2019d found the transition from potential lover to friend difficult. Time and distance had helped.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever fall this deeply in love again,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s better the second time around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Paul...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The door opened and a tall, lovely brunette walked into the caf\u00e9. Her eyes scanned the room; when she saw Paul, her face relaxed into a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul stood and held out his hands to her, and Bethanne watched as Angela approached him. Paul kissed her on the cheek and she sat down next to Bethanne. She\u2019d met Angela briefly a couple of months back and it had become obvious to her then that this woman was special to Paul.</p><p>\u201cI understand congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided on a winter date, and it would mean the world to both of us if you\u2019d plan our wedding.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled. She\u2019d only arranged one other wedding\u2014Elise and Maverick\u2019s\u2014and if this one went half as well...Nothing would give her greater joy than to be involved in the wedding of her dear friend.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted,\u201d she told them both.</p><p>\u201cAnd like I said,\u201d Paul insisted with his arm around Angela\u2019s shoulders, \u201cyou\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, Bethanne shrugged off his words. The divorce hadn\u2019t disillusioned her about love and marriage. If anything, it\u2019d confirmed the importance of family and commitment. Remarrying wasn\u2019t a priority, but an option\u2014something that might well be part of her future.</p><p>In the meantime, she had her children, her friends, her work. She\u2019d rediscovered herself, become the woman she wanted to be, and found new pleasure in the things she loved to do\u2014like gardening and reading and above all, knitting.</p><p>It was enough.</p> <p>CHAPTER 48</p><p>ELISE BEAUMONT</p><p>Elise glanced at the recipe again, adding flaxseed and blueberries to the mix. She\u2019d taken it upon herself to see to it that Maverick ate healthy, nutritious meals. She believed this would help in his fight against leukemia.</p><p>So far, his progress had been encouraging. Maverick was quick to credit her and the meals she so carefully planned. Elise, however, demurred at his praise; yes, a proper diet played its part, but it was love that had kept Maverick alive this long.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you baking now?\u201d Maverick asked from where he sat in the condo living room, the newspaper on his lap. The view of Seattle was spread out before them.</p><p>\u201cGoodies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe boys love your goodies, you know.\u201d</p><p>Elise grinned. He wasn\u2019t referring to their grandsons, although Luke and John were quite impressed with her baking skills. The minute they walked into the condo they went directly to the cookie jar, anticipating a treat.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will the boys get here?\u201d she asked, and slid the muffin tin into the preheated oven. These \u201cboys\u201d were Maverick\u2019s cronies, who stopped by two and sometimes three times a week for a friendly game of poker. He\u2019d met them at the local poker parlor where he\u2019d first played in order to win a slot in the tournament.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here at three,\u201d he said. He was apparently well-known in the gambling world. His initial failures, during their marriage, had made her angry and fearful. In her fear\u2014and self-righteousness\u2014Elise had preferred to think of him as living from hand to mouth. In reality, he\u2019d become a success. But he didn\u2019t encourage anyone else to choose the life he\u2019d lived, and in fact, dissuaded others from becoming professional gamblers. In retrospect he wished he\u2019d made a different choice.</p><p>Elise joined her husband in the living room and sat on the arm of his chair. He held her around the waist and sighed, his eyes closing. He was tired, she knew. A session of tests at the doctor\u2019s office that day had drained him, but the most recent news had bolstered both their spirits. The progression of the leukemia had slowed considerably. They\u2019d gotten a reprieve. Elise didn\u2019t know how long this would continue, but she figured every single day with him was a blessing she hadn\u2019t anticipated.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a nap before the game?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI think I will.\u201d</p><p>She slipped off the chair and sat across from him as Maverick lay back in the recliner. Reaching for her white wicker basket, Elise unfolded her pattern. She was knitting Maverick a lap robe for times like this. The needles made small clicking sounds. Comforting sounds.</p> <p>They\u2019d been together a year now, and not once had she regretted remarrying Maverick. Every day since then had been a honeymoon. She loved the way he loved their daughter and their grandchildren. He\u2019d seen to Aurora\u2019s future and David\u2019s, and to those of Luke and John with trust funds.</p><p>The matter of Elise\u2019s lawsuit had been resolved. A portion of her down payment had been refunded; it was more than she\u2019d expected and less than she would\u2019ve liked. The money she\u2019d received was currently invested. That chapter of Elise\u2019s life was closed, and she was grateful to have survived it financially.</p><p>She\u2019d never told her knitting friends that Maverick was the one responsible for their good fortune. It\u2019d been tempting, but she\u2019d kept quiet. As Courtney described her beautiful dress and shared the details of the Homecoming dance and the visit with her sister\u2014thanks to the generosity of her fairy godfather\u2014Elise had listened and silently cheered. Tears had gathered in her eyes as she tried to remember each and every word so she could repeat it to Maverick.</p><p>The difference his gift had made to Bethanne was even more striking. She\u2019d told Elise privately about the stranger who\u2019d given her a head start on her business, and how much those few thousand dollars had meant to her. That money had changed everything and had come to her when she most needed it.</p><p>Bethanne had an impressive business vision. Elise wouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything she undertook. A few years from now, Bethanne\u2019s party business could well become a franchise. Her ideas were original, fresh, inventive. Maverick\u2019s generosity had contributed to Bethanne\u2019s success, and someday her friend would give a similar gift of money and encouragement to another struggling entrepreneur. Elise found pleasure and pride in knowing that.</p><p>Not once in all the weeks afterward had Bethanne breathed a word about the money to the women in the knitting group. That was just as well. If Bethanne had said something in addition to what Courtney had already mentioned, their friends might have figured it out. Maverick didn\u2019t want any thanks or displays of appreciation; he preferred to remain anonymous, unacknowledged.</p><p>Elise smiled to herself as she continued knitting. She suspected Lydia knew. She\u2019d never come right out and asked Elise, but she\u2019d casually said one day that there seemed to be a fairy godfather at work in their group. Elise had tried to suggest it must\u2019ve been Courtney\u2019s dad, but Lydia just shook her head. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t bring it up again. Elise didn\u2019t want to mislead a woman she considered one of her best friends.</p><p>She heard the timer on the stove and set aside her knitting to check the cupcakes. Turning off the oven, she took out the muffin tin and placed it on a cooling rack. The scent of warm blueberries filled the kitchen. She intended to slather the cup-cakes with a cream cheese frosting and serve them to Maverick and his friends. Little did the \u201cboys\u201d realize how healthy these desserts were.</p><p>A half hour later, Maverick woke, looking noticeably rested. He glanced at his watch; the game would start in less than twenty minutes.</p><p>Predictably enough, the phone started to ring at three o\u2019clock and Bart, the first of the boys, arrived. He was quickly followed by Al and Fred.</p><p>\u201cSmells mighty good in here,\u201d Bart said, sniffing the air. He winked at Elise. \u201cNo one bakes better\u2019n you, no sir. I\u2019ll bet those taste as good as they smell, too.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled at the blatant flattery. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do to make sure you get one, Bart.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI do appreciate that, Mrs. Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Al and Fred weren\u2019t far behind, staggering playfully toward the kitchen, led by their noses.</p><p>\u201cYou been baking again?\u201d Al asked, hat in his hands, eyes comically wide.</p><p>Maverick shared a secret smile with her. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiling my friends,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThose for us poor old men?\u201d Fred rubbed his hands together. \u201cUs poor hungry old men...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you three stop it,\u201d Elise said, halfheartedly attempting to hold in a laugh. \u201cYou know darn well I always bake on Tuesdays.\u201d</p><p>Bart poked his elbow in Al\u2019s ribs. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we\u2019re here, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you came for the poker,\u201d Maverick teased.</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, they gathered around the kitchen table. Maverick pulled out a deck of cards and shuffled. Each one bought in for twenty dollars; the winner of the \u201ctournament\u201d took home the pot.</p><p>Within minutes, they were involved in their game. Elise frosted the cupcakes, then went back to her knitting. When the men had finished, she served coffee and cupcakes to the accompaniment of much praise and fulsome thanks.</p><p>Maverick caught her eye and she smiled at the man she loved. Her husband smiled back. Being in love did something for a woman, she decided. There was no feeling, no experience, to equal it.</p><p>CHAPTER 49</p><p>\u201cSock knitting teaches us to take one step at a time\u2014cuff, heel, foot, toe\u2014and not to be overwhelmed by the big picture.\u201d</p><p>Ligonier, PA.</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>There\u2019s a lull at the shop, and after a busy morning, I\u2019ve decided to take a break in the office. Margaret will handle the customers while I put my feet up. It\u2019s been rush, rush, rush all morning.</p><p>A Good Yarn is doing well\u2014so well\u2014and I\u2019m grateful. I sometimes feel as if I\u2019m living in a dream. I know I\u2019m not, because the diamond on my finger sparkles and my heart is full of love for Brad and Cody. I\u2019m quite possibly the happiest woman in the world. I\u2019m engaged to marry the hand-so-mest, most wonderful man alive. Within a couple of months, I\u2019ll be living with Brad and Cody and Chase. Whiskers, thankfully, tolerates Cody\u2019s dog and will probably teach him some discipline.</p><p>I don\u2019t think my life could get any better than it is right at this moment.</p><p>When I first opened the doors to A Good Yarn, it was my affirmation of life. Little did I realize, two years ago, what would happen and all the friends I would make. Jacqueline, Carol and Alix have become very dear to me. They were the three who gave me my start.</p><p>I\u2019ve held several classes since the baby blanket class. All of them were good, but none of those relationships matched the closeness I felt with my first three students. Until recently, with the sock class. That was when Elise, Bethanne and Courtney entered the shop and my life. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel as close to another class as I did my original one, but again life has taught me a valuable lesson.</p><p>I recall how difficult Elise was that first day, fretting over her ex-husband\u2019s coming visit. And Bethanne, with her self-esteem shattered by her divorce, and Courtney, a lonely, over-weight teenager struggling with a loss of her own. The four of us connected through knitting\u2014who would\u2019ve thought a pair of socks could change your life? I treasure each one of these women as a true friend, the same way I do Jacqueline, Carol and Alix.</p><p>Then there\u2019s my sister. I never thought the day would come when I\u2019d claim my sister as my very best friend. Well, that day has arrived. We\u2019re closer now than at any other time in our lives. And that special understanding started when she first came to work at the shop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My sister and I are sharing the responsibility of looking after Mom. Her health is declining rapidly and I suspect we won\u2019t have her with us much longer. That makes each day we have her all the more precious. She\u2019s still lonely without Dad, still a bit lost.</p><p>Both Margaret and I work hard at keeping her busy. We make sure she has lots of small things to look forward to each week\u2014a visit, an outing, shopping, a new book. Anything that we know will bring her joy.</p><p>Mom is knitting more and Margaret\u2019s been picking her up on Friday afternoons so she can join the other women who do charity knitting. She enjoys these occasions and feels part of the knitting community. My mother is a fast knitter and she\u2019s contributed enough patches to make an entire blanket for Warm Up America, plus another for the Linus Project. I think Dad would be very pleased to see the three of us working together, knitting.</p><p>I\u2019ve been so caught up in my thoughts that Margaret\u2019s standing directly in front of me before I notice her. \u201cI\u2019m leaving to pick up Mom,\u201d she announces.</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I lower my feet. I\u2019m generally not this tired on a Friday morning, but Brad, Cody and I were at a Mariners\u2019 playoff game last night and it went into extra innings. I didn\u2019t get to bed until after midnight and had to be up early to meet with a yarn sales rep. Brad and Cody, my two sweethearts, are real baseball fans and I\u2019ve learned to love the game, so it wasn\u2019t any sacrifice to be out so late.</p><p>Soon after Margaret\u2019s departure, Elise comes into the shop, carrying her knitting. The changes in Elise since she remarried Maverick would make anyone a believer in marriage! She\u2019s so much more relaxed now and genuinely happy.</p><p>I\u2019ve pretty much figured out that Maverick was our fairy godfather, although I\u2019ve never asked her directly and she hasn\u2019t volunteered the information.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Maverick?\u201d I ask. He almost always accompanies Elise on Fridays. I\u2019ve purchased a special chair for him, so he can read while the rest of us knit and talk. Maverick\u2019s face might be hidden behind a book, but he\u2019s listening. He always was a good listener, or so Elise tells me. Each one of us has more or less adopted Maverick. I know his condition is stable, and although we\u2019re all pleased by that, we worry, too. His immune system has been compromised by the treatments. But Elise is taking good care of him. Those two are so happy together, so accepting of each other. It almost seems that love is what they\u2019re living on now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s parking the car,\u201d Elise says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be along shortly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDoing really well.\u201d From the look in her eyes I know she\u2019s telling the truth, and I\u2019m relieved. \u201cBethanne\u2019s here, too, and I saw Jacqueline and Carol over at the French Caf\u00e9, chatting with Alix. I imagine they won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>A small package had arrived from Courtney earlier in the week, with several patches for the Warm Up America blanket we\u2019re currently working on. She has a whole group of girls in her dorm knitting now. Inside was a long letter that I plan to read to the entire group.</p><p>According to Bethanne, Courtney keeps in touch with Annie and Andrew. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Courtney and Andrew can maintain a long-distance relationship. I know Bethanne has encouraged both of them to date others and I believe they do. Above all, they\u2019re good friends; I hope they stay friends.</p><p>Speaking of Bethanne, I don\u2019t see her as often as I\u2019d like. We\u2019re all so proud of her. And not just because of her success with the business, either. Let me add that she\u2019s planning Brad\u2019s and my wedding, and I wouldn\u2019t trust that to anyone else.</p> <p>No, the real reason for my pride in her is the way she\u2019s virtually reinvented herself, the way she\u2019s found confidence, in herself and in others. As I remember it, she didn\u2019t even sign up for the class on her own. Her daughter made the phone call on her behalf.</p><p>And I feel that we in the class\u2014but especially Elise\u2014can take some of the credit for encouraging that transformation.</p><p>The bell rings above the door and Brad strolls into the shop. We see each other nearly every day now that the date for the wedding\u2019s been set. Alix has volunteered to bake the cake and Jacqueline insists we have the reception at the country club, but Bethanne is the one organizing it all. Margaret has agreed to be my matron of honor, and I have six bridesmaids. Six! It wasn\u2019t hard to decide who I wanted to stand up with me\u2014my dearest friends. My knitting friends.</p><p>\u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d Brad greets me, wheeling his cart with an expert hand. \u201cHow are you this beautiful afternoon?\u201d</p><p>I smile back. Fine, I tell him. Better than fine. Happy and very much in love with him and with life in the shop on Blossom Street. </p> </body></html>"]
