They cry over books, TV shows, those awful abused-animal commercials, and movies\u2014especially movies. Sitting down to purposely watch something you know will make you unhappy? It makes no frigging sense.</p><p>But that\u2019s okay; I\u2019m just going to chalk it up to another thing I will never understand about my girlfriend. Yes\u2014I said girlfriend. Dee Warren is officially my girlfriend.</p><p>One more time for those in the back\u2014girlfriend\u2014Delores\u2014mine.</p> <p>Repeating it might make me sound like a Harry Styles\u2013obsessed prepubescent girl, but I don\u2019t give a damn. Because it was a hard-won victory\u2014if you knew what I had to go through to make her mine, you\u2019d understand.</p><p>Anyway, back to what I was saying. Chicks like to cry\u2014but this isn\u2019t one of those stories. There\u2019s no dying best friends, no dark tortured pasts, no hidden secrets, no sparkly vampire breakups, and no kinky f**kery.</p><p>Well . . . okay . . . there\u2019s some kinky f**kery\u2014but it\u2019s the happy kind.</p><p>This is a story about a player, who meets a slightly crazy girl. They fall in love and the player changes his ways forever. It\u2019s a story you\u2019ve probably heard before, maybe even from my buddy, Drew Evans. But the thing is, while he and Kate were figuring their shit out? There was this whole alternate universe going on with Delores and me that you don\u2019t know about. So stick around, even if you think you already know the ending. Because the greatest part of a road trip isn\u2019t arriving at your destination. It\u2019s all the wild stuff that happens along the way.</p><p>Before we start, there\u2019s some background info you may need to know. First off\u2014Drew\u2019s a great guy, a true best friend. If we were the Rat Pack, he\u2019d be Frank Sinatra, I\u2019d be Dean Martin. Although Drew and I are tight, we differ in our opinions about women. At this point in our tale, he sees himself as a bachelor for life. He\u2019s got all these rules about never bringing a chick to his apartment, never dating someone he works with, and the Cardinal Rule: Never hook up with the same woman twice.</p> <p>I, on the other hand, don\u2019t care where I get laid\u2014my place, her place, the observation deck of the Empire State Building.</p><p>That was a great night.</p><p>I\u2019m also not opposed to seeing someone from the office\u2014though most of the girls in my line of work are stressed out, chain smoking, coffee-obsessed women with an unpleasant chip on their shoulders. I have no problem hanging out with the same woman on multiple occasions, as long as the good times keep rolling. And someday, I imagine myself settling down\u2014marriage, kids, the whole deal.</p><p>But while I\u2019m looking for Mrs. Right? I\u2019m having a blast with all the Ms. Wrongs.</p><p>Secondly, I\u2019m a real glass-half-full kind of person. Nothing gets me down. I have a great life\u2014a good career that lets me enjoy the best man-toys on the market, awesome friends, a weird but loving family. \u201cEmo\u201d doesn\u2019t exist in my vocabulary, but YOLO should\u2019ve been my middle name.</p><p>Next up is Delores Warren\u2014Dee, if you want to stay on her good side. By today\u2019s standards it\u2019s an unusual name, but for her it\u2019s a perfect fit. She\u2019s unusual\u2014different\u2014in all the best kinds of ways. She\u2019s brutally honest, emphasis on \u201cbrutal.\u201d She\u2019s strong and doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what people think of her. She\u2019s true to herself and makes no apologies for what she wants or who she is. She\u2019s wild and beautiful\u2014like an undomesticated thoroughbred that runs best without a saddle.</p> <p>And that was where I almost went wrong. I wanted to tame her. I thought I had the patience for it, but I pushed too hard and pulled too much on the reins. So she broke them.</p><p>Are you offended that I compared the woman I love to a horse? Get the f**k over it\u2014this is not a tale the PC police will enjoy.</p><p>But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Just know that Kate Brooks is our coworker and Delores\u2019s best friend\u2014the Shirley to Dee\u2019s Laverne. And in all the years I\u2019ve known Drew\u2014which is every one of them\u2014I\u2019ve never seen him react to a woman like he reacted to Kate. Their attraction, even though it was mostly antagonistic in the beginning, was palpable. Anybody with eyes could see they had it bad for each other.</p><p>Well . . . anybody but them.</p><p>Kate, like Delores, is a great girl. The type of woman who, in the immortal words of Eddie Murphy in Coming to America, could arouse a man\u2019s intellect as well as his loins.</p><p>You got all that? Great. Let\u2019s get this party started.</p><p>My life changed about four weeks ago. On a normal, average day\u2014when I met a girl who was anything but average.</p><p>Four weeks earlier</p> <p>\u201cMatthew Fisher, Jack O\u2019Shay, Drew Evans, this is Dee-Dee Warren.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no such thing as love at first sight. It\u2019s just not possible. Sorry to ruin your fantasy, but that\u2019s how it is. Ignorance might feel like bliss, but when you peel away the happy layer, it\u2019s still just a lack of information.</p><p>To really love another person, you have to know them\u2014their quirks, their dreams, what pisses them off and makes them smile, their strengths, weaknesses, and flaws. Have you heard that quote from the Bible\u2014the one they always read at weddings: \u201cLove is patient, love is kind . . .\u201d? I have my own version: Love is missing the taste of someone\u2019s morning breath. Thinking they\u2019re beautiful, even when their nose is Rudolph-red and their hair is bird\u2019s nest crazy. Love isn\u2019t putting up with someone in spite of their faults\u2014it\u2019s adoring them because of them.</p><p>Now lust at first sight, that\u2019s very real. And much more common. In fact, when most guys meet a woman, they know within the first five minutes which category of \u201cfuck, kill, marry\u201d they fall into. For guys, the f**k category has a pretty low bar.</p><p>I\u2019d like to tell you the first thing I noticed about Delores was something romantic, like her eyes, or her smile, or the sound of her voice\u2014but it wasn\u2019t. It was her tits. I\u2019ve always been a boob man, and Dee\u2019s set was fantastic. Slightly overflowing in a tight, hot-pink top, pressed together just right to create an enticing cleft of cle**age, beautifully framed by a gray knit sweater.</p><p>Before she uttered her first word to me, I was in lust with Delores Warren\u2019s rack.</p><p>After she banters with Drew for a minute, I steer her attention my way. \u201cSo, Dee-Dee . . . is that short for something? Donna, Deborah?\u201d</p><p>Warm, honey-colored eyes turn my way. But before she can answer, Kate lets the cat out of the bag, \u201cDelores. It\u2019s a family name\u2014her grandmother\u2019s. She hates it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Delores glares playfully at Kate.</p><p>If you want to make an impression on a girl, humor is always a safe bet. It shows a woman you\u2019re clever, smart, confident. If you\u2019ve got balls? Flaunt them.</p><p>Which is why I tell Kate\u2019s friend, \u201cDelores is a gorgeous name, for a gorgeous girl. Plus, it rhymes with clitoris . . . and I really know my way around them. Big fan.\u201d</p><p>As planned, my line gets an instant reaction. She smiles slowly and runs one finger across her lower lip, suggestively. Any time a woman touches her body in response to something a guy\u2019s said? It\u2019s a good sign.</p><p>Then, she breaks our gaze and says to us all, \u201cAnyhoo. I have to jet, gotta get to work. Nice meeting you, boys.\u201d Dee-Dee hugs Kate and winks at me. Also a good sign.</p><p>I watch her as she walks out and can\u2019t help but notice the rear view is almost as awesome as the front.</p><p>Drew asks Kate, \u201cShe\u2019s got to get to work? I thought the strip clubs didn\u2019t open until four.\u201d</p><p>I have to agree with him on that one. When you\u2019ve been to as many strip clubs as we have, you start to see a pattern. The clothes the women wear\u2014though minimal\u2014are similar. Like they all shop at the same store. And Dee is definitely rocking the Strippers \u201cR\u201d Us vibe.</p><p>Though it may just be wishful thinking on my part. It would be awesome if she were a dancer. Not only are they limber\u2014they party hard. Totally uninhibited. The fact that they generally have a low opinion of the male species is a plus too. Because it means the simplest act of chivalry is returned with extreme gratitude. And a grateful stripper is a blow-job giving stripper.</p><p>But Kate dashes my hopes. \u201cDee\u2019s not a stripper. She just dresses like that to throw people off. So they\u2019re shocked when they find out what she really does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a rocket scientist.\u201d</p><p>Jack reads my mind. \u201cYou\u2019re f**king with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not. Delores is a chemist. One of her clients is NASA. Her lab works on improving the efficiency of the fuel they use on the space shuttles.\u201d She shivers. \u201cDee-Dee Warren with access to highly explosive substances . . . it\u2019s something I try to not think about.\u201d</p><p>And now my curiosity is almost as strong as my lust. I\u2019ve always had a taste for the unusual\u2014the exotic\u2014in women, music, books. And unlike Drew, whose apartment is meticulously decorated, I tend to gravitate toward pieces with a history. Even if they don\u2019t match, nontraditional is always interesting.</p><p>\u201cBrooks, you\u2019ve got to hook me up. I\u2019m a nice guy. Let me take your friend out. She won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Kate thinks about it. Then she says, \u201cOkay. Sure. You seem like Dee\u2019s type.\u201d She hands me a neon-green business card. \u201cBut I have to warn you. She\u2019s the love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em-with-bruises type of girl. If you\u2019re looking for a good time for a night or two, then definitely call her. If you\u2019re looking for anything deeper than that, I\u2019d stay away.\u201d</p><p>And now I know how Charlie felt when he was handed the last golden ticket to Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory.</p><p>I stand up from the table and kiss Kate on the cheek. \u201cYou . . . are my new best friend.\u201d</p><p>I consider hugging her too\u2014just to f**k with my scowling buddy\u2014but I don\u2019t want to risk getting nut-punched. I have plans for my nuts. They need to be in top form.</p><p>Kate tells Drew not to pout, and he makes a comment about her boobs, but I\u2019m only half listening. Because I\u2019m too busy thinking about where I\u2019ll be meeting Delores Warren for a drink\u2014or several. And all the fantastically lascivious activities that are sure to follow.</p><p>So that\u2019s how it started. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be complicated\u2014no love at first sight, no grand gestures, no hard feelings. A sure thing, a good time, a one-night stand with an option for a second. That\u2019s what Kate told me Dee was into, and that\u2019s all I was looking for. All I thought it would ever be.</p><p>Elvis Presley was right. Fools really do rush in. And if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, I\u2019m a major f**king fool.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>A lot of people live for their job. Not because they\u2019re forced to financially, but because what they do for a living is who they are\u2014their profession gives them confidence, purpose, maybe even an adrenaline rush. It\u2019s not always a bad thing. The office is a businessman\u2019s playground, a courtroom to a lawyer feels like home. And if I ever need a surgeon? Only a full-blown workaholic is getting near me.</p><p>That being said, I\u2019m an investment banker at one of the most respected and prestigious firms in the city. I\u2019m good at my job, the paycheck is nice, I serve my clients well\u2014keep them happy and keep new ones coming in. But I wouldn\u2019t say I love it. It\u2019s not a passion. When I die, I\u2019m not going to go out wishing I had spent more time at the office.</p><p>I\u2019m similar to my father in that respect. He\u2019s committed to the firm he, John, and George founded, but he doesn\u2019t let the obligations interfere with his golf game. And he\u2019s an old-fashioned family man\u2014he always was. Growing up, dinner was served at six o\u2019clock sharp. Every night. If my ass wasn\u2019t in that dining room chair, I\u2019d better have been in the Emergency Room, or there was hell to pay. Dinnertime discussion focused heavily on \u201cWhat did you do today?\u201d and \u201cNothing\u201d was never an acceptable response. Being an only child, there weren\u2019t any siblings to distract my parents from keeping tabs on me. My old man was well aware of the potential pitfalls of growing up privileged in New York City, so he made damn sure I stayed out of trouble.</p><p>Well . . . most of the time \u0327 anyway.</p><p>Every kid deserves to get into a little trouble. It helps them learn to be resourceful, think on their feet. And if a teenager isn\u2019t allowed to have some kind of life \u0327 they\u2019ll go totally ape-shit when they get to college. Which could end badly.</p><p>My father\u2019s three basic rules were: Keep your grades up, keep your criminal record clean, and keep your pants zipped.</p><p>Two out of three ain\u2019t bad, right?</p><p>Even though my dad knows the importance of family and separating business from pleasure, that doesn\u2019t mean I get a free pass at the firm because I\u2019m his son. Actually, I think he rides my ass a lot harder than the other employees\u2019, just to avoid any claims of favoritism. Impropriety at the office is something he would never tolerate. He\u2019d come down on it like Gallagher\u2019s sledgehammer on a watermelon.</p><p>Which is another reason my dad and his partners were able to build such a successful business\u2014because each of them brings their own unique talents to the team. John Evans, Drew and Alexandra\u2019s father, is like Face from the A-Team. He\u2019s the charmer, the convincer\u2014he makes sure the clients are happy and the employees are not only content, but enthusiastic. Then there\u2019s George Reinhart\u2014Steven\u2019s dad. George is the brains of the operation. My dad and John aren\u2019t exactly lacking in that department, but George is like Stephen Hawking without the ALS. He\u2019s the only guy I know who actually enjoys the technical, number-punching aspect of investment banking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then there\u2019s my father, Frank\u2014he\u2019s the muscle. The intimidator. He\u2019s a man of few words, which means when he speaks, your ears better f**king be listening, because he\u2019s saying something worth hearing. And he has no problem firing people. My dad makes Donald Trump look like a pu**y. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the sole family breadwinner or a pregnant woman in her last trimester\u2014if you\u2019re not getting the job done, you\u2019re out on your ass. Tears don\u2019t move him, and second chances are rare. Ever since I was a kid, he\u2019d say, \u201cMatthew, family is family, friends are friends, and business is business. Don\u2019t confuse them.\u201d</p><p>Even though he\u2019s a hard-ass, he\u2019s always fair. Honest. Keep your i\u2019s dotted and your t\u2019s crossed and there won\u2019t be a problem. I always make sure my i\u2019s are dotted and my t\u2019s are crossed. Not just because I prefer to keep my job, but because . . . I\u2019d never want to disappoint my old man. Sadly, that attitude\u2019s become scarce. So many little ass**les running around today give no thought to making their parents proud\u2014but it\u2019s what Drew, Alexandra, Steven, and I were raised on.</p><p>Anyway, back to the real story.</p><p>After lunch with the guys, I spend the rest of the afternoon at my desk, drafting a contract and making nice with clients on the telephone. Around six o\u2019clock, I\u2019m packing up when Steven comes breezing through my door.</p> <p>\u201cGuess who spent their lunch break surrounded by rabid gamers in line for the latest fix?\u201d</p><p>I slip a folder into my briefcase for some non-enjoyable reading before bed. If you don\u2019t want to live life chained to a desk? Time management is crucial.</p><p>I answer, \u201cThat would be you?\u201d</p><p>He smiles and nods. \u201cDamn straight, brother. And look what I scored.\u201d</p><p>He holds up a square cellophane-wrapped package.</p> <p>Back in my father\u2019s day, guys would occasionally get together for a fishing trip or drinks at the local pub to unwind after a long day\u2019s work. But what Steven holds in his hands is more addictive than alcohol and a hell of a lot more fun that baiting a hook.</p><p>It\u2019s the latest edition of Call of Duty.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d I take the disk from his hand and flip it over, checking out the updated real-to-life graphics.</p><p>\u201cYou up for a mission tonight? Around nine?\u201d</p><p>In case you don\u2019t already know\u2014Steven is married. And he\u2019s not just married\u2014he\u2019s married to Alexandra-formerly-Evans, also known as The Bitch. But you didn\u2019t hear that last part from me.</p><p>If a regular wife is a ball at the end of a chain? Alexandra\u2019s a Sherman tank. She keeps Steven on a short leash\u2014doesn\u2019t let him come out to the bars on Saturday night, only allows him one poker game a month. Even though Steven\u2019s not the straying kind, Alexandra thinks hanging out with us carefree, single friends would be a bad influence on her husband. And . . . she\u2019s probably right.</p> <p>But, like any good warden knows, you can only restrict the inmates so much. You can lock them in a cage ten hours a day, ban yard time\u2014but try and take away their cigarettes? You\u2019ve got a major revolt on your hands.</p><p>Xbox is Steven\u2019s one permissible vice. As long as his playtime doesn\u2019t disturb their daughter, Mackenzie, after she\u2019s down for the night. One time, Steven got a little too loud during an ambush and woke Mackenzie up. He was on lockdown for a week. Lesson learned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, dude, count me in.\u201d</p><p>I hand him the game back and he says, \u201cCool. See you at twenty-one hundred.\u201d Then he salutes me and heads out the door.</p><p>I pick up my briefcase and gym bag and walk out a few minutes later. On the way to the elevator, I swing by Drew\u2019s office.</p><p>He\u2019s bent over his paper-covered desk, making notes with a red pen on a document.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He glances up, \u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cXbox tonight, nine o\u2019clock. Steven\u2019s got the new Call of Duty.\u201d</p><p>With his attention back on the paper, Drew says, \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna be here until ten, at least.\u201d</p><p>The people I mentioned who live for the job? Drew Evans is that kind of people.</p><p>But it works for him. He\u2019s not a bedraggled, stressed-out clock puncher\u2014he\u2019s the exact opposite. Drew genuinely enjoys the grind; he gets a rush out of negotiating a deal, even if it\u2019s a hard sell. Because he knows he can close it, that he\u2019s probably the only one who can.</p><p>Well . . . at least until a certain dark-haired woman joined our ranks.</p><p>I look across the hall to Kate\u2019s office. She\u2019s at her desk, the mirror image of Drew\u2014but way hotter.</p><p>Leaning against the chair, I say, \u201cDid you hear Kate\u2019s close to signing the Pharamatab account?\u201d</p><p>Still not looking up, he mutters grumpily, \u201cYeah, I heard.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cYou better step it up, man. If she makes that deal, your old man\u2019s gonna be so psyched I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he wants to adopt her. And incest\u2014even between adopted siblings\u2014is illegal in New York.\u201d</p><p>Busting balls is what friends do. It\u2019s the equivalent of women giving those half-cheek half-air kisses to each other. A sign of affection.</p><p>\u201cBut I guess incest wouldn\u2019t be an option anyway, with the way she keeps shooting you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow me.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cNot tonight, dear. I have a headache.\u201d Then I walk toward the door. \u201cHave a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>After leaving the office I hop on the subway, like I do every day after work, to go to the gym. It\u2019s in Brooklyn, a real bare bones kind of place. Some would call it a dump, but to me it\u2019s a diamond in the rough. The floor is hard and dirty and worn red punching bags line the back wall. There are weights stacked in front of a cracked mirror, a milk crate filled with jump ropes beside the lone rowing machine. There aren\u2019t any spandex-wearing, bored housewives looking to hook up or show off their latest cosmetic enhancement. There are no elliptical machines or high-tech treadmills like the ones that can be found in the workout room of my building. I come here to sweat and strain my muscles to their limit with time-tested calisthenics. And most of all, I come for the boxing ring in the center of the gym.</p><p>I was twelve the first time I watched Rocky. It takes place in Philly, but it could\u2019ve been in New York. I\u2019ve been a fan of boxing ever since. I\u2019m not going to quit the day job to train for the heavyweight title or anything, but there\u2019s no better workout than a few rounds in the ring against a decent opponent.</p><p>Ronny Butler\u2014the fiftyish, stubbly chinned guy in the gray sweatshirt with the thick gold crucifix around his neck who\u2019s in the ring\u2019s corner, yelling out critiques to the two sparring partners dancing around each other\u2014he\u2019s the owner. Ronny\u2019s no Mickey, but he\u2019s a good man, and an even better trainer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Through the years, I\u2019ve pieced together bits of information he\u2019s let slip when I\u2019ve been the last one here at closing. In the late eighties, Ronny was a Wall Street big shot, living the dream. Then, on a Friday night, he and his family were driving out to the Hamptons for the weekend. Because he\u2019d gotten jammed up at work, they\u2019d had a late start, and a drowsy truck driver nodded off at the wheel, flew across the median into oncoming traffic\u2014and smacked headfirst into Ronny\u2019s BMW. He made it out of the accident with a concussion and a shattered femur. His wife and daughter didn\u2019t make it out at all.</p><p>He spent a few years drowning in a bottle, a few more sobering up. Then he used the settlement money to buy this place. He doesn\u2019t come off as bitter or sad, but I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s happy either. I think the gym keeps him going, gives him a reason to get up in the morning.</p><p>\u201cBack up, Shawnasee!\u201d Ronny yells at the fighter who\u2019s got his sparring partner pinned against the ropes, pummeling his ribs. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Vegas, for f**k\u2019s sake, let the guy breathe.\u201d</p><p>That Shawnasee kid\u2019s an ass**le. You know the type\u2014young, hot-headed, the kind of prick who would get out of his car to beat down some poor schmuck for cutting him off on the freeway. Which is another reason I like boxing\u2014it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to put idiots in their places without being charged with assault. Shawnasee\u2019s been trying to goad me into the ring for a few months now, but it\u2019s no fun fighting someone with piss-poor technique. No matter how hard they hit, they\u2019ve got no shot at winning. I\u2019m waiting until he gets better\u2014then I\u2019ll kick his ass.</p> <p>I catch Ronny\u2019s eye as he breaks up the fighters and greet him with a nod. Then I head back to the locker room, change out of my suit, and hit the bag for half an hour. Next, I use the rowing machine until my biceps are screaming and my legs feel like Jell-O. I finish off with ten minutes of speed jump roping, which might sound easy, but it\u2019s not. You try jumping rope for half that time and I\u2019ll bet you feel like you\u2019re going into cardiac arrest.</p><p>When the ring is empty, I climb in and go three rounds against Joe Wilson, an uptown lawyer I\u2019ve sparred with before. Joe puts up a good fight, but the session clearly goes my way. Afterward, we tap gloves affably, and I go back into the locker room and grab my stuff. I smack Ronny\u2019s back on the way out, jog to the subway, and catch my train home.</p><p>I\u2019m not ashamed to say my parents hooked me up with my apartment after college\u2014in those days, this place was slightly above my pay grade. The location is great\u2014walking distance to the office and a killer view of Central Park. Because I\u2019ve lived here since college, it lacks the stylish consistency you\u2019d typically expect in the home of a successful businessman. Take a look around.</p><p>Black leather sofas face a big-screen television with a top-of-the-line sound and gaming system sitting on the glass shelves below it. The coffee table is also glass, but it\u2019s chipped around the edges from years of contact with reclining feet and glass bottles. A shadowy painting of a mountaintop by a renowned Japanese artist hangs on one wall, and my prized collection of vintage baseball caps hangs from hooks opposite it. A lighted display case is perched in the corner, showing off the crystal etched EXCELLENCE IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT award I received last year . . . and the authentic Boba Fett helmet that was worn during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. Built in, dark-wood bookshelves are lined with collectible sports memorabilia, books on art, photography, and banking, and about a dozen mismatched frames with photographs of family and friends from the best times in my life. Photographs I took myself.</p><p>Photography is a hobby of mine. You\u2019ll hear more about that later.</p> <p>In the dining room, instead of a totally useless formal set of table and chairs, there\u2019s a pool table and a Space Invaders arcade game. But my kitchen is fully set up\u2014black granite counters, Italian marble floors, stainless steel appliances, and cookware that Emeril would be honored to own. I like to cook, and I do it well.</p><p>The way to a man\u2019s heart may be through his stomach\u2014but it\u2019s also the most direct route down a girl\u2019s pants. For women, a guy who knows his way around a kitchen is a big selling point. Tell me I\u2019m wrong.</p><p>Anyway, my apartment is kick-ass. It\u2019s large, but comfortable, impressive without being intimidating. After hosing down in the glass-enclosed, triple-headed shower, I towel off and spend a minute looking at my reflection in the full-length mirror. My normally light brown hair is dark from being wet and sticks up at odd angles from the towel. I could use a cut\u2014it gets pretty-boy curly if I let it grow too long. I rub the stubble along my squared jaw, but I don\u2019t feel like shaving. I turn to the side and flex my bicep, proud of the muscle that bulges. I\u2019m not bulky like a meathead, but I\u2019m tight, lean, and powerful, without a centimeter to pinch from my six pack, let alone an inch.</p><p>Checking myself out in a mirror might seem douchey to you, but, trust me\u2014all guys do it. We just don\u2019t like to be caught doing it. But when you put as much time into your body as I do, the payoff makes it worth it.</p><p>I pull on a pair of silk boxers then heat up a bowl of leftover pasta and chicken. I\u2019m not Italian, but I\u2019d eat this every day of the week if I could. It\u2019s about eight thirty by the time I finish washing the dishes. Yes, I am a man who washes his own dishes.</p><p>Be jealous, ladies\u2014I\u2019m a rare breed.</p> <p>Then I flop back on my awesome, king-size bed and grab the golden ticket from the pocket of my discarded pants.</p><p>I finger the letters on the bright green cardstock.</p><p>DEE WARREN</p><p>CHEMIST</p><p>LINTRUM FUELS</p><p>And I remember the soft, smooth flesh that swelled from the confines of her tight, pink shirt. My dick twitches\u2014guess he remembers it too.</p><p>Normally I\u2019d wait a day or two to call a girl like Delores. Timing is everything. Looking too eager is a rookie mistake\u2014women enjoy being panted after by puppies, not men.</p><p>But it\u2019s already Wednesday night, and I\u2019m hoping to meet up with Dee on Friday. The twenty-first century is the age of \u201cMaybe He\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d and \u201cDating for Dummies\u201d and \u201cThe Girlfriends\u2019 Guide to Dating,\u201d which means calling a chick for a random hookup isn\u2019t as easy as it used to be. There are all these frigging rules now\u2014I found that out the hard way.</p> <p>Like if a guy wants to meet up with you the same night that he calls, you\u2019re supposed to say \u201cno,\u201d because that means he doesn\u2019t respect you. And, if he wants to take you out on a Tuesday, that\u2019s a sign he\u2019s got better plans for Saturday night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trying to keep up with the changing edicts is tougher than keeping track of the goddamn health care debate in Congress. It\u2019s like a minefield\u2014one wrong step and your c**k won\u2019t be getting any action for a long time. But, if getting laid were easy, everyone would be doing it. It . . . and pretty much nothing else.</p><p>Which brings me to my next thought: I know feminists always complain about how men have all the power. But when it comes to dating\u2014in America, at least? That\u2019s not really the case. In the bars, on the weekends, it\u2019s ladies\u2019 choice 24/7. They have their pick of the litter because single men will never reject a come-on.</p><p>Picture it: The music\u2019s pumping, bodies are grinding, and a non-hideous female approaches a dude having a drink at the bar. She says, \u201cI want to f**k your brains out.\u201d He replies, \u201cNah, I\u2019m not really in the mood for sex tonight.\u201d SAID NO MAN EVER.</p><p>Chicks never have to worry about getting shot down\u2014as long as they\u2019re not shooting too far above their pay grade. They never have to stress about when they\u2019re going to get lucky. For women, sex is an all-you-can-eat buffet\u2014they just have to choose a dish. God created men with a strong sex drive to ensure the survival of the species. Be fruitful and multiply and all that. For guys like me, who know what the f**k they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not exactly difficult. But for my not-as-skilled brethren, getting some can be a daunting task.</p> <p>A slight buzz of adrenaline rushes through me as I pick up the phone to dial the cell number on the business card. It\u2019s not that I feel nervous, more like . . . cautious anticipation. My hand taps my leg in time to Enter Sandman by Metallica, and my stomach tightens as her phone rings.</p><p>I imagine she\u2019ll remember me\u2014I did make quite the impression after all, and I assume she\u2019ll be receptive to a meeting up\u2014maybe even eager. What I don\u2019t expect is for her voice to slam into my eardrum as she yells: \u201cNo, jackass, I don\u2019t want to hear the song again! Frigging call Kate if you need an audience!\u201d</p><p>I pull the phone a little ways away from my ear. And I check the number to make sure it\u2019s the right one. It is.</p><p>Then I say, \u201cUh . . . hello? Is this Dee?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause as she realizes I\u2019m not jackass.</p> <p>Then she replies, \u201cYes, this is Dee. Who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Matthew Fisher. I work with Kate\u2014we met at the diner this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Another brief pause, and then her voice lightens, \u201cOh yeah. Clit-boy, right?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle deeply, not entirely sure I like that nickname, but at least I made my mark. Note to self: Use that line again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about yelling. My cousin\u2019s been up my ass all day.\u201d</p> <p>My c**k stirs from the ass talk, and I have to stop myself from offering to trade places with this cousin.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Matthew Fisher?\u201d</p><p>My imagination gets crazy. And detailed. Oh, the things she could do . . .</p><p>For a moment I wonder if she\u2019s talking like this on purpose or if I\u2019m just a horny mess.</p><p>I play it safe. \u201cI was wondering if you wanted to get together sometime? For a drink?\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s pause right here. Because, despite my earlier complaints about the modern complexities men face when trying to hook up, I feel it\u2019s my duty to educate others, get the word out, about how to decode guy-speak. Think of me as a studlier version of Edward Snowden or Julian Assange. Maybe I should start my own website\u2014I\u2019d call it DickiLeaks. On second thought, that\u2019s a shitty name. Sounds like an STD symptom.</p><p>Remember the mental game of \u201cfuck, kill, marry\u201d I mentioned earlier? If a man asks you to get a drink or hang out, you are squarely in the \u201cfuck\u201d category. Nope, don\u2019t argue\u2014it\u2019s true. If a guy asks you for a date or dinner, maybe even a movie, you\u2019re probably in the \u201cfuck\u201d category, but you have potential for upward mobility.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to base your response to a dude\u2019s proposition on this information; I just thought you\u2019d want to know.</p> <p>Now, back to the phone conversation.</p><p>I can hear a smile in her voice as she accepts my invite. \u201cI\u2019m always up for a drink.\u201d</p><p>Up. More sexual innuendo. Definitely not my imagination. I am so getting laid.</p><p>\u201cCool. You free on Friday?\u201d</p><p>Silence meets my ears for a beat, until she suggests, \u201cHow about tonight?\u201d</p><p>Wow. Guess Delores Warren missed the chapter requiring two days\u2019 advance notice for all screwing offers.</p><p>Lucky me.</p><p>And then she elaborates. \u201cI mean, there could be a blackout, a water shortage, aliens could finally decide to invade and enslave the entire human race . . .\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s one I haven\u2019t heard before.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d be shit out of luck. Why wait for Friday?\u201d</p><p>I like the way this girl thinks. As the saying goes, \u201cDon\u2019t put off till tomorrow anyone you could be doing today.\u201d Or . . . close enough.</p><p>\u201cTonight works for me,\u201d I readily agree. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>Some girls take forever and a day to get ready. It\u2019s f**king annoying. Going to the gym or the beach? Shouldn\u2019t require prep time, ladies.</p><p>\u201cHow about an hour?\u201d</p><p>Two points for Dee\u2014great tits and low maintenance. I think I\u2019m in love.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your address? I\u2019ll swing by and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>My building has private parking for tenants. Lots of New Yorkers spend thousands of dollars a month for parking spaces\u2014only to not drive their cars because of city traffic. Auto congestion doesn\u2019t bug me; I always leave myself extra time. Like I said before\u2014time management is key.</p><p>And another thing: I don\u2019t have a car. I drive a custom-built Ducati Monster 1100 S. I\u2019m not looking to put on a cut and join an outlaw MC or anything, but riding is another hobby of mine. Few things in life feel as great as cruising down an open highway on a blue-skied, crisp fall day when the leaves are just starting to change. It\u2019s as close to flying as a human being can get.</p><p>I take the bike out at every available opportunity. Sometimes a girl will bitch about being cold or messing up her hair\u2014but when all is said and done: Chicks dig motorcycles.</p><p>Delores responds, \u201cUm . . . how about I just meet you?\u201d</p><p>This is a smart move for a single woman. Just like you wouldn\u2019t give out your social security number online, you don\u2019t give out your address to some guy you barely know. The world is a f**ked-up place, and women especially need to do everything they can to make sure the f**ked up doesn\u2019t find its way to their front door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But, unfortunately, it also means the hog is staying home tonight. I\u2019m a little sad about that.</p><p>\u201cMeeting up sounds good.\u201d</p><p>Before I can suggest a place, Dee takes charge. \u201cYou know Stitch\u2019s, on West Thirty-seventh?\u201d</p><p>I do know it. It\u2019s low-key with good drinks, live music, and a comfortable lounge. Because it\u2019s a Wednesday night, it won\u2019t be packed, but no bar in New York is ever empty.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m familiar with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see you in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>After we hang up, I don\u2019t get dressed right away. I\u2019m not picky about my clothes, like some young semi-asexual professionals, but I\u2019m not a slob either. I can be ready to walk out the door in seven minutes flat. So I grab the folder from my briefcase and use the extra time to finish the work reading I planned to do before bed. Because it looks like I won\u2019t be hitting the sheets any time soon\u2014and when I do, I\u2019m definitely not going to be alone.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>I get to Stitch\u2019s early. I drink a beer at the bar, then step outside for a cigarette. Yes\u2014I\u2019m a smoker. Break out the hammer and nails and commence with the crucifixion.</p><p>I\u2019m aware it\u2019s unhealthy. I don\u2019t need to see the internal organs of deceased cancer patients on those creepy-ass commercials to understand it\u2019s a bad habit\u2014thank you, Mayor Bloomberg. Making me go outside doesn\u2019t stop me from lighting up\u2014it just pisses me off. It\u2019s an inconvenience, not a deterrent.</p><p>But I\u2019m considerate about it. I don\u2019t toss my butts on the street, I don\u2019t blow smoke in the faces of the elderly or children. Alexandra would literally slit my throat if I ever lit up anywhere near Mackenzie. Literally.</p><p>I do plan on quitting . . . eventually.</p><p>But for now, the long-term damage I might be doing to my lungs falls second to the fact that I like to smoke. It feels good. It\u2019s really just that simple. And you can keep your bar pretzels to yourself, because nothing goes better with a cold beer than a cigarette. It\u2019s as good as a mom\u2019s old-fashioned PB&amp;J.</p><p>I snuff out my cigarette on the wall of the building and throw it into the trash can on the street. Then I pop an Altoids in my mouth. Because\u2014like I said\u2014I\u2019m considerate. I don\u2019t know if Dee is a fellow smoker or not, but nobody wants to slide their tongue into another person\u2019s mouth and taste ashtray. And getting Dee\u2019s tongue in my mouth . . . among other places . . . is definitely on the schedule for tonight\u2019s festivities.</p> <p>I head back in the bar and order a second beer. I take a swig and notice the front door opening. I watch as she walks in.</p><p>Did I think Delores was a hottie when I met her this afternoon? I need to get my vision checked. Because she\u2019s so much more.</p><p>Her strawberry blond hair is down, curled under at the ends, pulled back from her face with a thick black hair band. A black, tuxedo-like jacket covers her torso, with a low-cut white tube top underneath. Short, white shorts barely peek out from the bottom of the jacket, revealing long, creamy, toned legs. She finishes the look with white sky-high heels. Red lipstick accentuates her mouth.</p><p>She\u2019s gorgeous\u2014shockingly stunning. Put her in a black-and-white photo and she could easily be in a Calvin Klein campaign. Her business card isn\u2019t Charlie\u2019s Golden Ticket\u2014it\u2019s the lottery kind\u2014and I just hit the jackpot.</p><p>She scans the room and spots me from the doorway. I wave, coolly. She smiles back, revealing straight, shiny teeth.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says as she approaches.</p><p>\u201cHello\u2014that jacket looks great on you.\u201d You can\u2019t go wrong by starting off with a compliment. Girls love them.</p><p>Her smile turns into a smirk as she teases, \u201cLet me guess\u2014\u2018But I\u2019d look better out of it\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>I chuckle. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say that. I would never give a line that cheesy.\u201d Then I shrug. \u201cI was going to say, \u2018It\u2019d look even better on my bedroom floor.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A rich, deep laugh escapes her throat. \u201cYeah\u2014\u2019cause there\u2019s nothing cheesy about that.\u201d</p><p>I pull out a bar stool and she sits.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Without a pause she answers, \u201cMartini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my martinis just like my sex.\u201d She winks flirtatiously. \u201cDirty is always better.\u201d</p><p>Yes\u2014I\u2019m definitely in love.</p><p>The bartender comes to us, but before I can order for her, Dee starts giving specific instructions on how she wants her drink made.</p><p>\u201cTwo ounces of gin, heavy on the vermouth, just a dash of olive juice . . .\u201d</p><p>The babyfaced, plaid-shirted bartender, who barely looks twenty-one, seems lost. Dee notices and stands up. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ll just demonstrate\u2014it\u2019ll be easier.\u201d She turns, hops backwards onto the bar, and swings her legs over the top\u2014while I discreetly try to get a peek up her shorts. If she\u2019s wearing underwear, it\u2019s gotta be a thong.</p><p>My c**k processes this information by straining against my jeans, hoping for a peek of his own.</p><p>Dee stands up on the business side of the bar and quickly mixes her drink, explaining every move to the unperturbed bartender. She tosses an olive into the air and catches it expertly with her mouth, before sinking the two-olived toothpick into the clear-liquid-filled glass.</p><p>She places it on the bar and motions to it with an open palm. \u201cAnd there you have it\u2014the perfect Dirty Martini.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve always believed you can tell a lot about a person by what they drink. Beer is laid back, easy-going, or cheap, depending on the brand. Wine coolers tend to be immature or nostalgic. Cristal and Dom P\u00e9rignon imbibers are flashy and try too hard to impress\u2014there are many champagnes that are just as expensive and exquisite, but lesser known.</p><p>What does Dee\u2019s choice of beverage tell me about her? She\u2019s complicated, with very specific, but refined, tastes. And she\u2019s outspoken, bold without being bitchy. The kind of girl who can send back her steak to the kitchen if it\u2019s cooked wrong, in a way that doesn\u2019t make the waiter want to spit in her food.</p><p>The bartender raises his brows and gives me a friendly look. \u201cYou got a live one here, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Dee swings back over the bar as I say, \u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>Once Delores is seated back on the stool, I comment, \u201cThat was impressive. So, I guess you\u2019re big on the micromanaging, huh?\u201d</p><p>She sips her drink. \u201cI bartended through college\u2014it made me very particular about my poison.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a drag off my beer and move into the small talk portion of the evening. \u201cKate tells me you\u2019re a chemist. What\u2019s that like?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing with a chemistry set every day and getting paid to do it. I enjoy analyzing things\u2014breaking them down to their smallest components\u2014then f**king with them a little. Seeing what other substances they play nice with . . . or don\u2019t. The don\u2019t part can get pretty exciting. Sort of makes me feel like I\u2019m on a bomb squad.\u201d</p><p>She stirs her olives in the glass. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a banker?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds very unexciting.\u201d</p><p>My head tilts left to right as I consider her comment. \u201cDepends on your outlook. Some deals are a high-stakes gamble. Making money is never boring.\u201d</p><p>Dee turns in her chair, facing me.</p><p>Body language is important. Typically, a person\u2019s movements are subconscious, but understanding the feelings behind them can either guide you to the Promised Land or get your ass locked outside heaven\u2019s door. If a girl folds her arms or leans back, that generally means you\u2019re coming on too strong or she\u2019s just not interested in what you\u2019re selling. Eye contact, open arms, full frontal attention are all sure signs she\u2019s feeling you\u2014and is hungry for more.</p><p>Her eyes quickly trail my body, head to toe. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a banker.\u201d</p> <p>I grin. \u201cWhat does a banker look like?\u201d</p><p>She scans the other patrons at the bar and in the lounge. Her gaze settles on a middle-aged, balding dude in a cheap suit, hunkered down over a double scotch, whose expression implies he\u2019s lost his life savings in a stock market crash.</p><p>Dee points at him with her crimson-nail-painted pinkie finger. \u201cHim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a mortician. Or a pedophile.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and downs the rest of her martini.</p><p>Leaning close to her, I ask, \u201cIf not a banker, what do I look like?\u201d</p> <p>She smiles slowly and scrapes the olives off the toothpick with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a Chippendales dancer.\u201d</p><p>Fabulous answer. I don\u2019t really need to explain to you why, do I?</p><p>In a low, seductive voice I say, \u201cI do have some great moves. If banking doesn\u2019t work out, Chippendales is Plan B.\u201d</p><p>I motion to the bartender for another round. Delores watches him work closely, and he must not screw it up too badly, because she smiles when he places the drink before her.</p><p>Then, she says to me, \u201cSo . . . your buddy Drew\u2014he\u2019s been giving my girl a hard time. Not a smart thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew has a weird relationship with competition. He thrives on it, but it also pisses him off. Kate hasn\u2019t exactly been taking it easy on him, either. She brings her A-game to the office\u2014I think she can hold her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you feel free to let him know he should watch his step. I\u2019m very protective of Katie\u2014we Ohioans stick together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re in New York now. We\u2019re \u2018Every Man for His-Fucking-Self.\u2019 It\u2019s the second state motto\u2014right after \u2018The City That Never Sleeps.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Her eyes shine as she laughs. And I think the first drink might be hitting her hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>My head leans back in exasperation. \u201cGreat. Cute. The adjective every man wants to hear.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again, and I\u2019m struck by how much I\u2019m enjoying myself. Dee Warren is a cool girl\u2014unreserved, quick-witted, funny. Even if I don\u2019t end up nailing her, the night won\u2019t be a total loss.</p><p>That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not dying to get her out of here and see what\u2019s\u2014or, preferably, what\u2019s not\u2014under those tiny shorts. But, it\u2019d be like rich icing on an already f**k-awesome cake.</p><p>I veer back toward small talk. \u201cYou\u2019re from Ohio?\u201d</p><p>She tastes her drink and nods. \u201cYes, the original Podunk, USA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, no love for the hometown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Greenville was a great town to grow up in, but it\u2019s sort of like the Hotel California. People check in, but they almost never leave. If all you want out of life is to get married and have babies, it\u2019s the place to be. But . . . that wasn\u2019t what I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for, Dee?\u201d</p><p>She thinks for a moment before she answers. \u201cI want . . . life. Newness. Discovery. Change. It\u2019s why I like the city so much. It\u2019s alive\u2014never stagnant. You can walk down a block and go down that same block a week later and it\u2019ll be totally different. New people, new sights and smells\u2014the smells aren\u2019t always good, but that\u2019s a small price to pay.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle.</p><p>Then she goes on. \u201cMy mom used to say I reminded her of a dog on a leash that never learned how to heel. Always pulling on the chain, raring to go. There\u2019s a country song with lyrics I like: \u2018I don\u2019t want easy, I want crazy.\u2019 \u201d She shrugs, a little shyly. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Everything she said\u2014they\u2019re my favorite parts about the city I grew up in too. Life is too damn short to stay safe, to stay the same.</p><p>My cell phone buzzes, but I ignore it. Checking your phone in the middle of a conversation, even if it\u2019s with a one-nighter, is just rude. Low class.</p><p>Dee asks me what my Zodiac sign is, but I make her tell me hers first. Some people are really into signs\u2014I\u2019ve been ditched on more than one occasion by a horrified Leo or Aquarius when they found out I\u2019m a Capricorn. Since then, I\u2019m not above fudging my birth date if needed.</p><p>In this case, I didn\u2019t have to. Dee\u2019s a Scorpio, which is supposed to be super hot with Capricorns in the sack. Personally, I think the whole thing is a crock of shit. But, if you want to play, you\u2019ve got to know the rules of the game. Including potential fouls.</p><p>Dee nurses her second drink as the conversation turns toward family and friends. Without getting too deep, she tells me about Billy, her more-like-a-brother cousin, and her single mother who raised them both. She touches on her lifelong friendship with Kate Brooks and a few surprising wild-child incidents during their teen years that are just too embarrassing not to mention to Kate at the office tomorrow.</p><p>I fill her in on Drew and Steven and Alexandra and how growing up with them saved me from ever feeling like an only child. I tell her about the coolest four-year-old I know, Mackenzie, and that I would hang with that kid every day of the week if I could.</p><p>By the time I finish my fourth beer, two and a half hours have flown by. When Dee hits the bathroom, I whip out my phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have six texts.

If you make a move on my widow I\u2019ll haunt you.</p><p>And finally, the last one just says:</p> <p>Fucker.</p><p>I laugh out loud and send him an apologetic text, telling him something suddenly came up. Steven\u2019s great at reading between the lines:</p><p>You mean your dick suddenly came up. What happened to bros before hoes? You owe me. I expect payment in the form of babysitting hours so I can take my wife out . . . or stay in. ;)</p><p>Personally, I think he spends too much time with his wife as it is\u2014as demonstrated by the winky face in his text.</p><p>Dee comes back from the bathroom and stands close to my chair. \u201cYou want to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>Yes, please.</p> <p>With a devastating grin, I answer, \u201cAbsolutely. You want to go to my place? I\u2019d love to show you the view.\u201d</p><p>She glances at my crotch. \u201cWhat view would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind you\u2019ll never want to stop looking at, baby.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles. \u201cI was thinking more along the lines of dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re thinking alike. Horizontal is my favorite dance.\u201d</p><p>She runs her hand up the sleeve of my black button-down shirt. \u201cThe vertical kind is a nice prelude\u2014gets me in the mood. There\u2019s a club around the corner from my apartment. Their Wednesday night DJ is the shit. You want to come with me, Clit-boy?\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over hers and rub my thumb slowly against it. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like that nickname.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs unapologetically. \u201cToo bad. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. You\u2019re Clit-boy until you give me a reason to think of you as something else.\u201d</p> <p>I lean in closer. Goose bumps rise on the flesh of her chest as my breath tickles her ear. \u201cBy the end of this night, I\u2019ll have you calling me \u2018God.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Her breathing picks up slightly, and the pulse point at her neck thumps faster. I want to put my mouth on it, suck on the skin and experience her taste.</p><p>But I don\u2019t get the chance.</p><p>Delores steps back, her amber eyes practically glowing with anticipation. And she commands, \u201cYou pay the tab, I\u2019ll get the taxi.\u201d</p><p>Independence in a woman is damn sexy. Only insecure losers get turned on by a chick who clings like you\u2019re the oxygen she needs to survive. Although it\u2019s obvious Delores is the stand-on-her-own-two-feet kind of girl, I like that she lets me pay the tab. I would\u2019ve insisted on it anyway. Opening a door, paying a bill: These are not digs against a lady\u2019s capabilities. Sometimes a guy just wants to do the old-fashioned thing.</p><p>Let us.</p><p>Think of it as considerate prepayment against our future screwups, which are pretty much guaranteed to occur.</p><p>I take care of the bartender and join Dee on the sidewalk, where she stands next to an awaiting cab. And\u2014get this\u2014Delores reaches out and opens the door to the taxi for me. There\u2019s a playful gleam in her eye that makes me suspect she can read my mind. I just smile, say thanks, and get in.</p><p>The club Delores suggested is called Greenhouse, in SoHo. Although I\u2019ve heard of it, this is the first time I\u2019ve walked through its doors. It\u2019s surprisingly crowded. The bar area walls and ceiling are coated with moss and lit up with blue, red, and green spotlights. The dance floor has a cave motif, with long jagged crystals hanging from the ceiling in hues of blue, purple, and pink. It\u2019s dimly lit\u2014shadowy\u2014perfect for some up against the wall action. That\u2019ll come in handy later on.</p><p>The music is loud, too noisy for any kind of conversation, but that\u2019s fine with me. Talking is nice\u2014action is better. We get our drinks and grab a table near the dance floor. Dee takes a sip from her glass, puts it down on the table, and gives me a sexy, \u201cwatch this\u201d kind of smile before making a beeline for the dance floor.</p><p>I sit down at the table, lean comfortably back in the chair, knees spread, content to caress her with my eyes for now. She closes her eyes and rocks her head in time with the beat of the music. Her hips sway, and her arms rise over her head. The blue and pink lights dance over her hair\u2014lighting her up\u2014making her seem magical. The music gets faster, louder, and Dee keeps up. Shaking her shoulders and her ass, bending her knees and sinking toward the floor, before swirling back upward.</p><p>She knows how to move, and it makes me want her more. I glance around and notice Delores has gained the attention of several guys\u2014make that every guy\u2014in the club. They watch her dance with appreciative, slimy smiles on their faces and hoping-to-tap-that gleams in their eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m not usually a possessive person. I\u2019ve gone to clubs with girls before and ended the evening with both of us leaving with someone else. It\u2019s par for the course.</p><p>But at the moment, my fists are clenching, ready to shove the first f**ker who tries to approach Delores through the wall and out to the street. It pisses me off that they\u2019re even looking at her\u2014that she\u2019s fodder for their wishful thinking and deviant desires.</p><p>Maybe I feel like this because I haven\u2019t screwed her yet. Maybe I don\u2019t want to share a dessert I haven\u2019t gotten to taste.</p><p>Or maybe, it\u2019s because Delores Warren is just . . . different . . . in a way I can\u2019t yet explain. What I know about her, I like\u2014a lot\u2014and there\u2019s a part of me I haven\u2019t consciously acknowledged with a deep craving to know more.</p><p>The music changes as I stand. \u201cWake Me Up\u201d by Avicii pours out of the speakers and washes over the room. The crowd hums their approval. I walk onto the dance floor, straight to Delores.</p><p>The beginning of the song is slow, heavy with acoustic guitar. Dee\u2019s body sways side to side in time, her long hair swinging out behind her, baring her neck. I step up behind her and wrap one arm around her waist, resting my palm on her stomach, over her jacket\u2014pulling her gently back against me.</p><p>She tenses for a split second, opens her eyes and turns her head to the side. Then she sees that it\u2019s me. And she smiles.</p><p>She relaxes against me, her back to my chest, and I lean forward, pressing us together. Her ass nestles perfectly against my dick, which hardened the moment she started dancing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think she feels it\u2014she must.</p><p>She leans forward, bending a little at her waist, and moves her hips in tight circles, rubbing right against where my body is screaming for contact.</p><p>If feels fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>I bend my knees and move with the music, even though my focus is solely on Dee.</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to brag . . . well, okay . . . I\u2019ll brag. I\u2019m a good dancer. It\u2019s a lot like screwing, finding the right rhythm, staying attuned to your partner\u2019s moves and responding accordingly.</p><p>I\u2019ll rip the tongue out of anyone who\u2019d let this get out, but when I was a kid, my mother made me take lessons. Drew, Steven, and I all did. Not the flashy, sequined costume kind\u2014thank Christ\u2014but the ballroom kind. It was a year or two before Alexandra\u2019s cotillion. Yes\u2014in our social circle, girls have cotillions, and knowing how to dance like a gentleman is a must. We all hated it. Drew and I had a detailed plan to run away and live in the Museum of Natural History until the danger passed, but it didn\u2019t work out.</p><p>Still, as miserable as I was, I\u2019m grateful for those lessons now. Because a kid who can dance is a f**king pansy, but a man who can dance is smooth\u2014sophisticated.</p><p>For hip-hop club dancing, you need some natural rhythm, something that poor son of a bitch Steven is sorely lacking. But for a guy like me, with some inherent ability and former training? I kill it on the dance floor.</p><p>The synthesized portion of the song takes over\u2014faster, more primal, with a strong bass. Dee straightens up and wraps her arms around my neck, behind her. I have one hand on her hip, holding her steady as I thrust against her. My other hand creeps under her jacket, to the taught, warm skin of her stomach.</p><p>I feel the vibration of her moan as my hand strokes and climbs higher.</p><p>When the music slows down once more, Dee turns in my arms, facing me. With her heels, we\u2019re almost nose-to-nose. I\u2019m caught in the dark gaze of her eyes as the singer croons about traveling around the world, staying young, and winning love.</p><p>The beat picks up again, but our eyes hold. Our bodies move against each other, hot and needy. My fingers dig into the flesh of Dee\u2019s ass, pushing her harder against me.</p><p>To the lyrics of a man not knowing how lost he was until he found what was missing, Dee\u2019s palm caresses my face. And it feels tender and intimate.</p><p>Meaningful.</p><p>I lower my head and press my lips to hers. And she\u2019s right there with me, opening for me\u2014warm and wet\u2014taking everything I have to give and kissing me back with equal ardor. Both my arms wrap around her, the dancing forgotten. One hand stays on her lower back, while the other buries in the softness of her hair as our mouths move together. Her hands cling to my shoulders, kneading the muscles, pulling me to her.</p><p>Have you ever had a moment when you think to yourself, this is going to change everything? From this point on, there will be a before, an after, and this event will forever divide the two?</p><p>Most people don\u2019t. They\u2019re too caught up at the time to recognize the significance of what\u2019s happening.</p><p>That\u2019s how I was.</p><p>But looking back now\u2014this was it. That first, scorching, perfect kiss. This was the moment that would determine the rest of my life. And nothing after it would ever be the same.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>We walk back to Dee\u2019s apartment. Stumble might be a more appropriate word.</p><p>Dry-hump would fit too.</p><p>I have the overwhelming need to kiss her every few steps\u2014to pull her to me, or press her against the wall of a building to gain the necessary friction. And she\u2019s in no way passive\u2014dragging her fingernails along the bare skin of my abs, dipping her hands into my pants to squeeze my ass. We\u2019re like two hormone-driven teenagers, making out in the school hallway, who don\u2019t give a shit if they get caught.</p> <p>We eventually arrive outside her apartment door. I stand behind her as she fiddles with the double locks\u2014grinding my pelvis against her ass, cupping both tits in my hands, massaging and teasing those beautiful attributes. Once we\u2019re inside, Dee crashes against me, standing on her toes to give me an intense, wet, tongue-tangling kiss. Her hands are all over my hair, pausing in their exploration just long enough for me to rip the jacket off her body. Then I bend low and make quick work of those minuscule shorts, leaving Dee wearing the white tube top and a string thong, with a scarce lace triangle.</p><p>I thought Delores was beautiful clothed, but naked\u2014she\u2019s breathtaking. Long, lean legs, narrow hips, a tight stomach with skin so soft it feels like a caress. She\u2019s not overly sculpted; she has a yoga body\u2014slim with the suggestion of firm muscles just below the surface. On my knees, I unbutton my shirt. Dee bends at the waist and pushes it off me, her hands grazing my back\u2019s physique appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so f**king hot.\u201d She sighs.</p><p>Already using the new nickname, and I haven\u2019t even made her come yet. I\u2019m good.</p><p>Without pause, I spread her knees wide enough to fit between them. Her upper body uses the wall behind her for support. And I place a long, openmouthed kiss against her cloth-covered cunt. Delores\u2019s chin rises and she keens. Her scent is sweet, fruity, with a hint of spice\u2014like a ripe apple with a touch of cinnamon. I drag her thong from her body, craving full contact. With my moist, heated tongue, I trace her cropped, flaxen landing strip, then I move lower to lick and nibble the rim of her pu**y. Done with the warm-up, I sink into her, laving and sucking, making her whimper and buck.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t talking shit when I said I know my way around a clit. Most guys think heading straight for the hot-button is the way to go\u2014but they\u2019re wrong. Too much pressure, applied too fast, isn\u2019t enjoyable, might even be uncomfortable for a woman. You have to tease it, gradually stimulate it, until it\u2019s stiff and reaching and pleading to be fondled. Once Dee is at that breaking point, I open her lips with my fingers and dance over her knotted bud with my tongue.</p><p>She screams\u2014in relief and decadent bliss. I lick her with more force, up and down, without ever losing contact, then I slide two fingers into her sodden, clenching pu**y. Her hips thrust against my face and her hands hold me in place as she comes with an openmouthed moan.</p><p>With the sound of Dee\u2019s heavy breaths still in my ears, I stand up and wrap an arm around her waist. She sags against me, pleasure spent and wobbly. I lift her feet from the floor, but she doesn\u2019t seem to have the strength to wrap her legs around me. Her lips seek mine, and her arms cling to my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBedroom?\u201d I ask between kisses.</p><p>\u201cLast door on the left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My tense legs carry both of us to the room. When I step in, I don\u2019t take in my surroundings or notice the d\u00e9cor\u2014my senses are solely attuned to Dee and my own raging desire. Slightly recovered from her come-coma, Delores sits on the edge of the bed and beckons me forward with entreating amber eyes. Holding my gaze, she unbuckles my pants\u2014the hiss of the zipper and our labored breathing making the only sounds. She pushes the clothing down, and I step out of them. She eyes me eagerly, like a treasure hunter seeking a fervently sought bounty.</p><p>My c**k is at his best\u2014long, thick, painfully willing. Delores licks her palm.</p><p>And it\u2019s the sexiest f**king thing I have ever seen. Bold and brazen.</p><p>Then she encases my dick in her slippery, searing hand, gripping it firmly, jerking tenderly. I move closer, without really thinking, and Dee takes it as a sign to bring her mouth into play. I watch as she licks me from base to tip, swirling around the foreskin, before taking me fully into her mouth\u2014so deep I feel the back of her throat.</p><p>My eyes roll closed. I grunt and I curse and I beg for more. Dee doesn\u2019t disappoint\u2014plunging me in and out of her heavenly f**king mouth over and over. But when she takes my balls in her hand\u2014rolling, rubbing them, tugging in the most delectable way\u2014I have to put the brakes on. I\u2019m afraid I may blow my load\u2014and I\u2019ve got way too many ideas for that to happen now.</p><p>I grasp a handful of her hair and ease her off. Then I lean down and kiss her as blood pounds in my eardrums. She lays back and takes me with her until we\u2019re stomach-to-stomach, thigh-to-thigh. I rip at the remaining fabric of her tube top and yank it down, revealing two plump, gorgeously full tits.</p><p>And on one, is a winking diamond piercing.</p><p>Holy mother of f**k.</p><p>My c**k grows harder, weeping at the sight. I attack her br**sts like a gluttonous animal\u2014sucking and biting, grasping and tugging with my hands. My mouth covers her pierced nipple, tasting cold metal and warm flesh. I pull at it with my teeth and lap it with my tongue. Dee writhes and whimpers below me, scratching my back with her nails, leaving scalding, sensuous gouges in their wake.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, Matthew,\u201d Dee wails. \u201cI need you to f**k me, now.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, I retrieve a condom from my wallet and roll it on in record time. Holding her ankles, I pull her to me, so her ass is at the edge of the bed. I drag the head of my dick over her needy pu**y, teasing at the opening.</p><p>Then I look her in the eyes and ask, \u201cHow . . . how do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard,\u201d she moans. \u201cHard and deep. I want to feel every f**king inch of you inside me.\u201d</p><p>I thrust inside harshly, as deep as I can. Dee\u2019s back bows off the bed and she screams, \u201cYes! Please . . . yes.\u201d</p><p>I pull out slowly, until just the head remains in her, then I push back in, circling my hips, rubbing against her clit when I\u2019m buried balls-deep.</p><p>This is lust at its finest\u2014primal passion, visceral hunger.</p><p>I keep the pace Dee craves, f**king the breath out of her with every thrust. Until she\u2019s reaching for me, begging for faster. I cover her with my body, and she wraps her arms around my neck, tasting my mouth as I drive into her furiously.</p><p>Her cheek is pressed against mine when she comes\u2014eyes closed, crying my name over and over, a phenomenal sound that I\u2019ll never forget. And as her orgasm clenches my cock, I come too\u2014so exquisitely long and hard, I\u2019m pretty sure I blacked the hell out.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing. Groundbreaking. Easily the greatest sex of my life. And while I\u2019m still inside her, before my heartbeat is able to relax, I know that Dee Warren is like no other woman who has ever come before.</p><p>After we get our breaths back, Delores gets up and disappears into the bathroom then exits a few minutes later wearing a multicolored, paisley, silk robe. I grab my pants off the floor, fish out the pack of cigarettes from my pocket, and ask her, \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>She opens a window, then retrieves a half-smoked joint from the wooden jewelry box on her dresser. She holds it up. \u201cSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>I lay my head back on one bent arm and light up. Dee slides into the bed beside me, putting an ashtray on my chest as she tokes up. Her robe falls open, exposing her magnificently pierced breast. I blow out a line of smoke and run my finger around the ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the story behind this?\u201d</p> <p>She inhales deeply, smoke escaping her lips as she tells me, \u201cRemember how I told you Billy, Kate, and I grew up together?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cBilly\u2019s the youngest, only by a few months. When he turned twenty-one, we all got trashed celebrating. Kate and Billy had tattoos done. I got pierced.\u201d</p><p>I tug gently on the ring, touching and testing it out like a kid with a new toy on Christmas morning. \u201cIt\u2019s sexy as hell. But I\u2019m curious, why didn\u2019t you get a tattoo?\u201d</p><p>She snuffs out the dead bud in the ashtray. \u201cTattoos are too much of a commitment. I don\u2019t like having anything on\u2014or in\u2014my body that I can\u2019t get rid of.\u201d</p><p>I put out my smoke and move the ashtray to the bedside table. Then I turn on my side to face Dee.</p><p>Her hand trails down my stomach and wraps around my cock, brushing her thumb across the foreskin. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story behind this? I thought all Catholics had to be cut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s Judaism.\u201d Then I explain, \u201cI was a sickly newborn\u2014nothing major, but enough for my mother to be wary of anything that might\u2019ve caused an unnecessary complication.\u201d</p><p>For some insane reason, my parents assumed I\u2019d have a circumcision performed when I was a strong, healthy adult. Like I would ever\u2014ever\u2014let a scalpel anywhere near my dick unless my life depended on it.</p><p>And maybe not even then.</p><p>Yes, in case you\u2019re wondering, there were a few girls in high school who were slightly . . . unsure about how to proceed with a non\u2013cookie cutter cock. But once they took it for a test ride and realized it works the same as all the other models, it was in high demand.</p><p>She continues to stroke me until I\u2019m hard and hot in her hand. Then she looks down and says, \u201cI like it. It\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>I grip Delores\u2019s hips, roll onto my back, and lift her over me so she\u2019s straddling my waist. \u201cOkay, you officially suck with adjectives. Pussies are pretty, not dicks.\u201d</p><p>Her robe falls fully open and I lick my thumb then press it to her clit to show her just how pretty I think her pu**y is. Fucking gorgeous.</p><p>Dee starts with a giggle but ends with a breathy moan. \u201cEnlighten me. What adjective is suitably masculine for a mighty dick?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hips mimic my thumb\u2019s movements, rotating in tight circles.</p><p>\u201cMighty is a good start. Scary works. Powerful, impressive are always winners.\u201d</p><p>I rub with more pressure. Her hips move faster and in ever-widening circles. She pants. \u201cI\u2019ll keep those in mind for next time.\u201d Then she bites her lip and looks me in the eyes. \u201cI love to f**k when I\u2019m high.\u201d</p><p>She rises higher on her knees, lining us up.</p> <p>\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m going to love it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, that was awesome,\u201d Dee exclaims into the pillow, where she\u2019s just planted her face.</p><p>On my knees behind her, I remove condom number two with a tissue and collapse next to her. \u201cIt really f**king was.\u201d</p><p>Doggy style never disappoints.</p><p>She lifts her head and looks at the bedside clock. \u201cDamn. I have to get up for work in four hours.\u201d</p> <p>Just to clarify\u2014this is my cue to leave. It\u2019s the nice way of saying, Thanks for the sex. Good-bye. Most of my one-night stands aren\u2019t sleepovers. Unless I\u2019m completely wiped out, I prefer to sleep in my own bed.</p><p>I stand up and start to get dressed. I zip my pants, but still shirtless, I tell Dee, \u201cI had a great time tonight.\u201d</p><p>She rolls over to her back, making no attempt to hide her naked glory. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>My eyes trail over her lustrous, after-sex-sheen-covered skin, settling on the nipple piercing that begs for more playtime. \u201cI want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Dee smirks. \u201cYou mean you want to screw me again.\u201d</p><p>I slip my arms into the sleeves of my shirt and admit, \u201cBaby, that goes without saying.\u201d I pick my pack of cigarettes off the floor and put them in my pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p> <p>She responds with a short bark of laughter and an eye roll. She grabs the silk robe and stands beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, slightly confused.</p><p>She shakes her head condescendingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019m not the kind of woman you have to make promises to, that you have no intention of keeping. It was fun, let\u2019s just leave it at that. If I never hear from you again, that\u2019s okay too.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t the reaction I expect from a chick I spent the last hours giving multiple orgasms to. Most of the time, they\u2019re asking to check my phone to make sure their digits are in my contact list. Demanding specifics\u2014dates and times when their phone will be ringing.</p><p>Dee\u2019s attitude is refreshing. And intriguing. And definitely challenging.</p><p>As we walk down her hallway, I insist, \u201cThat\u2019d be terrific . . . except, you will be hearing from me again.\u201d</p><p>She pats my shoulder. \u201cSure I will. But, if it\u2019s all the same to you, I won\u2019t hold my breath.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand from my shoulder and kiss her knuckles. She watches. And the smirk falls from her face and is replaced with . . . surprise. Yearning.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath\u201d\u2014I wink\u2014\u201cjust make sure you\u2019re waiting by the phone.\u201d</p><p>Then she\u2019s smiling again. She holds the door open, but before I step through it, I lean in close and kiss her cheek. \u201cGood night Dee.\u201d</p><p>Her hand covers the spot my lips just touched. And her honey-colored eyes meet mine. With a trace of sadness in her voice she says, \u201cGood-bye Matthew.\u201d</p><p>When she closes the door behind me, I stick around until I hear all the locks click into place. Then I head home for some well-deserved shut-eye.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>On Thursday night, there\u2019s a Columbia University fundraising dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel. Normally, I\u2019d send a check and skip the dinner. But Alexandra is one of the organizers, so attendance is mandatory. Although raising Mackenzie is a full-time job, Alexandra\u2019s always been an overachiever and a multitasker. Like many of the women in her station\u2014stay-at-home Manhattanite moms with money to spare\u2014she wants to give back to the community. Plus, I think philanthropic activities help her feel connected to the outside world when her everyday life has fallen into a black hole of Barney episodes, macaroni necklaces, and playdates that could easily turn her brilliant brain to mush. Steven says she\u2019s a lot more agreeable when she\u2019s planning an event\u2014but, when D-Day actually arrives, she has a tendency to get stressed out. Bitchy . . . if you will.</p><p>You\u2019ve been warned.</p><p>I\u2019m standing with Drew and Lexi, overlooking the elegantly decorated room filled with tuxedo- and cocktail-dress wearing Columbia alums. Seems like a success to me\u2014hors d\u2019oeuvres are being passed, drinks are flowing, chatter and laughter abound. Though her expression is serene, Alexandra\u2019s eyes dart around the room with the exactitude of a long-range sniper, scanning for potential targets.</p><p>\u201cCan I leave yet?\u201d Drew asks his sister.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexandra spits out in a way that tells me this isn\u2019t the first time Drew\u2019s submitted this request. \u201cIt\u2019s a party\u2014eat, drink, mingle.\u201d</p><p>Drew scowls. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously been away from the party scene for far too long. This isn\u2019t a party. This is an excuse for old biddies to whip out their beaded dresses and compare the carats in their diamond rings.\u201d He takes a sip of wine. \u201cAlthough, the wine is excellent. Good choice.\u201d</p><p>Lexi takes a drink from her own glass. \u201cWine loosens lips . . . and wallets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tequila makes the clothes fall off,\u201d I offer with an eyebrow wiggle.</p><p>Just then an extra-large woman with dark, beehive-styled hair and heavy makeup, wearing a pool-table-green gown, approaches us.</p><p>Under his breath, Drew quips, \u201cLet\u2019s hope the tequila is locked up nice and tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexandra, my dear,\u201d she cackles. \u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourself! This soiree will be the talk of the town for days to come.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hand presses humbly against the chest of her white gown. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind, Mrs. Sinclair.\u201d</p><p>Sinclair. I know that name. She\u2019s old money\u2014her grandfather made a fortune in steel during the turn of the century construction boon. And her nephew, the heir apparent, is a piss-poor CEO with a legendary coke habit. Here\u2019s a lesson for you: Money can\u2019t buy class, but it can buy a boatload of calamity.</p><p>Alexandra turns Mrs. Sinclair\u2019s attention to me. \u201cYou\u2019re acquainted with our dear friend Matthew Fisher?\u201d</p><p>New York society is a lot like the mob\u2014if you\u2019re not a friend of ours or part of our thing, they want nothing to do with you.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019re Estelle\u2019s boy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod my head respectfully. \u201cLovely to see you, Mrs. Sinclair.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra continues with, \u201cAnd have you met my brother, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>Drew, ever the gentleman, greets her with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Sinclair\u2019s eyes sparkle as she regards him. And she fans herself with one pudgy hand. \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t met . . . but I\u2019ve heard such stories about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVicious rumors.\u201d Drew winks. \u201cThat just happen to be true.\u201d</p><p>Judging by her quick breaths and the flush of her cheeks, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a high probability Mrs. Sinclair may actually pass out. It\u2019d certainly add some excitement to the evening. But\u2014she doesn\u2019t. An old friend that hasn\u2019t seen her in years hobbles by and drags Mrs. Sinclair away.</p><p>Alone once more, Drew tries again. \u201cNow, can I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop asking me that. We haven\u2019t even sat down to dinner yet,\u201d Alexandra hisses.</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t whine . . . but he\u2019s close. And he speaks for both of us as he says, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be here. I came, I smiled, I wrote you a check. Unlike some people, I actually have better things to do with my time.\u201d</p> <p>Before the squabble gets too heated, someone across the room catches Alexandra\u2019s attention. Her eyes widen, but her face falls . . . with disappointment. She ignores her brother and gawks. Drew and I follow her line of vision.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see her.</p><p>Almost every guy has a woman like her in his past. For some sad sons of bitches, there\u2019s more than one. The girl who f**ked him over, broke his heart, shattered his self respect. They say the first cut is the deepest . . . and she cut me straight to the bone.</p><p>Shakespeare wrote, \u201cO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face . . .\u201d And if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d swear he composed it with Rosaline Nicolette Du Bois Carrington in mind.</p><p>We met during our second year at Columbia, and we dated seriously for two years. Rosaline is intelligent, charming, an expert equestrian. She wasn\u2019t interested in frat parties or the bar scene, preferring instead to spend her time engaging in highbrow discussions about art and travel. I thought she was perfect: the woman I\u2019d marry, have children with\u2014the girl I\u2019d love when she was wrinkled and gray, and who would love me in return.</p><p>Sally Jansen may have been the first girl I ever loved, but Rosaline . . . she was the last.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t seen her since graduation. Six years. But she looks exactly the same\u2014a heart-shaped face; classic but full cheekbones that make her appear both sophisticated and innocent; crystal blue eyes with an exotic slant; plump, smiling lips; thick, dark-brown tresses; and a long, lean body that would bring any man straight to his knees. I watch her move across the room, her cotton-candy-pink dress swaying with every step.</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k would you invite her?\u201d Drew asks.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite her\u2014Julian\u2019s on the board. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d show up.\u201d</p><p>Julian is Rosaline\u2019s husband. He\u2019s ten years older and about ten times wealthier than any of us.</p><p>\u201cI thought they were in Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came back to the city last week.\u201d</p><p>As Rosaline reaches our trio, Drew and Alexandra move in front of me\u2014like bodyguards. Rosaline flashes a captivating smile\u2014one that I used to know well. \u201cAlexandra, Drew, it\u2019s so nice to see you. How long has it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly long enough,\u201d Alexandra replies with a deceptive smile.</p> <p>This is The Bitch, in full force. To the outside world, Alexandra is a refined lady\u2014but simmering below the surface is a ferocious, protective person who\u2019ll pull her hair back, take her earrings off, and open up a major can of whoop-ass on anyone she perceives as a threat to the people she loves. And she has a special kind of hate for my ex.</p><p>I didn\u2019t find out Rosaline was screwing around until after she dumped me. Getting kicked to the curb was rough, but discovering she\u2019d been f**king someone else the entire time . . . that was utterly crushing. In the days that followed, Drew was the one who took me out, got me drunk, made sure I got laid. But Lexi . . . she was the one I cried to. It\u2019s not pu**y to admit I cried\u2014shedding a few tears is perfectly acceptable after your chest is ripped open and your heart is peeled like a potato.</p><p>Following in his sister\u2019s footsteps, Drew says, \u201cI read there was a Listeria outbreak in Europe. You seem to have escaped unscathed. Pity.\u201d</p><p>Rosaline\u2019s smile stays in place as she ignores the barely veiled insults. \u201cYes, we enjoyed our European travels\u2014the culture, the history. But Julian missed New York. We\u2019ll be here until the spring.\u201d</p><p>Separately, the Evans siblings are capable of throwing some deadly verbal daggers\u2014you\u2019ve seen them in action. But together? They\u2019re a tag team that would put professional wrestlers to shame.</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s voice lowers to a whisper. \u201cI hate to be the one to tell you this, Rosaline . . . well, actually . . . I don\u2019t mind telling you at all. I\u2019ve heard your Julian is having a torrid affair with his secretary.\u201d She touches a thoughtful finger to her lips. \u201cOr was it the nanny?\u201d</p><p>Drew adds, \u201cI\u2019ve heard he\u2019s screwing them both.\u201d</p><p>Again, Rosaline\u2019s composure doesn\u2019t waver. I used to think her poise was an asset\u2014a sign of sophistication and maturity. But looking at her now, she just seems . . . unfeeling. Distant. Annoyingly passive.</p><p>She sighs sweetly. \u201cMen do so love their variety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Alexandra counters.</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Drew admits. \u201cBut, then again, I haven\u2019t vowed to forsake all others.\u201d</p><p>She folds her hands demurely. \u201cI\u2019ve resigned myself to Julian\u2019s dalliances. As long as I\u2019m the woman he comes home to, it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>Drew was always annoyed by his inability to goad a reaction out of Rosaline, no matter how crude he was. He gets a sick sense of amusement out of being able to drive people to the brink of assault. Which is why he digs deep and says, \u201cUntil he realizes the icebox you call a twat just isn\u2019t worth the price of admission anymore. That could be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Rosaline chuckles softly. \u201cYou always did have a colorful way with words, Drew.\u201d</p><p>And another round goes to the Stepford Wife.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to see you both again. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d Just like that, they\u2019ve been dismissed. Rosaline steps around Alexandra and Drew and approaches me from the rear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run a hand through my hair and turn to face my heartbreaker. She looks at me kindly, sympathetically, the way a nurse would behold a patient who\u2019s recovering from a life-threatening sickness. \u201cHello, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m determined to show her that my recuperation is complete. \u201cRosaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I reply coolly. \u201cAnd you . . . haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s weird talking to her again, even after all these years\u2014especially after all these years. There\u2019s no attraction, no hatred, no strong emotion at all. There\u2019s some regret\u2014a part of me wishes I could reach back in time and beat the shit out of my younger self for being so stupid. And blind. But that\u2019s more about me. As for Rosaline? She\u2019s just someone who I used to know . . . that I never really knew at all. Even though I\u2019m intimately acquainted with every swell and crevice of her body, she\u2019s still a stranger.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cSo . . . you have a son?\u201d</p><p>Did I forget to mention that? Yeah\u2014Rosaline didn\u2019t only screw around on me, she got knocked up. I\u2019m fairly certain that was her plan all along. Like with the royal family, the heir and the spare? I was the spare, just in case things didn\u2019t work out with Julian. Luckily for me, his dart hit the bull\u2019s-eye first.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYes, Conrad.\u201d Poor kid. \u201cHe\u2019s at boarding school in Switzerland.\u201d</p><p>I do the math in my head. \u201cBoarding school? Isn\u2019t he, like, six years old?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be six next month.\u201d I must look dumbfounded, because she adds, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that he have the right start in life. His school will provide that for him.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Pointing out the extreme f**ked-upness of this philosophy really isn\u2019t worth my time. \u201cRight. Of course it will.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m just about to extract myself from the conversation when Julian Wolfe comes striding on over. He\u2019s decent looking for a guy, tall but thin, with white-blond hair and a pale complexion. Kind of reminds me of a high-ranking Nazi officer.</p><p>\u201cRosaline, there are some important individuals I need you to meet.\u201d Then he notices me. \u201cHello, Fisher.\u201d He doesn\u2019t extend his hand, and I sure as hell don\u2019t offer mine.</p><p>I just nod my head. \u201cJulian.\u201d</p><p>Rosaline and Julian are prime examples of why people need a hobby. If money is your only passion, you\u2019re going to be a miserable human being. And eventually, your hobby will be spreading that misery and being a general douche to everyone you meet.</p> <p>\u201cSorry to steal her away. Again.\u201d He chuckles, because that\u2019s his idea of a joke.</p><p>And although it\u2019s more of a woman\u2019s game, if he wants to play with words, I\u2019m up for the challenge. \u201cNo, take her off my hands, please. You\u2019re doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Julian sobers. And Rosaline touches my arm. \u201cIt was good to see you, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d I tell them both.</p><p>Once they walk away, Drew comes up next to me. \u201cBet you\u2019re glad you dodged that bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>He nudges me with his elbow. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Take a good look\u2014this is as close to \u201ca moment\u201d as guys like Drew and I will ever get. We could hang out all day and not utter a single word about anything important going on in our lives. Words aren\u2019t necessary\u2014\u2019cause when the chips are down, we\u2019ll be in each other\u2019s corner.</p> <p>I assure him, \u201cYeah, man, I\u2019m top-notch. Like you said, dodged a bullet.\u201d</p><p>We return to Alexandra\u2019s side, and I can tell by his expression that he\u2019s going to ask to be excused again. But then, Drew seems to decide on a different strategy. He smiles deviously. \u201cHey look\u2014Squeaky\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Alexandra inquires.</p><p>Drew gestures with his wineglass. \u201cCurly haired brunette, in the blue dress near the bar.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s head bobs until she spots the lady in question. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . Alyson Bradford.\u201d</p><p>Drew shrugs. \u201cShe\u2019ll always be Squeaky to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call her Squeaky?\u201d</p><p>Mentally I shake my head. Because Alexandra should\u2019ve known better.</p><p>\u201cShe squeaks when she comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Casually, Drew explains, \u201cLike a dog\u2019s chew toy.\u201d He holds up his hand, opening and closing it. \u201cSqueak, squeak, squeak, squeeeeeak. At least she did when we were seventeen, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a condition she\u2019d outgrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Alexandra asks, expectedly grossed out. \u201cWhen did you have sex with Alyson Bradford?\u201d</p><p>Drew looks to the ceiling, recalling the event. \u201cUm . . . junior year. It was in the dark days following our loss to St. Bartholomew\u2019s in the playoffs. I wouldn\u2019t say she was my rock bottom, but she was close.\u201d</p><p>Lexi turns away. \u201cEck . . . forget it, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>If it\u2019s one thing The Bitch can\u2019t stomach, it\u2019s detailed stories of her brother\u2019s sex-capades.</p><p>Which is precisely why Drew says, \u201cShe also does this nasty thing with her tongue . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexandra clasps her eyes shut. \u201cAll right! You know what? Fine\u2014if you want to go that badly, then go. If you want to leave me in my hour of need . . .\u201d</p><p>She never should have given him an out.</p><p>Drew smiles brightly, puts his glass on the tray of a passing waiter, and kisses her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the best sister ever. Bye.\u201d Then he asks me, \u201cAre you coming or what?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, or in this case, an escape route. \u201cSuper party, Lex. See ya.\u201d Then I follow Drew to the door. And if you look to the far side of the ballroom, you\u2019ll see Rosaline\u2014following me with her eyes.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>After leaving the fund-raiser, Drew and I head out to a bar. He ends up going home with a leggy, black-haired lawyer looking for some sexual healing to ease the pain of a courtroom defeat. I nurse a beer and spot a few prospects, but none that motivate me to make an effort. On the walk home, I\u2019m tempted to break the Three-Day Rule and call Delores.</p><p>What\u2019s that? You don\u2019t know what the Three-Day Rule is? Listen and learn. Three days is the perfect amount of time to wait before calling a woman after you\u2019ve seen her. I don\u2019t care what category she\u2019s in. Whether you\u2019ve banged her or not, you don\u2019t dial her number until the third day. It\u2019s not about head games or having the upper hand\u2014it\u2019s about keeping her interest. Getting her to think about you. Day one, she\u2019s probably reminiscing about the last time she saw you. Day two she\u2019s hoping you\u2019re going to call and wondering if you had as good a time as she did. On day three\u2014the magic day\u2014she\u2019s just about given up hope that her phone is going to ring. She\u2019s questioning what went wrong, did she misread your signals, then\u2014bam\u2014your call swoops in and makes her day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve thought about Dee at random times throughout the day\u2014always with a smile. Her straightforward, wise-ass humor, the way she danced . . . her nipple piercing. But, my phone stays securely in my pocket\u2014because the three-day statute should never be broken.</p><p>Saturday night rolls around and it\u2019s business as usual. I meet up with Jack and Drew at the opening of the newest hot spot. It\u2019s a large club, a renovated warehouse in the heart of the meatpacking district. It\u2019s crowded\u2014wall-to-wall bodies with barely any elbow room and a line around the corner. We\u2019re sharing a booth with five gorgeous Dutch cruise ship passengers. Amsterdam is wild\u2014it\u2019s the modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. Women from Amsterdam who\u2019ve been at sea for three weeks could be hard to keep up with\u2014even for us.</p><p>I squeeze my way through the throng of people to the bar. I lean forward and try to catch the bartender\u2019s eye. A minute later, I\u2019m shoved deliberately from behind. I glance over my shoulder and see a short, Snooki-sized redhead with heavy lids, swaying in her high-heeled brown boots. She points her finger at me and slurs loudly, \u201cI know you. You\u2019re the guy I slept with two weeks ago, the one with the motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>I thought she looked familiar. And her name is trendy, androgynous\u2014Ricki or Remy . . .</p> <p>Her equally petite but clearly more sober friend puts an arm around her. \u201cCome on, Riley, forget him.\u201d</p><p>Riley. So close.</p><p>Riley pouts sloppily. \u201cYou never called. Prick.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just gonna put this out there: I\u2019m all for equal opportunity hookups. A woman shouldn\u2019t be thought any less of because she wants to get her freak on as frequently as a guy\u2014no name-calling, no slut-shaming. On the other hand, girls need to stop playing the victim card. If I tell you I\u2019m interested in one night only\u2014why am I suddenly an ass**le when that\u2019s all it turns out to be? Listen to what a guy says. Don\u2019t assume that there\u2019s some hidden meaning behind his actions. Real life is not chick-lit or a romantic comedy; you shouldn\u2019t expect it to be.</p><p>Still, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth when a girl feels used. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, babe. We had a good time\u2014neither one of us wanted more. I never said I was going to call.\u201d</p> <p>My words fall on deaf ears. Riley\u2019s eyes look to my right and she warns, \u201cWatch out for this one, sister\u2014he\u2019s a player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>And even with the loud, synthesized music at maximum volume, I know that voice. I close my eyes, turn my head, and open them to find Delores Warren standing next to me.</p><p>You\u2019re not surprised, are you?</p><p>Riley fades from my sight and my thoughts as I check out Dee in her club wear. Her blond hair is painted with streaks of purple and blue, a tight, electric blue crop top barely covers her tits, her skirt is nothing more than strips of blue and purple fabric, and fuzzy, calf-high boots adorn her feet. Every inch of her fabulously exposed, body-glitter-covered skin sparkles like diamonds.</p><p>She smiles playfully. \u201cHello, God. It\u2019s me, Dee.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t try to hide that I\u2019m happy to see her. \u201cHey. What\u2019s up? I left you a message this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Today was day three. But Dee seems to be one of those rare women who is immune to the Rule. She turns to face the bar but replies loudly enough for me to hear. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me back?\u201d</p><p>She bops her head in time to the music and shrugs. \u201cI figured you were just being nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do anything just to be nice.\u201d I hook my thumb in the direction Riley was standing. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t kiss ass\u2014unless a girl asks me to\u2014and the only smoke I blow is from my cigarettes.</p><p>A few feet away, a dark-skinned, hair-gelled dude in a white T-shirt and skinny jeans yells in Delores\u2019s direction. \u201cYo, Dee\u2014hurry up with the drinks!\u201d</p><p>There are two kinds of male Brooklynites\u2014liberal, wealthy transplants who want to immerse themselves in urban living while restoring their historic brownstones to their former splendor, and homegrown, heavily accented, wise-guy wannabes who\u2019ve watched Goodfellas one too many times. This dumbass is definitely the latter. I motion with my chin. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mickey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I came with a few girls from work. They\u2019re . . . around here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Then I ask the more crucial question. \u201cAre you going to leave with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d The single word hits me like a jab to the chin.</p><p>Dee leans over the bar to place her drink order. When she\u2019s back on her feet, I move in closer, so I don\u2019t have to yell. \u201cYou can do better.\u201d</p><p>She looks into my eyes. Wearing the same expression she had on her face when I left her apartment Wednesday night\u2014yearning mixed with sadness. Resignation.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. Shoot for the moon and you still end up amongst the stars.\u201d It\u2019s an expression my mother used to say.</p><p>Dee lifts one shoulder. \u201cOuter space isn\u2019t for everyone. I\u2019m more of a ground-level kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>A woman\u2019s view of herself is like a reflection in a fun house mirror\u2014bent, sometimes warped. The way others see them is always more accurate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMickey\u2019s uncomplicated. Easy.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for easy, I\u2019m your guy\u2014they don\u2019t come easier than me.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles. And I step to Dee\u2019s side, blocking her view of the worthless wonder. Out of sight, out of mind, right? Smoothly I ask, \u201cWhen can I see you again?\u201d</p><p>The side of Dee\u2019s mouth inches up. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see you in a predetermined location . . . preferably in less clothing.\u201d</p><p>Dee glances down at her outfit. \u201cLess clothing than this? That\u2019d be risking indecent exposure.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cAlways a sign of a great time.\u201d</p><p>Her drinks arrive. She picks up the tray and tells me, \u201cI think seeing you again would be a bad idea\u2014for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong again.\u201d</p><p>She smiles softly. \u201cBye, Matthew.\u201d And starts to walk away.</p><p>I call, \u201cHey, Dee.\u201d She turns. \u201cNext time, tell him to get his own f**king drinks, okay?\u201d</p><p>She holds my gaze for a moment, then nods and disappears into the crowd. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A while later, Drew tells me he and Jack are going to go party with the Dutch world travelers. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d he asks. \u201cDrop some anchor, do a little deep-sea muff diving?\u201d</p><p>I scan the dance floor, trying to catch a glimpse of electric blue. \u201cNah, I\u2019m working on something here.\u201d I watch Jack by the door, entertaining the five girls, and ask, \u201cWhich one are you going for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl in the middle seems like quite the eager beaver.\u201d He chuckles at his own joke.</p><p>Called it. I snort and Drew asks why. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual that out of five Scandinavians, you\u2019re shooting for the lone brunette in the bunch?\u201d</p> <p>Drew gets my point. But he blows it off. \u201cThanks, Sigmund. If I want to be psychoanalyzed, I\u2019ll throw good money away on an actual f**king therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, man.\u201d I slap him on the back.</p><p>After Drew and Jack leave, I do a lap around the club. I spot Dee on the dance floor with Tony Soprano Junior and it turns my stomach. His spastic, rough steps are a sharp contrast to Dee\u2019s effortless, rolling movements, and I wonder again what the hell she\u2019s doing with him.</p><p>I find an empty table but get blindsided by an aggressive, chatty blonde in a short-sleeved cashmere sweater and leather skirt. She sits herself down and seems oblivious to the fact that I\u2019m not paying attention to anything she says.</p><p>\u201c. . . and I was like, really, Dad? Like, how am I supposed to focus on graduate school with that measly allowance . . .\u201d The droning continues until a dark-haired girl happens by the table. Blondie grabs her hand. \u201cTracy! Omg, it\u2019s been, like, forever. Let\u2019s get a pic.\u201d She leans her head against Tracy\u2019s and snaps a picture with her iPhone. \u201cThat\u2019s going on my Instagram!\u201d</p> <p>But, as soon as Tracy\u2019s out of earshot, Blondie turns to me with a glower. \u201cI hate that bitch.\u201d</p><p>You know what I hate? Fakeness. Phony affection. It\u2019s stupid and a waste of time. The only falsies I appreciate are on a set of cosmetically altered boobs.</p><p>I\u2019ve had as much of this chick\u2019s company as I can stand, and then I see Delores, walking out the door of the club, behind the Italian loser. Determined to salvage the night, I ask Blondie, \u201cDo you want to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>She beams. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Blondie doesn\u2019t want to ride the Ducati to her place, so she gives me her address and I settle her into a cab before climbing on my bike to meet her there. I\u2019m unusually indifferent about the prospect of getting my dick wet. This girl\u2019s like a salad that\u2019s included with your meal\u2014you\u2019ll munch on it, but only because it\u2019s already on the table in front of you. My mind keeps drifting back to Dee, walking out of the club with that undeserving f**kface.</p> <p>I remember the way she moved Wednesday night and the appreciative, sexy sounds I elicited from her each time I sunk into her, slow and deep. I wonder if he\u2019s hearing those same tantalizing noises\u2014and it pisses me the hell off. Not because Dee\u2019s screwing another guy, but because the guy is so goddamn unworthy.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s why I tell myself I\u2019m pissed.</p><p>I shake off my conflicted feelings as I find a parking spot, at a meter, around the corner from the blonde\u2019s apartment, who I now think of as \u201cSalad-girl.\u201d She\u2019s waiting for me inside the atrium of her building and opens the door to her first-floor apartment.</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s really cold,\u201d she tells me in a high-pitched, almost whiny voice. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how quick the temperature dropped. I wonder if it\u2019s going to snow early this year. I hate the snow. Even at Christmastime, I\u2019ll take a sandy beach over . . .\u201d</p><p>I kiss her eagerly\u2014just so she\u2019ll stop talking.</p><p>She squeaks into my mouth before recovering and putting her all into kissing me back. Her tongue flicks at mine quickly\u2014too quickly. There\u2019s no rhythm or finesse. Feels like there\u2019s a stingerless bumblebee trapped in my mouth, and its wings are beating the hell out of my tongue. She shoves me back onto the sofa and yanks her sweater over her head, revealing a beige, lacy bra, encasing a set of mega-huge melons.</p><p>Like I said before, I\u2019m a breast lover, so I try and focus my attention on this positive attribute, but her idea of dirty talk is a major distraction.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she moans, pushing her tits together. \u201cI\u2019m a bad girl. You gonna be my daddy? Daddy gonna punish his naughty slut?\u201d</p> <p>There are so many things wrong with that statement, I don\u2019t even know where to frigging begin.</p><p>First off, the Daddy talk is a boner killer. It\u2019s as effective as being submerged in a tub of ice water. It makes me think of my father and children and a thousand other things I don\u2019t want to be imagining during foreplay. The naughty slut was a valiant effort\u2014I\u2019m definitely into the name-calling, ass-slapping, dominant role-play thing women seem so fond of these days. But her babyish, breathy voice ruins the effect.</p><p>Delores\u2019s voice is low, sultry, unmistakably woman. When she begged me to f**k her, or called out how she wanted me to f**k her\u2014it wasn\u2019t forced or fake. It was unrehearsed and real, because she was so turned on, so caught up in the ecstasy of the moment, that staying silent simply wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>I grunt as Salad-girl pounces on my lap. She claws at my shirt but only succeeds in giving me rug burn on my neck. Shirt-burn. Then, with surprising strength, she forces my head between her br**sts, holding me so tightly I can\u2019t f**king breathe. The Vikings believed dying on the battlefield was a \u201cgood death,\u201d and normally I\u2019d feel the same way about being tit-smothered . . . but these aren\u2019t the tits I want doing me in. I struggle to turn my head, finally succeeding when I grip her biceps and push back. I tilt my head up and reinflate my lungs.</p><p>And then, still holding her arms, I look at Salad-girl\u2019s face. A cute nose, wet, pink lips, and round blue eyes gaze back at me. She\u2019s hot. A solid 8. Any other night I\u2019d be all over this, but tonight . . . I\u2019m not.</p><p>Because the eyes I want gazing back at me are light brown with flecks of gold. The lips I want to nibble on are red and full and have the most direct, unexpected responses coming out of them. I\u2019m more turned on picturing Dee in my head than I\u2019ve been for the last five minutes with this topless alternative grinding on my lap.</p><p>\u201cWait . . . hold up a second. This isn\u2019t working for me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Women always say they just want men to be honest with them. Let\u2019s see how that plays out. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty and you seem like a fun girl . . . but, I just realized . . . I\u2019m into somebody else at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Her neck swivels as she asks, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense.\u201d She covers her immense chest with her hands. And now she\u2019s glaring at me. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, if I hadn\u2019t met her first, I\u2019d totally be having sex with you right now.\u201d</p><p>She scampers off my lap. \u201cYou\u2019re an ass**le!\u201d</p> <p>I can see why she\u2019d think that.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my apartment, you dick!\u201d She picks a coaster up from the end table\u2014the heavy ceramic kind\u2014and whips it at my head. The first one misses. But the second one nails me in the shoulder blade as I dive for the door.</p><p>\u201cOw! Christ, I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk!\u201d</p><p>This proves it\u2014whoever said honesty was the best policy, was obviously lying.</p> <p>I park my motorcycle on the sidewalk and sprint up to the front door of Dee\u2019s building. I push her buzzer once, twice, three times for good luck. I wait five seconds, but there\u2019s no response.</p><p>Next, I do what every other normal human being would.</p><p>I push the button down until my motherfucking fingertip turns white.</p><p>Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . . .</p><p>When that doesn\u2019t get an answer, I admit, I start to panic. I walk onto the sidewalk, below Delores\u2019s front window, and cup my hands around my mouth. \u201cDelores! Hey Dee\u2014you awake?\u201d</p><p>Because this is New York City, a neighbor immediately yells back, \u201cWe\u2019re all awake now, ass**le!\u201d</p> <p>A few \u201cShuddups\u201d come from various directions, and I think one woman may have thrown a potted plant at me.</p><p>But I\u2019d like to believe it was an accident.</p><p>With no other recourse, I throw my head back and go for my best Marlon Brando impression. \u201cStella!! Steeellllaaaa!!\u201d</p><p>Delores\u2019s window opens. Fucking finally.</p><p>\u201cMatthew?\u201d she calls down, surprised.</p><p>My fingers hook my belt loops, going for a nonchalant stance. \u201cHey,\u201d I answer. \u201cS\u2019up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Here is when I realize my grand plan to stop her and Tony from getting busy . . . only reached this point. Damn. From here on out, it\u2019s all improv.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to . . . Can you come down, please?\u201d</p><p>Miraculously, she doesn\u2019t tell me to go screw myself.</p><p>And two minutes later, she\u2019s walking out onto the sidewalk . . . with Goomba Johnny trailing behind her. Thankfully, she\u2019s still fully dressed in her club clothes. That doesn\u2019t really mean much\u2014especially considering the outfit covers little more than a bra and underwear would, but at this point, I\u2019ll take whatever bright side I can.</p><p>The wise guy wannabe walks in front of Dee and shoves me back. \u201cThe f**k\u2019s your problem? You some kinda psycho?\u201d</p><p>On instinct, my fists rise to a defensive posture. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to fight you, but you wanna go? We can go.\u201d</p><p>Then I notice the tattoo low on his bicep\u2014a tattoo of the Virgin Mary with AVE MARIA scrolled below it. And I take a different approach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to save my marriage.\u201d</p><p>Yes, lying is a low blow\u2014but desperate times . . .</p><p>His head snaps to Dee. \u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s horrified. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not married. He\u2019s out of his mind!\u201d</p><p>I open my wallet to the picture of Mackenzie and force sincerity onto my expression. \u201cMy family is my everything. I know you don\u2019t know me, but could you just do me a steady and . . . walk away?\u201d</p><p>Now Dee is seriously pissed off. She pushes my shoulder and turns to the Jersey Shore reject. \u201cMickey, that is not my daughter, and he is not my husband!\u201d</p><p>He replies, \u201cMy name is Mikey.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a relief to see I\u2019m not the only one having trouble with names tonight.</p><p>Exasperated, Dee asks, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>For most guys, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014we don\u2019t care if you scream the Pope\u2019s name while we\u2019re giving it to you. But apparently, \u201cMikey\u201d isn\u2019t most guys. Because he throws his hands up in surrender. \u201cThis is way too heavy for me. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d Then he turns on his heel and walks away.</p><p>I watch his retreating form with glee. Then I turn to Dee and hook my thumb over my shoulder. \u201cSome people are so gullible.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when she punches me\u2014right in the mouth.</p><p>I stumble back and taste blood. Delores may be petite, but she can throw a hell of a right hook. She points and wags her finger as she rails, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the f**k this is, but it is not okay!\u201d</p><p>My hand drops from my injured mouth to my side. And my mind is blank\u2014not a single smooth line or witty comeback in sight. So all I can do is ask, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a great time\u2014the sex was hot, we laughed\u2014but now you don\u2019t want anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a new concept for you?\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cShit, yeah, it\u2019s new. Everybody likes me. I\u2019m a great f**king guy.\u201d</p><p>Dee massages her forehead with her fingertips the way my mother used to do when she had a headache brewing. Then she sighs and admits, \u201cOkay . . . the thing is . . . it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m the problem.\u201d</p><p>My eyes crinkle with revulsion. \u201cJesus Christ, are you serious? I\u2019m practically pouring my heart out here, and you can\u2019t even be bothered to make up a decent lie?\u201d</p><p>Dee throws out her arms, \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth. I do like you. You\u2019re very cute, you\u2019re very funny, and you\u2019re fantastic in bed. But I . . . I\u2019m a more content person when I\u2019m not in a relationship. When I get serious with someone . . . I go a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s said anything about a relationship? Let\u2019s just . . . keep having a good time. See what happens. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to take off for Vegas and get married.\u201d</p><p>That would just be ridiculous.</p><p>Dee shakes her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It never ends well. This won\u2019t be any different, Matthew. I used to think it was the men I picked, but I\u2019ve finally accepted the fact that it\u2019s me. I make good guys go bad. I\u2019m like . . . a penis pump . . . I turn men into gigantic pricks. I\u2019m the girl your mother warned you about\u2014bad news.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And her expression is so serious, I can\u2019t not laugh. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know so far is pretty awesome.\u201d</p><p>She starts to deny what I\u2019ve said, but I push on. \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking this. We can be f**k buddies if it makes you feel better. New friends with fabulous benefits. I\u2019ll be the scratch for your itch . . . the booty to your two a.m. call. Just . . . don\u2019t screw any other guys\u2014you won\u2019t need to.\u201d</p> <p>She begins to shake her head. Until I remind her. \u201cAnd the world could end tomorrow, remember? The aliens could invade . . . global warming . . . we\u2019ve got to live for the now, \u2019cause you never know when the now will be gone.\u201d</p><p>I hold out my hand. \u201cTake a chance, Dee. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>Her honey-colored eyes look wistfully at my hand. \u201cGod, you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. And it just comes out. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d</p><p>Dee cracks up.</p> <p>Then she takes my hand in hers. They\u2019re a perfect fit.</p><p>Like two middle schoolers experiencing their first crushes, we stand like that for a few moments, smiling at each other. Wordlessly, we turn and walk toward her apartment.</p><p>Much too seriously, Dee says, \u201cHey, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had enough? Just remember I tried to warn you, okay?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what kind of f**ked-up, douche bags Dee has been going out with, but that kind of talk ticks me off. I\u2019m determined to prove her wrong and lighten the mood. So I lean toward her and whisper, \u201cYou\u2019re too beautiful to ever get enough of.\u201d</p> <p>Delores rolls her eyes. And I get the distinct impression she thinks I\u2019m bullshitting her. Guess I\u2019ll just have to keep calling her beautiful until she believes it.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Waking up in a place that\u2019s not yours is always slightly disorienting. My eyes open to sunlight streaming through sheer purple curtains and to a clothes-cluttered bedroom. Last night, Dee and I talked some more after going inside her apartment. Turns out, she didn\u2019t have sex with the homeboy. She said he spent the majority of their time at her apartment on the phone with a friend. Idiot. She asked me if it would\u2019ve bothered me if she had\u2014my answer was yes. But . . . I would\u2019ve gotten over it.</p><p>I slip on a pair of boxers, then I follow the smell of bacon and the sound of music to the kitchen. Dee stands at the stove with her back to me, singing along to \u201cBeneath Your Beautiful\u201d that pours out from the stereo, which is mounted below her cabinet.</p><p>Her voice is adorably bad\u2014off-key and screechy\u2014like a mating cat\u2019s. Her reddish-blond hair is pinned up with chopsticks\u2014still color-streaked from last night\u2014and the only piece of clothing she\u2019s wearing is my button-down, blue shirt. As the song ends, I applaud.</p><p>She spins around, spatula in hand. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice shirt.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSince I was making you breakfast, I decided to go full fledged clich\u00e9 and wear it.\u201d</p> <p>I step up close and plant a sweet kiss on her lips. She smiles, shyly. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>Dee hands me two glasses of orange juice and grabs a platter of bacon and scrambled eggs from the counter. We sit at her small, two-chaired dining table and dig in.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d I comment.</p><p>\u201cOrganic turkey bacon. It\u2019s like crack. One taste, you\u2019ll never do pork again.\u201d</p><p>As we eat, I take the opportunity to check out her place. Before, I was much too preoccupied with making her moan. It\u2019s neater than I expected, and eclectic. A red recliner whose fabric has seen better days is stationed next to a round, mosaic-topped table, adjacent to a comfy looking beige couch with a soft, brown blanket thrown across the back. Floral pillows of all shapes are scattered around, and a tall lamp with a beaded fringe shade stands in the corner. Just a few picture frames decorate the walls\u2014one is of Delores, standing next to a thin woman with similar hair color, who I assume is her mother. Another is of Dee, at about thirteen, with one arm around the shoulders of a braces-adorned Kate Brooks, and the other arm around a brown-haired boy, who must be Dee\u2019s cousin. All three are wearing roller skates.</p><p>I swallow a forkful of mouthwatering eggs and ask, \u201cWhat are you doing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to hit up the farmers\u2019 market in Brooklyn . . . but otherwise, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hang out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll swing by my place so I can shower, and I have to make one quick stop, but after, I thought we could go to Central Park?\u201d</p><p>The beauty of living in the city is there\u2019s always something to do. Even if your ass is sitting on a park bench and you\u2019re feeding the pigeons, it feels like you\u2019re doing something.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll get dressed.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Dee\u2019s freshly showered and walking out of her building with her hair in a bun, wearing a silver, strapless shirt, black leather pants, and tiger patterned high heels. Luckily, my illegally parked motorcycle didn\u2019t get ticketed or towed. Dee gazes at the bike appreciatively. She runs her hand over the seat and it reminds me of how she ran her hand over my stomach, inching lower and lower. I pick up her hand and kiss her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t stroke it like that unless you mean it.\u201d</p><p>She reaches up on her toes and whispers in my ear, \u201cI always mean it.\u201d</p><p>I pull a cap helmet out of the pack on the back of my bike and place it on Dee\u2019s head, buckling it under her chin. She\u2019s the perfect mixture of sensual and adorable, sexy and cute\u2014I could eat her out right here on the street.</p><p>She climbs on my motorcycle and winks. \u201cTake me for a ride, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I rev the engine. \u201cHold on tight.\u201d</p><p>Not every girl is cut out for riding on a motorcycle. One or two have clutched me so tight they left nail marks and cut off feeling to my extremities. Another time, a chick didn\u2019t grip strong enough\u2014was too busy \u201cwooting\u201d and waving her hands in the air\u2014and she almost gave me a heart attack when she went sailing off the back. Thankfully, she wasn\u2019t harmed. Dee squeezes me just right\u2014one arm around my waist, her other hand on my thigh, the splendid feel of her tits pressed against my back and her chin on my shoulder blade.</p><p>I\u2019ll gladly give her one long ride after another. Both kinds.</p><p>After we arrive at my building, we park in the private deck and head to the lobby. Delores admires the impressive architecture while I retrieve my mail from the box. When we walk into my apartment, I tell Dee to make herself at home and hop in the shower. After I\u2019m dry, I slip on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt. Leaving it unbuttoned for the moment, I walk back to the living room in search of Delores. She\u2019s staring out the picture window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to call you \u2018Upper West Side\u2019 from now on,\u201d she tells me with a grin.</p><p>\u201cBut \u2018God\u2019 is much more accurate.\u201d</p><p>She moves to the bookcase. \u201cThese are great pictures.\u201d She\u2019s looking at one I took of Mackenzie last year, blowing a kiss at the camera. The lighting brought out the brilliance of her baby blues.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mackenzie,\u201d I explain. \u201cThe niece I told you about Wednesday night . . . who\u2019s technically not.\u201d I point to another picture beside it. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my parents.\u201d It\u2019s a black and white\u2014my mother looks blissfully clueless, my father grumpily oblivious; their everyday expressions.</p> <p>I pull out my camera bag, making sure I have extra film, checking the lenses.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a darkroom?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI do, actually.\u201d</p><p>A look appears in her eyes that I\u2019m beginning to grow familiar with\u2014one that says she\u2019s turned on. \u201cWill you show it to me?\u201d</p><p>I put the camera down and raise my arm. \u201cRight this way.\u201d</p> <p>Officially, it\u2019s a walk-in closet, but windowless and large enough for a shelf of chemicals and a table with a row of developing trays. The lighting is low of course, with a sepia-tinted hue. I close the door behind us, as Delores looks around. And that feeling of playing seven minutes in heaven when I was thirteen washes over me. But heaven, back then, was never this beautiful.</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyes rake over me from head to toe. \u201cDo you have any idea how sexy this is, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit,\u201d I admit.</p><p>She presses up against me and my back hits the closed door. Dee kisses my chin, then scrapes it with her teeth. \u201cWill you take my picture sometime?\u201d She bends her knees and slides down my torso, her warm hands leaving a trail of heat as they skim my chest and stomach.</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cI will definitely be taking your picture.\u201d</p><p>She peppers my stomach with soft kisses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be like a modern day Jack and Rose from Titanic.\u201d</p> <p>Breathing heavy now, I say, \u201cJack was a pu**y. If I were him, I would\u2019ve tied Rose up, gagged her, and tossed her ass in a life boat. Then I would\u2019ve gotten in after her.\u201d I\u2019d like to point out that if Rose had just done what the hell Jack told her to, they both would\u2019ve survived.</p><p>Dee wets her lips with her tongue and slides my jeans down over my hips, freeing my already aching dick. She wraps her small hand around the base, pumping slowly. \u201cUntil you take those photographs of me, and develop them here, I want you to think about this the next time you\u2019re in this room.\u201d</p><p>Still stroking the base, she covers the tip with her lips, sucking gently and flicking it with her tongue. I lean more weight against the door\u2014my knees going weak. She removes her mouth, peels the foreskin back, and takes me fully in.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but moan. \u201cFuuuck.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth is hot and wet and so tight, bright dots appear in the darkness of my closed lids. Slowly she increases the suction of her mouth, the speed of her rubbing palm\u2014my hand buries in her hair and tightens.</p><p>Dee hums around me, and I beg, \u201cFaster . . .\u201d She grants my request and her head bobs quicker, dragging me closer with every pass of her mouth. I pant. \u201cDee . . . yes . . . gonna come . . .\u201d She sucks me even tighter, and then I\u2019m coming, groaning raggedly, gripping her hair in my fist\u2014trying not to pull. As soon as she releases me, I sink all the way to the floor, breathing like I completed the New York marathon.</p><p>I reach for Delores\u2014pull her up against my chest. I kiss her nose, both cheeks, and finally her mouth, thoroughly. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>I take my helmet off and lock it onto my motorcycle. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>Dee hasn\u2019t gotten off the bike. \u201cI\u2019ll wait out here, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014it\u2019s halfway over already\u2014I just have to drop off my envelope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you never heard the saying, \u2018As nervous as a whore in Church\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off with the self-deprecating comments. If that\u2019s the standard, I should be sweating bullets. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to drink blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re baptized.\u201d</p><p>If you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, we\u2019re at St. Mary\u2019s church. It\u2019s Sunday\u2014and on Sunday, I go to church, even if it\u2019s only for the tail-end of the mass. I have a deeply held belief that something terrible will happen if I don\u2019t.</p><p>Twelve years of Catholic school will do that to you.</p><p>I drag Dee into the vestibule. She steps carefully, like she\u2019s walking into a haunted house.</p><p>A suited, gray-haired gentleman comes through the double doors carrying a brimming collection basket. Perfect timing. I slip my envelope in and bow my head as the priest\u2019s voice echoes through the speakers from the main chamber, working up to the final blessing. Dee watches, copying my stance as she stands beside me. Before the priest is finished, a commotion of clattering feet coming up the stairs from the basement draws my attention. Through the side door, Sister Beatrice Dugan steps into the antechamber with a dozen Sunday school students in two lines behind her.</p><p>Sister B was my first sexual experience. Well . . . my first self-sexual experience. She was all of our firsts\u2014the closest Drew and I have ever come to a three-way.</p><p>Wait, that last part is gross, forget I said that.</p><p>Anyway, puberty is a confusing time for a boy. Having a f**k-hot teacher who happens to be a nun made it more confusing. I got carried away when I first discovered the joys of mast***ation. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t just \u201cchoke the chicken\u201d\u2014I literally strangled the sucker. That\u2019s how, at thirteen years old, I ended up diagnosed with CPS\u2014Chafed Penis Syndrome. I don\u2019t need to elaborate on that do I?</p><p>My mother may have bought into the doctor\u2019s explanation that my CPS was caused by keeping a wet bathing suit on too long, but my father sure as hell didn\u2019t. In one of our more tender conversations, he told me spanking the monkey was nothing to be ashamed of, that it was like electricity\u2014God wouldn\u2019t have given it to us if he didn\u2019t want us to use it. But, like all things, moderation was key. I calmed down after that chat, and was able to engage in regular self-pleasure, without inflicting injury.</p><p>Sister B quiets the giggling kids with a look. Then with an Irish lilt that time hasn\u2019t diminished, she says, \u201cMatthew\u2014how are you, m\u2019boy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight as rain, Sister B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight as rain and yet still late for Mass? Tsk-tsk.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, though offering a few Our Fathers as you pray for punctuality may be in order. I saw your parents at the early mass; they\u2019re looking grand as always.\u201d</p> <p>I nod. Then I turn to Dee and say, \u201cDelores, this is Sister Beatrice, my grade school teacher. Sister B, this is Delores Warren.\u201d</p><p>Sister B greets her. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Dee waves. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Sister Beatrice\u2019s brow wrinkles. \u201cYou look uncomfortable, m\u2019dear. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>Dee fidgets. \u201cI just . . . I\u2019m not Catholic. Not even a little.\u201d</p> <p>Sister B pats her shoulder, and in a hushed voice tells her, \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right. Neither was Jesus.\u201d</p><p>When we get to Central Park, I take out my camera and get a few great shots of Dee by the fountain. I take some more nature-themed pictures of the leaves as they\u2019re blowing down from the trees. Then Delores and I lay next to each other on a blanket, on a grassy patch, heated by the warm sun of the fall afternoon. And we trade questions\u2014the random, inappropriate kind that are always fun and a great way to get to know a person.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been arrested?\u201d Dee asks me as she plays with the buttons on my flannel shirt.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. You?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cArrested, but never convicted.\u201d Then she tells me about the time she, her cousin, and Kate got caught breaking into their local roller-skating rink after hours and had to be brought home by the town sheriff. Her mother wasn\u2019t thrilled.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had sex in a public place?\u201d I ask, partially because I\u2019m curious . . . and partially for future reference.</p> <p>\u201cMmm . . . public place, yes\u2014but I don\u2019t think anyone actually saw us.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through her hair, the sunlight accentuating the red highlights, making it more fiery than golden.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had sex on your motorcycle?\u201d she asks. And I hope that\u2019s for future reference too.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not as easy as you\u2019d think. But, it\u2019s something everybody should try at least once.\u201d Then I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color? And how do you take your coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a favorite color\u2014it changes, depending on my mood. And I don\u2019t drink coffee. I try and stay away from caffeine, it\u2019s bad for your skin.\u201d</p><p>Dee is a foodie. She mentioned going to the farmers\u2019 market in Brooklyn later, to stock up on fennel and lemongrass and some other shit I\u2019ve only heard of in gourmet restaurants where presentation is more important than taste. That\u2019s not my idea of a great meal. But she swears her homemade granola doesn\u2019t taste anything like rabbit food.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone in your family devout Catholics?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cDevout is kind of a strong word, but we all go to church.\u201d I think about it a little more, then say, \u201cWell, all of us except Drew. Besides weddings and baptisms, he hasn\u2019t willingly stepped inside a church since we were kids.\u201d</p> <p>She turns on her stomach, resting her chin on my chest. \u201cWhat made him the black sheep? Did he find a six-six-six tattoo on his scalp or something?\u201d</p><p>I smile, because I\u2019m sure several of our ordained teachers held that very same opinion about him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Drew and God had a falling out when we were about ten years old. That was the year Steven\u2019s mother, Janey, was diagnosed with breast cancer. The parents sat us all down, told us she was sick, that she\u2019d be getting treatment from the doctors, and that we had to pray as hard as we could that the treatment would work.</p><p>\u201cDrew didn\u2019t take the news well. He couldn\u2019t understand why, with all the dickheads in the world, God had to afflict someone as nice as Janey with a terminal illness. Anyway, she did chemo and eventually went into remission. But when we were in high school, the cancer came back hard and she was gone within a few months. She was the first person I knew who died. By the time I was born, my grandparents were long gone. My aunts and uncles are still around, but Janey went at age thirty-nine, which, even as a kid, seemed young to me.\u201d</p><p>Delores\u2019s mouth turns down in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cBut the real kicker came at her funeral. Steven\u2019s father, George, was just wrecked. And, unfortunately, useless. That left all the heavy lifting to Steven. He made the big decisions, he played host to the guests at the three-day wake. He was sixteen years old\u2014Alexandra and he had started dating a few months before Janey passed.\u201d</p><p>I watch a flock of three sparrows, flying with precise synchronization as I continue the trek down memory lane.</p><p>\u201cSo, on the day of the funeral and burial, there\u2019s an early viewing\u2014just for immediate family. Steven wanted to be there first, to have some private time with his mom. Drew and I went with him for moral support. And the priest at St. Mary\u2019s at the time was Father Gerald\u2014he was a real old-school, arrogant, prick of a priest, you know? He comes in where the three of us are sitting, and he tells Steven his mother died because she wasn\u2019t pure. That if she had been holier, God would have saved her. Then he said her death was also a sign of our lack of faith. That if we had believed more, God would have answered our prayers.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. What did Steven say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He was too shocked, too grief-stricken to say anything. Drew, on the other hand, has always been quick with a comeback. So he gets up, gets right in Father Gerald\u2019s ugly face and says, \u2018Fuck you, Father, and the donkey you rode in on. Isn\u2019t there an altar boy somewhere you should be trying to ply with sacrificial wine, so you can get laid?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The corners of Dee\u2019s mouth turn up. \u201cThe more I hear about this Drew guy, the more I\u2019m starting to like him.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cFather Gerald turns, like, frigging purple and is just about ready to smack Drew a good one when John, Anne, George, and my parents come in. So Gerald holds off, only to try and get Drew booted out of school the next day. He said if he didn\u2019t apologize, he\u2019d have him expelled. Although John didn\u2019t like what the priest had said, he leaned on Drew to apologize for being disrespectful. But he wouldn\u2019t give\u2014refused to say sorry to such \u2018an evil f**k.\u2019</p><p>\u201cAnd then, Anne started to cry. She sobbed about how if Drew got expelled it would ruin his life, and where did she go wrong. That\u2019s when Drew caved\u2014\u2019cause he just couldn\u2019t handle making his mother cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe wrote a letter of apology to Father Gerald and jumped through every hoop the old bastard gave him for penance. That\u2019s why Drew can quote the Bible\u2014word for word\u2014because Gerald made him copy it, down to the last punctuation mark, every day after school. Anyway, by the time his punishment was lifted, Drew was convinced Catholicism was just a racket and that God doesn\u2019t give a shit about any of us.\u201d</p><p>Dee tilts her head and regards me thoughtfully. Then she asks, \u201cBut you don\u2019t believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I asked Sister Beatrice if what Father Gerald had said was true. That if we had had more faith, would God have answered our prayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Dee asks.</p> <p>In my best Irish accent, I reply, \u201cShe said, \u2018Matthew, m\u2019boy, the Lord answers every prayer . . . but sometimes, the answer is no.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Dee thinks that over for a moment. Then she says, \u201cWell . . . that kind of sucks.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said too.\u201d</p><p>Then I wonder aloud, \u201cWhat about you? Did you grow up religious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could say that. My mother\u2019s always been a spiritual grazer. A taste of Mormonism here, a scrap of Protestant there, but nothing ever stuck. She was interested in Kabala way before Madonna made it all the rage. These days she\u2019s into Buddhism\u2014worked out well for Tina Turner.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s late afternoon by the time we walk back to my bike. I put the folded blanket and camera in the hard-top compartment. And the scent of fresh chili dogs from the sidewalk cart reaches my nose, making my stomach growl. I take out my wallet and ask Dee, \u201cYou want one?\u201d</p><p>She looks at the hot dog like it\u2019s a loaded gun. \u201cAh . . . no. I prefer to live past the age of fifty, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I order mine with extra chili, then respond, \u201cThe sidewalk hot dog is New York.\u201d The same could be said for a slice of pizza.</p><p>\u201cThe sidewalk hot dog is a heart attack in a bun. Do you know how many nitrates are in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it taste so good. You know, for someone who claims to be all \u2018carpe diem,\u2019 you\u2019ve got a lot of hang-ups.\u201d</p><p>She caves. \u201cOkay, fine . . .\u201d She tells the vendor, \u201cOne please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want chili?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSure. Go big or go home, right?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>We stand next to my bike eating our dogs. When Dee is done with hers, a dab of sauce lingers on her chin. Instead of telling her, I take care of it with my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMmm . . .\u201d I smack my lips. \u201cTastes even better on you.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. It\u2019s a great sound.</p><p>Our last stop of the day is the farmers\u2019 market in Brooklyn. She was limited by what could fit in the Ducati\u2019s pack, but Dee said having me around for the trip was worth the second trek she\u2019d have to make later in the week. I help her carry the groceries into her apartment, and I\u2019m about to ask her out to dinner when she wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me full on the mouth.</p><p>Dinner can f**king wait.</p> <p>I drop the bags on the floor and go right for her ass. Gripping and kneading, her black pants a thin but annoying barrier. Her hands bury in my hair while I lift her and wrap her legs around my waist, giving my rigid c**k the contact it craves. I suck on her bottom lip as her hands massage my shoulders, relaxing warmth spreading from her fingertips. I scrape my teeth along her jaw and swing us around, pressing Dee\u2019s back against the refrigerator. She moans as our hips rub and grind.</p><p>We\u2019re both panting hard as I nibble on her neck. Then she moans, \u201cMatthew . . . Matthew, I need . . .\u201d</p><p>My lips move against her hot skin. \u201cGod, me too . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>The next thing I know, Dee pulls out of my grasp and shoves me on my ass in her haste to run down the hall. I lay on the floor, breathing heavy, trying to process what the hell just happened\u2014when the unmistakable sound of upchucking emanates from the bathroom.</p><p>Bet you weren\u2019t expecting that, huh? Makes two of us.</p><p>My stomach rolls as I walk down the hall\u2014the sounds of Dee\u2019s sickness making me really f**king queasy. I brace a hand on the doorframe. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She sits in front of the toilet, a tissue covering her lips, her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cDo I sound all right, genius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She moans . . . in the not-awesome kind of way. \u201cYou and your stupid chili dogs. I think they were bad.\u201d</p><p>Like any accused man, I launch a defense. \u201cThey weren\u2019t bad. If they were bad, I\u2019d . . .\u201d And I can\u2019t even finish the sentence. Because heat closes in on my face, and my stomach twists around on itself, and I\u2019m diving for the plastic wastepaper basket in the corner.</p><p>Which just makes Dee vomit more.</p><p>And I think of Lardass and the Barf-o-rama story from Stand by Me. And I\u2019d probably laugh at the entire situation, if I didn\u2019t feel so frigging awful.</p><p>Eventually, we crawl into the bed and lay next to each other\u2014me stretched out, Dee in the fetal position.</p><p>\u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d Dee whimpers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re so right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you. No\u2014I don\u2019t mean that, I like you so much. I think I\u2019m dying, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dying. But I might be dying.\u201d</p><p>Even though we\u2019re naturally stronger than women, it\u2019s common knowledge that men are ten times more affected by illness. Just ask your husband or your boyfriend.</p><p>Dee opens the drawer of her nightstand, jostling the bed as she pulls something out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I groan. \u201cStop moving.\u201d It\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve ever said that to a girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m writing a note to Katie to have you f**king arrested for manslaughter if I die . . . and the hot dog man as an accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cold woman, Delores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter you learn that now,\u201d Dee says, even as she moves closer to me. I rub soothing circles on her back until she rolls over and takes my hand in hers. And we stay like that until we both fall asleep.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how close you can feel to a person after you\u2019ve suffered through the torture of food poisoning together for twenty-four hours. That kind of intimacy can take months\u2014even years\u2014to achieve. I now know Dee\u2019s cum face\u2014and her puke face.</p><p>We both call in sick Monday morning, both of us still feeling wrung out. We take separate showers and I borrow a pair of her cousin\u2019s sweatpants. Normally I\u2019d have issues with going commando in another guy\u2019s drawers, but these were clean and folded in the back of Dee\u2019s closet, so the time lapse from the last time Warren wore them makes them okay. Plus, the idea of putting on my clothes from last night feels nasty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Delores sits next to me on the couch, her Stompeez rabbit\u2013clad feet on the coffee table, wrapped in a fluffy, purple robe that would look light-years from sexy on another girl. But because I know there\u2019s nothing but smooth, bare flesh underneath it\u2014it\u2019s hot.</p><p>I flick on the television and we try to agree on a movie to watch. The problem is, Delores has a vagina, which means her taste in movies ranges from awful to nonexistent.</p><p>Don\u2019t scowl at me\u2014I\u2019m only stating what every man in the world knows. The reason shitty movies like The English Patient and The King\u2019s Speech win Academy Awards? Women have chick-boners for Ralph Fiennes and Colin Firth. Sure, Braveheart won a bunch of well-deserved awards, but it wasn\u2019t just because it\u2019s the perfect movie. Mel Gibson, anyone? Enough said.</p><p>Dee defends a horrible chick flick suggestion. \u201cI like best friend movies\u2014they\u2019re very empowering. Thelma &amp; Louise, Beaches, Steel Magnolias\u2014that one\u2019s my favorite. I always imagine Kate and me like Ouiser and Clairee when we\u2019re old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Steel Magnolia? More importantly, what the f**k is an Ouiser?\u201d</p><p>She looks simultaneously surprised and appalled. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen Steel Magnolias? Are you even human? It was one of Julia Roberts\u2019s first movies.\u201d</p><p>I throw up one hand as I object. \u201cNo\u2014no frigging way am I watching Julia Roberts! Drew went through a whole year of Julia Roberts as a kid and he still hasn\u2019t recovered. To this day, Pretty Woman quotes come flying out of his mouth uncontrollably. Not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are we going to watch?\u201d</p><p>I scroll through the on-demand movies until I spot a winner.</p> <p>\u201cConan the Barbarian. The greatest love story ever told.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkles. \u201cNormally I\u2019d be into Schwarzenegger-flavored eye candy, but I\u2019m not in the mood. Let\u2019s watch Steel Magnolias.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. It\u2019ll be two hours of my life I\u2019ll never get back.\u201d</p><p>Delores tucks her feet under her and rises to her knees. A sly, persuasive smile slides onto her face, which I\u2019ve come to recognize as a sign she\u2019s in the mood to get busy. She leans over me; I angle my head back to keep eye contact.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better, Matthew? \u2019Cause I\u2019m feeling a lot better.\u201d</p><p>I do a quick mental rundown of my faculties. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile gets wider\u2014more suggestive. \u201cThen let\u2019s make a bet. Whoever can make the other person come first gets to pick the movie? What do you say?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s clear to me why Delores is such a successful chemist\u2014she has such an amazingly innovative mind.</p><p>I scrape my teeth over my bottom lip thoughtfully. \u201cI say this is a bet I\u2019m going to really enjoy winning.\u201d</p><p>She tilts back and slowly opens her robe. \u201cNot as much as I\u2019m going to enjoy making you lose.\u201d</p><p>It was close. If this were NASCAR, it would\u2019ve been a photo finish\u2014just seconds apart. But . . . Dee was the winner. She got to pick the movie. Although, I wasn\u2019t exactly crying about my defeat. If you gotta lose a bet, that\u2019s the way to do it.</p><p>Anyway, Steel Magnolias is well under way. And it just reinforces my opinion about women and films, because nothing is f**king happening in this movie. It starts off with a wedding and now it looks like Julia Roberts is going to die. Other than that? Just a bunch of girls talking and getting their hair done and talking some more.</p><p>Dee sits beside me in rapt attention while the lady from Smokey and the Bandit\u2014she\u2019s Julia Roberts\u2019s mother\u2014starts talking to her friends at the cemetery. Dee\u2019s nose is already red and her eyes are watery. I turn back to the film and listen as the woman starts to scream and cry and ask how her grandson will ever know how much his mother loved him.</p><p>And out of nowhere I start to think about Mackenzie and\u2014God forbid\u2014if something ever happened to Alexandra, how Mackenzie would feel. Who would tell her, how much she would miss out on. Steven\u2019s a great guy, an awesome father, but a mother\u2014especially a fierce mother like Alexandra\u2014that kind of love is different. More.</p> <p>Irreplaceable.</p><p>And even though Dee\u2019s apartment doesn\u2019t seem dusty, some particles must have gotten in my eyes. I rub them, to get the irritation out.</p><p>And I sniff. Goddamn allergies.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d Dee asks me with surprise and laughter in her voice.</p><p>Disgustedly, I turn to her. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not crying.\u201d</p><p>Then I look back at the television screen. Where Julia Roberts\u2019s poor, distraught mother is screaming that she\u2019s fine, when she\u2019s obviously not. And about all the things she\u2019s able to do that her kid never could.</p><p>Jesus Christ, this is depressing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so f**king sad!\u201d I blurt out as I gesture to the television. \u201cHow can you watch this shit and not want to blow your head off with a twelve-gauge shotgun?\u201d</p><p>Dee covers her mouth and laughs into her hands. \u201cThe fact that it can make me cry is one of the reasons I love it so much.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that? That is like saying I love the table in my parents\u2019 front hall because I\u2019m gonna stub my toe on it every frigging time I walk past barefoot.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSometimes it feels good to cry. It\u2019s cathartic. You\u2019ve never cried over a movie?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m offended that she even feels the need to ask.</p><p>I shake my head, but then stop as I remember. \u201cRocky Three. I cried during Rocky Three, but that doesn\u2019t count. Anyone who doesn\u2019t get choked up when Mickey dies has no soul.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cNever seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing out. Have you seen Predator?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cThe original Escape from New York?\u201d Another negative. \u201cThe Warriors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Then a thought occurs to me. \u201cWait, your cousin grew up with you and your mom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the time I was about six years old, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you had a boy in the house\u2014how is it you\u2019ve never seen any of these classics?\u201d I ask, though I\u2019m pretty sure I already know the answer.</p><p>Dee shrugs. \u201cBilly was happy to watch what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>Sure he was. It\u2019s then that I decide to take that poor male role model\u2013deprived bastard under my wing.</p><p>By Monday night, I\u2019m well enough to return to my own apartment. You\u2019d think after almost two full days away, I\u2019d miss it\u2014be glad to be home. But it feels . . . quiet. Boring, even. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I develop the pictures I took with Dee at the park. And while I wait in the darkroom, I think about the last time I was here. With her. Her wet mouth, the stroke of her soft tongue, the way her cheeks hollowed out when she sucked me dry.</p><p>As my memory runs wild, I just barely contain the pu**y-whipped urge to call Delores and implore her to come over. I succeed, but only because we already made plans for her to hang out here Wednesday night.</p><p>As far as I\u2019m concerned, Wednesday can\u2019t come soon enough.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, I meet Alexandra downtown for lunch.</p> <p>The weather is mild, so we sit at a sidewalk table outside. I take a bite of my burger while Alexandra crunches a salad with grilled shrimp. Then I tell her, \u201cSo . . . I\u2019ve met someone.\u201d</p><p>Growing up with Drew, I always regarded Lexi as my older sister, but the fact that we didn\u2019t share the same genes, or actually have to live together, made our relationship much less contentious than the one she has with her brother. She looks out for me, but she doesn\u2019t \u201cmother\u201d me the way she does with Drew. She gets annoyed by my screwups, but she doesn\u2019t feel responsible for them. For me, it\u2019s the best of both worlds\u2014all the benefits of a big sister without the pain in the ass headaches.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, you and my brother \u2018meet\u2019 lots of women.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cThis one I like.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cOnce again, you and Drew \u2018like\u2019 a whole bunch of poor, unsuspecting ladies. Why is this one worth mentioning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like her, like her.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s blue eyes widen. \u201cWow. A Wonder Years reference. This must be serious. Do tell.\u201d</p><p>My eyes abashedly drop to my burger. \u201cHer name is Delores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . . different.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tries to pull more details out of me. \u201cLike . . . she has three br**sts kind of different?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cNo. But, for the record, it wouldn\u2019t be a strike against her if she did. She\u2019s . . . cool. I have a good time talking with her, you know? She says she\u2019s not into relationships, but I think I\u2019m hoping I can change her mind. I haven\u2019t felt like this since . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexandra puts up her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t. Do not even say the foul beast\u2019s name. I\u2019m trying to eat here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s going anywhere, but I . . .\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t get the opportunity to finish my sentence. Because a wave of icy, red liquid splashes in my face.</p><p>Tastes like cherry.</p><p>\u201cLying motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>I swipe my face, clearing the fluid off my eyelashes. When my vision clears, I see Delores standing on the sidewalk\u2014with a now-empty Slurpee cup clenched in her hand.</p><p>Which she proceeds to throw at my f**king head.</p> <p>\u201cAll that talk about not hooking up with other people! Exclusive f**k buddies, you said! I would\u2019ve liked you if you had just been straight with me! I knew it\u2014I knew you were just another false-faced bastard who doesn\u2019t like to share his sex toys but has no problem playing with a different one!\u201d</p><p>By this time, Alexandra and I are both on our feet. And I have no idea what\u2019s going on.</p><p>I try, \u201cDelores . . .\u201d</p><p>But she cuts me off. \u201cFour days! You tell me four days ago that you\u2019re not interested in screwing anyone else, and here I find you with . . . with . . .\u201d</p><p>Lexi holds out her hand for a shake. \u201cAlexandra Reinhart.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s incendiary glare turns to Lexi. But her tirade stops as she wonders. \u201cReinhart. How do I know that name?\u201d</p><p>She lets me answer. Finally. \u201cShe\u2019s Mackenzie\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>If you look closely, you can almost see our previous conversation replaying in Delores\u2019s eyes. \u201cMackenzie . . . the pseudo niece?\u201d Her head turns more fully to me. \u201cThat means she\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl I grew up with\u2014yes. Drew\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra takes over for me. \u201cDrew\u2019s sister, Steven\u2019s wife, daughter of John and Anne. I have many designations. One, in particular, is about to be put to good use.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s times like this I suspect Alexandra knows about her nickname. And it scares me.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s eyes stay on Dee, but she says to me, \u201cI see what you meant about different.\u201d Then to Delores, \u201cYou must be Delores. Matthew was just telling me about you. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, but I\u2019ve reached my bullshit quota for the week.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra circles her slowly\u2014like a shark checking out a wounded seal. \u201cYou know, Delores, my mother used to tell me that even though a man wasn\u2019t supposed to ever strike a woman, I should never take advantage of that. That I should never act without expecting an equal and deserving reaction.\u201d</p><p>Dee folds her arms across her chest and stands stubbornly tall under the weight of Lexi\u2019s disapproving gaze.</p><p>\u201cMatthew\u2019s explained our relationship to you. He\u2019s like a second brother to me. And of the two of them? He\u2019s the nicer one. You should keep that in mind before you think about tossing Icees at his head again.\u201d</p><p>Dee gives just a little. She looks down at the sidewalk and mutters defensively, \u201cIt was a Slurpee.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra snaps her fingers at me. \u201cGive me your shirt and jacket.\u201d</p><p>After taking off my tie, I hand the items to her and stand on the sidewalk in a plain white undershirt and gray slacks. Dee reaches for the stained clothes in Lexi\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll pay to have them dry-cleaned.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra rolls her eyes. \u201cThe dry cleaners won\u2019t be able to get this out. Luckily, I have a homemade paste that should save the day.\u201d She says to me, \u201cYou can pick it up Saturday.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on my shoulders and kisses my cheek while wiping some remaining red slush off my ear with a napkin. \u201cI have to get going. Good luck\u2014you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p><p>Before Alexandra leaves, Dee offers, \u201cI hope the next time we meet, it\u2019ll be under better circumstances.\u201d</p><p>And Alexandra responds, \u201cI seriously doubt we\u2019ll be meeting again. Matthew\u2019s sweet, not stupid.\u201d Then she grabs her purse and walks down the street.</p><p>Dee and I watch her go.</p><p>Almost to herself Dee says, \u201cIs she always that much of a bitch?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what she does.\u201d Then I run a hand through my sticky, stiff hair. \u201cWhat the f**k, Dee?\u201d</p><p>The arm folding is back, and she babbles, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing. It was a natural mistake. I told you I\u2019m not good at this. Apparently, I even screw up f**k buddies. I was walking around on my lunch break, and I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw you. What else was I supposed to think? If you want to blow me off, that\u2019s your decision to make, but I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grasp her shoulders, dip my head, and shut her the hell up with a deep kiss. Then I tell her, \u201cI\u2019m not blowing you off. And you don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d</p><p>I know, I know\u2014are you out of your f**king mind, Matthew? No, I\u2019m not nuts\u2014I just don\u2019t mind a chick with passion, spark. And a little possessiveness is no big deal. Plus, as Barney Stinson has already explained, Delores is hot enough to be as bat-shit crazy as she wants to be, and I still won\u2019t kick her out of bed.</p><p>Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to let her get by without payback. Which is why I pull her tight against me and rub my head against her face and hair. Spreading the love\u2014and as much of the Slurpee as I can.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d she yells and laughs and smacks me on the back.</p> <p>Eventually, I lean away and say, \u201cThere. Now we\u2019re even.\u201d I kiss her lips quickly. \u201cI\u2019m going to head home for a shower.\u201d Then I get an awesome idea. \u201cYou want to join me?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smiling as she rubs the stickiness off her cheek. \u201cI have to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cBut I\u2019ll see you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only as she\u2019s walking away that I notice the white lab coat she\u2019s wearing over her black leather dress, purple tights, and high leather boots. I call out, \u201cHey, Dee?\u201d</p> <p>She turns.</p><p>\u201cBring the lab coat home with you tonight. And a pair of safety goggles if you\u2019ve got them.\u201d You may think it\u2019s too early in our relationship for role play. But I\u2019ll tell you a secret: It\u2019s never too early for role play.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>For the next few nights, Delores and I hang out. We go dancing at clubs and stay in; we start movies but miss the endings; we have long hours of sweaty sex\u2014the kind you feel dirty about afterward and can\u2019t wait to do all over again.</p><p>We also talk\u2014surprisingly. In bed or across the dinner table.</p><p>On top of the dinner table.</p> <p>Dee\u2019s chatty. A sharer, an explainer. She also has . . . theories . . . on just about every topic imaginable. Though all of her theories are entertaining, some are pretty out there. Take this, for example:</p><p>\u201cJohn Hughes was a raging sexist pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at The Breakfast Club. The guys get five main stereotypes\u2014the jock, the criminal, the brain, the ass**le teacher, the cool laid-back janitor. What do girls get? Two. The beauty queen and the whack job\u2014subliminally telling generations of teenage girls they can be beautiful or they can be crazy, but not both. Because at the end, when the crazy girl gets beautiful, she\u2019s no longer crazy. It\u2019s f**ked up. I\u2019m going to start a petition about it.\u201d</p><p>Or this:</p><p>\u201cMicrowaves are evil\u2014I\u2019ll never own one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sharp rise in childhood illnesses, allergies, and developmental disabilities can all be traced back to the moment microwaves became common fixtures in the home. It\u2019s malevolent consumer abuse. But you have to keep it to yourself. Corporations have ears and eyes everywhere, and there\u2019s no lengths they won\u2019t go to, to cover it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>Then, there\u2019s this little gem:</p><p>\u201cYou actually think the Egyptians built the pyramids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014it\u2019s well documented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you poor, gullible man. How were they able to move stones as big as a house? How were they able to make underground, structurally sound tunnels and rooms without any engineering equipment? Or, for that matter, how were they able to shape and cut the blocks at precise and identical angles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . if the Egyptians didn\u2019t build them, who did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAliens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAliens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s tons of proof that aliens have been visiting Earth for centuries\u2014you don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>Nope, and I don\u2019t want to. That last one is too freaky\u2014and plausible\u2014for me.</p><p>I wake up Saturday morning to the sounds of running water from the shower. And the screechy echo of Delores\u2019s singing from inside it. \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d by Taylor Swift is probably the most annoying song ever written\u2014but hearing Dee\u2019s awful rendition just makes me chuckle.</p><p>Never one to waste good wood\u2014particularly the morning kind\u2014I grab a condom out of the nightstand drawer, slip out of bed, and step into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201c. . . trouble . . . ah . . . ah . . .\u201d Her eyes are closed and her head is tilted back to rinse her long hair under the spray. \u201c. . . ah . . .\u201d</p><p>I get into the shower and waste no time, going immediately for Dee\u2019s succulent nipple that\u2019s already pointy and proud. She\u2019s not startled. She doesn\u2019t yell. Her pitchy \u201cah\u201d changes to a muted moan, and her hands slide across my shoulder blades, pulling me closer.</p><p>I like that she knows it\u2019s me, without opening her eyes.</p><p>I realize the likelihood of anyone else worshipping her beautiful tits at this place and time except me is slim to none. But what I mean is . . . she knows my touch. My sounds, my movements. We\u2019ve become used to\u2014attuned to\u2014each other in the greatest of ways. I know she likes her hair pulled just before she\u2019s about to come. And she knows it drives me crazy to watch her finger her nipple ring or when she traces my abs with her tongue.</p><p>Once she\u2019s rubbing\u2014squirming\u2014against me, I release her breast and devour her lips, sliding my mouth against hers and my tongue inside her warm heat. Without breaking the kiss, I roll on the condom with deft fingers. Then I wrap an arm around her waist and lift her against me with little effort.</p><p>Her legs take their natural place around my hips. Cock in hand, I drag the head across her pu**y and even with the warmth of the water raining down around us, I feel how hot and eager she is.</p><p>I push inside her fully, pressing her back up against the tiled wall. She tears her mouth from mine and moans. Her head tilts back as I start to move\u2014strong, deliberate strokes that fill her completely. I pant against her cheek. She bites my shoulder and I groan.</p><p>Her legs squeeze me tighter, and I move faster. Wanting to go deeper. Harder. More.</p><p>Always more.</p><p>She grunts. \u201cI love your cock. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d She grinds against me, lifting herself up and down on me, in time with the movements of my hips. \u201cFuck me, Matthew . . . f**k me with your perfect cock.\u201d</p><p>Her words get me hotter. Make me harder.</p><p>I feel the flutter of her muscles starting to contract around me\u2014tightening\u2014making each thrust of my hips all the more intense and eye-crossingly pleasurable. I speed up even more, wanting us to come together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her back is flat against the wall, not an inch of space between our chests as I press into her deeper and deeper. Then she\u2019s clenching me, holding me inside as she comes with a high whimper. And I\u2019m right there with her\u2014crying her name as every nerve in my body explodes in a rapturous frenzy.</p><p>Dee kisses me again. Slower this time, almost tenderly. I don\u2019t let her go right away, but I bury my face in the crook of her neck, content to stay right here with her. All day if I could.</p><p>She nuzzles my ear with her lips and whispers, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d</p> <p>I turn, so we\u2019re both directly under the spray, and eventually I loosen my embrace and set her down. Wearing ludicrously satisfied smiles, we wash each other slowly then step out into the steamy bathroom.</p><p>As I towel off, I glance at my watch. \u201cShit, I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>Dee rubs her hair with the cotton cloth. \u201cLate for what?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cI\u2019ve got a date.\u201d</p><p>For all of Delores\u2019s insistence that she doesn\u2019t want to be serious, it\u2019s obvious my statement bugs the hell out of her. Her elegant shoulders stiffen, her chin rises, her eyes darken and narrow. She tries her best to keep her voice nonchalant.</p> <p>Tries\u2014and fails.</p><p>\u201cOh, a date? That\u2019s nice. Good for you.\u201d</p><p>I grasp her hips and pull her up against me so she\u2019s got nowhere to look but at my grinning face. \u201cYou want to join us?\u201d</p><p>She tries to pull away. \u201cIt\u2019s a little soon for a threesome, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>My ears perk right up. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a threesome?\u201d</p><p>On second thought, I don\u2019t want to know.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind. Don\u2019t answer that. Although I like where your thoughts are headed. I\u2019m not asking for a threesome. I\u2019m asking you to come to the zoo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds kinky.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her hips. \u201c. . . with Mackenzie and me.\u201d</p><p>Dee processes my words. Then she smiles\u2014a relieved, grateful smile. She thinks a moment more. \u201cWon\u2019t Miss The-Dry-Cleaners-Will-Never-Get-That-Out have a problem with me tagging along?\u201d</p><p>Many families are way too involved in each other\u2019s business. You know the kind I mean. Sisters who refuse to speak to each other because one married a guy the other didn\u2019t like. Brothers who come to blows because of a bitchy girlfriend, and friends who fall out of touch because someone refused to listen to advice that was never asked for in the first frigging place.</p><p>Even if Alexandra full-out hated Dee\u2019s guts, out of respect for me, she\u2019d never show it. For months, Drew tried to tell me Rosaline wasn\u2019t the girl I thought she was, and even though I didn\u2019t believe him, even though he turned out to be right, he didn\u2019t rub my face in it.</p><p>The best kinds of families try to stop a train wreck\u2014but if they can\u2019t, they still show up to give first aid to the walking wounded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be with me. She\u2019ll be fine with it.\u201d</p> <p>Alexandra and Steven\u2019s east side condo is a gorgeous place\u2014I think it was featured in Architectural Digest or something. Despite the grandeur of it, Lexi still manages to make it feel like a home, not a museum. She opens the door for Dee and me, and we walk into the shiny, marble-floored entryway.</p><p>On her best behavior, Dee says, \u201cHello, Alexandra. It\u2019s so nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelores\u2014what a surprise. You\u2019ll be joining Matthew and Mackenzie at the zoo today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Lexi smiles, but there\u2019s a teasing shine in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Only, I do try to discourage Mackenzie from throwing her food, so please remember to set a positive example.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around Dee. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to control ourselves . . . but I make no promises.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Mackenzie comes riding into the foyer. She drives her red, bell-ringing tricycle around the circular mahogany table in the center of the room, shaking the ornate arrangement of orchids and lilies in their vase. Reminds me of Danny Torrance from The Shining but without the hair-raising eeriness.</p><p>Mackenzie parks the trike and climbs her denim-overall-wearing self off. \u201cHi, Uncle Matthew!\u201d</p><p>I get a hug.</p><p>\u201cHey, princess.\u201d I tilt my head in Delores\u2019s direction. \u201cThis is my friend Dee. She\u2019s going to come to the zoo with us today, all right?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s never been a shy kid\u2014she\u2019s confident and candid, no matter where she is or who she\u2019s with. Traits that run strong in her family.</p><p>\u201cHi, Miss Dee.\u201d The \u201cMiss\u201d is all Alexandra. She\u2019s drilled titles of respect into Mackenzie\u2019s head since she learned to talk.</p><p>Delores waves. Then Mackenzie zeroes in on the black fur vest she\u2019s wearing. She reaches out and pets it\u2014like a rabbit. Then she asks, \u201cIs that your Halloween costume?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s wearing tight white pants, a white top, and black sneakers that someone Bejeweled within an inch of their lives. With the vest, I can see why Mackenzie might think it\u2019s a costume\u2014a Dalmatian, or a zebra.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie, that\u2019s rude,\u201d Lexi admonishes.</p><p>But Dee waves her hand. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She crouches down to eye level with Mackenzie. \u201cI like to dress like every day is Halloween.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s face brightens. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Can I do that, Momma?\u201d</p><p>Alexandra shakes her head. \u201cNo. You only get to be Frankenberry once a year.\u201d</p><p>With that, I get handed a neutral-colored man-purse with all the essentials that have to be in reach whenever any child Mackenzie\u2019s age leaves the house. And we head to the zoo.</p><p>When I was a kid, I thought zoos were pretty f**ked up. You take a bear, or a lion\u2014the king of the jungle\u2014and lock him in a 300 by 300 foot cage, add some greenery, and expect him to be happy? Wild animals are meant to be . . . wild. As I got older, I realized that a lot of the animals were rescued because they were sick or injured and wouldn\u2019t survive on the outside anyway. Although there\u2019s something to be said for nature taking its course, now I look at zoos as a wildlife retirement home where lions and tigers and bears get to live out the last of their days being cared for and catered to.</p><p>It may not be as exciting as living in the wild . . . but it sure beats being dead.</p><p>Dee, Mackenzie, and I spend the afternoon visiting all the exhibits in the Central Park Zoo\u2014the lions, the reptile house. Unlike every other woman I know, Dee actually likes snakes. When she was a kid, she wanted a boa constrictor for her birthday, but her mother said no. Her cousin bought her a rubber one in consolation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We eat lunch\u2014pizza\u2014and I don\u2019t even look at the hot dog cart. My days of chili dogs are over.</p><p>Dee buys Mackenzie a polar bear balloon and they have a long discussion about how many balloons she would need to be able to fly, like in the movie Up. Dee\u2014because she knows about gases like helium\u2014was actually able to figure out how many on her calculator. Mackenzie was totally impressed.</p><p>I just hope she doesn\u2019t get any ideas.</p><p>At the moment, we\u2019re eating popcorn and watching the penguins. And Mackenzie asks no one in particular, \u201cDid you know the girl penguins got the boy penguins by the balls?\u201d</p> <p>Dee chokes on a kernel.</p><p>Mackenzie doesn\u2019t notice. \u201cUncle Drew say the girl gets ta pick any boy penguin she wants\u2014they has ta dance for them. Then, the boy penguin has ta carry the egg on his feet for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose girl penguins are some pretty smart cookies,\u201d Delores comments. And Mackenzie nods vigorously.</p><p>Next we move on to the monkeys. I\u2019m not sure of their breed, but they\u2019re small, white little puff balls that can only seem to sit still if they\u2019re trying to mount each other. Delores snorts and Mackenzie says, \u201cThey wrestle a lot.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. And talk low in Dee\u2019s ear. \u201cThese horny little guys are giving me ideas. We should go before I embarrass myself.\u201d</p> <p>Mackenzie\u2014because she obviously has dog hearing\u2014asks, \u201cUncle Matthew, whas \u2018horny\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m quick with the save. \u201cExcited.\u201d</p><p>She nods . . . and files it away in her adorable, unpredictable mind.</p><p>The three of us climb out of the cab back at Alexandra and Steven\u2019s. I hold Mackenzie on my shoulder\u2014she\u2019s half asleep. Dee carries Mackenzie\u2019s balloon and her bag and about a dozen small gift shop items I couldn\u2019t not buy her. Alexandra lets us in, and Mackenzie perks up, trying to rub the weariness from her eyes. I set her on her feet, and she hugs us both, thanking us without being told.</p><p>Alexandra tells her, \u201cThere\u2019s a package on your bed\u2014it came while you were out. I think it\u2019s the Elizabeth American Girl doll Grandma bought for your birthday, the one that was back-ordered.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s mouth forms a precious O, and she practically vibrates with excitement. \u201cI been waiting for dat! I\u2019m sooo horny!\u201d</p> <p>Then she scampers out of the foyer to her room.</p><p>Alexandra turns stormy eyes on Dee and me. \u201cCare to explain that?\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my neck . . . and then completely throw Steven under the bus. \u201cYou should really talk to your husband. He needs to watch his language around Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll make it up to him, I swear.</p><p>Dee joins in. \u201cYeah. Kids are like sponges. They just suck up everything around them.\u201d</p><p>From the look on Lexi\u2019s face, she\u2019s not buying it.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d Delores tells me.</p><p>\u201cYes, we should.\u201d I yawn. \u201cThe amphibians really wore me out. Bye, Lexi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye, Alexandra,\u201d Dee says.</p><p>Then we run.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>That night, I blow off clubbing with the guys. Dee and I order Chinese takeout and spend the evening fantastically f**king in every room of my apartment.</p><p>I\u2019ll never look at my pool table the same way again.</p><p>We pass out in my bed, and I sleep the sleep of the exhausted damned . . . until the rustling of clothing and footsteps wakes me up in the middle of the night. I crack my eyes open to find Dee not next to me in the bed but bustling around the room, searching for her clothes and pulling them on hurriedly when she finds them.</p><p>\u201cDee? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Her voice is wide awake and tense. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Go back to sleep, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Bleary-eyed, I glance at the clock: 3 a.m. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>I force myself to sit up, shaking the fog from my head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where I live, remember?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what bug crawled up her ass while I was sleeping, but I\u2019m really too tired to argue with her. I throw the blankets off. \u201cOkay. Jus\u2019 give me a minute and I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes scan the floor, spotting her purse in the corner. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll take a cab.\u201d</p><p>Sensing my time is short, I pull on a pair of sweatpants and grab a T-shirt that landed on the nightstand after it was ripped off of me earlier. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take the cab ride with you.\u201d</p><p>Delores stops and pins me with a sharp frown. \u201cIt may come as a shock, but I am capable of getting myself home, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the goddamn morning, Delores.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you live in a bad neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Manhattan\u2014any neighborhood could be a bad neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond. And she doesn\u2019t wait for me. I clutch my sneakers in my hand and barely remember to take my keys as I jog to keep up with her. Wide awake now, I slip into my shoes on the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you pissed off at me about something specific, or is this a more general \u2018all men suck\u2019 kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not pissed off.\u201d</p><p>Translation? You\u2019re an ass**le, but you have to figure out why on your own, \u2019cause I\u2019m not telling.</p><p>We walk out of the lobby. I wave the doorman off and hail a cab myself. The ride to Dee\u2019s place is strained and silent. I sneak sideways glances at her\u2014because the quickest way to get your throat ripped out is staring a skittish dog in the eye.</p><p>She sits stiffly\u2014not exactly angry looking, but anxious\u2014like a cornered animal waiting for the chance to bolt. When we pull up to her building, Dee is out of the cab before the driver comes to a complete stop. I ask him to wait for me, then I hop out after her.</p><p>As she slides her key into the locked outer door, I put my hand over hers. \u201cCould you, please, give me a hint about what\u2019s going on in your head right now? \u2019Cause I\u2019m . . . kinda lost here, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She stares hard at our hands, then she faces me with a sigh. \u201cThis is just . . . you\u2019re moving way too fast for me.\u201d</p><p>I lean my shoulder against her building. \u201cIf you wanted me to go slow, all you had to do was say so. Hard, easy, fast, slow\u2014I always aim to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be cute, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t help it.</p><p>She wiggles her hands, fanning herself\u2014like she\u2019s on the edge of a panic attack. \u201cI woke up in your bed and . . . it\u2019s just too much. I feel like I\u2019m suffocating. I need . . . space.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Space.</p><p>Right.</p><p>This is an exclusively female concept. For a man, distance doesn\u2019t make the heart grow fonder, it just provides ample opportunity to find someone else he can stick his dick into. When a guy is really into a woman, he feels the same way about her as he does about Sunday football games\u2014more is always preferable.</p><p>Still, I see what Delores is trying to say.</p> <p>This time last week, I offered her casual, but the days that followed have been anything but. They\u2019ve been intense. Consistently frequent. And it\u2019s obviously freaking her the f**k out.</p><p>When hanging out with the same person every day becomes routine, it\u2019s difficult to remember what your life looked like before . . . or what it might look like after.</p><p>Although I\u2019m cool with the time Dee and I have been spending together, I don\u2019t want to seem needy. Desperation is a reek that\u2019s impossible to wash off once it\u2019s been sniffed.</p><p>\u201cYou need space\u2014sure\u2014I get it.\u201d</p><p>She opens the door and steps inside. And she turns back to me and smiles insincerely. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . call you.\u201d</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>Then she slams the door in my face.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t call.</p><p>Not the next day. Or Monday. Or even on the most-holy third day. I haven\u2019t been checking my phone every five minutes or anything . . . but I\u2019ll admit, the sucker\u2019s been fully charged.</p><p>Delores blew me off. Just . . . f**king wow.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019ve ditched girls in the past\u2014nice girls who didn\u2019t hold my interest. Yes, this is the first time I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of a blow-off.</p> <p>And no\u2014it doesn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>I should forget about her. There are plenty of alternates waiting to step up to bat. I should move onward and upward. Downward is always fun too.</p><p>I should . . . but I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not just that she\u2019s beautiful, wild, and her tits are the stuff wet dreams are made of. More than all of that\u2014Dee\u2019s interesting. Fascinating. Different than any other girl I\u2019ve dated before. The way her mind works, how she teases, challenges me\u2014I could spend day after day just talking to Delores and never get bored.</p><p>She makes me think, she makes me laugh . . . she makes me hard.</p><p>And just like a baseball scout can look at a Little Leaguer and see an MVP in the making, I know Dee and I could be great together. Legendary. I feel the potential every time I\u2019m close to her. That\u2019s what keeps my thoughts\u2014and my fantasies\u2014coming back to her. Because with a little time and some extra effort, we\u2019ll both be reaping some sweet rewards.</p><p>By Tuesday night, I take the bull by the horns\u2014or in this case, the bitch by the ears.</p><p>I skip the gym and stake out Delores\u2019s apartment building, hell-bent on catching her on her way home from work.</p><p>She\u2019s walking down the block now, briskly striding in shiny, open-toed heels, a flowy white blouse that billows with every swing of her arms, and a green, snakeskin skirt. I trot down to her. Her chin rises determinedly when she sees me, not missing a step.</p> <p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I walk beside her. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo busy to pick up the phone, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone call an exorcist\u2014you\u2019ve been possessed by my mother.\u201d</p><p>I grasp her elbow, bringing her to a stop. At first she\u2019s annoyed, but when her eyes meet mine, I feel it. Electricity. Excitement. Her eyes dance over my face, drinking in every detail. And my own relief at seeing her again\u2014after days of settling for paltry memories\u2014is mirrored in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not him, Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever jerk-off made you so ready to run\u2014scared of relationships. Of letting yourself actually f**king feel something . . . want someone . . . the way I know you want me.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms and cocks her hip. \u201cYou must not fly very often\u2014the airline\u2019s baggage weight limit is forty pounds. Your enormous head must weigh at least a hundred.\u201d</p><p>Depends on which head she\u2019s referring to.</p><p>I smile. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>She turns away, watching the passing cars. And when she speaks her voice is somber. A mixture of sadness and fear. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a \u2018who,\u2019 Matthew . . . it was a them. I\u2019ve been here before. There\u2019s no point in sitting through the drama when you already know the ending.\u201d</p><p>I cup her jaw, brushing the warm, petal softness of her cheek with my thumb. \u201cBut I\u2019m not like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say, and I let myself believe them. But eventually, the truth comes out, and the guy I cared about\u2014the guy I thought I knew\u2014turns out to be a loser, or a gambler, or married, or just a plain old son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens at her wounded expression. At her hurt. And a part of me wants to hunt down every one of the idiots she referred to and smash their faces in for their stupidity.</p><p>I lean in close, ghosting my lips along her neck. Because I want to overwhelm her so she\u2019ll forget about her doubts and her fears and all the ass**les she\u2019s ever known. And I\u2019ll be the only one she feels\u2014the only one she\u2019ll remember.</p><p>\u201cCome out with me tonight, Delores. One more time. Even if it\u2019s the last.\u201d</p><p>She wants to say yes. It\u2019s there in her eyes, in the way her body turns toward me and her hand naturally gravitates to my arm. But what comes out of her mouth is, \u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>I press my lips to her ear and whisper, \u201cGive me one more night and after that, if you want, I won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head back and runs her fingers along my jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re a tough guy to say no to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cAll right\u2014one more night. But the clubs are going to be empty.\u201d</p><p>I smile and hold her hand as we start walking toward her apartment again. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to a club.\u201d My eyes skim her smooth, bare legs. \u201cAnd, you should probably put pants on.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity sweeps across her face. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>I wink. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>If any of you out there were already wishing I\u2019d marry your daughter? You\u2019re gonna go nuts for this next part.</p><p>I pull my bike into a parking spot in the almost empty lot. I nudge the kickstand with my foot and climb off. Delores rips the helmet off her head for a better look at the glowing sign.</p><p>ROLLER-SKATING CENTER</p><p>We\u2019re in Newark\u2014the decent part. Because, like drive-in movie theaters, roller rinks are quickly becoming extinct. There aren\u2019t any left in Manhattan and only a few still in Jersey. I did some Google searching\u2014figured, given the pictures in her apartment, this would be the kind of date that would make Dee all giggly and gushy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And after hot and horny, that\u2019s the next best thing.</p><p>As usual, I wasn\u2019t wrong. Dee\u2019s smile is blinding as she gets off my motorcycle. She claps her hands and hops up and down. \u201cOh my God, this is gonna be awesome! I haven\u2019t been skating in . . . I can\u2019t even remember how long!\u201d</p><p>It may sound pansy, but watching Delores smile is quickly becoming one of my favorite things to do. Finding ways to make her smile could easily become a new hobby.</p><p>\u201cDo you skate?\u201d she asks as we walk into the building.</p> <p>Growing up, roller-skating wasn\u2019t a frequent pastime for my friends and me. But, I\u2019m pretty sure I can hold my own.</p><p>\u201cOnce, when I was like, nine.\u201d</p><p>She grips my arm. \u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bike; you never forget.\u201d Her eyebrows wiggle. \u201cAnd I do a kick-ass shuffle.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d</p><p>Inside, the place smells like a mixture of rubber, floor polish, and slightly moldy rugs. After renting our skates and lacing up, we hit the rink.</p> <p>Where I proceed to fall on my ass. Hard.</p><p>But, in a cool way, of course.</p><p>Dee stands next to me, laughing, and offers her hand. I take it\u2014then pull her down with me. On top of me. I cover her giggling mouth with mine, and I bite her lip in punishment. But just when things are starting to get good, a pimply faced boy in a white-and-black referee uniform skids to a stop inches from us.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . you can\u2019t . . . This is a family place . . . You can\u2019t do that here.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cSorry.\u201d Delores covers her chuckle with her hand.</p><p>I drag myself up the wall and start again. By our second lap, I\u2019m steadier on my feet and we cruise next to each other. There\u2019s only a handful of other skaters on the floor\u2014most of them look under the age of ten. \u201cI think we\u2019re the oldest people here,\u201d I tell Dee.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Look at them.\u201d She points to a Hispanic couple that doen\u2019t look a day under eighty, holding hands, skating in perfect sync. \u201cAren\u2019t they sweet? That\u2019s how I want to be when I\u2019m old.\u201d</p><p>They look . . . happy. Tired, a little worn around the edges, but totally comfortable with each other. It must be gratifying to be with someone who knows you as well as you know yourself\u2014and at the end of the day, still wants to go roller-skating with you.</p><p>\u201cBeing them when I\u2019m old would be nice. Being Hugh Hefner would be better.\u201d</p><p>Dee throws her head back and laughs. Then she agrees with me.</p><p>Later, Delores is taking a break, sitting down on a bench, while I get some sodas from the snack bar. As I hobble back, a kid with a slick smile and a backwards baseball cap skates up to Dee. Physically, he looks about twelve\u2014but his attitude seems much older.</p><p>And he sounds like Joey Tribbiani. \u201cHey, babe, how you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dee smirks. \u201cI\u2019m doin\u2019 awesome, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you and me\u2014next couples skate?\u201d</p> <p>Before she can answer, I\u2019m there handing her the soda\u2014and answering for her. \u201cI got next couples skate, kid. Called it.\u201d</p><p>His little punk eyes look me over. Then he tells Dee, \u201cYou get sick of the Angus beef over here and wanna try some veal, I\u2019ll be over there.\u201d He hooks his thumb toward the arcade games that line the wall, then he skates away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>Delores chuckles. \u201cThat is exactly how I picture you as a kid.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s close. I was less obnoxious, much more charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you just thought you were,\u201d she says, then she takes a sip of soda.</p><p>And the DJ\u2019s voice comes out over the loudspeaker. \u201cThe next skate is couples only . . . and we\u2019ve got a dedication.\u201d</p><p>I watch her reaction. Waiting.</p><p>\u201c \u2018All I Want Is You\u2019 by U2 is going out to Dee from Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen, and her teeth clasp her bottom lip\u2014with excitement and awe\u2014because she never saw it coming.</p><p>I stand up and hold out my hand.</p><p>Dee shakes her head a little, then she smiles up at me. \u201cYou just made every dream of my thirteen-year-old self come true.\u201d</p><p>She stands and kisses me sweetly. Then she holds my hand and we move out onto the floor. And\u2014thank Christ\u2014I don\u2019t fall. The lights dim so only multicolored spinning spots illuminate the rink. Bono\u2019s voice howls out of the speakers as Dee and I smile at each other and skate. And it\u2019s ridiculous and immature\u2014silly and stupid.</p><p>And more f**king perfect than I ever thought possible.</p><p>Riding back into the city, we\u2019re stopped at a red light. I know Delores enjoyed herself tonight, and I\u2019m almost certain she has no problem spending the rest of it at my place.</p><p>But . . . I want to hear her say the words.</p><p>Women liked to be chased, want to be shown that they\u2019re desired, needed\u2014valued. And guys like me revel in the chasing\u2014but only if catching is a possibility. I want Delores to admit\u2014to acknowledge\u2014that she\u2019s caught. That she\u2019s in this with me. That she wants it just as bad as I do.</p><p>I turn in my seat so I can see her face. \u201cDo you want to call it . . . or are you gonna stay with me?\u201d</p><p>My words are heavy with double meaning. And when her brows furrow with deliberation, I know she understands what I\u2019m asking.</p><p>\u201cTell me this is you,\u201d she demands softly. \u201cTell me this is . . . real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is as real as it gets, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She mutters to herself. \u201cWhat the hell . . .\u201d Then she holds on to me tighter. \u201cI want to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>I grin\u2014with relief and delight. Then I rev the engine and take us home.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>On Friday night, there\u2019s an art show at one of my favorite galleries downtown\u2014the Agora. For the upper crust of New York, art appreciation is like a girl going out for the cheerleading squad in high school. Often, it\u2019s got very little to do with a love of the \u201csport,\u201d and a whole lot to do with the status symbol.</p><p>But I actually enjoy art\u2014beautiful paintings, interesting sculptures. Although I could do without performance and certain modern pieces\u2014pissing in a jar and calling it art is not my idea of f**king talent.</p><p>I swing by Dee\u2019s at seven, but I leave my bike at home. Delores told me she\u2019s wearing a dress, so she\u2019ll definitely prefer taking a cab to the gallery.</p><p>And what a dress it is. When she opens her apartment door, all I can do is stare. My mouth hangs open\u2014drooling is definitely possible.</p><p>It\u2019s sleeveless and short\u2014accentuating her long, toned limbs. Bright blue and green geometric-dotted fabric covers her ample br**sts and the lower half of the dress. But the stomach and chest area are cut away, covered by a thin, sheer black material. I\u2019ve never seen a dress like it\u2014the definition of sexy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally closing my mouth, I hold up the large bouquet of red roses I bought for her.</p><p>\u2019Cause, yeah, I\u2019m smooth like that.</p><p>Dee\u2019s extremely grateful. Holding the roses in one hand, she trails the other down the lapel of my charcoal gray suit, over my stomach, and cups my junk in her hand.</p><p>It\u2019s unexpected, but always a pleasant surprise.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. Thank you,\u201d she whispers while stroking my dick, before pressing her strawberry-flavored lips to mine.</p><p>After she pulls back, I murmur, \u201cThe priceless art doesn\u2019t seem so interesting anymore. Maybe we should just stay in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, this is a dress that needs to be seen. And . . . you look way too hot in that suit to stay home.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t really argue with that.</p><p>Unlike the exhibitions at major museums like the Met, private gallery shows are smaller, more intimate affairs. Although it\u2019s open to the public, typically only serious buyers attend, and the wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres served by the white-gloved attendants are chosen specifically to cater to the expensive tastes of those patrons.</p> <p>Both of us enjoy a glass of white wine as we peruse the photographs and paintings on the walls. The floors of the gallery are natural wood\u2014the walls, stark white, with dramatic overhead lighting accenting each piece. Guests are scattered around the maze-like rooms, voicing their opinions of the works in hushed, pretentious tones. Delores and I are alone in one partitioned area, whose walls are dotted with vibrantly colored and variously sized canvases depicting a wide range of subjects.</p><p>\u201cWhich one\u2019s your favorite?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you going to buy one?\u201d</p><p>The prices aren\u2019t displayed, but I know from experience that any of these pieces will easily go for tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>\u201cThinking about it.\u201d</p><p>But that\u2019s not why I asked.</p> <p>Art preference is very personal, almost subconscious. It\u2019s the same as learning if a guy prefers boxers, briefs, or going commando\u2014art teaches a boatload about the kind of person you are.</p><p>Dee strolls the perimeter of the room, stopping in front of a painting of a white farmhouse on top of a hill, with a fiery red-and-orange sky on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cKatie would like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head. \u201cIt\u2019s very neat\u2014cozy and safe. But the sky . . . there\u2019s kind of a wild side to it too.\u201d</p><p>I point to a piece on the opposite wall. \u201cDrew would go for that one.\u201d</p><p>She glances at it. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a picture of a naked woman?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cYes. And . . . because it doesn\u2019t try to be something it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a picture of a flower that\u2019s really a vagina\u2014like it or hate it, it is what it is. Drew\u2019s a big fan of the direct approach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich one do you like best?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Immediately I point to a Jackson Pollock that\u2019s not for sale. It\u2019s busy with splashes and swirls of every color against a black background. Dee approaches it, looking closer, as I tell her, \u201cLooking at it never gets old\u2014I see something new every time.\u201d I glance back at Dee. \u201cWhich brings me back to my original question: Which one is your favorite?\u201d</p><p>She opens her small green purse and takes her phone out. She scrolls through the pictures on it before handing it to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>I look at the screen. \u201cThat\u2019s the periodic table.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a masterpiece. Harmonious. Perfectly organized. Dependable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t some of the elements unstable?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cSure, but the table tells you which ones they are. No surprises. No disappointments.\u201d</p><p>And this right here is the perfect example of who Delores is. Safety-goggle-wearing chemist by day, glitter-covered club girl by night. She wants excitement, spontaneity, but a part of her\u2014the part that\u2019s been dicked around by one too many pricks in the past\u2014craves reliability. Honesty. Truth.</p><p>I want to give her both. I want to be her roller coaster and her merry-go-round, her adventurer and her protector. Her impressionist and her periodic table.</p><p>As the show winds down, most of the guests congregate in the main reception room of the gallery. While Dee goes to the ladies\u2019 room, I stare at a huge sculpture in the corner, trying to figure out what it\u2019s supposed to be\u2014either an endless cavern or a swamp monster.</p><p>I don\u2019t notice the person who comes up beside me until she speaks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of acquiring this piece for my music room. It has a very inspirational energy, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Rosaline. She\u2019s well put together in a strapless beige dress, with her dark hair piled on top of her head\u2014not a strand out of place.</p><p>And she\u2019s smiling at me . . . like the spider to the fly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say more confusing than inspirational. It doesn\u2019t seem to know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s because it\u2019s willing to be anything you want it to be.\u201d</p><p>The tone of her voice, the playfulness in her eyes\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s coming on to me.</p><p>\u201cDo you still dabble in photography, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She giggles softly. \u201cDo you remember that time we went out to Breezy Point and drank too much of that awful Chablis? Your camera got a lot of use that day.\u201d</p><p>I remember the day she\u2019s talking about. We were young and worry-free and drunk on cheap wine and each other. But I don\u2019t look back fondly on any moment with Rosaline. If you have a can of white paint and add a drop of black, the whole batch will be tainted. Gray.</p><p>The memories that should mean the most\u2014the starry-eyed, first-love kind\u2014they just make me sick. Because every touch, every word and kiss . . . none of it was real.</p><p>Before I can respond, Delores is back at my side, holding my arm comfortably. \u201cThere are paintings hanging in the ladies\u2019 room! How do you think those artists feel? Their work is in a respected, renowned gallery . . . but only in the shitter.\u201d</p><p>For just a second, Rosaline\u2019s expression turns sour. Then\u2014like the actress she is\u2014she covers it with courtesy. \u201cWell . . . hello. I\u2019m Rosaline Du Bois Carrington Wolfe. And you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee what?\u201d</p><p>With a toss of her hair, like some blond bombshell from the forties, she says, \u201cJust Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you and Matthew . . . work together?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee just laughs. \u201cDo I look like a banker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . I wouldn\u2019t say you do.\u201d Her eyes cut to Dee\u2019s dress, and her voice takes on that bitchy, passive-aggressive tone that I can\u2019t stand on a woman. \u201cYour dress is much too . . . bold . . . for a banker. Not every woman would be so . . . brave . . . to wear something so unusual.\u201d</p><p>Delores smiles sweetly\u2014but there\u2019s a bite to it. \u201cSo nice of you to say. And your dress, it\u2019s so very . . . beige.\u201d</p><p>Rosaline caresses the fabric modestly. \u201cWell, you know what they say\u2014less is more.\u201d</p> <p>Dee looks her right in the eyes. \u201cAnd sometimes less is . . . just less.\u201d</p><p>She lets the jab hang for a moment. Then she turns to me. \u201cI love this song. Do you want to dance?\u201d</p><p>Instrumental music has been floating around the room all night. The song Dee loves is a jazzy, wordless version of \u201cUnforgettable\u201d by Nat King Cole.</p><p>Rosaline chuckles. \u201cMy dear, that\u2019s just background music. No one actually dances at these things.\u201d</p><p>Delores shrugs. \u201cLife is short\u2014I never pass up the chance to dance to a good song. Matthew, what do you say?\u201d</p> <p>I take Dee\u2019s hand and kiss it softly, so proud of her right now. \u201cI say, I\u2019d dance with you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Then I lead her to the middle of the room. As we pass Rosaline, Dee whispers, \u201cLovely to meet you, dahling. Ta-ta.\u201d</p><p>I take her in my arms and begin a smooth, easy fox-trot. Dee follows my lead effortlessly. \u201cWow, look at you, Fred Astaire. I didn\u2019t know you could dance like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very talented.\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d Her eyes slide in Rosaline\u2019s direction. \u201cSooo . . . is every woman you introduce me to going to be a bitch?\u201d</p><p>I think it\u2019s over. \u201cNo\u2014she was the last of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she an ex-girlfriend or something?\u201d</p><p>No man wants to tell the story of how he was played\u2014made a chump. It\u2019s embarrassing, uncomfortable\u2014we generally choose to block it out and replace it with stories of our winning touchdowns and all-night f**k fests.</p><p>\u201cOr something. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels like she\u2019s trying to slit my throat with her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Skillfully, I turn us, so my body obscures her view.</p><p>But Dee still says, \u201cShe\u2019s very beautiful\u2014like a Victoria\u2019s Secret model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, she doesn\u2019t hold a candle to you.\u201d</p><p>She stops dancing. Fully. Immediately. And her face\u2014her gorgeous face is a mixture of hurt and doubt . . . and a trace of resentment.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feed me a line like I\u2019m a girl you just met in a bar. Tell me you hate her, or tell me you want to f**k her brains out, and either way, I\u2019ll deal. Whatever you say, just . . . mean it. Be here with me . . . be real.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. Right on the money. Reflexes are a body\u2019s reaction without input from the brain. They happen independently\u2014without thought or consideration. Insecurity is not something I\u2019m used to hearing from Dee. And I sure as shit don\u2019t want to keep talking about Rosaline, so I said the first thing that came to my lips. Without thinking.</p><p>Without meaning it.</p><p>And she deserves better than that.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I pull her back to me, and we\u2019re dancing again, slower than before.</p><p>Dee rests her cheek against mine, and I kiss the shell of her ear before whispering, \u201cWhat I meant to say was, she\u2019s beautiful\u2014but only on the outside. You, on the other hand . . . you\u2019re like a diamond. Clear . . . and flawless . . . through and through.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head up to look at me. And she\u2019s smiling again. And I feel like a master of the universe.</p><p>\u201cI like that much better.\u201d</p><p>I brush my hand up her arm, over her shoulder, under her hair to the back of her neck. Then I kiss her softly. Tenderly. I worship her lips, venerate her tongue. It\u2019s wet and wonderful\u2014the kind of kiss that makes you forget you\u2019re in a public place\u2014or if you do remember, that makes you not give a flying f**k.</p><p>When the music and the kiss end, Delores licks her lips. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea.\u201d</p><p>When we get back to my apartment, Delores takes off her heels, dropping each one with a thud as she walks straight to the stereo system.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some wine?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Her eyes rake over me appreciatively. \u201cI\u2019m not thirsty for wine.\u201d</p><p>As she plays with the buttons, I press up behind her, skimming my lips across her neck and my fingers up her sides. The speakers come alive with \u201cDemons\u201d by Imagine Dragons. Dee presses the REPEAT button and swivels her ass against me.</p><p>\u201cI like this song,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI like this dress.\u201d</p><p>She turns to face me. And her breath tickles my ear as she whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re going to like what\u2019s underneath it a lot more.\u201d</p><p>She drags my jacket off my arms and drops it on the floor. I take her mouth, and she makes quick work of my shirt. Her hands glide over my chest as she backs me up, wordlessly guiding me to the couch. I sit back, expecting her to follow me down.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t. Instead she stands up.</p><p>And the heat in her eyes\u2014the hunger\u2014makes my heart pound. She retrieves my camera from the coffee table, then she kneels between my spread knees, presenting it to me, like an offering.</p><p>\u201cTake my picture, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I breathe heavy\u2014almost a grunt. And my c**k aches with anticipation. Of watching her, touching her, and yes, photographing her.</p><p>On some level, every guy wants to be a p**n star. I mean, really, can you conceive of a more awesome way to make a living? Disneyland may be the happiest place on earth, but Silicone Valley is the place men\u2019s wishes come true. Homemade sex tapes and photographs allow men\u2014and women\u2014to taste that fantasy. To reminisce and relive the most erotic experiences of their lives.</p><p>If that\u2019s too wild for your tastes, you may want to skip this next part.</p><p>Dee smiles when I take the camera from her hands. I double-check the film and the battery while she stands up and sways her hips in time with the music. Her eyes close, her head rocks side to side, her shiny, strawberry-blond locks fan out around her as she spins.</p><p>And she looks so . . . free. So beautifully unrestrained.</p><p>It takes my breath away.</p><p>I capture the moment with eager hands. Click, click, click goes the shutter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reaches behind her, pressing her tits forward, releasing the zipper on her dress. Unhurriedly, she peels it off her body. Revealing a sheer, black, strapless bra trimmed in bright blue with a matching thong. Her br**sts are firm and high and completely visible through the shadowy fabric\u2014including my favorite plaything, Dee\u2019s sparkling diamond nipple piercing.</p><p>Her dress lays forgotten on the floor as she gyrates and turns. I lick my suddenly dry lips, refocus the lens of the camera, and shoot.</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>Delores\u2019s hands slide down her thighs then skim up her stomach, cupping her br**sts the way I want to. My fingers twitch and I grip the camera tighter.</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>My voice is rough as I say, \u201cCome here, Dee.\u201d</p><p>And miraculously, she actually does. The moment she steps close enough, I pull her down on top of me, one hand fisting in her hair, the other kneading her smooth, tight ass.</p><p>She moans against my lips. Then her hands fumble with my belt, pushing my pants and boxers down in one fell swoop. Taking her\u2014and the camera\u2014with me, I slide from the couch to my knees, then down onto the floor. The fabric of Dee\u2019s lingerie feels whisper soft against my straining cock\u2014but not as soft as her skin.</p><p>I lay her down flat, then I rear back. Keeping eye contact, I slide her almost nonexistent panties off first. When I tug at the peek-a-boo bustier, it rips up both sides, but I don\u2019t let that stop me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one,\u201d I promise gruffly.</p><p>Dee gives the slightest nod.</p><p>When she\u2019s beautifully bare, ready and writhing, I pick the camera back up.</p><p>Click, click, click, click.</p><p>I set the camera down, close by, and cover Dee\u2019s body with my own\u2014giving all my attention to her amazing br**sts. I squeeze with one hand while I worship the other with my mouth. I lick around her nipple, then I encase it with my lips\u2014scraping with my teeth, flicking with my tongue, suckling hard until Dee cries out in that stunning symphony of elation and pain.</p><p>Then I start all over again with its exquisite twin.</p><p>\u201cDo you like my tits, Matthew?\u201d Dee moans.</p><p>I rub the pink peak with my firm tongue, then answer, \u201cI love them. They\u2019re perfect. I could do this all f**king night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like licking them?\u201d She whimpers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinching them?\u201d She sighs.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucking on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to f**k them, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>White-hot need goes straight to my cock\u2014making me moan. Because giving her br**sts a thorough f**king is a fantasy I\u2019ve courted since the second I laid eyes on them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I practically beg. \u201cGod, yes, I f**king want that.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, tantalizingly. A perfect seductress\u2014the face and body of an angel with a devil\u2019s desire. All willing and wanting.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Delores glides down beneath me, trailing kisses as she goes, pausing when her face is directly under my raging erection. As I hover over her, she takes me into the superb wetness of her mouth, all the way\u2014until I feel the tightness of her throat. She eases back, leaving a heavy coating of moisture behind when she removes her mouth.</p><p>I rise up onto my knees. Dee lies between them, her br**sts overflowing in her own hands, perfectly aligned with my c**k above them. Gently, I sit back, bracing most of my weight on my calves. She presses her br**sts together, encasing my rigid dick between their perfect, slick softness.</p><p>I savor the sensation. My eyes squeeze shut.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a smile in her voice as she tells me, \u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d</p><p>I want to move\u2014I want to pound against her in a frenzied rush until I find that paradise that I know is just waiting to be reached.</p><p>But I hold back\u2014and force myself to go easy. To let her take the lead. I open my eyes and meet Dee\u2019s fiery gaze. She pushes her tits up and down\u2014jerking me off with them\u2014again and again.</p><p>The feeling\u2014Jesus Christ\u2014it\u2019s more incredible than I ever conceived.</p><p>Dee\u2019s hands still, just maintaining the snug fit, while I drive my hips forward and back\u2014slowly\u2014drawing out the indulgence. Then I hunch over and speed up\u2014my breaths come faster, my heart tries to break out of my chest.</p><p>Dee pants beneath me. \u201cUse the camera, Matthew. I want to see the pictures. After.\u201d</p><p>I hiss and I groan. Then I do what she demands. I grab the camera from the floor. And take the pictures.</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>But it\u2019s not the view of my c**k sliding between her luscious tits that I capture\u2014that image is already seared into my brain until the end of time.</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>It\u2019s her lips\u2014open in pleasure. Click.</p><p>Her wet, seeking tongue. Click.</p><p>Her amber eyes blazing with intensity . . . and trust. Click, click, click.</p><p>Those are the images I immortalize. The ones I need to hold on to.</p><p>Because outside of this moment\u2014beyond our searing attraction and erotic endeavors\u2014Delores doesn\u2019t trust me. Not fully. Not yet.</p><p>She wants to. She hopes I\u2019m worthy. But doubt still lingers, protecting her heart\u2014preventing her from putting her faith in me completely.</p><p>And it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t know what scars she carries. I don\u2019t know the experiences that taught her to be so guarded. I\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s ready to show me. I\u2019ll work at convincing her, that I\u2019m one of the chosen few she can give her trust to.</p><p>Because Delores is worth waiting and working for.</p><p>But here\u2014now\u2014Dee\u2019s body already believes what her mind is still wary of. That I\u2019ll never hurt her. That I want her\u2014desire her\u2014more than any other woman before her.</p><p>That I\u2019ll cherish every part of her\u2014her body, her mind . . . her heart\u2014for as long as she\u2019ll let me.</p><p>The song\u2019s drumbeat pounds. And the singer\u2019s words resonate.</p><p>This is my kingdom come.</p><p>This is my kingdom come.</p><p>My c**k slides smoothly between her br**sts in a sensational, steady rhythm. Then Dee lifts her head. She leans forward and wraps her lips around me, pulling as much of me into her mouth as she can reach\u2014sucking hard.</p><p>And it feels so fantastic, I swear I could frigging cry.</p><p>Pure undiluted ecstasy rips through me. I moan her name as I come hard and deep\u2014from the marrow of my f**king bones.</p><p>After Dee swallows every drop, she releases me from her mouth. Then she smiles mischievously. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thirsty for.\u201d</p><p>I keel over to the side, my legs no longer able to hold me up. And I try like hell to catch my breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a minute of silence, Dee asks, \u201cDid I kill you?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cPretty damn close.

Our skin is slick and all kinds of sticky wonderful. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d She giggles.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s about to get even better.\u201d</p><p>She looks up into my eyes. \u201cIs it really?\u201d</p><p>I smile and nod. \u201cIt really is.

She made a few jabs at the speed bag and was convinced hers was broken, but I showed her it\u2019s just a lot harder than it looks.</p><p>Delores was proud of herself by the time we left\u2014almost as proud as I was of her. She hadn\u2019t mastered the bag, but she was a hell of a lot better than most beginners.</p><p>Then Sunday morning rolls around.</p><p>I\u2019m awakened by whispered arguing\u2014that raspy, not at all quiet sound that\u2019s as annoying as frigging fingernails on a chalkboard.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014Mom, he\u2019s sleeping. God, would you just stop! I hate when you do this! Fine\u2014I\u2019ll wake him up. Fine!\u201d</p> <p>Hands poke and push at my shoulder.</p><p>I tell myself it\u2019s just a dream.</p><p>\u201cMatthew. Matthew\u2014wake up, my mother wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes open. And I see Delores isn\u2019t f**king with me\u2014she holds out her cell phone.</p><p>Parents love me\u2014always have. But, my first interaction with them is not usually over the telephone while I\u2019m in bed with their daughter at six o\u2019clock in the goddamn morning.</p><p>It\u2019s a little off-putting.</p><p>I whisper roughly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, join the club. But she\u2019ll keep calling\u2014just get it over with so we can go back to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I hiss. \u201cI\u2019m naked. I don\u2019t want to talk to your mother butt-ass naked.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a f**king telephone, not Skype\u2014get over it.\u201d She pushes the phone at me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Then she actually presses the phone to my face so I\u2019ve got no choice but to take it. My voice comes out forced\u2014unwillingly respectful\u2014like a class of grade school kids giving their teacher a group greeting.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ms. Warren.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is clipped\u2014strong. And I wonder if she has any military training in her background. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Fisher. I am told that you are having relations with my daughter\u2014please confirm or deny.\u201d</p><p>I look at Delores incredulously.</p><p>She just mouths, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cWell . . . um . . . not at the moment.\u201d</p><p>She harrumphs. \u201cI realize that Delores Sunshine is an adult and can make her own decisions. But given the state of the world today, I would appreciate it if you would indulge me by answering a few questions to ease the mind of a concerned single mother?\u201d</p><p>I cover the mouthpiece with my hand. And smirk. \u201cYour middle name is Sunshine?\u201d</p><p>Dee hides her face in the pillow.</p><p>My attention goes back to Ms. Warren. \u201cFire away.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cHave you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been treated for a mental disorder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But I\u2019m starting to suspect Ms. Warren has.</p><p>\u201cAre you gainfully employed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live in a structure that does not have wheels attached to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you fathered any children that you are aware of?\u201d</p><p>It feels like I\u2019m being interviewed by the scariest life-insurance company ever.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no children\u2014aware of or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you practice safe sex with my daughter?\u201d</p><p>And that concludes the trivia portion of our game show . . . thanks for playing.</p><p>I sit up a little straighter in bed. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, Ms. Warren\u2014I think your daughter\u2019s awesome. I treat her with respect, I care about her, I make sure she has a wonderful time whenever we\u2019re together.\u201d Delores watches me with warm, adoring eyes. \u201cBut frankly, the answers to these questions are none of your goddamn business. That\u2019s between Dee and me\u2014only.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren grunts. Then she says, \u201cWell, it was nice speaking with you, Matthew. Hand the phone to my daughter, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d I pass it over to Dee.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom. Yes. I love you too. Good-bye.\u201d She ends the call with a sigh.</p><p>Then she lays her head on my chest, wraps her arms and legs around me\u2014and squeezes tightly. I kiss the top of her head and run my hand up and down her spine.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hold her insanity against me,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met my parents yet. Like Ferris Bueller said, every family has weirdness in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . the good news is, she likes you. You\u2019re welcome to stay in the bunker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Dee closes her eyes and explains. \u201cA few ex-boyfriends back, Amelia dated a guy that was a survivalist. He built an underground shelter in our backyard. He didn\u2019t last, but the bunker has. She keeps it fully stocked, and the people closest to her are invited to hide out there, when, according to her\u2014inevitably\u2014the government tries to enslave the populace and take her guns away.\u201d</p><p>The hum of Dee\u2019s voice is just about to lull me back to sleep . . . when her words finally register.</p><p>I pick my head up. \u201cWait. Your mother has guns?\u201d</p><p>Monday night, I walk into my apartment and throw my keys down on the front hall table. And right away, something feels . . . off.</p><p>The air feels different. It\u2019s like a sixth sense when you live alone\u2014you can just tell when someone has been in your place.</p><p>Or if they\u2019re still there.</p><p>Nothing in the living room is disturbed. The same goes for the kitchen and dining room, which I scan as I walk down the hall toward the closed bedroom door. I open it and walk in.</p><p>And there, laid out in the middle of my bed, in a pale pink lace teddy with matching garters and stockings is . . . Rosaline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a lot of guys, this is a fantasy come to life. Right up there next to a hot, horny chick showing up at your door in a trench coat with nothing on underneath.</p><p>But for me? Fantastic fantasy\u2014wrong girl.</p><p>Her dark hair falls over my pillow in shiny waves. Her blue eyes gaze at me while her red lips stretch into an inviting smile. \u201cHello, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the f**k did you get in here?\u201d She doesn\u2019t acknowledge the shocked disdain in my tone. Or maybe she doesn\u2019t hear it.</p> <p>Her ruby smile stays perfectly in place. \u201cI told your doorman I was an old friend. After a little persuasion, he let me in. You really should complain to the manager. After what you paid for this place, the security is appalling. Although, I suspect at the moment, you\u2019re quite pleased about that.\u201d</p><p>She trails her hand down her stomach, teasing the thin fabric of her panties. Although my eyes are tempted to follow her hand, I keep them trained on her face. \u201cAnd you\u2019d be wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>She rises from the bed and stands in front of me, eyes downcast, hands folded\u2014the perfect picture of sexy vulnerability. \u201cI was wrong to leave things with you the way I did. Seeing you again has made me realize how much I\u2019ve missed you. I was hoping, now that I\u2019m back in the city, you\u2019d give me a second chance.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to lie. Hearing her say that is a rush. My ego does a fist pump. Isn\u2019t that what every jilted lover craves? To hear the former object of their affection say that they were wrong? Beg and plead to be taken back?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving Julian?\u201d I ask, stupefied.</p> <p>She giggles. \u201cLeaving him? Of course not, silly. If I leave, I get nothing\u2014the prenup was very specific about that. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t enjoy my own . . . distractions. You and I can enjoy them together. Frequently.\u201d</p><p>A few weeks ago I may have taken her up on the offer. Screwing Rosaline was always a spectacular event. And I\u2019m a guy. Regular sex without attachment is the pot of gold at the end of the frigging rainbow. Something all of us dream about finding but don\u2019t really believe exists.</p><p>But here\u2014now\u2014not even my dick is interested. Which is really saying something considering she\u2019s almost naked.</p><p>Rosaline steps forward and moves to put her arms around my neck. But I grasp her forearms and hold her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d</p><p>She looks genuinely surprised. Confused.</p><p>But before I can elaborate, there\u2019s a knock on my door. And Delores\u2019s squawking, singing voice drifts down the hallway. \u201cHow ya call ya loverboy? Come \u2019ere, loverboy . . .\u201d</p> <p>Motherfucker.</p><p>This is bad. Like building a house on an ancient Indian burial ground whose bodies are reawakened and really pissed off kind of frigging bad.</p><p>I walk away from Rosaline and make my way to the door, going over my options. I could stash Rosaline in a closet or under the bed, but if Dee finds her, I\u2019ll look guilty. I could try to rush Delores away from the scene of the crime, but if she ever finds out why, I\u2019ll look really f**king guilty.</p><p>The only viable choice is to lay it on the line\u2014tell Delores the truth\u2014appeal to her trusting nature and God-given faith in the honesty of her fellow man.</p><p>Yeah\u2014you\u2019re right\u2014I\u2019m totally screwed.</p><p>I open the door. Delores holds a Dirty Dancing DVD up for me to see as she dances in place. \u201cThis is the perfect movie for us! I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t seen it yet\u2014since your testosterone-drenched eyeballs have been too busy watching action movies and war p**n . But lucky for you, I own the director\u2019s cut with extended scenes. We can reenact the \u2018lift\u2019 scene. I also do a hot cha-cha.\u201d</p><p>I slide out into the hall before she\u2019s done talking and close the door behind me. That\u2019s when she notices the look on my face and stops dancing. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on her shoulders and say, \u201cI need you not to freak out.\u201d</p> <p>Of course saying that is just going to make her start to freak out sooner. Stupid.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I freak out?\u201d</p><p>I try to do better. \u201cYou have to trust me, Delores. I swear it\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not any better, is it? Shit.</p><p>Her apprehensive tawny eyes shift from my face, to the door behind me, and back again. She doesn\u2019t assure or agree, but demands, \u201cOpen the door, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Might as well just get it over with.</p><p>I open the door and Delores marches in ahead of me. Whatever she was bracing herself for, she doesn\u2019t find it. She looks around the living room. \u201cWhat are you . . .\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s then that Rosaline comes striding down the hall\u2014still covered in garters and lace.</p><p>Because if I didn\u2019t have bad luck? I\u2019d have no luck at all.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being rather childish about . . .\u201d Rosaline stops short when she sees Dee\u2014but doesn\u2019t seem even a little bothered. \u201cWell, this is awkward.\u201d</p><p>I grind my teeth. \u201cI told you to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were being coy. I didn\u2019t think you were serious.\u201d</p><p>I turn my back on her and face Delores. \u201cDee . . .\u201d</p><p>Half a dozen emotions swirl in her eyes\u2014shock, surprise, hurt, betrayal, anger, humiliation. Faith and trust are nowhere to be found.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t run.</p><p>And for just one moment, I think I might have gotten through to her. That she\u2019ll remember my promises\u2014think of my actions\u2014over the last several days and she\u2019ll come to the inevitable conclusion that I\u2019m not a cheating dickwad.</p><p>I\u2019ll give you a second to guess what she does next. Just to keep things interesting.</p><p>She slaps me. Hard. Straight across the face.</p><p>Slap.</p><p>Then she runs out the door like a bat out of hell.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d</p><p>I want to go after her\u2014I will\u2014but first I have some exterminating to do.</p><p>With an oblivious smile, Rosaline says, \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just about to toss your ass out the door. Still am. I don\u2019t want to resume anything with you, Rosaline. We\u2019re done. Don\u2019t try to speak to me at parties. If you see me on the street? Turn around and walk the other f**king way. If you ever pull something like this again, or try to interfere in my life? I\u2019ll make damn sure your husband and every society acquaintance you have learns that you\u2019re a conniving, cold-hearted, two-faced bitch. Understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her confidence evaporates and her expression turns wounded. But it only lasts a second. Then her eyes ice over. Angry, but controlled. Like a rat hell-bent on survival, even if it means chewing off her own leg. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>I give her a final glare as I walk out the door. \u201cDon\u2019t be here when I get back.\u201d</p><p>By the time I catch the next elevator and make it down to the lobby, Dee is nowhere in sight. I jog out to the sidewalk and search through the sea of busy New Yorkers until I spot her blond head retreating down the block.</p><p>And that\u2019s when it starts to rain. It\u2019s pelting and icy, like a giant sky-wide showerhead turned on cold full blast.</p> <p>Thanks a lot, God. Way to cut me a f**king break.</p><p>I weave between pedestrians\u2014trying my best not to get an eye gouged out by the flurry of umbrellas along the way. When I catch up to Dee, I grab her arm, spin her around, and yell, \u201cWould you stop running! I told you not to freak out!\u201d</p><p>She motions back toward my building and shouts, \u201cHow am I supposed to not freak out when you\u2019ve got a naked girl in your apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not up there with her! I\u2019m down here\u2014probably contracting pneumonia\u2014chasing the f**k after you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s then that I realize I\u2019ve asked Dee to trust me\u2014to believe that I\u2019m different from the ass**les of her past\u2014without really giving her a reason to. Any guy can show a girl a good time\u2014thoughtful presents, fun dates\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s honest. He could just be putting up a convincing front. Shielding an ulterior motive or a player persona.</p><p>To prove you\u2019re not hiding anything, sometimes you have to empty your pockets, open your bag, submit to a pat down. Even if it\u2019s uncomfortable or embarrassing. Trust has to be earned . . . sometimes by stripping yourself bare.</p><p>\u201cWe dated for two years in college. I wanted to marry her\u2014and I thought she wanted the same thing. But she didn\u2019t. She was cheating on me the whole time with an older, richer guy, and I was too f**king blind to see it. She dumped me when he got her pregnant. She broke my f**king heart . . . and . . . and now, I\u2019m so glad she did. Because if not . . . I never would have met you.\u201d</p><p>Delores looks surprised. Then sympathetic\u2014but lingering doubt is there too.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at Dee\u2019s wet, matted hair, her mascara-smeared face, her blue tinged-from-the-cold lips. Then I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>She takes in my words, and after a moment gives me a small smile. I hold out my hand. \u201cCan we please go back inside now?\u201d</p><p>She takes it. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>We walk quickly back to my building. As we get close, I see Rosaline step out of the lobby door\u2014wearing dark sunglasses despite the weather, an impeccably belted trench coat, with her hair pulled back into a low, neat knot. Her driver holds an umbrella over her head as she walks to the open door of the limo. I don\u2019t bother to watch her drive away\u2014I\u2019m just relieved that she does.</p><p>Back in my apartment, Dee wraps her arms around herself, but that doesn\u2019t stop her teeth from chattering. We strip out of our wet, cold clothes, and I fill the double-wide Jacuzzi with water, just short of scalding. Although few things are better than a splashing, slippery screw in a bathtub, that\u2019s not what this is about. I\u2019m not going to get all corny and say I just want to \u201chold\u201d her\u2014I want much more than that.</p><p>Just . . . not right now.</p><p>I relax against the back of the tub, my arms on the edges, with Dee\u2019s head resting on my chest, her body laid out beside me, turned toward mine. I close my eyes, enjoying the feel of the hot water as it loosens my muscles and warms our skin. The mirror-fogged room is quiet, peaceful\u2014both of us content just to be.</p><p>Until Dee whispers, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d</p> <p>I open my eyes, tilt my head so I can see her face. \u201cYou ask the weirdest questions.\u201d</p><p>I see her smile. She explains, \u201cGood deeds are easy to talk about. But bad things tell you more.\u201d</p><p>I inhale a gulp of steam and do a mental rundown of all my transgressions. Then I confess. \u201cI . . . cheated . . . on every girlfriend I ever had, in high school and college . . . before Rosaline. And the few times I got caught, I made them feel like it was their fault.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no judgment in Delores\u2019s expression. No horror or revulsion. Just curiosity. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>Why do guys cheat? It\u2019s an age-old question with varied answers. The simplest is\u2014because they\u2019re guys. But that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.</p><p>Some guys get bored. Tapping the same ass\u2014even if it looks like Kate Upton\u2019s\u2014can get old. For others, it\u2019s a game. The thrill of getting away with something they shouldn\u2019t, the excitement of possibly getting caught. A final few are just cowards. They don\u2019t have the balls to admit to a girl who loves them that they don\u2019t feel the same way. They think they\u2019re shielding her from hurt by letting her believe their commitment means more than it actually does.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was young and stupid. Selfish. Because I wanted them enough to bang them, but not enough to stop banging other women. Because I didn\u2019t know how f**king awful and humiliating it felt to be lied to like that.</p><p>\u201cKarma\u2019s a righteous bitch, though. After Rosaline . . . then I knew. And I swore I\u2019d never make someone else feel like that again.\u201d</p><p>In a messed-up way, Rosaline did me a favor\u2014taught me a much-needed lesson. Made me a better man. For the women who came after her.</p><p>For Delores.</p><p>I touch my finger to Dee\u2019s chin and bring her eyes to mine. \u201cI would never do that to you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Please, God . . . please let her believe.</p><p>She searches my eyes, trying to read me\u2014then she gives me a crooked smile. \u201cYes, I know that.\u201d She lays her head back down against me. \u201cBut, I\u2019ll still need a reminder once in awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I wonder. \u201cWhat skeletons are in your closet?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer right away. When she does speak, her voice is hushed. \u201cI had an abortion when I was sixteen years old. He was my first\u2014good-looking, cocky, came from the better end of town. He said he loved me and . . . I believed him.\u201d</p><p>She watches her hand move under the water, creating a ripple effect. \u201cAnd, I know I\u2019m supposed to have this . . . regret . . . about it. Guilt. But I don\u2019t. It was the right decision at the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStill,\u201d she continues, \u201cevery now and then, I\u2019ll think to myself\u2014I could have a kid right now. He or she would be about nine years old. And I\u2019m not . . . sad . . . exactly, but I wonder what my life would be like, if things had been different.\u201d</p><p>She looks up into my eyes. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d I pull her closer against me and kiss the top of her head.</p><p>Her tone is less weighted when she comments a moment later, \u201cI mean, wouldn\u2019t that be crazy? Me\u2014raising a little boy or girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want kids?\u201d I ask. \u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be any good at it. My mom wasn\u2019t exactly the finest example. I don\u2019t think she was ready to be a mother. I was an accident; Billy was a charity case. She loved us and tried really hard, but nothing was ever . . . stable . . . when I was growing up, you know what I mean? She was always changing jobs, trying to reinvent herself, looking for love in all the wrong places. She\u2019s more of a friend than a parent. I\u2019m afraid her inconsistency could be hereditary.\u201d</p><p>Even though this conversation has gotten way more serious than I ever would have predicted, I can\u2019t stop myself from picturing Dee as a mom. Cruising the city streets in her heels and halter tops, with an infant strapped to her chest in one of those baby-backpack contraptions.</p><p>And in my imaginings, the infant is the perfect blend of us: Dee\u2019s strawberry blond locks, my hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d be a great mom.\u201d</p> <p>Warm appreciation melts in her eyes and radiates from her smile. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Delores reminds me a lot of Alexandra, actually. Fierce\u2014fervent in her affection. A giver of tight hugs and plentiful kisses. That\u2019s the makings of the best kind of mom.</p><p>There\u2019s no more talk after that. We stay in the tub until the water turns cold, enjoying the comfortable silence\u2014together.</p><p>Some women won\u2019t appreciate hearing this, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway: You don\u2019t need love to have great sex. The most fantastic sexual experiences of my life didn\u2019t involve emotions at all. They involved women I was pretty indifferent to, actually. I didn\u2019t know them well enough to like them or dislike them. For some, I didn\u2019t even know their names.</p><p>But I knew they were hot\u2014I wanted them, was attracted to them, on a purely physical level.</p> <p>Lust is easy. Clear. Exhilarating.</p><p>Love is messy. Confusing. Sometimes scary.</p><p>Lust is powerful. Primal. Driving.</p><p>Love is dubious. Transitory. It can f**k with your head.</p><p>I realize this opinion isn\u2019t absolutely exclusive to men\u2014but statistically speaking, guys are much more likely to get satisfaction from a random, emotionless sexual experience than women are.</p><p>Google it, if you don\u2019t believe me.</p><p>Most women crave feelings with intercourse\u2014they might not even be able to get off without it.</p><p>But Delores Warren isn\u2019t most women. She screwed my brains out the first time we went out. Without knowing me well enough to feel anything, except lust. And it was awesome. For both of us. In fact, she seemed to have preferred it that way.</p> <p>Like I said . . . lust is easy.</p><p>But the night after Rosaline invaded my apartment, something changes. Shifts.</p><p>Transforms.</p><p>I don\u2019t just want Dee to come hard, I want to please her. I want her to feel happy, cherished\u2014in or outside the bedroom. And I want to be the reason she feels that way.</p><p>She sighs in her sleep, and the sound awakens me. She\u2019s on her stomach, the blanket only covering to her waist, exposing the flawless expanse of her back. I watch her face and wonder what she\u2019s dreaming. Her features are relaxed, smooth\u2014making her appear vulnerable and young.</p><p>Innocent.</p><p>And an ardent protectiveness fills my chest, clenching at my heart. My hand touches her first, softly trailing up her spine. Followed by my lips. My tongue. I taste the sweet saltiness of her skin, from her backbone to her neck.</p><p>\u201cMatthew.\u201d She sighs. And I know she\u2019s awake too.</p><p>She rolls over onto her back, her alert eyes finding mine in the darkness. I push the blanket away, and her thighs open for me. Welcoming me.</p><p>I move onto her, chests pressing, thighs aligning, her hips cradling. And when I kiss her lips, it\u2019s so much more than just a kiss. Different than the others we\u2019ve shared.</p><p>I want her to know what I feel. I want to show her\u2014with every caress, every stroke\u2014what she\u2019s come to mean to me. And more than anything . . . I want to know I mean the same to her. I want to feel it from her.</p><p>I slide into her fully. Her gloriously tight wetness stretches, yields, then clutches at me as I pull back for another thrust. My mouth hovers above hers, our breaths blend, our pants mingle.</p><p>It\u2019s f**king splendid.</p><p>She touches my face, and I kiss her chin, her cheek, her hair, her ear, showering her with my newfound feeling. Our movements are tender . . . not gentle or calm per se, but . . . meaningful.</p><p>Profound.</p><p>Her hips rise up to meet mine, fusing us deeper. I swallow the sob that falls from her lips as she comes before me. I plunge into her, unrelenting, through her orgasm, until I follow with an earth-shattering one of my own.</p><p>Her legs wrap around me, keeping me magnificently imprisoned in her embracing heat. We kiss as we come down, nibbling and biting at each other\u2019s lips. I turn my face into her neck, resting my head against her clavicle, breathing in her scent. Her hands skim my arms and settle on my shoulder blades.</p><p>A few minutes later, I reluctantly pull out. Dee\u2019s arms tighten around me, so I don\u2019t move off of her. We fall asleep in that same position\u2014with my body serving as her heavy blanket, and hers my supple pillow.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Over the days and nights that follow, Delores and I literally spend every night together. She finally opens up and tells me all about her ex-boyfriends. There weren\u2019t as many as you\u2019re probably thinking, but the ones she had were some real winners.</p><p>There was the first prick, of course\u2014the kid who knocked her up, then kicked her to the curb.</p><p>Douche bag number two turned out to be older than he\u2019d first said. Like . . . ten years older. And married. With a kid.</p><p>The ass**le after that\u2014this would be during Delores\u2019s college years\u2014stole her bank account information, cleaned the frigging thing out, and took off for Vegas. The dickhead left her a note explaining he had a rampant gambling addiction that he\u2019d been able to keep hidden from Dee for the months they were together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And finally\u2014there\u2019s the last gash. The motherfucker who hit her.</p><p>Delores said it only happened once, but once is way too many times for me. She wouldn\u2019t give me his name, but I swear on everything that is holy if I ever learn it? I\u2019ll track the f**ker down, go to his place, and break every bone in the hand that touched her.</p><p>Then I\u2019ll break the other one, just to be sure he won\u2019t forget.</p><p>Oh\u2014and then there\u2019s the story of her parents. Delores said her mother and father hooked up hot and heavy, swearing it was instant but lasting love. Until her mom got pregnant. Then her father turned into a ghost and disappeared . . . never to be heard from again.</p> <p>Now that I know the details about Dee\u2019s losing streak, everything makes so much more sense. Why she was so nervous in the beginning, even though she liked me\u2014because she liked me.</p><p>It\u2019s a wonder she even trusts me now. After her history, I wouldn\u2019t have been shocked if she threw in the towel and went full-out lesbian.</p><p>But\u2014as cool as that would be\u2014I\u2019m really glad she didn\u2019t.</p><p>The night before Thanksgiving is officially the biggest bar night on the calendar. Every year after the Day-Before-Thanksgiving Office Party, Drew, Jack, and I hit the clubs and party until the sun comes up. It\u2019s a great time. As traditional as turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.</p><p>Although, can I just say, I never got the cranberry sauce thing. Even homemade, it\u2019s f**king nasty.</p> <p>Anyway, this year I invite Dee along for the ride\u2014the office party and the after-festivities. I haven\u2019t hung out with the guys in more than two weeks. It happens that way sometimes. When a kid gets a new shiny toy for Christmas, the last thing he wants to do is let his friends play with it. He hordes it, hibernates with it, keeps it to himself, maybe even sleeps with it under his pillow. Then, after a week or two\u2014he\u2019ll let someone else have a turn.</p><p>Not that Jack or Drew are going to have a frigging \u201cturn\u201d with Dee the way they\u2019d probably like\u2014but it\u2019s time to bring her around. Let her get to know the boys so they can see she\u2019s a cool kind of girlfriend. The kind that plays darts and shoots pool and doesn\u2019t put a damper on the good times.</p><p>I call Dee\u2019s cell from outside her apartment building so I don\u2019t have to search for a parking spot for my bike. Then I smoke a cigarette while I wait for her to come down. When she exits the building, I smile appreciatively at her outfit. Black satin pants hug her legs so tightly, they look like they\u2019re painted on. Hot-pink stilettos match her halter top, and she carries a short black jacket in her hand. Her hair is pinned up and curled, drawing attention to the diamond necklace that falls just above her cle**age.</p><p>\u201cNice necklace,\u201d I tell her as I hand her a helmet.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cJunk jewelry from QVC.\u201d</p><p>I make a mental note to get her a real one. And the image of Delores dripping in diamonds\u2014and nothing else\u2014brings a leer to my face and a boner to my pants.</p> <p>She puts on the helmet but doesn\u2019t climb on the Ducati right away. She stands on the sidewalk, hands on her hips, looking thoughtfully at it.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say if I said I wanted to drive your motorcycle to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re shit out of luck. I don\u2019t ride bitch.\u201d</p><p>She knocks me upside the head\u2014but my helmet softens the blow.</p><p>\u201cThen let me take it for a ride myself. Just around the block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>She pouts.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cHave you ever driven a motorcycle before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve always wanted to fly, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna strap on a squirrel suit and skydive from the goddamn Empire State Building.\u201d</p><p>She steps closer and rubs her placating hands up my chest. \u201cCome on, please? I\u2019ll be really careful and grateful. Really grateful. Like . . . deviantly, let you handcuff me to the bed kind of grateful.\u201d</p><p>Forget the national broadcast system\u2014this is the test.</p><p>Am I going to stick to my man-guns, keep my pride, and protect my cherished vehicle from almost certain carnage? Or, am I going to be ruled by my dick and swayed by the promise of kinky, have-Dee-at-my-mercy-all-night-long sex?</p><p>No contest.</p><p>\u201cRiding bitch it is.\u201d</p><p>I slide back in the seat so she has room to climb on in front of me. Then I show her the clutch, the gas, and\u2014most importantly\u2014the brake.</p><p>You know that saying about your life flashing in front of your eyes before you die?</p><p>By the time we make it to the office building, I can say\u2014without a shred of doubt\u2014it\u2019s totally f**king real.</p><p>I saw my whole life laid out before me. Three times.</p><p>Once for the bus Dee veered in front of. Once for the garbage cans she took out like bowling pins, and once for the cab that almost knocked us sideways.</p><p>Although, that last one wasn\u2019t totally Delores\u2019s fault. New York cabbies are f**king crazy\u2014they\u2019ll take you out without blinking an eye and won\u2019t even check the rearview mirror to make sure you\u2019re dead.</p><p>Leaving my bike safely in the parking deck, Dee and I walk hand in hand into the large, festively decorated conference room. Classic, upbeat music emanates from the DJ\u2019s speakers stationed in one corner, mouthwatering aromas waft from the buffet table along one wall, and the sounds of chatter and laughter fill the room.</p><p>John Evans is good at many things\u2014but throwing a great party is at the top of that list.</p><p>I make the rounds with Dee, introducing her to my coworkers, my executive assistant. We get some drinks from the bar and hang out with Jack O\u2019Shay, who gives us the toned-down version of his latest weekend exploits. I spot my parents across the room\u2014as we head in their direction, Jack catches my eye, points to Dee, and gives me a thumbs-up.</p><p>My mother\u2019s petite\u2014more than a foot shorter than my father who, even now in his later years, stands at six foot two. She\u2019s getting on in years, her poofy light brown hair is a bit grayer since the last time I saw her. But her eyes\u2014the same hazel color as my own\u2014still sparkle with the lively sweetness they\u2019ve always had.</p><p>She was a true debutante, raised to be elegant, poised . . . and silent.</p><p>Legend has it, she met my father when he crashed her coming-out party, and there was an instant infatuation. He was rowdy in those days\u2014a partier\u2014but he was captivated by her calm serenity. She was helplessly attracted to his passion. And despite my grandfather\u2019s threat to disown her, they eloped four weeks to the day after they met. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mother doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body. She\u2019s soft, virtuous. Her voice is naturally quiet\u2014almost lyrical, like Jackie Kennedy in those historical White House interviews. My father has always been brutally protective of her, and there is nothing\u2014nothing\u2014I remember her ever asking for that he didn\u2019t immediately provide.</p><p>My father greets me with a handshake. \u201cSon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dee stands beside me as I get a hug from my mom. \u201cDarling.\u201d</p> <p>Introducing a girl to your parents can be stressful, particularly if your mother is one of those overly critical, judgmental, no-one-is-good-enough-for-my-boy types. My college roommate\u2019s mother was like that. She cut his girlfriend to pieces for wearing white frigging shorts after Labor Day. Needless to say, she wasn\u2019t his girlfriend for long after that.</p><p>But my parents are easy. My dad, in particular, knows I\u2019m not a saint. He thinks that if I can find a woman willing to put up with me, that\u2019s good enough for him. My mom just wants me to be happy. Her definition of happy is married with 2.5 children and a family pet. Any chick who can make that happen will be welcomed into the family with open arms.</p><p>If she\u2019s able to persuade me to sell my motorcycle\u2014she\u2019ll be extra adored.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, this is Delores Warren.\u201d</p><p>Delores smiles brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Fisher.\u201d</p> <p>My father nods. \u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>My mother comments, \u201cThose are adorable shoes, Delores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. They\u2019re my latest favorite pair\u2014and a lot more comfortable than they look. I can even dance in them and they don\u2019t pinch a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a dancer, dear?\u201d my mother asks.</p><p>\u201cNot professionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was your age, I loved to dance. I would make Frank take me every chance we had.\u201d</p> <p>Since Dee\u2019s glass is almost empty, I take the opportunity to get us both refills from the bar. I see Kate Brooks walk in and recognize the guy standing next to her as Delores\u2019s cousin, from the pictures in her apartment.</p><p>I hand Dee her fresh drink, and when there\u2019s a lull in her and my mother\u2019s conversation, I tell her, \u201cYour cousin and Kate just walked in.\u201d</p><p>My mom excuses us with, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, dear. I hope to see you again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Dee says warmly.</p><p>As we walk through the crowd she tells me, \u201cWe should take your mom out dancing sometime. I can tell there\u2019s a twerker inside her just waiting to bust out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBust out or bust her hip?\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>We reach Kate and Billy, and Delores introduces me to her cousin. He gives me a firm handshake. \u201cGood to meet you, man.\u201d</p><p>I nod. And Delores teases her cousin. \u201cKate finally got you into a suit, huh? It looks good\u2014never thought you\u2019d clean up so nice.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls at his collar uncomfortably. \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it. The only way this thing\u2019s coming back out of the closet is if I\u2019ve got a funeral to go to.\u201d</p><p>Kate rolls her eyes. Then John Evans joins us. Introductions are made and we talk shop for a few minutes. I see Drew across the room, making his way over to us. Having known him since birth, I\u2019m kind of an expert on reading his facial expressions\u2014even the ones he tries to cover. At the moment, he\u2019s pissed. Royally.</p><p>Not entirely sure what it\u2019s about. He and Kate lost Saul Anderson\u2014the client they were both aiming for\u2014a few weeks back. Although his old man was disgruntled, Drew was inordinately pleased with himself for telling the bastard off, so I know it\u2019s not that. He was also able to smooth things over with his father, so that can\u2019t be what has him riled either. For a second I consider that maybe seeing Kate\u2014the first woman I know of who has shot him down\u2014here with her fianc\u00e9 could be what\u2019s got him all hot under the collar.</p><p>But I discount that as soon as I think of it. Drew\u2019s possessive of his car, his clients\u2014not women. He doesn\u2019t do jealousy any more than he does relationships. So I just can\u2019t imagine him getting upset that a chick he wants to nail is nailing somebody else. Even a woman as attractive as Kate Brooks.</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d his father greets him. \u201cI was just telling Mr. Warren about that deal Kate closed last week. How lucky we are to have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all an act,\u201d Delores goads. \u201cBeneath her corporate suit and that good-girl persona beats the heart of a true rebel. I could tell you stories about Katie that would put hair on your eyeballs.\u201d</p><p>Kate shoots Delores a warning glower. \u201cThank you, Dee. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Billy chuckles and puts his arm possessively around Kate\u2019s waist.</p><p>Drew frowns. And although he\u2019s joking, his words are cutting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You were quite the little delinquent back in the day, weren\u2019t you, Kate? Dad, did you know she used to sing in a band? That\u2019s how you supported yourself through business school, right? Guess it beats pole dancing.\u201d</p><p>Dee looks sharply at Drew\u2014obviously not appreciating his tone.</p><p>Kate coughs. Drew hands her a napkin, chivalrously. But then directs his lethal wit at Warren. \u201cAnd Billy here, that\u2019s what he still does. You\u2019re a musician, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Billy answers.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell us, Billy, are you like a Bret Michaels kind of rocker? Or more of a Vanilla Ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you grab your accordion, or whatever you play, and pop up onstage? There\u2019s a lot of money floating around this room. Maybe you could book a wedding. Or a bar mitzvah.\u201d</p><p>Billy glares\u2014like he\u2019s just dying to knock Drew on his ass. \u201cI don\u2019t play those types of venues.\u201d</p><p>And with his next comment, it seems like Drew is dying for him to try. \u201cWow. In this economy, I didn\u2019t think the poor and jobless could be so picky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you piece of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kate tries to diffuse the tension\u2014like a referee in a ring, breaking up two boxers hell-bent on getting a piece of each other. \u201cBilly, honey, could you get me another drink from the bar? I\u2019m almost done with this one.\u201d She tugs on Warren\u2019s arm.</p><p>He huffs. But heads over to the bar anyway.</p><p>Then, sounding as livid as Drew looks, Kate says, \u201cDrew, I just remembered I have some documents to give you about the Genesis account. They\u2019re in my office. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a party, Kate,\u201d John states jovially. \u201cYou should save the work for Monday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll just take a minute,\u201d she tells him with a smile. Then her smile drops as she grabs Drew\u2019s arm and drags him away.</p><p>While John chats with an associate next to him, Dee leans in and tells me quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t like how your friend was running his mouth at my cousin\u2014and Kate.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her. \u201cHe\u2019s just competitive. It\u2019s business\u2014a dog-eat-dog kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>And I have no doubt Drew would give up his right ball for the chance to eat Kate Brooks.</p> <p>Dee\u2019s not pacified. \u201cIf he comes back and decides to be a dick again, I\u2019m going to tell him he\u2019s risking getting his cut off.\u201d</p><p>In the weeks since meeting her, I\u2019ve seen many sides to Delores\u2014carefree, seductive, tender, silly. But this is the first time I\u2019ve witnessed her protective side. I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for loyalty. The fact that Dee is so violent about expressing hers is goddamn adorable.</p><p>I press my lips to the top of her head. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d</p><p>When Kate and Drew didn\u2019t return to the conference room within a couple of minutes, I\u2019m guessing Billy went searching for them. Because ten minutes later, Billy and Kate appear at Dee\u2019s side\u2014both looking uncomfortable. Tense. Definitely not happy campers.</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t come back to the party at all.</p> <p>When Jack takes his leave a half hour later, I assume he and Drew made plans to start bar-hopping early. Given her recent threats against Drew, it\u2019s probably not the best night to bring Dee out with the guys after all. So when the office party winds down, Kate, Billy, Dee, and I hit the city together. We walk a few blocks and grab a table at a just-starting-to-get-crowded tavern that\u2019s hosting an open mic night on its small stage.</p><p>Delores and Kate harass Billy to sign up to perform. Billy nudges Kate with an elbow. \u201cSing with me. Like old times.\u201d</p><p>Kate shakes her head. \u201cNo way. My singing days are over. I\u2019ve hung up the microphone for good.\u201d</p><p>Although her tone is joking, Warren looks . . . disappointed. Maybe even a little wounded.</p><p>After downing our first round of drinks, his name comes up and he takes the stage\u2014borrowing one of the tavern\u2019s guitars. He sings a cover of \u201cHere\u2019s to Us.\u201d I don\u2019t remember the name of the original band, but I know their sound leans toward heavy metal and their lead singer is a smoking hot redhead with killer pipes.</p><p>And I have to say\u2014I\u2019m pretty frigging impressed with Billy Warren. His guitar playing is really good and his voice is awesome\u2014smooth, with just the right amount of gravel.</p> <p>Dee raises her glass, claps, and calls, all while bobbing her head in time to the tune. Kate, however, watches Billy with proud\u2014but serious\u2014eyes. I guess some of the lyrics are kind of sad, in a way. Poignant.</p><p>They talk about toasting love, good times, mistakes, and moving on.</p><p>Warren hits the last note of the song perfectly, and the whole place erupts in applause. Kate smiles and stands when he comes back to the table, telling Billy he did a great job. I shake his hand and say the same. While Dee goes for the more exuberant approach. \u201cAwesome job, Jackass!\u201d Then she hugs him until he turns red.</p><p>Kate excuses herself to the bathroom. And I turn to Delores. \u201cSo . . . I guess your cousin got all the musical genes in the family, huh?\u201d</p><p>Billy adds, \u201cI see you\u2019ve sampled Dee-Dee\u2019s singing skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you both\u2014I\u2019m an excellent singer.\u201d</p><p>Her cousin chuckles. \u201cSure you are, Rain Man. Cats come from miles around just to hear you\u2014hoping to get lucky.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and tap my beer bottle to Warren\u2019s. Then he ducks as Dee whips a pretzel at his head.</p> <p>Kate sits back down next to Billy, and I can\u2019t help but notice the space between their chairs. Billy leans forward and says, \u201cSo . . . I\u2019ve got some news. That music producer who came to my gig a few months back called. He wants me to come out to California . . . says he can get me into a studio.\u201d</p><p>Dee smiles joyously. \u201cOh my God! That\u2019s fantastic!\u201d</p><p>But judging by the look on her face, fantastic isn\u2019t what Kate thinks it is at all.</p><p>\u201cWhen . . . when did this happen?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Billy shrugs. \u201cA few days ago.\u201d He sips his beer.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I just hearing about it now?\u201d</p><p>Tension sweeps across the air like a swarm of locusts.</p><p>Billy stares hard. \u201cWhen was I supposed to tell you, Kate? You\u2019re never around.\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepens. \u201cWe live together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even when you\u2019re at the apartment, you\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>She looks away and pushes a hand through her hair. Delores watches them\u2014worriedly\u2014like a child of divorce stuck between two bickering parents.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . .\u201d Kate starts. \u201cI can\u2019t go to California now.\u201d</p><p>Billy keeps his eyes on his beer bottle. \u201cYeah . . . I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going by myself.\u201d</p><p>Kate looks completely blindsided\u2014hurt, and a little angry.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . we had a plan. You supported me when I was in school and now I . . . it\u2019s my turn to do that for you.\u201d</p><p>Billy pushes his chair back from the table. Defensive frustration makes his hands clench and his expression tight. \u201cWell, plans change, Katie. I mean really, will you even f**king notice when I\u2019m gone? \u2019Cause it sure doesn\u2019t feel like you will.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s about to ask what he means. It\u2019s right there on the tip of her tongue. But she stops short and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d</p><p>This just pisses Warren off more. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t want to fight. You don\u2019t want to do anything with me these days!

Good night, Matthew. Dee, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>As Kate walks out the door, Warren stands up to follow her, but Dee grabs his arm.</p><p>\u201cBilly! Don\u2019t . . . don\u2019t say things you can\u2019t take back . . . things you and I both know you don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>All he does is nod. Then he\u2019s out the door too.</p> <p>Dee takes a long drink of her martini. \u201cWell, that just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink they\u2019ll be okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make up, stay together\u2014do the long-distance thing. But they haven\u2019t been okay in a long time. Their relationship is like a morgue . . . lifeless. And Billy\u2019s right. I can\u2019t remember the last time they argued before tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d I wonder, finishing off my beer.</p><p>\u201cNot for them. They don\u2019t not argue because they\u2019re happy\u2014they don\u2019t fight because, I think, deep down where neither of them wants to admit, there\u2019s nothing worth fighting for.\u201d</p> <p>The most successful marriages and relationships are between best friends\u2014who want to f**k each other. Trusted confidants who can\u2019t keep their hands off each other. When you\u2019ve been with the same person for years, it\u2019s supposed to get comfortable. Broken in. Like a well-worn favorite pair of sweatpants.</p><p>But there has to be heat\u2014desperate attraction. A craving need. Sometimes, like Steven and Alexandra, it comes in waves. They indulge it, when the demands of life let them. But if the passion is gone and you can\u2019t be bothered to even try and rekindle the flame\u2014all you have is friendship. Companionship.</p><p>At eighty years old, that may very well be enough. But at frigging twenty-five? You\u2019re just settling for the status quo.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to head out?\u201d Delores asks.</p><p>\u201cYep. Looks like it\u2019s just you and me tonight.\u201d</p><p>She pumps her fist. \u201cWeekend warriors . . . on a Wednesday. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p> <p>Delores and I spend the next few hours bar-hopping. We play darts and pool. She takes me for fifty bucks on our last game because I didn\u2019t realize I was dealing with a practiced hustler.</p><p>I should have known.</p><p>Ultimately we end up at a club\u2014pressing and grinding together on the crowded dance floor. But the whole time, Dee\u2019s more subdued than usual. She seems weighed down. Disquieted. Not the unpredictable and jovial girl I\u2019ve come to know the last few weeks.</p><p>I call it a night\u2014much earlier than past years\u2014and we go back to her place. Once there, we crash on the couch and talk about nothing . . . and everything. Eventually, the subject of pets comes up, and I tell her all about King, the massive black Great Dane I grew up with. I genuinely loved that big hairy bastard, so I\u2019m kind of horrified when Delores tells me, \u201cI never had a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Never? Not even like . . . a Chihuahua?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI had a hamster\u2014they\u2019re pretty self-sufficient. My mother never wanted the responsibility of a dog. Plus, there was the drool phobia.\u201d</p><p>I grin, \u2019cause I can already tell this is gonna be a good one.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrool phobia. I have a long-standing aversion to any man or animal with over-productive saliva glands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle wet kisses\u2014you already know that. They\u2019re hot when I\u2019m caught up in the moment. But too much saliva is nasty. And spitting, drooling\u2014those are deal breakers. Makes me nauseous.\u201d</p><p>Delores isn\u2019t bothered by dirt or sweat or sloppiness. She\u2019s not afraid of rodents\u2014even the cat-size rats that scour the city and are pretty f**king frightening if you ask me. She\u2019s in love with my motorcycle and actually likes snakes. So, I can\u2019t help but find this quirk\u2014this chink in her otherwise \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit\u201d armor\u2014cute. Funny.</p><p>And I want to f**k with her about it.</p><p>The nine-year-old boy inside me\u2014the one who was amused by dangling a long-legged spider in Alexandra\u2019s face, despite the consequences that always followed\u2014takes over my body. It\u2019s the only explanation for what I do next.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . it would bother you if I did this?\u201d I scrape my nasal passage loudly then hawk the thick ball of phlegm up to the back of my throat.</p><p>Delores leans back, closes her eyes disgustedly, and holds up her hands. \u201cDo not do that.\u201d</p><p>I swallow my spit and taunt, \u201cAnd I guess you really wouldn\u2019t want me to do a John Bender in front of you.\u201d</p><p>John Bender\u2014The Breakfast Club. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, watch and learn.</p><p>She actually looks a little panicked. \u201cDon\u2019t you f**king dare!\u201d</p><p>I smile wide. Then I tilt my head back, open my mouth and launch an impressive loogie wad up into the air. It gets some distance, hangs for a moment, then falls back into my waiting mouth. Before I can say \u201ctasty,\u201d Dee is up on her feet screaming.</p><p>\u201cAh! That\u2019s sooo gross!\u201d She dances around like there\u2019s ants crawling under her dress and points at me as she shrieks, \u201cYou are no longer Clit-Boy or God! You\u2019re Loogie-Man and you disgust me! I\u2019m never kissing you again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>She laughs nervously and backs away. \u201cNo . . . no, you and your foul tongue stay away!\u201d</p><p>In a flash, I\u2019m off the sofa with my arms around her waist. Dee struggles to get away and we both fall to the floor in a screeching, rolling, laughing heap. I\u2019m able to get on top; I straddle her stomach and pin her wrists above her head. There\u2019s no chance for her to buck me off, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from trying.</p><p>And maybe it\u2019s the friction from her writhing body underneath me. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m having so much fun. Or maybe it\u2019s the fantastic sexual escapades we had in this particular position\u2014but whatever the reason, I\u2019m instantly and totally turned on.</p><p>Still, I ignore the boner. He\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon, and I\u2019ve got some torturing to do. Like a tentacle in a sci-fi horror film, my outstretched tongue slowly lowers toward Dee\u2019s face. Her head thrashes and her screams turn ear piercing.</p><p>Then she tries to bite me.</p><p>So I go in for the kill. I lick her cheek and her forehead\u2014making sure to leave a heavy slime trail, like a slug that\u2019s been mutated from a radiation leak. I get her closed eyes next, and I\u2019m about to move to her neck when there\u2019s a loud knock at the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wonder if a neighbor heard Dee screaming and called the cops. I roll off of her. She gets up, making snorting but revolted sounds as she wipes at her face vigorously. Then she threatens, \u201cYou\u2019re ass is grass, Fisher, and I\u2019m the lawn mower. Do not close your eyes tonight.\u201d</p><p>I just laugh.</p><p>Dee opens the door without looking out the peephole. And standing there, head down, guitar case in hand, is Billy Warren. He looks up at Dee and asks, \u201cCan I stay here tonight?\u201d</p><p>Dee opens the door wider to let Billy walk in.</p> <p>\u201cYeah\u2014sure. What . . . are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He drops his guitar in the corner. His eyes are moist, like he\u2019s fighting to hold back tears, but losing. \u201cKate and I . . . we . . . I broke up with Kate.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>After giving Delores the barest of details, Billy insists she go check on Kate\u2014sounds like she\u2019s pretty much a train wreck. Dee grabs her coat and makes eye contact with me from the door. Then she tilts her head in her cousin\u2019s direction, silently telling me to hang out with him while she\u2019s gone.</p><p>I nod firmly. She gives me a thankful smile then walks out.</p> <p>Leaving Billy-boy and me on our own.</p><p>I feel like I should play host, but this is his cousin\u2019s apartment\u2014he\u2019s obviously comfortable in it\u2014\u2019cause he knows where the hard liquor is. As soon as the door is closed, he walks to the kitchen and comes back with a bottle of vodka, two shot glasses, and two beers.</p><p>He sits on the couch, sets the on-my-way-to-shit-faced paraphernalia on the table, and pours two shots. He slides one in my direction and immediately downs his own. By the time I swallow my shot, Billy\u2019s already finished with number two.</p><p>He blows out a deep breath and stares at the table. Without looking up he informs me, \u201cYou\u2019re good for my cousin. You make her . . . happy. Dee\u2019s got crap taste in guys\u2014always has. Assholes are her usual type\u2014but you, you seem decent.\u201d</p><p>I crack open my beer. \u201cI like to think I am. She makes me happy too.\u201d</p><p>He nods. Then he looks up at me. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it\u2014the hell she\u2019ll most likely put you through. Delores can be a major pain in the ass, but it\u2019s only because she\u2019s been hurt\u2014trusted the wrong people . . . and now\u2019s she\u2019s scared of being wrong again. But . . . she loves . . . deep. She gives everything she\u2019s got. If she lets you in\u2014she\u2019ll never let you down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know she\u2019s worth it.\u201d I chuckle. \u201cAnd I\u2019m working on getting her to let me in.\u201d</p><p>Billy takes a drag on his beer. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He offers me another shot\u2014I shake my head and he drinks it himself.</p><p>Then he says, \u201cI know you don\u2019t know me, man, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be straight with me. Is something going on between Kate and that Evans guy?\u201d</p><p>The words hang for a moment, and I ask cautiously, \u201cDid Kate tell you something was going on between them?\u201d</p><p>He drinks his beer and shakes his head. \u201cNah\u2014just a feeling. She\u2019s always mentioning him\u2014either because he\u2019s pissed her off or he\u2019s helping her out or he\u2019s done something f**king brilliant.\u201d</p><p>In situations like these, I don\u2019t like to lie. I was raised on the idea that how you treat others is how the world will turn around and treat you. At the same time, Drew is my best friend. So while Billy seems like a good guy, if I need to have someone\u2019s back here, it\u2019s not going to be his.</p><p>\u201cKate really doesn\u2019t seem like the type to cheat, Billy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. At least, she never was before.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAnd Drew . . . well, he doesn\u2019t screw around with girls from the office. It\u2019s kind of a rule he lives by. He\u2019s never broken it before. Not once.\u201d</p><p>He leans back on the couch, mollified\u2014relieved\u2014by my statement.</p><p>Then, roughly, he says, \u201cThis sucks.\u201d</p><p>I agree. \u201cBreakups always do.\u201d</p><p>He snorts. \u201cThis is my first one. Kate and me . . . we\u2019ve been together forever\u2014since we were fifteen. She\u2019s been my first everything. I thought she\u2019d be my last everything too. My only.\u201d</p><p>I just nod and let him talk.</p><p>\u201cBut the last few years . . . it feels like we\u2019ve just been holding each other back, you know? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving her . . . but it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s not enough. We don\u2019t . . . fit . . . anymore.\u201d</p><p>Sympathetically, I tell him, \u201cThat happens\u2014a lot. People change.\u201d</p><p>He nods too. \u201cYeah.\u201d He takes another swig of beer. \u201cStill f**king blows chunks though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets better.\u201d</p><p>We sit silently for a few minutes\u2014our heart-to-heart time over.</p><p>So I pick up the remote and pull up the on-demand movies. \u201cYou want to watch Predator?\u201d</p><p>Billy pours himself another shot. \u201cSure. Never seen it.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cIt\u2019ll change your life.\u201d</p><p>A few hours before sunrise, Delores comes walking back into her apartment. I\u2019m half asleep on the well-used recliner while Billy\u2019s passed out cold on the couch.</p><p>The vodka bottle sits empty on the coffee table\u2014its purpose fulfilled.</p><p>Dee kicks off her shoes with a sigh. Then she sees me. And she\u2019s surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I not supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She covers her cousin with the throw blanket, brushing his hair back tenderly, like a mother with a feverish toddler. Then, she walks past me into her bedroom. I get up and follow her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Kate?\u201d</p><p>Delores takes off the outfit she\u2019s still wearing from the party\u2014letting the clothes fall off her to the floor. Leaving them there. Revealing tiny leopard print panties and a matching strapless bra.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2019s a mess. She\u2019s hurt . . . Billy said some messed-up stuff during their argument. Harsh shit. And she feels guilty. Billy worked his ass off to support Katie while she was in school. She hates herself, now that she won\u2019t be able to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>Dee keeps her back to me when she removes her bra, only turning around after she slips a red Phillies T-shirt over her head.</p><p>\u201cThank you for staying with him, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, but her shoulders are stiff. \u201cI\u2019m really tired.\u201d</p><p>I start to unbutton my shirt, to join Dee in bed. I\u2019m not looking to get laid\u2014although with the amount her cousin drank tonight, I don\u2019t think even a full-fledged f**k fest would wake him up. But I\u2019m not expecting what Dee says next. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can go now.\u201d</p><p>My fingers freeze on the buttons. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, thank you, I\u2019m tired\u2014you can go.\u201d And her eyes are flat, her face taught\u2014like a mannequin in a department store.</p><p>I step toward her, trying to make it past her attitude.</p> <p>\u201cDee, I know you\u2019re upset . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I just don\u2019t want you here, Matthew!\u201d she lashes out. \u201cMaybe I just want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>And, yes\u2014in case you\u2019re wondering\u2014this is my pissed-off face. Jaw clenched, lips tight, eyes alive with adrenaline.

You see Kate and your cousin and you don\u2019t want to feel what they\u2019re feeling . . .\u201d</p><p>She claps her hands slowly. Sarcastically.</p> <p>\u201cBrilliant deduction, Watson. Forget Chippendales\u2014if banking doesn\u2019t work out, it sounds like you want to be a therapist.\u201d</p><p>I push a hand through my hair, trying to rein in the frustration that makes me want to put my hand through her bedroom wall.</p><p>\u201cThis pushing me away shit is getting really f**king old, Delores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s the door.\u201d She points at it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go find yourself something brand spanking new.\u201d</p><p>My voice is low\u2014but fuming. \u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Then I turn around and walk out of the goddamn room.</p> <p>I make it all the way to the living room\u2014my hand on the apartment door\u2014before I stop. Because this is exactly what she\u2019s expecting. For me to give up. On her.</p><p>On us.</p><p>Dee would rather hit first and then throw in the towel than risk getting sucker punched later on.</p><p>I know this. As well as I know the last thing she really wants is for me to leave.</p><p>To leave her alone.</p><p>My hand drops from the door and I walk purposefully back into her bedroom. She sits ramrod straight on the edge of her bed, facing away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving. You want to yell? You can yell at me. Feel like hitting something? I can take a punch. Or, we don\u2019t have to talk at all. But . . . I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I sit on the bed and take off my shoes\u2014the rest of my clothes quickly follow. Dee slides under the covers, then switches off the lamp, but the room doesn\u2019t plunge into total darkness. There\u2019s just enough light from the window to make out her silhouette\u2014on her back, staring up at the ceiling. Boxers on, I climb under the covers next to her. And as soon as my head is on the pillow, she moves closer, turning on her side and resting her forehead against my bicep.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arm around her, pulling our bodies together\u2014her cheek now on my chest, her hand on my stomach, our legs entwined. Delores whispers, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do tomorrow? It\u2019s Thanksgiving. Kate, Billy, and I were going to spend the day together\u2014go out for steak.\u201d</p><p>My brow wrinkles. \u201cSteak?\u201d</p><p>I feel her shrug. \u201cEverybody eats turkey. I hate doing what everyone else does.\u201d</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t choose between them,\u201d she continues. \u201cThis is going to be hard enough\u2014I don\u2019t want either of them to feel lonely.\u201d Dee lifts her head and looks into my eyes. \u201cIf Steven and Alexandra broke up, who would you pick to spend the day with?\u201d</p><p>I stroke her back lightly and answer in the most unhelpful way possible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She lies back down on my chest. And I add, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to choose. You could blow them both off equally and come to Drew\u2019s parents\u2019 place with me for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t actually think she\u2019d go for it.</p><p>I suggest an alternative. \u201cYour cousin is going to be sleeping it off for many hours to come. And when he does wake up, I can guarantee he\u2019s not gonna want to eat steak. Leave Billy a note, meet up with Kate for brunch, spend the afternoon with her, then take him out for a late dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll both still be alone, for part of the day at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re adults, Dee. They\u2019ll deal. And who knows, maybe tomorrow they\u2019ll patch things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she says softly. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best if they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what your cousin said too.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my chest lightly\u2014one sweet peck. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . sad. The end of an era.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her. Dee tilts her head back to look at me. \u201cMatthew, these last few weeks with you and me . . . I . . .\u201d She pauses and licks her lips. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m really glad you stayed tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes, her breathing turns steady and deep. I think she\u2019s fallen asleep, until, in a small voice she says, \u201cJust . . . don\u2019t hurt me . . . okay.\u201d</p><p>I run my hand through her hair and hold her tight. \u201cNot ever, Delores. Promise.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re the last words we speak before we both fall asleep.</p><p>Early the next morning, Dee wakes up just long enough to kiss me good-bye. I walk past Billy\u2014dead to the world\u2014on the couch and go home for a long shower. Then I drive up to Drew\u2019s parents\u2019 country place for the day\u2019s festivities.</p><p>All the usual suspects are in attendance\u2014John and Anne, Steven and Alexandra, George, and my mother and father. I make my way through the handshakes and hugs to the back sunroom, which affords a panoramic view of the pristine backyard. And a view of Drew\u2014with Mackenzie\u2014riding opposite ends of the very same seesaw we played on, as kids, a lifetime ago.</p><p>Although they seem to be engaged in a serious conversation, I walk out the back door anyway, to join them. Drew lets Mackenzie know I\u2019m here and she jumps off the seesaw, runs, and throws herself into my arms like she hasn\u2019t seen me for months. But I eat it up and give her a long hug when her little arms wrap around my neck.</p><p>Then I set her down and we walk back to Drew. \u201cHey, man,\u201d he greets me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou go out early last night? You never came back to the party.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMy head wasn\u2019t in it. I hit the gym and went to bed.\u201d</p><p>Huh. That kind of behavior is weird for Drew, and I wonder if it has anything to do with his pissy attitude toward Kate and Billy at the party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou hung out with that Delores chick?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod. And test the waters. \u201cHer, Kate, and Billy.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThat guy licks ass.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie walks over to us and holds up the Bad Word Jar\u2014Alexandra\u2019s invention\u2014to keep us in check around her kid. It\u2019s simultaneously a bane of my existence and completely f**king hysterical.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>Drew says, \u201cIdiots annoy me.\u201d And he loses another dollar.</p><p>I think he does it on purpose\u2014actually curses more than he would if the jar didn\u2019t exist. Like a twisted sort of reverse psychology, just to buck the system and show his sister that he won\u2019t be controlled.</p><p>And maybe you\u2019re wondering why I haven\u2019t told him about Billy and Kate\u2019s breakup? The answer is simple: Guys don\u2019t f**king gossip. We don\u2019t talk about shit like that\u2014other people\u2019s relationship issues. We barely talk about our own relationship issues. It\u2019s just that simple.</p><p>Plus, Drew would be on Kate like white on rice, if he knew she got dumped. Because everyone knows dumped chicks are low-hanging fruit. Easy pickings. I think it would give him an unfair advantage in their little battle of the sexes. One he doesn\u2019t need.</p> <p>Lastly, people break up all the time . . . only to get back together the very next day. Despite what Dee said, Billy seemed pretty devastated over Kate. I have a feeling he\u2019s going to try for one more at bat before that particular game gets called.</p><p>There\u2019s no point in getting Drew\u2019s hopes up in the meantime.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you and Delores?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I smile. And keep it simple. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging out. She\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve nailed her?\u201d</p><p>I frown. Because even though I know he doesn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful, Dee\u2019s not just some random chick. Hearing him talk about her like she is feels disrespectful. So I set him straight. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>Now he\u2019s confused. \u201cThen what\u2019s it like, Matthew? You haven\u2019t hung out in over two weeks. I can understand you being too pu**y-whipped to come out if you\u2019re getting some. But if not, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>I wait for Mackenzie to approach us with the Bad Word Jar . . . but she doesn\u2019t. Guess she didn\u2019t hear that one.</p><p>Then I try to get Drew to understand, but since he\u2019s never been in love with anyone except himself, I really don\u2019t know if he can. \u201cShe\u2019s just . . . different. It\u2019s hard to explain. We talk, you know? And I\u2019m always kind of thinking about her. It\u2019s like the minute I drop her off, I can\u2019t wait to see her again. She just . . . amazes me. I wish you knew what I meant.\u201d</p><p>He warns me. \u201cYou\u2019re in dangerous territory, man. You see what Steven goes through. This path leads to the Dark Side. We always said we wouldn\u2019t go there. You sure about this?\u201d</p><p>I just keep smiling. And in my best Darth Vader voice I tell him, \u201cYou don\u2019t know the power of the Dark Side.\u201d</p><p>This Thanksgiving dinner is definitely one for the record books. Or the scrapbooks. If I\u2019d had my camera handy, I totally would have documented the entire hilarious, horrifying debacle. It was stupid of me to think the all-hearing Mackenzie didn\u2019t pick up on Drew calling me \u201cpussy-whipped.\u201d She heard, all right. The reason she didn\u2019t charge him was because she didn\u2019t know it was a \u201cbad word.\u201d</p><p>After she repeated it at the Thanksgiving Day dinner table? Then she knew. And all hell broke loose.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle again. Her asking Steven, \u201c \u2018Wha\u2019s pu**y-whipped, Daddy?\u2019 \u201d will forever live in my brain as the funniest f**king thing I\u2019ve ever heard. I was so shocked, I spit out the black olive in my mouth and almost blinded Steven when it hit him right in the eye. Drew\u2019s father practically choked to death on his turkey and my mother knocked over her glass of wine\u2014leaving a permanent reminder on Anne Evans\u2019s lace table cloth.</p> <p>Good times.</p><p>Alexandra was rightly and truly pissed. Of course, if her ire was directed at me, I probably wouldn\u2019t find it so awesomely amusing. But it\u2019s aimed squarely at Drew, so I laugh over Mackenzie\u2019s parody and its aftershocks the entire ride home.</p><p>I only wish Delores had been with me to see it. Speaking of Dee, before I get back to the city, I stop for gas and call her to see how her day went.</p><p>\u201cBetter than expected,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, can I stay at your place tonight? My cousin is channeling his feelings into his music. And while I love listening to him sing, if I have to hear one more f**king song about his heart breaking, I\u2019m going to make our food poisoning episode look like a hiccup.\u201d</p><p>And my life just got a whole lot more perfect. I know when things first started with Dee and I, she said she wasn\u2019t into relationships. And I know she\u2019s had her moments of insecurity\u2014but look at us now. She\u2019s coming to me, asking to stay at my place. That\u2019s a huge tell. It means she wants the same things I do. That we\u2019re on the same page. That she\u2019s invested\u2014interested in a future\u2014with me.</p><p>I chuckle against the cell phone. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll be at my apartment in thirty minutes. Come on over, baby.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s always darkest before the dawn. It\u2019s a common saying. What\u2019s less common, but equally true is, Pride comes before the fall.</p><p>Remember a while back I told you that women needed to stop playing the victim card? Stop reading into a guy\u2019s actions, thinking they mean something more than they do, and just accept what a man is telling them, straight up? I was so into Dee, so eager to take what we had and run with it all the way into the end zone, I ignored my own advice.</p><p>Ever heard of the myth of Icarus?</p><p>You probably weren\u2019t expecting a Greek mythology lesson, but indulge me anyway\u2014this is important. Icarus was the son of a master craftsman. His father made him a pair of wings out of feathers and wax and warned him, before he took off, to stay on the flight path. Not to fly too high. Icarus agreed.</p><p>But once he was airborne, he was so caught up in how amazing it felt\u2014the beauty and warmth of the sun\u2014he forgot all about the warning. He ignored the signs that were right in front of him because he was positive he knew where he was going, thought he had everything under control.</p><p>You can guess what happened next. Yep, Icarus got burned. His wings fell apart and he came crashing back to earth.</p><p>Unfortunately . . . I can relate to that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 16</p><p>The Bible says there\u2019s a time for all things under heaven. A time for peace and a time for war, a time to reap and a time to sow . . . a time to love . . . and a time to tell a girl you love her.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t actually say that. But it should. Because many poor bastards make the mistake of telling a woman at the wrong f**king time.</p><p>Like after sex. Wrong. That\u2019s just asking for trouble.</p> <p>Or during an argument. Really wrong. There\u2019s a reason the Doors\u2019 song \u201cLove Her Madly\u201d is still popular today. Because the lyric, \u201cDon\u2019t you love her as she\u2019s walking out the door\u201d is timeless. Men don\u2019t like to lose. Not a bet, their favorite T-shirt, or a girlfriend. In the attempt to keep from losing the latter, we could say something stupid\u2014things we really don\u2019t mean.</p><p>But for me, tonight is the perfect time to take my and Dee\u2019s relationship to the next level. I had a key to my apartment made for her, and when I put it in her hands, I\u2019m going to tell her I\u2019m falling in love with her.</p><p>You\u2019re not surprised, are you? Jesus, you had to have seen this coming.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot lately. It happened gradually, but that\u2019s the best way. In four weeks, Dee\u2019s gone from a girl I wanted to nail, to a girl I wanted to hang out with, to a girl I really liked . . . to someone I don\u2019t want to live without.</p><p>I think about her all the time, I crave her\u2014miss her\u2014when we\u2019re apart, no matter how long we were just together. She\u2019s funny and beautiful and interesting . . . and sure she\u2019s a pain in the ass too, but\u2014like I told you in the beginning\u2014I love her because of her quirks, not in spite of them.</p> <p>The last week and a half has been amazing. Billy\u2019s still crashing at her apartment, so except when she\u2019s there checking on him, she\u2019s been here with me. But I still want more. There were plenty of times that I could have dropped the bomb on her during the last few days, but I wanted it to be memorable. Special. Something she\u2019ll proudly tell Kate about, or someday\u2014our kids. Girls love that shit.</p><p>I haven\u2019t talked to her yet today. I was out of the office all day, visiting with one client after another. But she\u2019s coming over tonight and I have the whole thing planned. You want to hear about it?</p><p>We\u2019ll start with an excursion to the Jersey shore. My parents used to take me there all the time when I was a kid. It\u2019s December, but most of the rides and boardwalk games are open year-round. There\u2019s an indescribable magic to the place\u2014an aura of simpler days\u2014a nostalgic beauty. I\u2019ll hold Delores\u2019s hand, spend thirty bucks to win her a two-dollar stuffed animal on one of those games where you have to knock the weighted cans over with a baseball. We\u2019ll ride the bumper cars, maybe a roller coaster, and we\u2019ll share a delicious but incredibly bad for you funnel cake.</p><p>Then we\u2019ll kick off our shoes and walk down the beach, near enough to the water so we can watch the waves in the moonlight without getting wet. It\u2019ll be cold, so she\u2019ll lay back against me and I\u2019ll wrap my arms around her to keep her warm. And then, with the thunder of the crashing waves in the background, I\u2019ll tell her.</p><p>That she\u2019s changed my life. That I want to share the rest of it with her. That nothing looks or feels the way it did four weeks ago\u2014because of her\u2014it\u2019s unbelievably better. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll freak out, although it\u2019s possible. If she does, I\u2019ll tell her she doesn\u2019t have to say anything back. I\u2019m a pretty patient guy. I can wait.</p><p>Then we\u2019ll make out. And it\u2019ll be awesome. Sex on the beach isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Sand is not a friend to genitalia. But . . . if Dee is interested, I\u2019m sure as hell not going to turn her down.</p> <p>When I hear my unlocked apartment door open, I check my hair in the bathroom mirror. All good. Then I walk out to the living room. Smiling\u2014until I see Delores\u2019s face.</p><p>She\u2019s furious. The teeth-grinding, pacing, nostrils flaring kind of fury. And words shoot out of her mouth\u2014like a hail of bullets. That I walk right into.</p><p>\u201cYour friend is an ass**le! And I want you to tell me where I can find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew-I\u2019m-gonna-cut-his-pecker-off-and-feed-it-to-him-Evans.</p><p>I chuckle, even though I shouldn\u2019t. \u201cEasy there, Lorena Bobbitt. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>Calm down. What the hell am I thinking? Those two words are like pouring water on a grease fire\u2014just makes it hotter. It\u2019s the second most direct way to piss a woman off even more than she already is. The first, of course, is to ask if she\u2019s on the rag.</p><p>\u201cCalm down? You want me to calm down?\u201d Dee yells.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, you insensitive ass, is I just left Kate\u2019s apartment. She\u2019s wrecked\u2014completely devastated. Because your buddy, Drew, played her like a violin and then treated her like a whore that he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to pay afterward.\u201d</p><p>I knew Drew had a thing for Kate, but still, I can\u2019t keep the surprise out of my voice. \u201cDrew and Kate hooked up?\u201d</p><p>Dee crosses her arms. \u201cThey sure did. He\u2019s been all comforting and kind to her since the breakup with Billy. Made her believe he actually gave a shit. She spent the weekend at his apartment. And then this morning, after they got to work, he pretty much told her she sucked in bed\u2014wasn\u2019t worth another go around.\u201d</p><p>I press my fingers to my forehead, trying to digest the information Dee\u2019s telling me\u2014that just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Drew doesn\u2019t take women to his apartment, any woman. Drew doesn\u2019t screw the same chick twice . . . at least . . . not if he remembers he\u2019s already done her. And spending the weekend with a girl? No frigging way.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure Kate said Drew?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHe called her a f**king \u2018project,\u2019 Matthew! One that he was \u2018done with.\u2019 And I\u2019m gonna make a project out of his face. Kate is the best person I know. She puts on a tough front, but inside she\u2019s soft. Breakable. He doesn\u2019t get to treat her like this.\u201d</p><p>Underneath Dee\u2019s anger, there\u2019s pain. She\u2019s hurting, because her friend is hurting. I move forward to touch her, to comfort and calm her, but she steps back.</p><p>I put my hands up in surrender and try to reason with her. \u201cDrew\u2019s not that kind of ass**le, Dee. He has a lot of respect for women . . . in his own way. He likes to have a good time, no hard feelings. He doesn\u2019t get off on making girls feel bad about themselves. He wouldn\u2019t go out of his way to hurt someone, especially . . . Jesus, especially not Kate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell he did!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cKate must\u2019ve misunderstood him.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she just stares. Her gaze rakes over me, up and down, like she\u2019s seeing me for the first time. Then her expression changes from righteous fury to cold disbelief.</p><p>And her voice drops to a harsh whisper. \u201cAre you defending him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend. Of course I\u2019m defending him!\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifts sharply, almost like she\u2019s absorbing an uppercut. She hisses, \u201cWell then f**k you too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think there\u2019s nothing wrong with what he did then you\u2019re not the person I thought you were. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>And I shout, \u201cAre you f**king serious right now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! A serious idiot is what I am. To think that I let myself believe . . . I should\u2019ve never let things get this far. We\u2019re done Matthew. Don\u2019t come to my apartment; don\u2019t call me! You and your ass**le friend can just stay the hell away from us!\u201d</p><p>Her words hit me like a sledgehammer to the stomach. They\u2019re wrenching. Bruising. And f**king maddening. Dee\u2019s rant continues, but I\u2019m not listening anymore. All I think about is how stupid I\u2019ve been.</p><p>Blind.</p><p>Again.</p><p>It\u2019s almost funny, in a depressing, ironic kind of way. Dee told me\u2014more than once\u2014that she couldn\u2019t do this. That her relationships never ended on a happy note. But I didn\u2019t listen. I heard what I wanted to hear and believed I could change her mind. That if I was charming enough, smooth enough, she\u2019d see\u2014like I did\u2014how great we could be together.</p><p>What a f**king moron.</p> <p>It\u2019s really no different than Rosaline. The red flags may not have been there for the same reasons\u2014but they were there. And I missed them.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d I kick the coffee table but it doesn\u2019t break. So I kick it again\u2014until it does. The leg collapses and the glass top cracks against the floor, bringing Delores\u2019s rant to an immediate stop.</p><p>She takes two steps back, looking cautious\u2014almost afraid that she\u2019s pushed me too far. And I hate that I\u2019ve made her look like that. But I\u2019m too pissed, too disappointed in her to stop. So instead, I lash out.</p><p>\u201cYou say Kate puts on a tough front but she\u2019s soft inside? How about you look in a f**king mirror, Dee? You\u2019re terrified\u2014nothing but a scared little girl. You\u2019d rather be alone and tell yourself it\u2019s what you choose than take a chance on something that might be better. Something that could\u2019ve been amazing. I have bent over backwards for you! I\u2019ve spent weeks walking on f**king eggshells trying not to scare you away! And where\u2019s it gotten me? Nowhere! You think you\u2019re done? I\u2019m done! \u2019Cause it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Her arms cross over her waist, holding herself together. And she doesn\u2019t look angry anymore. She looks . . . sad.</p><p>I take a breath and push a hand through my hair. And I laugh at myself\u2014because I\u2019m an idiot. Pathetic. \u201cI had this whole thing planned. I was going to take you to the boardwalk and win you a bear. I was going to tell you that I think you\u2019re the most incredible, beautiful, fantastic woman I\u2019ve ever known. And I was going to tell you that I\u2019m completely in love with you. And now . . . now I can\u2019t say any of those things.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cBecause you\u2019re just waiting . . . . looking for a reason . . . because I can\u2019t love someone who\u2019s so f**king eager to run out the door.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is quiet now. Softer. \u201cI told you . . . I told you I wasn\u2019t good at this.\u201d</p><p>And mine is raw. \u201cYeah, well I guess I finally believe you.\u201d</p> <p>I look into Dee\u2019s honey-brown eyes. Eyes that always said so much, even if she didn\u2019t speak a word. And I turn my back on her. \u201cJust go, Dee. Just leave\u2014it\u2019s what you\u2019ve wanted to do from day one.\u201d</p><p>I hear her breathing. Waiting. And then I hear her footsteps. They stop near the doorway, and for a wonderful, awful moment I think she\u2019s changed her mind.</p><p>Until she whispers, \u201cGood-bye, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, and I don\u2019t turn around. Until I hear the door close behind her.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>I spend the thirty minutes after Dee walks out cursing and pacing and kicking shit around my apartment\u2014generally pissed off at the entire world.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m angry at myself for letting things get as far as they did\u2014for losing my patience and my temper\u2014and for even falling for Dee in the first place. My self-flagellation is hot and varied and doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense\u2014even to me.</p><p>I\u2019m furious with Delores\u2014for not trusting me, for not even f**king trying. For not thinking what we have is worth the risk. For thinking I\u2019m a goddamn risk at all, when I\u2019ve done everything possible to show her I\u2019m not.</p><p>And I\u2019m beyond irritated with Drew\u2014but I\u2019m not sure what the f**k for yet. Maybe he cut Kate down just like Dee claimed. And if he did, it was an ass**le move. One that\u2019s unjustly blown back on me. And I\u2019m kind of pissed that he even screwed Kate at all\u2014breaking his precious, stupid f**king rule that was there for a reason. This reason. Because\u2014like a goddamn suicide bomber\u2014his actions have had painful consequences for everyone around him.</p><p>But most of all, I\u2019m infuriated that Drew won\u2019t pick up his f**king phone so I can find out what the hell happened.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d</p><p>Guys aren\u2019t chatty. The telephone is not a necessity for us\u2014unless it\u2019s to find out where we\u2019re meeting up or what the latest baseball scores are. But this is one time I actually need to talk to him\u2014and he\u2019s MIA. I call Erin, Drew\u2019s secretary, who\u2019s still at the office. She informs me that he went home sick this afternoon\u2014that he probably has the flu.</p><p>Fucking perfect.</p><p>Screw it. I drop my phone, grab my keys, and head over to Drew\u2019s apartment\u2014to get the story straight from the ass\u2019s mouth.</p><p>But when I get to his place, he doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I bang on the door for the third\u2014or thirtieth\u2014time. \u201cDrew! Open the f**king door! What the hell happened today? Drew!\u201d</p><p>Nothing. I stop and listen for any sign of life inside the apartment, but all I hear is silence. Not even the rustle of footsteps or the squeak of couch springs. There\u2019s an excellent chance he\u2019s not even home. Which means, for now, I\u2019m shit out of luck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breathing hard, I leave the building. I get on my bike and ride\u2014fast and sharp. Probably not the best idea at the moment, but I do it anyway. I get through the tunnel, onto the turnpike, where traffic is thankfully scarce.</p><p>And I really open her up. The wind blows so cold and harsh, my face goes numb. But it\u2019s a good thing. Because feeling nothing is so much better than feeling the loss. Of what Dee and I had\u2014of everything we could\u2019ve had.</p><p>I ride for hours. Trying to let go. Trying to forget today . . . and the entire four weeks that came before it.</p><p>I park my bike in the garage and climb off\u2014stiff and frozen from the ride. I didn\u2019t think I was hoping that Delores would be here, waiting. That she\u2019d realize she made a terrible mistake and show up at my door to beg and apologize. Especially the begging part.</p> <p>But I realize it\u2019s exactly what I was hoping for . . . when I reach my apartment door and she\u2019s not there.</p><p>And the disappointment is crushing.</p><p>The letdown intensifies when I scroll through the missed calls on my phone and see that none of them are from Dee.</p><p>But I\u2019m not tempted to call her.</p><p>I\u2019m frustrated, and I miss her\u2014but I\u2019m not calling. I\u2019m not chasing her. Not this time. Not ever again, if it comes to that.</p> <p>Drew hasn\u2019t returned my calls either. I\u2019m looking forward to work tomorrow, where I\u2019ll see him, get the story . . . and most likely punch him in his stupid face. That\u2019ll make me feel better.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry\u2014I won\u2019t actually do any damage. Even though he doesn\u2019t box as often as I do, Drew\u2019s no wuss. He can take care of himself. And unlike Delores\u2019s and my relationship, our friendship will survive. A few punches, between friends, really isn\u2019t that big of a deal.</p><p>I have no appetite, so I skip dinner. I just take a shower and collapse\u2014naked and wet\u2014into my bed. But when my face burrows into the pillow, I smell her. The scent of her skin, her hair\u2014it\u2019s sweet and spicy, apples and cinnamon, distinct.</p><p>And it makes my chest ache.</p><p>Instead of getting up and sleeping on the couch, like I probably should, I pull the pillow closer and wrap the sheets tighter\u2014surrounding myself in Dee\u2019s memory\u2014until I fall asleep.</p><p>Kind of pathetic, right?</p> <p>Yeah, I f**king think so too.</p><p>Tuesday morning, I drag my ass into work\u2014grumpy, disheveled, and feeling shitty\u2014even though I slept like a rock. There, I hear all about the show Billy Warren put on for Kate in the lobby, and I wonder if they got back together. As far as grand gestures go, you don\u2019t get much grander than a public serenade and a lobby full of flowers. But if Kate is back with Billy, why would she give two shits about what Drew thinks or feels about her?</p><p>Throughout the rotten day, I check to see if Drew shows up. He doesn\u2019t. And I wonder if he really is sick. Or if whatever happened between him and Kate\u2014and the possibility that she went back to her ex right after\u2014busted him up more than he let on.</p><p>I spend my time wondering about that . . . so I don\u2019t have time to think about Dee. But, of course, my mind finds a way to squeeze thoughts of her in.</p><p>Plentiful, pain-bringing thoughts.</p><p>About where she is\u2014what she\u2019s feeling. If there\u2019s any way she\u2019s doing as badly as I am.</p><p>Erin gathers Steven, Jack O\u2019Shay, and me together and asks us to cover for Drew while he\u2019s out. Like the man himself, his clients are f**king spoiled, and they tend to freak out if he isn\u2019t close by to hold their hands. I take a couple of his files because, even though I think he\u2019s a shithead at the moment, I\u2019m not gonna let his career tank over it.</p><p>The extra work makes the day go faster, and before I know it, it\u2019s quitting time. I go to the gym\u2014even though I\u2019m feeling craptastic\u2014and undergo a brutal workout and sparring session.</p> <p>Because this is what most guys do when they\u2019re hurting. Punish themselves or\u2014like the barking boss in desperate need to get laid\u2014everyone around them.</p><p>After the gym, I stop by Drew\u2019s apartment again, significantly calmer than last night. He still doesn\u2019t answer the door, but this time, I hear the television on inside. Sounds like he\u2019s watching Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.</p><p>I pound on the door. \u201cOpen up, jerk-off.\u201d</p><p>The only response I hear is the growl of Sex Panther\u2014a punch line from the movie. I knock again. \u201cCome on, douche bag. You\u2019re not the only one with problems, you know.\u201d</p><p>When he still doesn\u2019t answer, I genuinely start to worry. \u201cDrew, you seriously need to give me a sign here. If not, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re actually dying and call nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>A minute goes by. Then another. And just as I\u2019m about to pull out my phone, something bangs against the inside of the door. Like it was purposely thrown against it. A baseball maybe.</p><p>Bam.</p><p>\u201cDrew? Was that you?\u201d</p><p>Bam.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to bust the door down?\u201d</p><p>Bam . . . Bam.</p><p>I think for a moment. Then, to make sure I\u2019m right, I ask, \u201cSo it\u2019s once for yes, twice for no?\u201d</p><p>Bam.</p><p>Guess it\u2019ll frigging have to do for now. I sit on the floor and lean my back up against Drew\u2019s door. And I start to talk, ask yes and no questions\u2014feeling kind of like an idiot. Like some teenager in a horror movie, communicating with the other side through a Ouiji Board, who\u2019s too much of a moron to remember those interactions never end well.</p><p>\u201cErin said you texted her. Do you really have the flu?\u201d</p><p>Bam.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Kate hook up last weekend?\u201d</p><p>Bam.</p><p>\u201cWas it as good as you imagined?\u201d</p><p>Bam . . . Bam.</p><p>You might be confused by his answer. I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cWas it even better?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a meaningful pause. And then . . . Bam.</p><p>\u201cWere you a dick to her afterwards?\u201d</p><p>Bam . . . Bam.</p><p>No. So Dee did have it wrong. But then, Drew elaborates. Sort of.</p><p>Bam.</p><p>No and yes. Drew was a dick to Kate . . . but he seems to think he had a reason to be. I move on.</p><p>\u201cDelores broke up with me. Because of the way you treated Kate. And I was really into her, man. I . . . I fell in love with her.\u201d My voice gets stronger. Irritated. \u201cDo you even care? Are you f**king sorry at all?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another meaningful pause. Then . . . Bam.</p><p>Although his remorse is nice to hear, it doesn\u2019t help me at all. And, the bottom line is, it wasn\u2019t really Drew that ended Dee and I. That was all on us. Her refusal to trust me . . . my refusal to keep trying to earn it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whatever Drew said to Kate, he\u2019s obviously suffering because of it. So, I let him off the hook. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s not all on you. We had . . . issues. Problems I thought I could get us through . . . but . . . she didn\u2019t want it as much as I did. You know how that goes.\u201d</p><p>Bam.</p><p>\u201cYou plan on staying in there forever?\u201d</p><p>Bam . . . Bam.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need anything?

Then he answers.</p><p>Bam.</p> <p>I go back to my apartment and do nothing but watch TV the rest of the night. My face has one expression the whole time\u2014grim. As I flick through the stations, one of those long-as-hell commercials comes on, advertising the ultimate soft rock eighties collection. And \u201cOne More Night\u201d by Phil Collins plays loud and clear. It\u2019s the part of the song where he\u2019s wondering about calling the girl.</p><p>And it\u2019s like a freaky science fiction movie\u2014like the television is reading my f**king mind. I stare at my cell phone. Contemplating.</p><p>Trying to Jedi Mind Trick it.</p><p>Ring, you bastard. Ring.</p><p>I pick it up, brushing my fingers over the numbers. And I punch in nine of Dee\u2019s ten digits . . .</p><p>Until the next lyric out of the TV reminds me that maybe she\u2019s not alone.</p> <p>I toss my phone away, like a scorching Hot Pocket fresh from the microwave. Then I plant my face in the couch cushion and yell into it.</p><p>\u201cFuck me!\u201d</p><p>The music on the infomercial changes. And now it\u2019s \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d\u2014a song about a guy who has so much to say to a girl, but she just won\u2019t turn around and let him.</p><p>You know, somebody must\u2019ve really screwed Phil Collins over. Big-time.</p><p>I sing a few of the lyrics \u2019cause it\u2019s just you and me here. And for an eighties song, it\u2019s pretty good.</p><p>And\u2014oh look\u2014\u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d just came on. Completing the trifecta of spirit-crushing, why-don\u2019t-you-just-kill-yourself eighties tunes.</p><p>Yay.</p><p>Excuse me while I go slit my wrists in the bathroom.</p> <p>Chapter 18</p><p>Wednesday morning brings a staff meeting in the conference room. I sit comatose through it\u2014only half listening. After it\u2019s over, everyone files out, except for Kate, who\u2019s still at the table, sorting and organizing a stack of papers and folders in front of her.</p><p>She\u2019s Delores\u2019s best friend\u2014and yes, that means there\u2019s a code. As impenetrable as the blue wall of silence. But, at this point, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She smiles softly. \u201cHi, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t beat around the bush. \u201cDoes she . . . does she ever talk about me?\u201d</p><p>Kate looks down at the conference table. \u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>Yeah\u2014motherfucking ouch.</p><p>But I don\u2019t surrender all hope just yet. \u201cDoes she think about me?\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes meet mine and they\u2019re sympathetic\u2014a little sad. I\u2019m not sure if the sadness is for me or for Delores. She whispers, \u201cEvery day. All the time. She hasn\u2019t gone out she just . . . mopes, and watches movies. She won\u2019t admit it, but I know it\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p><p>Well . . . that\u2019s something at least. Misery loves company\u2014and Delores\u2019s gives me a sick jolt of comfort. Reassurance. That at least I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>\u201cMatthew, why don\u2019t you just call her? People in relationships have arguments sometimes; it doesn\u2019t mean it has to be over.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already shaking my head. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. Delores likes to be chased\u2014I get it. But, at some point, she needs to stop running and let me catch her. I\u2019ve put myself out there for her\u2014to show her how important she is to me. That I\u2019m in this for the long haul\u2014if she wants it. But now it\u2019s her turn. She has to show me she wants it too.\u201d</p><p>Pride isn\u2019t always a sin. Sometimes it\u2019s a savior that keeps you from making an ass**le of yourself. Of not just looking like a fool\u2014but being one too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with someone who . . . wanted something else. Someone else. I\u2019m not going there again.\u201d</p><p>Kate nods her head, with a small smile. \u201cOkay. For what it\u2019s worth, I hope Dee wises up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I take a few steps toward the door. But then I stop. Because even though I haven\u2019t actually seen Drew, every instinct I have tells me he\u2019s hurting. Licking his wounds.</p><p>The fatal kind.</p><p>And my hunch is, Kate\u2019s nursing the same kind of injury\u2014she\u2019s just better at hiding it.</p><p>\u201cListen, Kate . . . about what happened between you and Drew . . .\u201d</p><p>All signs of friendliness drop from her face. Her eyes go hard, her lips pinch, and she cuts me off in a sharp voice. \u201cDon\u2019t, Matthew. Just . . . don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I guess Drew\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s hell-bent on keeping radio silence.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I squeeze her shoulder. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p><p>She smiles tightly and I head to my office.</p><p>Later that evening I swing by Steven and Alexandra\u2019s to keep an eye on Mackenzie while they go out to the movies. Lexi opens the door for me, looks at my expression for longer than necessary, then glances behind me. Seeing only the empty space there, her face softens with pity.</p><p>She pulls me into a tight hug and says, \u201cYou know, Matthew, there is such a thing as too different.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cYeah, I know, Lex.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no time for a pity party because a blond blur comes tearing down the hall, wearing a blue princess nightgown, with a floppy teddy bear grasped in one hand. She crashes into my legs and wraps her arms around my knees. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>I reach under her arms and pick Mackenzie up. \u201cHey, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna play tea party, Uncle Matthew? You can be Buzz Lightyear and I\u2019ll be Miz Nezbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the most fun I\u2019ll have all week.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rewarded with a gorgeous baby-teethed smile. And for the first time in days, the weight sitting on my heart feels a little lighter.</p><p>Steven helps Alexandra into her coat, and they each kiss Mackenzie good-bye.</p><p>\u201cBedtime at eight,\u201d Alexandra informs me. \u201cDon\u2019t let her try and negotiate more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I can hold up against the big, blue, puppy-dog eyes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grins. \u201cBe strong.\u201d</p><p>They leave and I lock the door behind them. For the next hour and a half, I play tea party with Mackenzie. And Barbie dolls. Then we build a block wall and take it out with her remote-control Humvee. Just before bed, we shoot some hoops with the Fisher-Price adjustable basketball net I bought her for her birthday.</p><p>Once she\u2019s all tucked in, she asks me to read her a story and pulls a thin Disney book out from under her pillow.</p><p>Cinderella.</p> <p>Mackenzie hugs her bear and regards me with long-blinking, sleepy eyes. When we get to the part about Prince Charming\u2019s proclamation, she asks, \u201cUncle Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Cinderella go to the prince with her glass slipper? Why didn\u2019t she say \u2018It\u2019s me\u2019? How come she waited for him?\u201d</p><p>I think about her question and can\u2019t help but make the comparisons to Delores and me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . . maybe Cinderella wasn\u2019t sure how the prince felt about her. Maybe she needed him to be the one to come to her\u2014so she would know he loved her.\u201d</p> <p>This is just f**king sad. Talking about my love life with a four-year-old?</p><p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen.</p><p>Mackenzie nods her understanding and I read on. Until . . .</p><p>\u201cUncle Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come da prince didn\u2019t know it was Cinderella? If he loved her, he woulda bemembered what she looked like, right?\u201d</p> <p>I think of Dee\u2019s teasing smile, her perfect lips, the warm tenderness in her eyes when she wakes up beside me, how it feels to caress her cheek with my fingertips\u2014like touching a rose petal.</p><p>My voice is thick when I answer. \u201cYes, Mackenzie. If he loved her, he wouldn\u2019t have forgotten what she looked like. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>She yawns, long and wide. Then she turns on her side and nestles into the down pillow.</p><p>With a drowsy sigh in her voice, Mackenzie says, \u201cI think Uncle Drew is right. Prince Charming really is a douche bag.\u201d</p><p>And those are the last words she says before sailing off into dreamland.</p><p>Thursday at work, my father stops by my office and informs me my mother is expecting me for dinner that evening. Disappointing my mother is a capital offense, and the last thing I need at the moment is to have my name at the top of the old man\u2019s shit list.</p><p>I arrive at five thirty on the button. My parents\u2019 place is a four-bedroom multi-floor brownstone, originally built in the 1920s, with original molding, three ornate fireplaces, a sitting room, den, a music room, a butler\u2019s pantry, and a spacious formal dining room.</p><p>Do they really need this much space? No. But they wouldn\u2019t dream of moving. Especially once I was out of the house and, as my mother used to say, they could finally have \u201cnice things\u201d again.</p> <p>I figure it\u2019ll only be a few more years before we\u2019ll need to install one of those cool automatic chairs to get them up the staircase.</p><p>After the housekeeper, Sarah, who\u2019s worked for my parents for years, answers the door, I find my mom in the sitting room, enjoying a glass of sherry by the lit fireplace.</p><p>When she sees me, she smiles, stands up, and hugs me close. \u201cHello, darling. I\u2019m so glad you could come tonight.\u201d She peers up at my face. \u201cYou look tired. You must be working too hard.\u201d</p><p>I give her a smile. \u201cNo, Mom, I\u2019m really not.\u201d</p><p>We sit and she tells me about the mums she\u2019s growing and the latest goings-on at the country club. When my father exits his study, that\u2019s the cue that dinner is served.</p><p>The dining room table\u2019s not overly large\u2014six chairs\u2014but my father eats at one end, looking over the newspaper that he\u2019s just getting around to reading, my mother dines at the other end, and I\u2019m in between.</p><p>As she slices into her chicken cordon bleu, my mother asks, \u201cAre you still seeing that young lady from the office party? I liked her very much, Matthew. So spirited. Right, Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl Matthew brought to the office party\u2014we liked her, didn\u2019t we? What is her name again? Deanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelores,\u201d my dad grunts\u2014proving he actually is aware of what\u2019s going on around him.</p><p>Sometimes I think he just acts clueless\u2014and deaf\u2014so he won\u2019t have to participate in conversations that don\u2019t interest him. It\u2019s a handy trick.</p><p>I force the food down my suddenly tight throat. \u201cNo, Mom, Dee and I . . . we didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue clicks in disappointment. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d She sips her wine. \u201cI just want to see you settled, dear. None of us is getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>My mother is awesome\u2014kind and gentle\u2014but she\u2019s still a mother. Which means any second now, she\u2019s going to start talking about how I need someone to take care of me and about seeing her grandchildren before she dies.</p><p>It\u2019s a discussion we\u2019ve had before.</p><p>She leans my way, and in a conspiratorial tone whispers, \u201cWas it . . . a sexual problem?\u201d</p><p>My bite of chicken gets stuck in my esophagus. I pound my chest and dislodge it\u2014but my voice is scratchy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She straightens back up in her chair. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, Matthew. I used to wipe your bottom\u2014there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t have an adult discussion about your sex life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to wipe your bottom\u201d and \u201csex life\u201d should never, ever, be used in the same sentence. Unless your name\u2019s Woody Fucking Allen.</p><p>I clear my throat again. Still burns. \u201cNo, Mom. We were fine in that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Some ladies don\u2019t always feel comfortable expressing their needs . . .\u201d</p><p>No way this is happening.</p><p>\u201c. . . communicate their desires. My book club is discussing a novel this month on this very subject. Fifty Shades of Grey. Would you like to borrow my copy, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>I take a long drink of water. \u201cNo, I\u2019m already familiar with it, thanks.\u201d</p><p>The fact that my dear, sweet mother is familiar with it, however, will definitely be giving me nightmares.</p><p>She pats my hand. \u201cAll right. You let me know if you change your mind. That Mr. Grey is certainly creative with a necktie.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, the rest of the dinner conversation revolves around less nauseating topics.</p><p>After the plates are cleared, I stand up and kiss my mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cGood night, Mom. And . . . thanks . . . for your advice.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cGood night, darling.\u201d</p><p>My father wipes his mouth then throws his napkin on the plate. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out. Going to have a cigarette.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My father has smoked my whole life\u2014but he doesn\u2019t know I do. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m thirteen or thirty\u2014if he ever finds out, he\u2019ll break my frigging fingers.</p><p>We walk downstairs and stand in the open doorway where he lights up. The smell of my father\u2019s cologne and the freshly lit cigarette smell familiar. And weirdly . . . comforting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he barks in his rough, old-man voice. \u201cThe last few days, you\u2019ve been walking around looking like you did the day we had to put King down.\u201d</p><p>See? He may not comment a lot, but it\u2019s only because he\u2019s too busy listening and watching\u2014and pretending like he\u2019s not.</p> <p>I kick a pebble off the front step. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad.\u201d</p><p>I feel his eyes on me. Scrutinizing. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d He snubs out his cigarette in the sand can. \u201cBut you will be.\u201d</p><p>And then he hugs me.</p><p>Strong\u2014like a bear. The same way he\u2019d hug me when I was a kid, just before he left for a business trip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Matthew. You always were. And if she can\u2019t see that? Then she doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p> <p>I hug him back, because . . . I just really f**king need to. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>We break apart. I swipe at my nose and he smacks my back.</p><p>\u201cSee you at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, son.\u201d He closes the door behind me.</p><p>I don\u2019t go home right away. I walk a dozen blocks trying not to think\u2014or see\u2014Dee\u2019s face in my mind with every step. I walk one street down, to Drew\u2019s building.</p><p>The doorman greets me, and when I get to the penthouse, I sit down in the hallway, leaning my back against Drew\u2019s door.</p> <p>I\u2019m not entirely sure he\u2019s listening, but it feels like he is.</p><p>And I laugh. \u201cDude, I hope you\u2019re sitting the f**k down\u2014\u2019cause you\u2019re not gonna believe the conversation I just had with my mother . . .\u201d</p><p>Friday is a rough one. I just . . . miss her. It\u2019s acute and relentless. The memories, the image of her face, are in my head every second, taunting me. I can\u2019t concentrate; I don\u2019t want to eat. My body feels weighted and heavy; my chest is tight, achy, like the tail end of bronchitis. I miss everything about her. Her laughter, her ridiculous theories, and yes\u2014not gonna lie\u2014I miss her exquisite tits. I\u2019ve gotten used to sleeping next to Dee\u2014or on top of her\u2014skin to skin, with my arms either draped around her or my head nestled on the soft comfort of her br**sts.</p><p>My goddamn down pillow just doesn\u2019t compare.</p><p>What I really need is to get laid. You may not like hearing that, but too f**king bad\u2014it\u2019s the truth.</p><p>When your car irreparably dies, do you sit inside it, remembering all the times it drove you to work or to a friend\u2019s or on some great road trip? Of course you don\u2019t. That\u2019s stupid. The logical thing to do\u2014the only thing to do\u2014is go shopping for a new car. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll ever be able to move forward.</p><p>For a man or a woman\u2014getting laid after a breakup is a lot like that. It feels good\u2014even if just for a few moments\u2014and it reminds you that life doesn\u2019t stop. That the world isn\u2019t ending just because your relationship did. Getting some instills confidence in a brighter tomorrow. In a future not immersed in misery.</p><p>But while the idea occurs to me, and I know it\u2019s something I should do . . . I don\u2019t want to. I have no desire to f**k anyone who\u2019s not Delores Warren. And to tell you the truth\u2014there\u2019s a small, admittedly pu**y-whipped part of me that\u2019s afraid to. Scared about even trying.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same part of me that sags with disappointment every time I come home and she\u2019s not here. The part that still thinks there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll realize how great we are together, that she\u2019s completely in love with me, that she\u2019ll come running back to me. And if any or all that were to happen, I would never want to have to break the news that during our downtime, I screwed another woman. Right or wrong, the trust I\u2019ve worked so hard to build with Delores would be destroyed. So, in the end, it\u2019s just not a risk I\u2019m willing to take\u2014not for some random piece of ass I don\u2019t even want.</p><p>Saturday isn\u2019t any better. Jack pleads with me to go out with him\u2014complains that he feels abandoned, that he\u2019s missing his wingman.</p><p>But I\u2019m just not up for it.</p><p>Instead, I grab a six-pack and a pizza and have a pity picnic outside Drew\u2019s apartment door. I do most of the talking: He only \u201cbams\u201d his answer when I ask if he\u2019s still alive. It sounds like he\u2019s moved on to watching Blades of Glory. What\u2019s up with the Will Ferrell fixation, right? Weird.</p><p>Anyway, after I\u2019m done with the pizza and making my way to the bottom of the last beer, I lean my head back against his door\u2014a little buzzed. And I get downright philosophical. I talk about the weekend, when we were kids, and my uncle took Drew, Steven, and me camping at his cabin in the Adirondacks.</p><p>Steven\u2019s highly allergic to poison oak\u2014he blew up like a tick.</p><p>But not even that stopped him from joining us in our search for buried treasure. My uncle had given us a map he and my old man had made when they were kids\u2014to a box of silver dollars they thought would be a brilliant idea to bury.</p><p>For the entire first three days up there, all we did was hunt for it. But then . . . as kids tend to do . . . we gave up. We turned our attention to climbing trees, and beating the crap out of each other with sticks, and watching the girls from the local college go skinny-dipping in the lake.</p><p>I think about those days and, of course, Delores\u2014always her. And I wonder sadly, \u201cDo you think if we had just held on a little longer, looked a little harder, tried just a little bit more\u2014do you think we could\u2019ve made it to the treasure, Drew?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. And I\u2019m a lot further past buzzed than I thought. So before I knock out here in his hallway, I pack up my stuff and take a cab back to my own bed.</p><p>And like every night before, I dream of Dee.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>When a guy\u2019s nursing a broken heart, he engages in one of three behaviors: he drinks, he f**ks, he fights. Sometimes all three in one night.</p><p>It\u2019s been six days since I\u2019ve seen Delores and I haven\u2019t f**ked anyone. Drinking has been minimal\u2014but I\u2019m definitely ready to fight. I\u2019ve been going to the gym every day, working out harder than usual, trying to channel the feelings of missing her into something positive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On Sunday afternoon, when I walk through the gym door, Shawnasee\u2019s is the first face I see. You remember him, right? The prick I mentioned awhile back, who\u2019s in dire need of a good beat down?</p><p>Looks like today\u2019s his lucky day.</p><p>He grins menacingly. \u201cYou wanna go a few rounds, or you gonna pu**y out again?\u201d</p><p>Something inside me tears\u2014like the Hulk when he shreds his T-shirt\u2014and I answer, \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t wait to get in the ring. To hit something\u2014to vent the frustration and guilt and generally bad feelings that have been churning inside me for the last six days. I bounce on my toes, roll my head left to right\u2014cracking my neck. Then I duck under the ropes, tap my gloves together, and walk to the center of the ring.</p><p>Shawnasee\u2019s already waiting for me, looking both confident and eager. Ronny stands between us and recites the typical directions about clean fights and good sportsmanship. We hit gloves, go back to our corners, and wait.</p><p>Then the bell rings.</p><p>I come at him, hard and fast, but my head\u2019s not in it. If you want the truth, I\u2019ve got no f**king business fighting right now. Because my focus isn\u2019t on my opponent at all. It\u2019s on the unfairness of life. The bitterness of wanting something\u2014someone\u2014that doesn\u2019t want me the same way. At the moment, I\u2019m all about pain and heartbreak\u2014feelings I\u2019m hoping punches will purge.</p><p>Shawnasee and I dance and dodge in a circle around each other . . . and then movement from the front door distracts me. And I forget all about footwork, defensive postures, jabs, right hooks, and body blows.</p> <p>Because standing there in the doorway is Delores Warren.</p><p>In a nanosecond, my mind takes her in from head to toe\u2014her hair\u2019s pulled back in a ponytail, revealing a makeup-free, beautiful face. Her plain white T-shirt is tied at the hip over tight blue jeans and black Converse sneakers. I don\u2019t have time to greet her or even wonder why she\u2019s here.</p><p>Because the instant after I see her, Shawnasee\u2019s fist makes contact with my chin\u2014like an uppercut from Thor\u2019s hammer.</p><p>My teeth crunch together and my head jerks back. My eyes close automatically as I fall straight back and crash to the floor.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m out, but it must only be a few moments. The next time I open my eyes, Ronny\u2019s stubbled face is inches from mine. My vision is blurry\u2014colors and lights stretching and bleeding into one another. Sound roars in my ears, like static from an out-of-commission television set.</p><p>Through the din, Ronny\u2019s voice breaks through. \u201cFisher! Can ya hear me, Fisher?\u201d</p> <p>I blink and answer, but my speech sounds muffled, like I\u2019m talking underwater. \u201cYeah, I . . . I hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan ya see me all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Ronny. I see a whole bunch of you.\u201d</p><p>Ronny turns and talks to someone next to him. I only make out a few words: \u201c. . . concussion . . . hospital.\u201d Then he leans back over me. \u201cI need you to get up, Fisher.\u201d</p><p>My legs don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather just stay here, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stand, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Nope. My legs still say \u201cGo screw yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>Then I see her. She kneels down next to Ronny\u2014next to me. Her warm hand touches my bicep where my T-shirt ends. And she whispers, \u201cGet up, ya son of a bitch . . . \u2019cause Mickey loves ya.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, I\u2019m choked up. Not because of the stirring movie quote\u2014but because of what those words could mean.</p><p>For us.</p><p>\u201cYou watched Rocky Five?\u201d</p><p>Delores nods. \u201cI watched them all. Mickey dying was the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>Then her face crumples, and she\u2019s crying.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t try to hide it. Her hand doesn\u2019t cover her face or stifle her sobs. Because she doesn\u2019t pretend to be someone she\u2019s not. Take her or leave her, what you see is what you get.</p><p>That\u2019s what I love about her. One of the many things I love.</p><p>My arm is heavy, but I raise it. One still-gloved hand brushes at her tear-trailed cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I was awful to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . I was an ass**le. I promised you I\u2019d be patient, and then I . . . wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right. You were right about everything.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m reminded of our audience when Ronny cajoles, \u201cAll right, boys, let\u2019s hit the lockers for a few. Give these two lovebirds some time to cry all over each other.\u201d As the other guys follow out, Ronny shakes his head at Dee and me. \u201cThis is exactly why I don\u2019t want women in my gym.\u201d</p><p>Once we\u2019re alone, I force myself to sit up. This is not a conversation I want to have on my back. Well . . . unless I was naked and on my back.</p><p>Dee helps me take the gloves off my hands, and then I rest my upper body against the corner of the ring.</p><p>She asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It feels like a semi ran over my face, but otherwise I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>With vengeful eyes, she glances toward the locker room door where Shawnasee entered. \u201cI\u2019m going to slash that guy\u2019s tires before we leave. Will that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cNever change, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She sobers and looks down at her hands. Then she confesses, \u201cThe thought of having feelings for you\u2014real \u2018forever\u2019 kinds of feelings\u2014scares the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>Her declaration doesn\u2019t bother me. She\u2019s not telling me anything I didn\u2019t already know. But the fact that she\u2019s here . . . that means everything.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get used to being with you, because I knew once I did, when you left . . . I\u2019d be miserable. But it\u2019s too late. I was miserable anyway. These last few days . . . I\u2019ve never felt so sad. And lonely. Empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been the same for me.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at that, though there are still tears in her eyes. And in her voice. \u201cBut when I\u2019m with you . . . when you\u2019re here next to me . . . it feels perfect. You make me happier than I ever thought I could be, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s an easy fix. I\u2019ll just have to stay with you . . . all the time. It won\u2019t be too difficult. Because . . . I\u2019m kind of . . . totally in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing man, Matthew. You\u2019re funny and warm, you\u2019re thoughtful and sexy as all hell. You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d Her eyes are soft and tender as she looks into mine. She touches my face gently. \u201cI love you, Matthew.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even though it feels like my jaw is going to splinter off at any moment, I smile. It\u2019s impossible not to.</p><p>My hand slides to the back of Delores\u2019s neck and I bring her forward. My mouth brushes hers\u2014lightly at first\u2014then deeper, with more meaning. I pull her across me, full into my arms. Our tongues touch and taste, slow and unrushed, with the promise of more to come.</p><p>Dee sighs and rests her forehead against mine. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine telling you I loved you, like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither. But . . . it\u2019s something we\u2019ll remember, right? It works for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sure f**king does.\u201d Then Dee hops to her feet and holds out her hand to me. \u201cWhy are we still here?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m able to get up without her help. But once I\u2019m standing, I remember what brought us to this moment in the first place. \u201cDee, about Drew and Kate . . .\u201d</p><p>She puts her finger over my lips. \u201cNo. We\u2019re not talking about them. Ever. You\u2019re not your bastard best friend\u2014I know that. I don\u2019t want him coming between us.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. This isn\u2019t about Drew or Kate or Rosaline or any of the douche bags from her past. They shouldn\u2019t affect us\u2014can\u2019t touch us.</p><p>This is about me and Dee.</p> <p>As we make our way out of the ring, I ask, \u201cDid you take a cab here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014why?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cI drove the Ducati.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s pleased. \u201cI\u2019ve missed feeling the power between my legs.\u201d</p><p>I throw my arm around her shoulders. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll feel the power\u2014after I get you back to my place.\u201d</p><p>Delores loops her arm around my waist and shakes her head. \u201cSo cheesy.\u201d Then her voice becomes firmer, more insistent. \u201cBut we\u2019re both going to have to wait to feel the power, because before we go home, we\u2019re taking a cab to the emergency room to get you checked out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d I whine like a six year old who doesn\u2019t want to go to the dentist.</p><p>Dee shakes her head. \u201cDon\u2019t want to hear it\u2014you\u2019re going. Concussions are nothing to fool around with. I just got you back, I\u2019m not taking any chances on losing you now.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to argue\u2014because I really am fine\u2014and I\u2019ll be f**king fantastic as soon as I get Dee back in my bed. Or, on my kitchen counter, the dining room table, the living room wall\u2014you get the point.</p><p>But before I can disagree, she adds, \u201cBesides, for what I have planned for you? We\u2019re going to need medical clearance.\u201d</p><p>Well, when she puts it that way . . .</p><p>Our trip to the hospital was relatively short\u2014a little over three hours. After a bunch of questions and a few tests, the doctor diagnosed me with a minor concussion.</p><p>Frigging Shawnasee.</p><p>Payback is a bitch\u2014and you can bet your ass I\u2019ll be driving that point home the next time I\u2019m at the gym.</p> <p>The doctor told me to watch out for nausea, blurry vision, blah, blah, blah. At the same time Dee and I asked if sex was okay.</p><p>He said it was.</p><p>Which is why the moment my apartment door closes, Dee and I are kissing, tearing at clothes, mauling each other\u2014with six days of desire and want driving us on. My clothes are easier to get off than Dee\u2019s, so by the time we step over the threshold of my bedroom, I\u2019m completely naked.</p><p>Hard, hot, and thick, I need to be inside her more than I need to take my next f**king breath.</p><p>Dee\u2019s shirt? Gone.</p><p>Her bra? On the pool table in my dining room.</p><p>I touch her, hold her against me\u2014drowning in the sensation of our bare chests pressing and the velvet texture of her perfect skin. My fingers work on the button of her jeans. But Dee stops me. Her hands cover mine and she backs up a step. Her chest rises and falls rapidly as she tries to catch her breath. \u201cMatthew . . . there\u2019s something I have to tell you. I . . . did something. Last night.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Me. Hard.</p><p>Last night was Saturday. My first thought is, \u201cDee screwed another guy last night,\u201d and I almost double over from the sheer agony of it. And the rage.</p><p>I know, technically, we weren\u2019t together. We were broken up. I can\u2019t get mad.</p><p>Fuck that\u2014I\u2019m going to lose it.</p><p>I\u2019ll forgive her. I\u2019ll get over it . . . after I smash something into a thousand pieces and pound on the walls like a gorilla on crack cocaine.</p><p>I sit down on the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do? Whatever it is I\u2019ll . . . f**k, just tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>And then she does the strangest thing. She smiles. And unbuttons her own pants, sliding them down her legs as she talks. \u201cI thought all week about what you said. How I was scared, how I didn\u2019t want to take a chance . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was angry when I said that, Delores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were also right. So I wanted to do something, to show you, to prove that I do trust you. That I want this, and you\u2014permanently.\u201d</p><p>She slips her panties off, and I\u2019m momentarily hypnotized by the sight of her stunningly smooth pu**y. Until I notice the white bandage covering a small patch of skin below her pelvic bone.</p><p>She peels it off, revealing the bright blue tattoo emblazoned on her skin underneath. A tattoo of my name.</p><p>MATTHEW</p><p>I\u2019m speechless\u2014can only stare. Then I drop to my knees in front of her and kiss the soft, still-tender flesh beside my name.</p><p>\u201cI f**king love it. I love you.\u201d I dust my fingers over it, very gently. \u201cNow you\u2019re really stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>Delores tilts my face up and runs her hands through my hair. \u201cYeah, I really am.\u201d</p><p>I stand, swing her around, and toss her on the bed. Then I jump in after her.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Later, when the sun has gone down and the sheets on my bed are fantastically rumpled, after fevered \u201cI love you\u201ds and \u201cI missed you\u201ds and \u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me\u201ds are whispered between desperate touches and gratified moans, I force myself to get up.</p><p>It\u2019s not easy. Dee lays naked in my bed, her lips swollen and well used, her hair alluringly tousled. I stand for a moment\u2014pants in hand\u2014just looking at her.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>This time, she smiles. And I know it\u2019s because she believes me.</p><p>She reaches out her hand. \u201cThen don\u2019t go. Come back to bed, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>I groan\u2014\u2019cause getting back in bed is all I really want to do. But I shake my head. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone long. I just have to check on Drew real quick\u2014it\u2019s a guy-code thing. What kind of friend would I be if I didn\u2019t make sure he hasn\u2019t hung himself in his walk-in closet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe kind who wants to make the world a better place.\u201d</p><p>Then she spots my camera on the bedside table. She turns it over in her hands, biting her lip. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to occupy myself . . . by taking X-rated selfies on your camera. We can develop them together when you get back.\u201d</p><p>I take a second to enjoy the images that pop into my head\u2014that hopefully will be showing up on my camera.</p><p>Then I hand her two extra rolls of film.</p> <p>I take my time kissing her good-bye before I compel my legs to move to the door. Just before I walk out, Dee calls, \u201cMatthew?\u201d</p><p>I stop and turn to her.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>And just like every other time she\u2019s said it today, a goofy, ridiculously happy grin appears on my lips. I walk back to the bed and kiss her yet again.</p><p>\u201cFor the record? I\u2019m never going to get tired of hearing you say that.\u201d</p> <p>She smiles contentedly. \u201cHurry back.\u201d</p><p>And I end up running the whole way to my bike\u2014so I can do just that.</p><p>Outside Drew\u2019s apartment door, it\u2019s the same old same old. I pound on it and I call, but the only response I get is one bump of a baseball thrown against the door when I ask him if he\u2019s still breathing.</p><p>I sigh and rest my hand on the door.</p><p>It\u2019s time for some tough love. Well past the time for it, if you want to know the truth.</p><p>\u201cDude, you gotta man up. Whatever happened between you and Kate\u2014however badly you f**ked up\u2014it\u2019s not gonna get any better if you don\u2019t come out and deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>No response.</p><p>I try taunting him. \u201cIn all the years we\u2019ve known each other, I never would\u2019ve guessed you were capable of being such a gigantic pu**y. You realize you\u2019re completely wrecking my image of you, right?\u201d</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Drew. Open the door. Remember how I was after Rosaline? You were there for me . . . let me return the favor.\u201d</p><p>Third strike, and I\u2019m out.</p><p>I tap the door, the way I\u2019d tap Drew\u2019s fist if these were better days. \u201cOkay, man, have it your way. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, all right?\u201d</p><p>Bam.</p><p>The door vibrates from the impact of the ball on the other side, and I know he\u2019s heard me.</p> <p>I shake my head as I walk back to the elevator. Because tomorrow, when I come back, I won\u2019t be alone. I really didn\u2019t want to have to do this\u2014but it\u2019s been a frigging week. He\u2019s left me no choice.</p><p>It\u2019s time to go nuclear.</p><p>I exit the lobby of the building, stepping out onto the sidewalk. Then I take my phone out and dial.</p><p>She picks up after two rings, greeting me by name.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alexandra. Listen, I need your help . . . it\u2019s about Drew.\u201d</p><p>And the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>So now you have the full story. The parts you didn\u2019t get to see before, the answers to some of the questions that might\u2019ve been bugging you.</p><p>When it comes to advice, I\u2019m kind of tapped out at the moment\u2014there\u2019s not a whole lot left to give. But I\u2019ll leave you with this:</p><p>Life is a short, wild ride. Don\u2019t try to put the brakes on, don\u2019t overanalyze or try to control it. If you\u2019re lucky, like I was, you\u2019ll find that perfect someone who\u2019ll sit next to you and hold your hand through every curve, every up and down.</p><p>And that? Just makes it even more fun.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Six months later . . .</p><p>Las Vegas, Nevada. The Elvis Chapel. It\u2019s technically called A Little White Wedding Chapel, but because there\u2019s an Elvis impersonator officiating the services, it\u2019ll always be the Elvis Chapel to me. We wait in an adjoining room for our turn, surrounded by signed photographs of the celebrities who\u2019ve exchanged vows here over the years.</p><p>It\u2019s been six months since our first kiss on the dance floor. Maybe you think that\u2019s too fast. Maybe you think we\u2019re crazy. But for Dee and me?</p><p>Crazy is actually pretty normal. Let\u2019s look at how we became engaged, for example:</p><p>\u201cMr. Fisher, please lay back down!\u201d the nurse yells in a commanding voice, but I ignore it.</p><p>What a f**king disaster.</p><p>Instead of a private, romantic evening at Dee\u2019s favorite restaurant, I\u2019ve somehow ended up in a hospital gown, on a gurney, in the back room of the goddamn ER. The only thing that could make it worse would be if the engagement ring was to get stolen by a sticky-fingered nurse or random homeless person.</p><p>I designed the ring myself, and it\u2019s perfect. A flawless two-carat diamond surrounded by emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. It\u2019s colorful, unique, just like Dee. Now I just have to give it to her.</p><p>I dig my pants out of the standard-issue plastic hospital bag and pull the ring box from the pocket. Then, before the nurses can stop me, I sprint down the short hall to the emergency room waiting area where Delores is. She stands up as soon as she sees me.</p><p>I walk to her and drop to one bended knee. \u201cI want you to belong to me. And I want to be yours. I want to be the reason for your smiles. I want to spend the rest of my life listening to all your theories and teaching you the difference between a good movie and a bad one. I want to be eighty years old, holding your hand during couples skate\u2014and I promise to love you every single moment from now until then. Will you marry me, Delores?\u201d</p><p>Yeah\u2014so that was my romantic proposal.</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t want to have a long engagement, and I was thrilled about that. The \u201cwhy wait?\u201d philosophy is how we started, and it hasn\u2019t let us down yet. So, here we are\u2014me, Dee, Drew, and Kate\u2014in Vegas for a quickie wedding and kick-ass celebration.</p><p>I look in the mirror and try to straighten my tie, but it doesn\u2019t cooperate.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Drew asks from behind me, dressed in his own custom-tailored tuxedo.</p><p>\u201cNever been more sure, buddy.\u201d</p><p>I give up on the tie. Screw it.</p><p>\u201cAre you really sure?\u201d Drew asks. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to back out.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s way too late.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drop to my crooked tie, and he steps in front of me to fix it\u2014like a father helping his teenage son on prom night. Once it\u2019s straightened to Drew\u2019s satisfaction, he puts his hands on my shoulders, looks me in the eyes, and says, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re really sure?\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s frowning voice calls from across the room. \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sure. Don\u2019t ask him again or I\u2019m not going to be happy. And you won\u2019t like it if I\u2019m not happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think they\u2019ve been watching Incredible Hulk reruns recently.</p><p>Drew nods. But as soon as Kate\u2019s back is turned, he silently mouths, \u201cAre you sure? Really sure?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. Because I\u2019m sure.</p><p>And because I never\u2014ever\u2014thought I\u2019d see the day when Drew would be cowed by a chick. But it looks like he has.</p> <p>Haven\u2019t we all?</p><p>I adjust my cuff links as Dee walks up beside me, warm contentment in her eyes. She\u2019s wearing an all-white, all-lace, long-sleeved minidress with baby blue stilettos. Her strawberry-blond hair is pulled up at the sides, and a shoulder-length veil cascades over her hair like a halo, held in place by a small diamond tiara that sits atop her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>I wrap an arm around her waist, pulling her close. \u201cI was thinking about the first time I called you. I didn\u2019t want to admit it at the time, but I think I was kind of nervous.\u201d I kiss her temple, gently. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous now.\u201d</p><p>She rests her head against my chest. \u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p> <p>Just then, the double doors to the chapel open, and a crystal-encrusted Elvis steps into the room. \u201cAre we ready to get this show on the road, kids?\u201d</p><p>Drew and I take our places near the altar as the doors are closed once more. Instrumental guitar music begins, the doors open, and Kate steps into the archway. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Drew smile wide as he follows Kate\u2019s every move. When she gets down the aisle, he winks, and Kate answers him with an adoring smile.</p><p>Once Kate stands in her assigned spot, the doors reopen again, revealing Dee on Elvis\u2019s arm. As he escorts her down the aisle, he sings our wedding song, \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling In Love.\u201d</p><p>Delores and I stand side by side, hand in hand, as Elvis asks us our vows. \u201cDo you, Matthew Franklin Fisher, take Delores Warren as your lawfully wedded wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise to never treat her like a \u2018Hound Dog,\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t Be Cruel,\u2019 or leave her \u2018Lonesome Tonight\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise to be her \u2018Big Hunk O\u2019 Love,\u2019 her \u2018Teddy Bear,\u2019 and love her tender and true until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>I cup Dee\u2019s cheek in my hand. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Dee smiles and tears up as I slip the platinum band on her finger, next to her engagement ring.</p><p>Then Elvis asks Delores, \u201cDo you, Delores Sunshine Warren, take Matthew Fisher as your lawfully wedded husband?\u201d</p><p>Her voice is clear and sure as she answers, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise to never step on his \u2018Blue Suede Shoes,\u2019 never cause him to have a \u2018Suspicious Mind,\u2019 or leave him \u2018All Shook Up\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you always have him on your mind, always show him the \u2018Wonder of You,\u2019 and always keep that \u2018Burning Love\u2019 for him until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>With that, Dee slips the ring on my finger. And in a deep drawl, Elvis proclaims, \u201cBy the power invested in me by the State of Nevada, I pronounce you husband and wife.\u201d He slaps my shoulder. \u201cYou may kiss your bride.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to be told twice. I wrap my arms around her and press my lips to Dee\u2019s\u2014pouring every ounce of love, excitement, and gratitude I feel for her into it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s proper to use tongue in a wedding kiss, but I don\u2019t let that stop me.</p><p>Before I can sweep Delores up, she jumps right into my arms, and I cradle her as we kiss. Kate claps and Drew whistles. After we take a thousand pictures, we thank Elvis and head out. And the four of us spend the rest of the night laughing and dancing until we can\u2019t stand up.</p><p>It really is the best of times. And it\u2019s just the beginning. </p> </body></html>"]
