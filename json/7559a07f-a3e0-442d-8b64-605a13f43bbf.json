Give in or deprive yourself. Choose your adventure.</p><p>Jace\u2019s general stance: Deprivation was overrated.</p> <p>But he\u2019d never faced this kind of temptation. The kind that seeped into your skin so slowly you didn\u2019t even notice until you were soaked with it, saturated. To the point that every thought, every breath, seemed to be laced with the desire for that thing you shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>And right now that thing was nibbling flecks of purple polish off her fingernails.</p><p>Jace shifted on the rec room couch, pretending to look for the remote control, even though he could feel the damn thing digging into his hip. He had to do something to get her calves off his lap. Otherwise, she was going to feel exactly how much he hadn\u2019t been concentrating on the horror movie. Or she\u2019d assume he\u2019d gotten the monster hard-on watching the teens get butchered on the screen. Although, thinking he got off on blood and guts might be preferable to the real reason he was sporting wood.</p><p>She tucked her legs to her chest and set her chin on her knees, staring at him with eyes so pale blue, they looked like silver dimes in the flicker of the television. Thunder rumbled outside and her gaze darted to the window behind him. Wary. \u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve watched that Jim Carrey movie instead.\u201d</p><p>He hit Stop on the VCR, cutting off the eerie music to the closing credits, and resisted the urge to scoot closer to her, to curl around her lithe body and slay her fears like the dude in the movie had done for the heroine. Well, up until the guy\u2019s head was lopped off. That he could skip. \u201cSee, I warned you it would freak you out. I shouldn\u2019t have even let you watch it. It\u2019s rated R. Too old for you.\u201d</p> <p>She snorted and shoved his thigh with her foot. \u201cSaid the nineteen-year-old who just finished his third beer.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the empty bottles on the side table. Yeah, he was batting a thousand on the responsible adult thing tonight. Good thing his parents had left him in charge. \u201cI\u2019m in college. Beer is part of homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll be rated-R approved in three months anyway.\u201d She grabbed her Coke off the coffee table and sipped, drawing his attention down to her heart-shaped lips and the way they drew the liquid slowly from the bottle. \u201cHell, I\u2019ll be porn approved.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. That\u2019s the last image she needed to paint on his brain. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. Gotta be eighteen for that.\u201d</p><p>Lightning reflected off the silver ring in her arched eyebrow. \u201cYou would know, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy.\u201d Which should be enough of an explanation. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare watch any of that shit until you\u2019re like thirty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please. I\u2019m not that innocent, Jace,\u201d she said, yawning and setting down her drink. She rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands, smudging her heavy kohl eyeliner until she looked like some gothic angel. \u201cThe couple I was placed with last time had a huge stash that their idiot sons always raided. I\u2019ve seen my share of bom-chicka-wah-wah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, terrific. Glad you were supervised so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was stupid. The guy actors were ugly and the girls were fake-looking.\u201d She bumped his thigh with her bare foot again. \u201cKind of like those chicks you always date.\u201d</p><p>He almost jolted when she touched him. He felt like that game Operation where any slight nudge sent a loud buzz through his system\u2014only this buzz went straight to his dick. Every time he was around her these days was like this.</p><p>He\u2019d almost gotten used to it, had accepted the painful state as part of his daily existence. Then two weeks ago they\u2019d been goofing off in the pool. She\u2019d sprayed him in the face with the hose, and he\u2019d grabbed her by the ankle and pulled her into the water with him. When she\u2019d surfaced, she\u2019d been laughing\u2014something as rare as a unicorn sighting.</p><p>He\u2019d pushed her hair off her face, intending to dunk her again, but had gotten caught in the net of her laughing eye-lock. He\u2019d hesitated. And in the space between blinks, she\u2019d glided in closer to him, invaded his space, and kissed him.</p><p>And dammit, he\u2019d kissed her back. Had let all the pent-up desire he\u2019d harbored for her over the last few months pour into the kiss. So stupid.</p><p>He knew having someone live in his parents\u2019 house for a year didn\u2019t make her his sister. But he wasn\u2019t dumb enough to think kissing her was okay either. Especially when she was still in high school. Man, if hell existed, he was going straight there.</p> <p>He\u2019d stopped the kiss when she\u2019d pressed her body against his, her one-piece bathing suit not thick enough to insulate him from her every peak and valley beneath it. She\u2019d swum off without a word and hadn\u2019t mentioned it again, apparently voting to pretend it never happened. He\u2019d seconded that vote.</p><p>But now he realized they were probably going to have to discuss it. Draw a nice little chalk line between them. He\u2019d drunk the beer, hoping to get some liquid courage, but no such luck.</p><p>He scooted more toward the arm of the couch, away from contact with her feet. \u201cThe girls I date aren\u2019t fake-looking.\u201d Not totally.</p><p>\u201cThey sure as hell don\u2019t look like me.\u201d</p><p>Fuck no, they didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t smell of cherry shampoo like she did either. Or smile at only his good jokes, not the lame ones. Or make him feel like he was worth hanging out with\u2014not because of his money, or his rank on the college swim team, but just because. \u201cNo one looks like you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted back to her chipped nail polish. \u201cYeah, well, not all of us can be supermodels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>She swung her legs from the couch to the floor and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to go clean this polish off and go to bed. Thanks for renting the movie, even though I think I\u2019ll be sleeping with the lights on and the closet doors open tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up.\u201d Jace grabbed her hand before she could escape, knowing he shouldn\u2019t say what he was about to, but not okay letting her walk away feeling like she was somehow less than. \u201cI\u2019m serious. Those girls only wish they looked as great as you. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of crap I bet your eyes have turned brown with it.\u201d She slipped her fingers from his grasp and hugged her elbows. \u201cDon\u2019t do this because of what happened in the pool. I have enough people doing the let\u2019s-lie-to-make-her-feel-good thing. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve been able to count on to not bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>Thunder rolled outside as if gathering energy off her building anger.</p><p>He leaned back on the couch, his hands out to his sides. \u201cChill, I\u2019m not lying to you, okay?\u201d I haven\u2019t really been sitting here all night watching you instead of the stupid movie. And no, I haven\u2019t spent the last two weeks replaying how good it felt to kiss you that day. Or wondering what would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t stopped things.</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, eyes narrowed, like she was determining results on some internal lie detector.</p><p>He knew more discussion in this direction wasn\u2019t going to lead anywhere good. If she kept prying, his feelings were going to slip out, especially with his tongue loose from beer. \u201cYou should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted as if she was going to push the issue further, but then\u2014thank God\u2014clamped them shut and turned her back on him. \u201cGood night, Jace.\u201d</p><p>After he was sure she\u2019d be done in the bathroom and tucked into her own room, Jace trudged upstairs to get ready for bed. He should\u2019ve skipped brushing his teeth. The minute he stepped into the steamy, cherry-scented bathroom, his hard-on returned full force. She\u2019d showered.</p><p>He groaned as images of her slipping out of her clothes right where he stood assailed him. Water sluicing down over her every curve, washing away all that makeup and leaving behind that natural beauty so few girls seemed to have. Her hands sliding soap over her naked body, touching, exploring. Fuck.</p><p>He brushed his teeth with brutal force and shoved his toothbrush back in its holder, fighting the temptation to climb in the shower and let the fantasy run wild while he stroked himself. He\u2019d done it before with her on his mind. But he knew it wouldn\u2019t provide any real relief. It\u2019d only key him up more, and all he wanted to do right now was fall into bed and crash. At least if he was sleeping he didn\u2019t have to think about the girl two doors down.</p><p>He made his way to his bedroom and flipped on a lamp. The room flooded with warm light, but then flickered off, the distinctive sound of everything electronic in the house going from a whir to dead silence following it. Ah, hell.</p><p>He crossed to the far side of the room and pulled back the curtains on the pair of large windows, lighting his room with the flashing of the storm. With wind like this, losing electricity had been inevitable. Now he wouldn\u2019t even be able to distract himself with TV to help get to sleep. He stripped down to his boxers and slipped between the cool sheets.</p><p>Stared at the ceiling.</p><p>This was going to be a long night.</p><p>He counted the seconds between the bolts of lightning and the boom of thunder\u2014the space between getting less and less. The worst of the rain would pass over them soon. But he feared his throbbing hard-on wouldn\u2019t fade quite as quickly.</p><p>He tossed from one side of the bed to the other, trying to think of something\u2014anything\u2014besides the girl down the hall. Even replaying some of the gory scenes from the movie they\u2019d watched didn\u2019t help. Nothing could shake the image of her standing there\u2014smudged eyeliner, faded sweatshirt, and a jaded smirk that told him she really didn\u2019t believe she was beautiful.</p><p>Didn\u2019t realize he couldn\u2019t even concentrate when she was near.</p><p>He flopped onto his back with a strangled sigh. He would never fall asleep at this rate. Not with his brain on an endless loop and his body staging the boner from hell. Resigned, he let his hand track down his abdomen and below the waistband of his shorts, imagining that it was her delicate, purple-polished fingers wrapping around his cock instead of his large hand.</p><p>He groaned as he stroked up the length and ran a thumb over the tip. God, how many times in the last few months had he thought of her this way? He couldn\u2019t ever remember aching for someone like this. Sex was sex. Girls were girls. Both had always come easy to him. Neither was something to get all knotted up about. Why was she so different?</p><p>Her name whispered off his lips as he brought himself closer to release, and the windows rattled with the next roll of thunder. Jace almost missed the faint tap tap tap sound mixed in with it. The noise came again. He tilted his head, listened. Another knock and then his door cracked open a sliver, a beam of light peeking through. \u201cJace?\u201d</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. He pulled his hand from his shorts and squinted in the glare of the flashlight. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d she asked, her voice swallowed by another rumble outside.</p><p>Hell no! He sat up on his elbows, making sure he had enough blankets over him to cover what was beneath the sheets. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She stepped fully into the room and clicked off the flashlight. \u201cDo you have any matches or a lighter? I . . . I know it\u2019s stupid, but the dark still freaks me out and I want to light a few candles.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo, sorry, I don\u2019t. I could go look downstairs. There may be some in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t get up.\u201d She took another step toward him, the flashing from the windows lighting her in strobe effect, each blink giving his eyes something new to torture himself with. Bare legs. Short gym shorts. Damp hair. A tank top so thin he could see the shadow of dusky pink nipples beneath it.</p><p>But where he lost it was when his eyes locked with hers. The longing he felt in his own chest reflected in her pale blue stare. He tried to clear the knot that lodged in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to my room, Jace,\u201d she said, something very different from fear lacing her words.</p><p>His tongue grew thick in his mouth. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t stay in here.\u201d</p> <p>Another step closer, now within arm\u2019s reach of him. \u201cWhy not? No one will be home until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and raked a hand through his now sweat-dampened hair. \u201cBecause . . . Jesus, you know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you think I\u2019m pretty.\u201d The corner of her mouth lifted despite the obvious nervous edge tracking through her tone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d he said, not sure if the words were directed at her or himself.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I want to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, because I think you\u2019re pretty.\u201d He looked toward the windows, breathed. \u201cBecause I damn near lose my mind every time I\u2019m near you lately.\u201d</p><p>Her breath escaped in a sharp little puff, and the thunder rolled between them, electrifying the air.</p><p>He hardened his tone, hoping she\u2019d run for the door. \u201cGo back to your room. We\u2019re playing a dangerous game and doing the right thing has never been my strong suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I love about you,\u201d she said, sitting down on the bed, ignoring his warning. The curve of her hip brushed against the back of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one in this family that seems to live in the moment, to take risks.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and his family hated him for it. He closed his eyes, trying to shut out the vision of her, but her scent wrapped around him just the same, awakening every nerve in his body.</p><p>Soft skin slid across his palm as she gripped his hand. \u201cTake a risk on me, Jace. Please. I need . . .\u201d She paused and he opened his eyes to find hers going shiny. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p> <p>The stark ache in her voice sank down into his bones, eclipsing even the sexual attraction he had for her and fueling something deeper, some longing to connect with her. Hold her. Soothe whatever made her so sad beneath that tough girl fa\u00e7ade. To be that guy to fight off her demons.</p><p>To be what she needed.</p><p>So he squeezed her hand and pulled her down against him, taking her lips in a slow, savoring kiss and letting himself fall to the desire that had choked him these last few months. Her body melted along his, her hands exploring his bare chest, threading though his hair, touching and testing. Both brave and timid.</p><p>Jace held back his need to run his hands over each inch of her, afraid he\u2019d overtake her with his own wants and urge her farther than she wanted to go. He settled for laying gentle kisses along the curve of her neck, tasting the sweet salt of her skin and breathing in her heady scent. He could spend all night relishing every nuance of her. Each flavor. Each texture. Each breathy sigh.</p><p>Her fingers traced down over his hip, pausing when they brushed the waistband of his boxers. Tentative.</p><p>He eased back from kissing her neck and tucked a stray hair behind her ear. \u201cHey, we can just kiss. This doesn\u2019t have to be anything more than that.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and looked down at her hands. \u201cBut what if I want it to be?\u201d</p><p>The sweet plea in her tone undid him. Completely and totally decimated the last of his resistance. He put a knuckle beneath her chin and lifted her face to him. \u201cTell me what you want, baby.\u201d</p> <p>The lightning flashed outside, revealing the color staining her cheeks. \u201cI want everything with you, but . . . can you take the lead?\u201d</p><p>He eased her off him and onto her back, kissing the corner of a mouth that smirked too often and stared into eyes that had seen too much. \u201cYeah, I think I can do that.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>Tasting her, touching her. Loving her.</p><p>Breaking every rule he\u2019d set for himself and breaking the goddamned law.</p><p>But in the beautiful perfection that filled the next few thousand breaths, he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Because sometimes doing the wrong thing was the only thing that felt right.</p><p>ONE</p><p>Evan Kennedy swigged the last of the tequila from the mini-bottle as her fianc\u00e9\u2019s moans of pleasure drifted through the wall behind her. She set the bottle down and sank back onto the bed, curling her pillow around her ears. This was torture\u2014absolute Geneva Convention\u2013worthy stuff. Next time they stayed in a hotel, she would make sure the suite had two bedrooms that didn\u2019t share a wall.</p><p>How was she supposed to sleep with that kind of erotic soundtrack in the background? Especially when the only company she had in her room was the hotel\u2019s mini-bar and a subpar selection of cable stations.</p><p>The heavy thudding of a headboard banging against the wall started up, rattling the three empty bottles on her bedside table. Oh, the guys were on their game tonight\u2014obviously celebrating the good news they\u2019d all gotten earlier in the evening. No telling how long their show would go on. With a heavy sigh, she threw the comforter off her legs and climbed out of the bed, happy to find she only wavered slightly.</p><p>She needed air. Or at least some place where two happy lovers weren\u2019t sharing passionate, wall-rattling sex while she lay in bed alone.</p><p>She yanked on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, then tucked the last mini-bottle of tequila into her pocket. The bars downstairs would be closed by now, and although she rarely drank, tonight she had the urge to get comfortably numb. She just had to make sure not to run into any of the people here for her and Daniel\u2019s couples\u2019 seminar. That certainly wouldn\u2019t reflect well on the company. And the last thing she felt like doing was getting into a row with Daniel about \u201cprofessional image.\u201d</p><p>After running a brush through her hair, she stepped out of her bedroom and threw one last glance at Daniel\u2019s closed door. The moans had turned to dueling male grunts. Clearly both parties were having a good time. An unexpected pang of sadness hit her in the gut, and her eyes burned as if tears were going to flow.</p><p>What in the world? Her hand went to her cheek, but of course no actual tears were there. She never cried. But that burning was the first sign she\u2019d had in years that she was still physically capable of tears.</p><p>She shook her head. Maybe it was the tequila.</p><p>And the close quarters.</p><p>A walk would help.</p><p>She shut the door with a soft snick and made her way down to the lobby. As expected, things were quiet. The overnight desk clerk glanced up at her with disinterested eyes. She gave him a quick smile and turned in the opposite direction to head toward the pool and the beach beyond.</p><p>She slipped through the exit door, and the warm Gulf breeze wrapped around her, lifting her mood a bit. She closed her eyes and inhaled the salty air, letting it fill her lungs and hoping it would clear her head. But as soon as she opened her eyes again, the glowing swimming pool seemed to tilt in front of her. Whoa. Maybe she had overestimated her liquor tolerance. Three shots of tequila might have been two too many. She grabbed on to the back of a nearby lounge chair to steady herself.</p><p>Evan focused on the dark expanse of the Gulf of Mexico in the distance, waiting for the spinning in her head to stop. She just needed to make it to the beach, sit down in the sand, and get her normally iron-clad defenses back in place so she could return upstairs with a smile on her face. She didn\u2019t need the guys seeing her this way. They\u2019d want to sit down and talk about feelings and shit. And really, she just didn\u2019t want to go there. The last thing she needed right now was for Daniel to put on his therapist hat with her.</p><p>After a few more fortifying breaths, she straightened her spine and made her way slowly around the edge of the pool and to the wooden stairs that led down to the beach. Almost there. But when she reached for the gate, the latch didn\u2019t give. \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She looked down and sighed at the sign attached to the weather-beaten wood. Private Beach\u2014Closed: midnight to 6 a.m. No lifeguard on duty.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>She stared longingly at the crashing waves, the peaceful solitude of the beach calling to her like a siren song. She peeked over her shoulder at the hotel\u2019s main building. There weren\u2019t any security cameras out here. Who would know? And Daniel had brought a hell of a lot of business to the hotel this weekend with the conference, so even if someone caught her, she doubted they would do more than politely direct her back to her room.</p><p>Without giving it more thought, she planted a foot on the lowest railing and draped her other leg over the top, making sure to keep two hands securely on the fence so her head wouldn\u2019t start whirling again. She hoped no one was watching because she was sure she was executing the maneuver with the grace of a walrus, but at least she didn\u2019t topple down the stairs. Score.</p><p>After a careful walk down the steps, she kicked off her flip-flops and curled her toes into the cool sand. Ahh, yes, so worth the rule-breaking.</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance, and the clouds far off on the horizon blinked with lightning. Damn, she should\u2019ve brought her camera. The new lens she\u2019d bought would\u2019ve been perfect to catch the display. She moved closer to the water, stepping past the rows of hotel lounge chairs and closed umbrellas and not stopping until the spray from the crashing waves hit her face and the taste of salt alighted on her tongue.</p><p>The tide pooled around her feet, soaking the bottom of her jeans and sending a little chill through her. She rubbed her arms and glanced down the beach, taking in the deserted shoreline that stretched along the length of South Padre Island. The moonlight had turned the normally colorful view into silver sand and black water, but even in the darkness, she could tell she was alone on her three a.m. adventure.</p><p>No surprise there. People didn\u2019t come on vacation to wander around alone half-drunk in the middle of the night. No, the people in those beautifully appointed hotels lining the beach were cuddled up to their loved ones right now, sleeping off a fun day. Or, like Daniel, having crazy monkey sex with their lovers. Lucky bastards.</p><p>Normally, that knowledge wouldn\u2019t bother her. She\u2019d made her decisions, had created a good life for herself. For the first time, she was with someone who loved her\u2014even if that love was only platonic. But for some reason, a hollow ache had rooted solidly in her chest tonight. And paired with the heated need that had settled between her thighs after listening to an hour of lovemaking, she was dangerously close to feeling sorry for herself.</p><p>Her fists balled. No way. Screw that. The alcohol had to be what was making her feel this way. She just needed to sober up.</p><p>She looked down at the water swirling around her ankles. A dunk in the surf would probably snap her into sobriety pretty quickly. But walking back through the hotel in dripping-wet clothes wasn\u2019t exactly wise, especially when she wasn\u2019t supposed to be on the beach in the first place.</p><p>She gave the shore another quick scan, then shrugged. Oh, what the hell.</p><p>Evan stepped back from the water long enough to shimmy out of her jeans and T-shirt and tossed the clothes where the water\u2019s edge wouldn\u2019t reach. Despite the warm night breeze, her nipples beaded beneath her bra and goose bumps rose on her skin. A little zip of adrenaline went through her. Man, how long had it been since she\u2019d done something like this, stepped outside the lines a little? She\u2019d almost forgotten what it felt like.</p><p>To hell with the pity party. She was on a gorgeous beach and had the whole damn thing to herself. No more whining. She made her way back toward the waves and took her time submerging herself, determined to enjoy the luxury of owning this little piece of ocean for the night.</p><p>The water lapped at her as she moved further into the surf\u2014bathing her legs, sliding up her thighs, soaking her panties. Mmm. The gulf was deliciously warm against her skin, caressing the dormant parts of her to full sensual awareness. Her hands cupped the water and drew it up and over her breasts, soaking her bra and the tightening buds underneath. A shudder went through her.</p><p>She wanted to sink into the salty depths and allow the sensations to take over, to wash away the dark emotions that had claimed her tonight. But even in her buzzed state, she knew tequila and swimming weren\u2019t good bedfellows. So, she stopped when the waves crested at her chest and settled in to watch the light show on the horizon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>The distant storm had moved a bit closer, and though it still wasn\u2019t near enough to be a threat, the view of the flashing sky was breathtaking. She wanted to kick herself for not bringing her camera. She\u2019d had so little time for her photography since she\u2019d gone on this seminar tour with Daniel she was beginning to worry she\u2019d forgotten how to do it. Hopefully, when they returned to Dallas after this last stop, she could dedicate some time to her neglected studio.</p><p>With a sigh, she tilted her head back, closed her eyes, and dipped her hair into the water. Maybe that\u2019s why she was in such a funk. She\u2019d spent the last few months supporting Daniel\u2019s passion and ignoring hers. She\u2019d signed up for it, and the venture had turned out to be lucrative for them both, but it definitely didn\u2019t feed the part of her soul that slipping behind a camera did. That part was downright starved.</p> <p>Thunder rumbled closer this time. Reluctantly, she drifted back a few feet. It was probably time to get out. The alcohol-induced fog in her head was clearing, and based on the sudden uptick in wind, the storm would be on top of her in the next few minutes. But before she could take another step, pain\u2014sharp and sudden\u2014shot up her thigh.</p><p>She yelped and jolted backward, her arms flailing before she crashed into the water and went under. Saltwater filled her mouth, silencing her shout, and a burning sensation wrapped around her thigh and radiated outward.</p><p>Disoriented, she scrambled for solid footing, trying to get back to the surface. She knew she couldn\u2019t have fallen into deep water, but the writhing pain and the knowledge that she was out there alone had panic edging in. She spread her arms in an attempt to tread water and finally felt sand against her toes. But just as she tried to push off, twin bands of heat wrapped around her upper arms and her entire body was propelled upward.</p><p>When her face broke the surface of the water, she sucked in a large gulp of air, half-coughing, half-choking. She kicked frantically, trying to make sure she didn\u2019t get dragged back under.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting or you\u2019re going to drown us both.\u201d The rumbling male voice came from behind her, and the grip on her arms tightened. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of the undertow.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart jumped into her throat, but she forced herself to stop struggling so the stranger could help. His breath was warm on her neck as he pulled them both backward, but he didn\u2019t say another word. The water seemed to be fighting their progress, and the man adjusted his hold until he had his arms hooked beneath her armpits. She wanted to tell him to let her go, that she knew how to swim, but her thigh was burning like a swarm of wasps had attacked it and her head was spinning again.</p><p>A few hard-fought minutes later, packed sand scraped against her heels, and she sucked in a deep sigh of relief. The man dragged her another few feet until they reached dry land, then set her down and kneeled next to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, his broad chest heaving beneath his soaked T-shirt.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to the concerned eyes staring down at her, an odd sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washing over her. \u201cI, uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you scream. Are you hurt?\u201d He touched the side of her head, evaluating her.</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cMy leg . . . Something stung me . . . I lost my balance.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced down the length of her\u2014the mostly naked length of her. Shit. She shot up into a sitting position and scooted backward, but his hand locked over her knee as he stared down at her upper thigh, which was still burning like she\u2019d roasted it over an open fire.</p><p>\u201cDamn, it got you good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She tried to jerk her leg from beneath his grip, but he held her firm as he examined her.</p><p>\u201cJellyfish,\u201d he said, frowning at her. \u201cYour whole thigh is striped. That must hurt like a sonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the red tentacle-shaped lines around her thigh. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t feel awesome.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, the rich sound seeming to vibrate from deep within his chest, and something stirred in the back of her brain. He climbed to his feet. \u201cHere, let me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare pee on me,\u201d she said, the words slipping out before she could rethink them.</p><p>He tilted his head back in a full laugh this time, the sound echoing down the beach.</p> <p>She cringed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand, his eyes still lit with humor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The urine thing is just an urban myth. And I\u2019m definitely not going to ruin my \u2018just saved pretty girl from drowning\u2019 hero status by taking a leak on you. I\u2019m not that stupid.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cOh, a hero, huh? So this is all a big pick-up routine? Find drowning girls and ride in on your white horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He grabbed the hem of his T-shirt and pulled it off, revealing miles of taut skin, sinewy muscle, and tribal-style ink running across his shoulder and down one arm, rendering her momentarily speechless. Water dripped off his soaked hair\u2014which looked to be blond, though it was hard to tell in the moonlight\u2014and slipped down his now bare chest. Her gaze locked on the tiny droplets, tracking their path down to the band of his shorts until they disappeared. Oh, blessed Lord.</p><p>He cleared his throat, no doubt catching her in her perusal, and squatted next to her. His hand slipped under her knee. \u201cHere, seawater actually helps the sting. Let me wrap this around your leg, and then we can go to my room. We\u2019ll get you feeling better.\u201d</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow at him. \u201cOh, really. Might want to tap the brakes there, Rico Suave. Despite my state of undress, I don\u2019t just go to strangers\u2019 hotel rooms. I\u2019m not quite that easy.\u201d</p><p>Dimples appeared as he fought a smile. \u201cOh, not quite that easy, but easy. Duly noted.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a withering look.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not why I was inviting you to my room. Although, I promise that certainly would distract you from the pain. But all I mean is my roommate is Mr. Prepared. He keeps a first-aid kit for the beach and always has a bottle of vinegar in it. It will help deactivate the venom.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Two grown men on a beach vacation together? Great, not another good-looking guy who preferred other good-looking guys. Not that she was looking for anything to happen anyway. He was a stranger. An extremely pinup-worthy stranger. But still. In her sexually deprived state, a little flirting could be almost as satisfying as an orgasm. Almost.</p><p>With gentle hands, he bent her leg and wrapped his wet T-shirt around her thigh. His focus was on the task at hand, but she didn\u2019t miss the sneaky sidelong glance toward her open thighs, where her wet panties were probably revealing every detail of what lay beneath.</p><p>She cleared her throat, and his gaze darted back to her leg, but the corner of his mouth tugged up a bit.</p><p>Well, well, maybe not so gay.</p><p>Her body heated at the thought, even though her brain knew that, straight or gay, she wasn\u2019t going to do anything with her rescuer. \u201cSo how long were you out here? I thought I was alone.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up as he draped the shirt around her leg a second time. \u201cI was here the whole time.\u201d He crooked a thumb behind him. \u201cWas sitting in one of the lounge chairs on the far end. I thought you saw me when you looked down the beach, but I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve said something, you know.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an unrepentant grin. \u201cIf a beautiful woman wants to go for a naked swim, who am I to intervene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery gentlemanly of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, never said I was a gentleman. Just a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her tone dry.</p><p>He tucked the end of the shirt underneath the first layer, securing it. \u201cIs that too tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s actually helping the burning a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d He climbed to his feet and jogged a little ways down the beach, grabbed something from one of the lounge chairs, then walked over to where she had left her clothes and picked up those as well. When he returned he held out her T-shirt. \u201cGo ahead and put this on. You\u2019re not going to be able to put on the jeans, but you can wrap my beach towel around your waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She took her shirt and towel from him, pulled the first over her head, then got to her feet and knotted the beach towel around her hips. She tilted her head up to smile at him. \u201cSo, Mr. Humble Hero, you have a name?\u201d</p><p>He stuck out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Jace.\u201d</p><p>Her body froze, the world seeming to tip off balance for a moment. Had she heard right? She stared at him for a moment, taking in every nuance of his face, the earlier whispers of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu now becoming shouts.</p><p>Was it really him? His hair was longer, his body harder and more mature, the green in his eyes more wary, but the resemblance was there. It\u2019d been years\u2014twelve actually. The nineteen-year-old boy she\u2019d known had become a man. \u201cJace Austin?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. The recognition that flashed in the woman\u2019s blue eyes had Jace dropping his hand. This chick knew him? He frantically flipped through his mental Rolodex, starting with the girls-I\u2019ve-slept-with file.</p><p>When they\u2019d locked gazes earlier, he\u2019d felt a nudge of familiarity but had dismissed it. Surely, he\u2019d remember this dark-haired beauty, especially if he had gotten the privilege of touching that lush little body. But something about her was poking at the recesses of his mind.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck and offered an apologetic smile. \u201cUh, yeah. Jace Austin. I\u2019m sorry, have we met?\u201d</p><p>She flinched a bit\u2014the move subtle, but not lost on him. Damn, well now he felt like a jackass. Had they slept together?</p><p>She recovered quickly, the corner of her mouth tilting up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure I look a little different than I did at sixteen. Especially without that god-awful bottle red hair and eyebrow piercing.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen? Red hair? The flashing list of names in his head suddenly flipped back over a decade and landed on one he hadn\u2019t thought about in years. One he\u2019d purposely tried to block out. No, couldn\u2019t be. \u201cEvangeline?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and looked out at the water, the wind whipping her hair around and disguising her expression. \u201cIt\u2019s Evan now. I stopped using my full name a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou look great. I\u2019m so glad to see that you\u2019re . . .\u201d Okay. Alive. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She turned back toward him and smiled, though it didn\u2019t light her face the way the earlier smiles had. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too. But, if you don\u2019t mind, before we go down memory lane, how \u2019bout that vinegar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d he said, his mind still whirling. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>And she needn\u2019t worry. The last thing he was going to do was initiate any reminiscing. No, some things were better left buried. And how he\u2019d destroyed the girl he\u2019d sworn to look out for was A-number-one on that list.</p><p>TWO</p><p>Evan leaned against the back of the couch in Jace\u2019s hotel suite and clasped her hands in front of her to keep them from shaking. She\u2019d thought about Jace so often over the years, despite her best efforts not to. She had wondered how he was doing, but she\u2019d never allowed herself to look him up and check. She\u2019d been a coward\u2014afraid of how she\u2019d react seeing him all grown up, possibly with a wife and kids or something.</p><p>When she was a teenager, Jace had been the perfect boy in her eyes. The only guy who\u2019d been able to make her smile during those dark years. She\u2019d stupidly assumed his attention had meant more than simple friendship, more than pity for a screwed-up foster kid. But God, how wrong she\u2019d been. Of all the disastrous mistakes she\u2019d made in her life, falling for Jace had been her biggest. She\u2019d paid dearly for that error\u2014still paid for it\u2014but he would never know that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>And now he\u2019d seen her moping alone on the beach and going skinny-dipping drunk. Stellar. If she\u2019d wanted to show him how far she\u2019d come, how put together she was now, she\u2019d certainly gotten off to a shining start.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go grab the vinegar from Andre\u2019s room,\u201d Jace said, pulling her from her thoughts. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in the bathroom and unwrap your leg? I\u2019ll bring you the bottle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d she said, proud her voice was steady despite her jangled nerves.</p><p>She made her way to the restroom and sat on the edge of the tub, arranging the towel to cover her lap. The burn of the jellyfish sting had lessened a bit from its five-alarm status, but still made it hard to sit still. Or maybe it was the fact that Jace was here that had her ready to jump out of her skin. Even after all these years, simply being near him had her stomach doing silly flip-flops. She needed to get it together.</p><p>She unwrapped the makeshift bandage and laid it over the edge of the tub right as Jace poked his head into the bathroom. \u201cHow\u2019s it looking, Ev?\u201d</p><p>The affection lacing her old nickname poked at something she\u2019d long since buried. She forced a casual shrug. \u201cLooks like I got in a fight with a jellyfish and lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He stepped inside and the room seemed to shrink as his tall, still shirtless frame filled up the space. He squatted next to her and uncapped the bottle of vinegar. \u201cThis should neutralize the sting. Might be a little cold.\u201d</p> <p>She winced when he poured the liquid over her thigh, but despite the shock of the contrast in temperature, the sting started to ease. \u201cOoh, that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped her knee and he ran a thumb over the curve of it, causing her breath to hitch. He glanced up from his crouched position, his eyes seeming to see right through her this-is-no-big-thing fa\u00e7ade she was working so hard to maintain. \u201cYou okay, Ev?\u201d</p><p>She could tell by the somberness of his expression, the edge of concern in his voice that he wasn\u2019t asking about the sting. The combination of his touch and the sentiment almost undid her, almost brought forth the tears she\u2019d hadn\u2019t cried in a decade. She looked back at her leg. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Jace. Really.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath and stood. \u201cPat your leg dry. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, he returned\u2014thankfully with a shirt on. God knows she was having enough trouble concentrating around him without the added distraction of his bare chest. He tossed a ball of blue fabric to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pair of track shorts you can use. They\u2019ll be big, but hopefully the drawstring will help. You\u2019re not going to want to put your jeans back on over that sting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Thanks.\u201d She stared down at the shorts.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cUh, why don\u2019t you go ahead and get changed. I\u2019ll be in the living room.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already seen her in her underwear on the beach, but she knew why he was giving her privacy. Now that they knew who each other was, the wall of the past was firmly erected between them. There would be no more lighthearted flirting. Certainly not from her end.</p><p>Regardless, she appreciated the few minutes of alone time. It gave her time to regroup, pull her shoulders back, and slip back into the woman she was now\u2014instead of the teenager she\u2019d regressed to as soon as Jace had appeared.</p><p>When she stepped back into the living room, Jace was leaning over the small refrigerator, clanging bottles around as he searched for something. He glanced up from his task when she cleared her throat and sat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to see if we had any soda, but it looks like all we have is beer and water.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough alcohol tonight. Plus, I need to get back to my room.\u201d</p> <p>A squeak from the other side of the room caught her attention. She turned her head just as one of the bedroom doors swung open on whining hinges. A drowsy-eyed man wearing only plaid pajama bottoms filled the doorway and leaned against the doorframe. \u201cJ, what the fuck are you doing in here? I\u2019m trying to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jace frowned in the man\u2019s direction. \u201cWatch the language, Andre. We\u2019ve got company.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s roommate turned his head, his dark eyebrows lifting when he spotted her. \u201cOh.\u201d His gaze traveled down the length of her, pausing at the borrowed shorts, and a sleepy smile crossed his face. \u201cWell, hi there.\u201d</p><p>Evan heated beneath Andre\u2019s attention, the hint of Spanish accent and the flare of interest in his eyes singeing her. No worries about the two gorgeous men in the room being gay. That was for damn sure.</p><p>Jace snorted. \u201cBack off, Romeo. Evan\u2019s an old friend of mine and is only here because she has a wicked jellyfish sting. So you can dial down the flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second.\u201d Andre scrubbed a hand over his face and stepped closer, his eyes narrowing as if evaluating her closer. \u201cEvan? As in Evan Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Evan Litch\u2014\u201d Jace began, but she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, Evan Kennedy.\u201d She stuck out her hand. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Andre sauntered forward and took her hand, bringing it to his mouth and planting a kiss on top of it instead of shaking it. \u201cPleasure.\u201d</p><p>Jace walked up behind him, his brows knitted together. \u201cYou changed your name? Why does your new one sound so familiar?\u201d</p><p>Andre laughed and sank into the armchair next to her. She would\u2019ve answered Jace, but she had a hard time drawing her attention away from Andre\u2019s lean, tan chest and the silver nipple rings glinting in the lamp light. Oh, my. Not to mention Jace\u2019s well-built form in her peripheral vision. Man, she was like a starved woman at a buffet. Beyond getting away from her past with Jace, she needed to get away from all this testosterone.</p><p>Andre answered for her. \u201cBecause this lovely lady is engaged to the guy who\u2019s running the whole couples shindig this weekend. She\u2019ll be Mrs. Doctor Dan in a few months.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d Jace said, drawing her attention back to him as he crossed in front of her and sat on the couch opposite her. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>She cringed inwardly. Why had she let herself flirt on the beach? She knew better than that. Now she looked trampy on top of flighty. Fabulous. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the Dr. Dan?\u201d Jace eyed her in a way that made her want to shift her gaze to the floor. Like if she met his stare, he\u2019d see every bit of the truth written on her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, the very one.\u201d She stood and forced a brief smile. \u201cAnd I doubt he\u2019d be happy knowing I was half-dressed in someone else\u2019s hotel room in the middle of the night. So I better head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him you were going to the beach?\u201d Jace asked, the frown lines around his mouth deepening. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerous, Ev. You should\u2019ve told someone you were going out there. What if that undertow would\u2019ve kept you under and I hadn\u2019t been there?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw flexed. \u201cI would\u2019ve been fine. The jellyfish sting distracted me, but I would\u2019ve been able to swim to shore. And I don\u2019t need to report where I\u2019m going every second of the day to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do if your plan is to go skinny-dipping drunk in the middle of the night,\u201d he said, his voice rising.</p><p>Andre looked back and forth between the two of them, but was obviously smart enough not to jump in the conversation.</p><p>Her cheeks heated with a combination of shame and anger. \u201cI don\u2019t need a keeper, Jace. I didn\u2019t need one when you knew me before, and I don\u2019t need one now.\u201d</p><p>Jace looked ready to argue the point, but then his shoulders sagged and he released a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s none of my business. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her fists, which had clenched during the exchange, loosened. This was ridiculous. Why was she arguing with someone she had no intention to lay eyes on ever again? Jace was her past. She\u2019d spent a decade burying her old life and that version of herself. No good could come of dredging up any of those memories. She needed to keep Jace locked away in that \u201cmistakes\u201d box and get out of here.</p><p>\u201cLook, I appreciate your help tonight. Really.\u201d She turned to Andre. \u201cAnd thanks so much for the vinegar. It really helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, sometimes my Boy-Scout-like preparedness comes in handy.\u201d Andre gave her a little mock salute, but she had a hard time believing the wholesome routine when he was so busy looking like Latin-flavored sin.</p><p>Her gaze strayed to the door. \u201cUm, well, I\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p><p>Jace ran his fingers through his still-damp blond hair and sighed. \u201cWhen are you leaving the resort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday. We have workshops until five and then we\u2019re headed back to Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me buy you lunch,\u201d he said, standing in her path when she took a few steps toward the door. \u201cWe can catch up.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop walking. \u201cJace, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve got a lot going on and am so busy with all this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He laid a hand on her forearm when she tried to move around him, halting her. \u201cI want to hear how you\u2019re doing. How your life has been. What happened after you left.\u201d</p><p>He meant after she\u2019d run away. And what had happened was that her life had fallen completely the fuck apart. Not exactly fun conversation to share over burgers. And not a story she could ever tell him. She shook her head. \u201cI just can\u2019t, Jace. I\u2019m sorry. Thanks again for your help tonight. It was good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he tugged her against him and enveloped her in a bear hug. Her cheek pressed against his solid chest, and the intoxicating scent of male wrapped around her. No, not just male scent, Jace\u2019s scent. A warm, familiar smell that yanked her back through time, back to the last moment she could remember feeling truly content.</p><p>He kissed the crown of her head. \u201cTake care of yourself, Ev. I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out of the embrace, swallowing past the tightness in her throat, and gave him what she hoped was a convincing smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing great, Jace. Just terrific.\u201d Fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>There was a storm behind his green eyes as he stared back at her, but after a moment, he returned her smile and stepped past her to open the door. \u201cGlad to hear it. Now get back to your room before your fianc\u00e9 comes hunting us down in a jealous rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She glanced at Andre, who was watching her and Jace\u2019s exchange intently. \u201cNice to meet you, Andre. Y\u2019all have fun on the rest of your vacation.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand in good-bye and after one last look at Jace, she walked out of the room, holding her breath until she heard the door click shut behind her.</p><p>Jace let the door close and then dropped back onto the couch with a groan.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what was that all about?\u201d Andre asked.</p><p>Jace pressed the heels of his hands to his brow bone to stave off the fierce pounding that had started there. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, not sure what to start with\u2014Dr. Dan\u2019s woman being here at all or the fact that you totally jumped her shit like you had some right to her.\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head. \u201cWe have history. It\u2019s been twelve years, but I know her well enough to see that she\u2019s feeding me a platter of bullshit about being great.\u201d</p><p>Andre stretched his legs out and propped them on the coffee table as if ready to settle in for a great story.</p><p>Too bad this story sucked.</p><p>\u201cShe seemed fine to me. You sure you\u2019re not reading too much into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I watched Evan on that beach. She was sad\u2014and drunk. I didn\u2019t know who she was at that point, but I almost got up to talk to her to make sure she was all right. But then she started taking off her clothes, and well, I got a little distracted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Andre sniffed. \u201cCan\u2019t blame you there. The girl\u2019s smoking. I saw her in the lobby yesterday and definitely conjured up some mental pictures her fianc\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t have appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Jace tilted his head back and stared at the ceiling. \u201cBelieve me, I had the same thoughts down on the beach. I flirted with her and, up until she realized who I was, she was giving me all the positive signs\u2014like she was interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s surprising. She and the doctor are supposed to be some power couple. She stays behind the scenes but he talks about her all the time on his radio show. Their whole image is based on that \u2018we\u2019re the super happy All-American couple, so let us help you be that way, too.\u2019\u201d Andre\u2019s snide tone made it clear how he felt about that sentiment.</p><p>Jace released a frustrated breath and lifted his head. \u201cSee, that\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. If things are going that awesome for her, why was she out there alone at three in the morning looking so lost? And where the hell was her fianc\u00e9? He should be looking out for her. She could\u2019ve drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems pretty tough to me. I doubt she needs anyone watching out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. Evan always needed someone to do that even if she thinks she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not. Twelve years is a long time. People change.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted. \u201cNo one changes that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should let it lie, man. She obviously doesn\u2019t want to reminisce with you and if you push it, you\u2019re going to piss her off and risk her saying something to the doctor. Stay focused on why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Jace stood and stalked over to the mini-fridge to grab a beer. Yes, why he was here. That\u2019s what he needed to concentrate on. Dr. Dan Witter could be the key to dragging Jace\u2019s sales numbers out of the drastic decline they\u2019d been in over the last year. Between the struggling economy and the financial hit he took from his divorce, Jace\u2019s once thriving business was on shaky ground.</p><p>If the good doctor agreed to feature Wicked as the best adult store and website for couples on his sure to be a hit new TV show, Reignite the Flame, Jace could almost guarantee that he\u2019d get enough of a bump in business to stabilize his current location and expand the chain.</p><p>It was make it or break it time, and make it was the only option he\u2019d consider. He would rather die than admit to his parents that he\u2019d fucked up yet again, that he\u2019d made the wrong decision walking away from his lucrative financial planning job to pursue his passion.</p><p>He tipped back the beer and took a long swallow. He just needed to steer clear of Evan. That\u2019s what he should\u2019ve done when he was nineteen and that\u2019s what he needed to do now. He wasn\u2019t the guy looking out for her anymore. If there were things amiss in her life, it was none of his business. And even if he had wanted to make it his business, she\u2019d certainly made it clear she had no intention of talking to him about it.</p> <p>He turned back to Andre. \u201cYou\u2019re right. No use dredging up the past with her anyway. I just wanted to make sure she was doing okay, and I guess she is.\u201d</p><p>Andre sat forward, setting his feet back on the floor. \u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you two anyway? How do you know her? Old flame?\u201d</p><p>Jace leaned against the wall, feeling his lack of sleep. He didn\u2019t want to talk about this right now\u2014or ever really\u2014but he knew Andre would put on his police interrogator hat if he tried to brush him off. Jace drained the last of his beer. \u201cShe lived with my family for a little over a year when I was in college. She was sixteen the last time I saw her. My parents fostered her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at sixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ran away. Without a goddamned trace.\u201d He tossed his bottle in the trash can. \u201cSeeing her again is like seeing a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s forehead wrinkled. \u201cSo you were her foster brother? Man, the way she was looking at you, I would\u2019ve bet money that you two had something more than that between you.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s stomach knotted\u2014the word brother stirring the old guilt into a maelstrom. His gaze shifted to the sliding glass doors and the darkened beach beyond. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not done with the story yet.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p> <p>\u201cSweets, you okay in there?\u201d Daniel tapped on her door. \u201cWe missed you at the meeting this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d Evan twisted her arm behind her, trying to reach the zipper on the back of her sundress. She\u2019d slept through her alarm and had woken up right when she was supposed to be in the middle of a breakfast meeting with Daniel and a potential vendor. Not good.</p><p>After one more yoga-like move, she gave up and yanked open the door, finding Daniel leaning against the wall in the hallway, tapping out a text message and looking like an Armani model in his perfectly tailored slacks and dress shirt.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me with this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Daniel looked up from his phone, then pushed off the wall. \u201cOh, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She turned around and waited for him to zip up the dress. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning. I must\u2019ve slept through the alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was going to wake you, but you were dead to the world when I peeked in. Guess we all need a lazy morning every now and then, right?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a pointed glare over her shoulder, then turned and breezed past him into the suite\u2019s living area.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his tone innocent. \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Marcus, Daniel\u2019s business manager and boyfriend, looked up from his USA Today as she sank onto the couch across from him. He smirked. \u201cHey you, rough night?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Yes-Please-Oh-God-Just-Like-That, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Marcus gave her a sheepish grin. \u201cOh, you heard that?\u201d</p><p>She threw a pillow at him, and he ducked behind his newspaper.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are killing me. I know you\u2019re happy and in love and apparently rock each other\u2019s world, but take pity on the girl in the other room who doesn\u2019t have some sexy man heating up her sheets.\u201d</p><p>Daniel sat next to her and put his arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweets. We drank a little too much celebrating the TV deal and got carried away. We didn\u2019t mean to keep you awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut look.\u201d Marcus lifted a steaming cup from the side table. \u201cI went out and got your favorite fancy coffee for you. Does that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarginally.\u201d She sighed and let her head rest against Daniel\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIs everything else okay?\u201d Daniel asked. \u201cYou never miss a meeting, even if you didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Daniel rubbed her bare arm and looked down at her, his all-knowing brown eyes evaluating her. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all? You know if that new medication isn\u2019t working, I can talk to Dr. Barnes about getting you something different.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great, here we go. Daniel had been her best friend for too long, and paired with his psych degree, he was a formidable force at poking past her shields. \u201cI don\u2019t need a different medication.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want any medication, for that matter. She\u2019d weaned herself off those horrid antidepressants three months earlier. But she hadn\u2019t quite told Daniel that part yet. She\u2019d planned to first prove how well she was doing off them before breaking the news to Mr. Overprotective. Unfortunately, her behavior last night wasn\u2019t exactly a billboard advertisement for mental stability.</p><p>\u201cWe saw the empty tequila bottles,\u201d Marcus added, his tone gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you to drink like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. Would you two just stop?\u201d She shrugged from beneath Daniel\u2019s grasp with a huff and rose from the couch, grabbing her coffee from Marcus on the way up. \u201cSeriously, guys, I\u2019m not in the mood for Freud and his trusty sidekick. I couldn\u2019t sleep and listening to you guys had me all keyed up. So I had a few drinks and took a walk on the beach in lieu of a cold shower. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the glass doors that led to the balcony and stared out at the beach. The stretch of sand that had been so deserted just a few hours earlier was now filled with families and children, happily playing in the surf. She pressed her fingers against the glass, feeling so far removed from that world that the glass may as well have been made of impenetrable steel.</p><p>\u201cAh, the truth reveals itself,\u201d Marcus said from behind her, his tone playful. \u201cThat ridiculous vow of celibacy is finally getting to you, isn\u2019t it? I told you it was unnatural.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. Blatantly.</p><p>\u201cIs that it, Evan?\u201d Daniel asked. \u201cAre you lonely? I know things have been crazy with this seminar tour and we haven\u2019t been able to spend as much down time together.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn around, just spoke to her own reflection in the window. \u201cHow can I be lonely? I\u2019m always with two men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Daniel agreed. \u201cWe both love you and are so happy you\u2019re with us, but maybe you need to think about finding some physical outlet. It would be good for you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and turned around. \u201cYou want me to get a lover?\u201d</p><p>Daniel frowned, his dark eyebrows dipping low. \u201cYou know you have that option. When we agreed to this arrangement, I never intended for you to give up sex. That\u2019s been your choice.\u201d</p><p>The arrangement. She guessed that was what they were calling it now. Daniel had saved her life and her sanity when they were on the streets. She owed him everything. And she\u2019d never had someone she could count on so wholeheartedly in her life. So she\u2019d readily agreed to do whatever it took to help him with his crazy business idea. But she hadn\u2019t known at the time she\u2019d been signing up to live a lie.</p><p>The first radio station manager who\u2019d considered Daniel for a job had told him he couldn\u2019t put Daniel on the air as a relationship guru if he was openly gay. He said\u2014right or wrong\u2014there was no way people in Fort Worth were going to take marriage advice from someone who couldn\u2019t even legally marry.</p><p>Evan had wanted to flip off the whole system and move to someplace more open-minded like Austin or maybe even California. But they hadn\u2019t had the money to do that then, and Daniel had been so desperate for a break that he\u2019d come up with the arrangement.</p><p>Most of the time she was perfectly content with the decision. She\u2019d never had so much stability in her life. And she was with a man she loved and could trust\u2014even if she would never sleep with him.</p><p>Or anyone the way things were going.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s not exactly tempting to go jump in bed with some guy who\u2019s totally cool with me cheating on my fianc\u00e9.\u201d Evan shuddered. \u201cThe kind of sleaze ball who would be okay with that kind of thing is not someone I\u2019d want to get horizontal with.\u201d</p><p>Daniel sighed. \u201cI know it\u2019s not ideal, but you have to work with us here. I can\u2019t risk you telling someone the truth. The minute the relationship goes wrong, the guy could blow the whole thing open. Then, all three of us are screwed.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI get it, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? It seems like over the last few months you\u2019ve lost sight of why you agreed to do this in the first place. Don\u2019t forget what it was like before all this, Evan. What it could be like again if we\u2019re not smart.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. Forget? Yeah, right. She\u2019d love to fucking forget. But being on the streets and not knowing if you\u2019d eat from day to day wasn\u2019t something that easily left the memory. \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole. Believe me, I know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s expression softened. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. It\u2019s just, we\u2019ve done all this work and now it\u2019s really happening\u2014national TV. I want you to be happy. Just think, a few more years and you\u2019ll never have to worry about money again. Then, if you want to walk away and do the traditional marriage and kids thing, you\u2019ll still be able to do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Her chest tightened, an invisible band squeezing out all of her air. No, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever be able to do that. Especially the kid part. But she\u2019d never tell Daniel that. She sipped her coffee and turned back to the window. \u201cI\u2019m fine, okay? I think I\u2019m just tired of being on the road. Let\u2019s drop the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You know you can talk to us about anything,\u201d Marcus added.</p> <p>\u201cThen talk to me about today\u2019s agenda,\u201d she said, desperate to redirect the conversation. \u201cIsn\u2019t the first workshop about sex toys?\u201d</p><p>Daniel snorted. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not exactly how we labeled it, but yeah, it\u2019s for couples who are looking to spice up their sex lives. The guy we met with this morning is leading it. Should be a fun workshop if the couples can relax a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m only going so I can stare at the speaker,\u201d Marcus said, the sound of him folding his newspaper half drowning him out. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame that beautiful man is straight. Even if he hadn\u2019t presented such a great proposal, I would\u2019ve given him our business.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019ll put in an order for a few toys for myself. Get myself a new battery-operated lover and solve all our problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no sleeping alone tonight,\u201d Daniel said, coming up behind her and wrapping his arms around her waist. \u201cYou can share our bed. We promise to behave.\u201d</p> <p>She turned around in his arms, taking care not to spill her coffee on him, and smirked. \u201cThanks, that\u2019s sweet, but last time we did that, Marcus snored like a chainsaw the whole night.\u201d</p><p>A loud scoff came from behind Daniel. \u201cI did no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Daniel chuckled and pressed his forehead against hers. \u201cWe\u2019re here for you, sweets. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cAnd all we need to do is roll him on his side after he nods off to shut him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Marcus called.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI do love you guys, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at ya, buttercup.\u201d He lifted his head and grinned. \u201cNow let\u2019s go learn how to spice up our sex lives and try to keep Marcus from ogling our guest speaker.\u201d</p> <p>Evan fiddled with the wire on the PowerPoint projector and cursed the damned machine under her breath for a second time. A few couples had already drifted into the meeting room, and she knew the speaker would be right behind them. Usually, she was pretty good at the technical stuff and had been successfully setting up the meeting equipment for all the workshops this weekend, but her pounding headache and lack of sleep had pureed her brain.</p><p>Plus, she\u2019d discovered that the hotel\u2019s wiring was a bit temperamental, so she didn\u2019t want to overload the circuit again. Yesterday she\u2019d nearly plunged the windowless room into darkness when she\u2019d plugged the computer and the projector into the same power strip. For a few seconds the room had looked like a nightclub with all the blinking lights.</p><p>She kneeled down and scooted under the table to check that the surge protector was plugged in, making sure not to flash her backside to the audience while doing so. She never wore dresses to these things because she inevitably ended up doing dirty work of some sort, but the welts on her thigh were still too tender to have pants rubbing against them.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help with that?\u201d</p><p>The sound of the familiar voice had her jolting upward, and she banged her head against the table\u2019s underside. \u201cSon of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d Jace said, squatting down and peeking at her. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you. You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She rubbed her head and took his offered hand so she could climb out from under the table, wondering for a second if she\u2019d actually knocked herself out and was only imagining him here. Imagining him looking this dazzling in crisp black slacks and a polo shirt that perfectly matched his green eyes.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDo I need to render first aid again?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, still a bit dazed, although she was sure the lightheadedness had nothing to do with hitting her head. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left before we had a chance to chat last night.\u201d He crooked his thumb at the projector. \u201cI\u2019m today\u2019s speaker.\u201d</p><p>The words took a moment to line up in her head. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>He reached into his back pocket, pulled out his wallet, and handed over a business card. \u201cJace Austin at your service. Owner of Wicked which, as of this morning, is the recommended adult boutique and website for Dr. Dan\u2019s loyal fans.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stepped up behind Jace and clapped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cJace, I see you\u2019ve met my lovely fianc\u00e9e. Evan was so disappointed that she missed our meeting earlier. Something came up that she had to take care of.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s gaze met hers. \u201cNo worries. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a very busy lady. I\u2019m just happy that the both of you are staying on for the workshop today. Hopefully, I don\u2019t disappoint.\u201d</p><p>Daniel smiled. \u201cAh, I don\u2019t doubt you\u2019ll do great. Just be aware that some of these couples haven\u2019t so much as touched each other in months, sometimes years. So, they may need to be eased into the topic in order to feel comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. My plan is to have them do some non-threatening, sensate exercises with each other, make it fun and just a little sexy. Then hopefully they\u2019ll be relaxed enough to ask questions after that.\u201d</p><p>Daniel nodded. \u201cSounds good. I really want it to be a safe place for them to have an open dialogue. Plus, I want to normalize some of your products so that they feel comfortable to explore. I think beyond the emotional issues, a lot of couples just get bored with their routine in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we definitely have a lot of things to alleviate that last problem.\u201d Jace smiled as he looked at her, then back to Daniel. \u201cHey, would you and Evan want to participate in the couples\u2019 activity? It may help the group feel more comfortable if they see you guys are willing to do it as well.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s gaze drifted to Evan, and she gave a slight shake of the head. He tucked his hands in his pockets, a mischievous glint flickering behind his brown eyes. \u201cActually, I\u2019m going to be in and out. I have a conference call I have to take in the middle of it, but Evan can help you out. You can do the activity with her.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her jaw so it wouldn\u2019t drop open and sent Daniel a what-the-hell-are-you-doing look. \u201cDaniel, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to put anyone in an awkward position,\u201d Jace said, his eyes shifting toward Evan, his own discomfort evident. \u201cI don\u2019t mind managing on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cEvan will be glad to help, won\u2019t you, sweets?\u201d</p><p>She pasted on a smile and vowed to kick Daniel\u2019s ass later. \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d</p><p>He probably thought he was doing her a favor\u2014letting her have a little fun with a hot guy, but he had no idea how hard it was for her to even stand next to Jace without stirring up an old ache she\u2019d rather keep dormant.</p><p>Jace eyed her in that way he\u2019d done the night before, like he wasn\u2019t buying her bullshit, but his tone was bright when he spoke. \u201cGreat. We\u2019ll get started in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Evan was ready to slip out the back door and bail on the whole thing. After introductions and a general overview of what he hoped to accomplish in the workshop, Jace had instructed the couples to ditch their chairs and get comfortable on the floor. The attendees were murmuring among themselves as everyone got settled\u2014a little edge of anxiety zipping through the group.</p><p>Jace had assured them that these would all be simple exercises, but as he handed out gift bags that contained a number of sexy items\u2014blindfolds, feathers, scarves\u2014the mellow energy of the room had shifted into nervous anticipation.</p><p>Jace finished distributing the bags and circled back to the front of the room where she sat on the edge of the stage, bumping her knee up and down in time with her out-of-control heartbeat. He gave her a wary smile before hopping up on the stage and turning toward the audience.</p><p>\u201cAll right, guys and dolls, the lovely Ms. Kennedy has agreed to be my willing victim to demonstrate the exercise, so I\u2019d like to thank her for her bravery. And hopefully we won\u2019t make the good doctor too jealous.\u201d Jace winked in Daniel\u2019s direction and the audience laughed.</p><p>Jace put out his hand and helped Evan to her feet. \u201cNow since Evan\u2019s up here on stage and has a dress on, I\u2019m going to have her sit in a chair for this, but for everyone else, I want one person lying on the ground and their partner sitting next to them. So first I need each couple to decide who is going to be leading the exercise and who is going to be the recipient.\u201d</p><p>The crowd began to hum with conversation again as each couple decided who would play what role. Jace turned to her and lowered his voice. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay with this? I know your fianc\u00e9 over there kind of threw you to the wolves\u2014or me, in this case. If it\u2019s weird that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, probably a bit too emphatically, then shrugged in an attempt to appear casual. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, Jace. I can handle a blindfold and a feather.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, an unreadable expression crossing his face. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He left her alone for a moment, giving her a chance to catch her breath, and headed to the far side of the stage. The lights dimmed slightly and for a moment she thought they\u2019d tripped the circuit again, but then soft music started playing and she realized Jace was setting a relaxing mood for the group.</p><p>When he returned to her, he had a chair in tow. She sat down and faced the very attentive audience. Her tongue darted out to wet her lips as a paradoxical combination of dread and anticipation came over her.</p><p>Jace circled her chair and braced his hands on the back of it, his knuckles grazing her bare shoulders. \u201cAll right, everyone, the first thing we\u2019re going to do is establish a safe word. This is something that\u2019s typically used in more serious sexual play, but I think it\u2019s useful in this context as well. If your partner does anything that you are not comfortable with, you say \u2018red\u2019 and everything will stop. Understand?\u201d</p><p>The audience members bobbed their heads, and Evan resisted the urge to bite her nails.</p><p>\u201cThis is all about establishing trust with your partner. Once you feel safe with him or her, you\u2019ll find you\u2019re able to let go and have more fun in the bedroom. So, let\u2019s get started by taking out your blindfolds.\u201d Jace bent and grabbed the little black mask from the bag next to her chair. \u201cYou want your mate to focus on the sensation of your touch, not everything else going on around them. So slip this over his or her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jace touched her shoulder, and Evan nearly jumped out of the chair.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Ev. I\u2019m just going to put this on you.\u201d He walked around the front of her chair, blocking out her view of the audience, and leaned toward her. His hulking presence hovering over her should\u2019ve made her more nervous, but it somehow eased her hopping nerves instead. Their eyes met for a moment, and she thought she saw worry flickering in his. But before she could examine his expression further, he slid the black material over her eyes and blotted out the view.</p><p>She took a deep breath, the loss of vision disconcerting her. Darkness was not her thing. She gripped the arms of the chair and strained her ears to get an idea of where Jace was moving. As if sensing her need, Jace laid a hand on her shoulder and squeezed, grounding her. The tightening muscles in her body loosened.</p><p>His voice was soothing when he spoke again. \u201cNow, the only rule is that you can\u2019t touch the person anywhere overtly sexual\u2014arms, legs, head, and face are all in play. Start with soft, easy touches above the neck. Like this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Jace\u2019s hand left her shoulder and soon gentle fingertips threaded in her hair and moved in a circular motion against her scalp. A hard shudder of pleasure went through her, and she had to work hard to hold in a sigh.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to use your hands or the feather we provided. The person receiving the touch shouldn\u2019t speak unless it\u2019s to use the safe word.\u201d</p> <p>Evan could hear the shuffling in the room as people adjusted and started the exercise, but all her focus remained on the lovely pressure of Jace\u2019s fingers against her skull.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she murmured low enough so no one but Jace would hear. \u201cYou missed your calling as a salon shampoo girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could speak,\u201d he said, his voice low, commanding.</p><p>The authority in his tone sent an odd zing through her. Whoa. She shifted in her seat, feeling warmer than she had a second before. She nodded, not sure if an apology would break the no-speaking rule as well.</p><p>His fingers halted as if he\u2019d been surprised by something. Breath tickled her ear. \u201cSorry, Ev. That just slipped out. You can talk if you want.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll follow the rules you set for the activity. I can take direction.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if the noise he made was an under-the-breath groan or a grunt of approval, but he returned to the exercise. His fingertips slid down the side of her neck and marked a whisper-light path across her throat that had her holding her breath and squeezing her eyes shut beneath the blindfold. Without consciously deciding to do so, she tilted her head back, giving him better access.</p><p>He traced over the line of her collarbone, ever so softly, but so damn effective. It was as if each brush of skin pressed a button on her circuit board, lighting up places that had long gone dim. Delicate threads of warmth traveled down from the press of his fingers to the curve of her breasts, settling right into her quickly hardening nipples.</p><p>Dark thoughts of Jace moving his hands lower, slipping beneath the neckline of her dress and cupping her breasts in front of all these people had liquid heat gathering between her thighs. His touch would be firm, confident. He wouldn\u2019t even care that others were watching. He\u2019d just touch her however he pleased. And she\u2019d let him.</p><p>She bit her lip. Stop. This is Jace.</p><p>She crossed her legs more tightly together.</p> <p>Even if she could forgive him for how he\u2019d treated her all those years ago, she definitely could never risk being around him again. Not as a friend, and certainly not as anything more. When he\u2019d pushed her away, her entire existence had folded in on itself. Not before or since had she ever fallen for anyone that hard\u2014let a person\u2019s place in her world define if life was worth living or not. It had been stupid. And dangerous. She\u2019d spiraled into the pit of her depression so fast, she\u2019d gotten whiplash.</p><p>She knew she wasn\u2019t that bad off anymore. She had taken steps to work with those damaged parts of her makeup. But she also knew Jace being near was like setting heroin in front of a recovering addict. She needed to run in the other direction.</p><p>Now if she could just convince her hormones of that.</p><p>Jace\u2019s voice broke through the quiet of the room. \u201cIf you feel comfortable doing so, you can use the silk scarf to bind your partner\u2019s hands above their head, so they can experience letting go of even more control. Then, you can move to touching the lower half. Keep the touch light and easy.\u201d</p><p>Evan could see a bit of movement through the shadow of the mask, and a warm hand grasped her wrist. \u201cEvan, sit up straighter. I\u2019m going to bind your hands behind the chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, si\u2014 I mean, sure.\u201d</p><p>Sir? Where the hell had that come from? It\u2019d slipped off her tongue like it was the most natural thing in the world to call him. Must\u2019ve been that authoritative tone he kept using with her. Man, she needed more sleep. She was getting loopy.</p><p>Jace made quick work of securing her hands behind the chair. The binding was loose, but the effect potent nonetheless. Her heartbeat picked up speed. She\u2019d never considered herself a control freak, but she\u2019d also learned very early on not to trust anyone but herself. She wet her lips, reminding herself that they were in front of an audience. That this was completely harmless.</p> <p>A warm palm ran along the back of her calf as Jace lifted her leg from the crossed position and set her foot on the floor. Goose bumps prickled her skin. Okay, maybe not completely harmless. Her libido was under a full-frontal assault.</p><p>She could picture him there, kneeling in front of her, knowing he could do whatever he wanted because her hands were tied. He could nudge her knees apart, slide her dress up her thighs, and run his tongue along the outside of her already damp panties. She sucked in a ragged breath. Shit. She needed to stop the fantasy reel before she started panting.</p><p>A new vibrator was definitely coming home with her tonight. Depriving herself this long had her on the verge of doing something stupid, like whispering to Jace to meet her in the maid\u2019s closet after the workshop.</p><p>And making that kind of mistake would ruin everything she\u2019d worked for.</p><p>Not. An. Option.</p><p>Jace was going to fucking lose it. He hadn\u2019t planned for this exercise to go on very long, but there was no way he could turn around and face the audience at the moment. Evan\u2019s lightning-quick physical responses and eagerness to follow instruction had his cock swelling painfully against the zipper of his dress pants.</p><p>She\u2019d almost called him sir for the love of God. What was she trying to do? Kill him?</p><p>He\u2019d known immediately that doing this exercise with her would be tough, but he thought it\u2019d be because of the old guilt of knowing what had happened the last time he\u2019d really touched her. But hell, he couldn\u2019t even spell the word guilt if he tried at the moment.</p><p>All he could think about was how tempting those hard little nipples looked pressed up against the pale blue cotton of her dress. How silky the skin of her legs felt against his hands as he slowly drew his fingers up and down her calves. And how fucking hot she looked blindfolded and bound for him.</p><p>No. Not for him. She was someone else\u2019s. He needed to keep that at the forefront of his mind. Shit. He closed his eyes and tried to block out what was happening\u2014focus on something else. War. Sick puppies. Female bodybuilders. Anything that would get the blood flowing back to his brain and out of his throbbing dick.</p><p>Because he could not tread in this territory. This was Evangeline\u2014not some chick he could haul off to his hotel room, fuck, and leave. And beyond that, he didn\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s women\u2014not without permission. He\u2019d been on the receiving end of that equation before and refused to inflict that on someone else.</p><p>He moved his hands to her knees, hoping those wouldn\u2019t be as tempting as the soft flesh on her legs. But when he grasped them, he felt the little give of her thighs, the slight parting, and he had to bite back a deep groan.</p><p>He tried to picture Evan the very first time he\u2019d met her when she was all bones and wide eyes\u2014eyes way too jaded for a fifteen-year-old. But the image wouldn\u2019t appear. All he could think about was the gorgeous woman who sat before him. A woman who probably hated him, who couldn\u2019t even bear to have lunch with him.</p><p>He swallowed hard and, using his thumbs, drew tiny circles on the sides of her knees. Counting the rotations as he went, praying it would refocus him. Evan adjusted in her seat a bit and her knees parted enough for him to glimpse the lacey white panties underneath. And holy shit\u2014the view was only half the torture. The sweet, hot scent of female arousal wrapped around Jace like a fist.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath, and his grip tightened on her. Get up, moron! End the exercise. But instead of listening to the shouting voice of reason in his head, he found his hands inching higher, brushing the tops and insides of her lower thighs, careful not to hit the jellyfish stings. Her legs quivered beneath his touch.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d The words were so quiet, so full of . . . need, he\u2019d thought for a minute he\u2019d only imagined he\u2019d heard them. But when he looked at her face and the way her teeth were biting into her full bottom lip, he knew she\u2019d said them.</p><p>Every nerve in his body seemed to electrify. Christ.</p><p>However, before he could figure out how to respond, the lights flickered and blinked out, blanketing the room in darkness. A few sounds of surprise came from the audience behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Evan asked, stiffening beneath his touch, her voice higher than normal.</p><p>Before Jace could answer her, Dr. Dan\u2019s voice rang out through the pitch-black space. \u201cJust stay put, everybody. Nothing to worry about. I\u2019ll go tell them to flip the circuit breaker, and we\u2019ll be up and running again in a minute. Relax and stay where you are for now. Don\u2019t want anyone tripping over anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Jace started to pull away from Evan, but the sound of her quickening breath gave him pause. \u201cYou okay, Ev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see enough to untie me? I . . . It\u2019s hot in here, and I\u2019m feeling kind of . . . claustrophobic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, no problem.\u201d He hopped to his feet, thankful for the lack of light. Otherwise the audience would see just how effective the exercise had been for him. Reigniting the flame was an understatement; he could set off a fucking forest fire right now.</p><p>Carefully, he moved around the back of the chair and felt around until he found her wrists. He hadn\u2019t tied her tightly, so it only took a second to loosen the bindings. Once she was freed, he heard her rustling around\u2014probably taking off the blindfold. He wondered if Evan still had a fear of the dark like she\u2019d had when she was a teenager. His fingers flexed, wanting to reach out and touch her again, make sure she was okay, but he held back.</p><p>\u201cEv, stay in the chair, okay? I don\u2019t want you to fall off the stage.\u201d</p><p>No response came.</p><p>A few seconds later, the bank of overhead lights flickered back on, and he shielded his eyes from the sudden brightness. He blinked, letting his vision adjust, and found the chair in front of him empty. He looked around the room.</p><p>The back exit door was clicking shut, and Evan was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Awesome. He\u2019d stepped over the line again, and she\u2019d done exactly what she\u2019d done the last time.</p><p>Bailed.</p><p>God, he was a jackass.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Evan\u2019s muscles ached as she unlocked the front door of her photography studio and went inside. She\u2019d planned to come in earlier to get things in order for re-opening next week. But after the restless night she\u2019d had, she\u2019d decided to go to the gym first for Janice the Evil\u2019s advanced spinning class, hoping the punishing workout would beat her agitation into submission. No such luck. She\u2019d almost puked thirty minutes in and now she just had embarrassment and a sore ass to add to the restlessness.</p><p>God, if she could just get some sleep, maybe she could get herself back on track. Since they\u2019d returned from South Padre, she\u2019d tossed and turned every night, her mind racing and her body craving things she couldn\u2019t have. It was as if seeing Jace again had knocked her whole system out of alignment.</p><p>Ugh. She dropped her bag and sank into her desk chair. What was the deal? She was the freaking master of blocking things out, of centering herself and focusing on the tasks at hand. But now she just felt . . . scattered. And all the things that usually kept her calm and content weren\u2019t doing a damn thing.</p><p>Part of it could still be her body adjusting to being off the medication, but there was no way she was going back to those pills. After so many years on them, she hadn\u2019t even noticed when the healing effects had switched from therapeutic to numbing. Until one day a few months ago when she\u2019d seen her neighbor\u2019s sweet little dog dart across the street during her morning run and get hit by a car. The whole thing had happened in the space of seconds, and her neighbor had immediately rushed to the injured dog\u2019s side. But as Evan had stood there on the curb watching the horrible scene, she\u2019d realized that all the things she should be feeling\u2014sympathy, concern, sadness\u2014were just . . . absent. Like her heart had gone hollow inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>That night she\u2019d vowed to work her way off her prescription. She didn\u2019t want or need that crutch anymore. At one time her depression had been dangerous, but she was no longer that girl, and she had no intention of living the rest of her life on deep freeze. But the change hadn\u2019t come without consequences. Her whole system now seemed to be on the fritz.</p><p>So she was down to her last resort\u2014the one outlet that had never let her down. Her photography. Maybe if she threw herself into her work, she\u2019d find her way back to the stable existence she\u2019d created before Jace\u2019s reappearance had knocked her off balance.</p> <p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d</p><p>Evan yelped and nearly toppled off her chair. She glanced to the back of the studio where her part-time intern had stuck his shaggy head out from the storage room.</p><p>Finn grimaced. \u201cSorry, I thought you knew I was here. Didn\u2019t you see my motorcycle parked out front?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand to her chest, her heart pounding beneath her palm. How had she not even noticed his bike? She really was in a freaking daze. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClasses are out this week and I\u2019m not scheduled at the restaurant until late, so I thought I\u2019d come in and help you get things ready to go for Monday. Plus I wanted to experiment with a technique for a still life project I have coming up. I should\u2019ve asked first, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry. You just startled me. I\u2019m a bit of a space cadet today. No sleep.\u201d</p><p>He locked the storage area behind him and gave her a mock pout. \u201cPoor thing. Traveling the country with your totally tasty fianc\u00e9. Must be a real hardship. I could take over for you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThough you are prettier than me, Daniel\u2019s too old for you. You\u2019re what? Twenty-two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three.\u201d He smirked and tucked his inky black hair behind his ears. \u201cAnd age I can work with. But that whole him being straight thing might get in the way.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. If Finn only knew how wrong he was on that one. \u201cSo how\u2019d the Allen shoot go last week?\u201d</p><p>Even though she\u2019d shut the studio down for the most part while she was out, she had let Finn take on a few simple jobs to get in some practice. He\u2019d been with her six months and had proven to be more than reliable despite the fact that he was balancing community college classes and a waiter gig along with his internship. The eager desire to learn reminded her of how she\u2019d been when she\u2019d first discovered photography. And his talent behind the camera was so innate that she had full trust that her clients would be happy\u2014especially with the intern discount she\u2019d given them. She was already feeling awful that she\u2019d have to let him go when she, Daniel, and Marcus moved to L.A. in a few months.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was cake. Just a couple of business headshots. She didn\u2019t want anything too\u201d\u2014he did air quotes\u2014\u201cout there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so nothing fun. She wouldn\u2019t even do outdoor shots. I gave her what she wanted\u2014boring pictures in front of a bookcase.\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cA little part of my creative genius died on the inside.\u201d</p><p>He stepped to the file cabinet behind her desk and pulled out a folder. He tossed copies of the black-and- white proofs on her desk.</p><p>She picked them up and scanned through them. Even with the ho-hum background, Finn had captured the spark in the elderly executive\u2019s eyes and her take-no-shit smile. \u201cThese look great\u2014excellent lighting. You made her look a decade younger.\u201d She handed the sheets back to him. \u201cI appreciate you accommodating her wishes. Hopefully we can get something more fun for you to shoot next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re back so we can start booking some bigger stuff again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She choked down the little pang of sadness that hit her at the thought of only having a few months left in this studio. Yes, she planned to get something new set up in California, but nothing would ever be like this little place.</p><p>It was located in what her real estate agent had called a \u201ctransitional neighborhood\u201d when she\u2019d first leased it. Evan had learned that this basically meant the little cluster of historic buildings was starting to be restored and inhabited by an eclectic blend of artists and other start-up business owners. But it also meant that if you hung around the area too late at night, your chances of getting mugged were pretty solid.</p> <p>Finn shut the file cabinet and crooked a thumb at the door. \u201cHey, I was just about to go pick up a sandwich. You want me to grab you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Roast beef sounds good. Might as well completely negate my spinning session from this morning.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGot it. Be back in a little while.\u201d</p><p>After Finn headed out, she booted up her computer and checked the list of messages he\u2019d stacked on her desk, grimacing a bit at the painfully low number of inquiries that had come in while she\u2019d been out. Even with Finn covering the occasional headshot and family photo session, the workshop tour and her absence had delivered a serious blow to her business.</p><p>This kind of business was based on word of mouth and being available right when someone needed you. People planning weddings, children\u2019s portraits, and senior high school pictures weren\u2019t going to wait around for a photographer to call them back. They would just call the next one on the list. She\u2019d once had a steady business building and now it was dying a slow death.</p><p>Well, no more. She refused to let her involvement with Daniel\u2019s business hamper her own dream any further. She\u2019d work as much as she could these next few months before closing the doors here, but she also would dedicate herself to building contacts in California. Los Angeles was going to be a nightmare to have a start-up\u2014a place where everyone needed headshots but no one wanted to work with an unknown. She\u2019d have to be dogged in her pursuit of business once she got a location up and running out there. Because giving up her photography was not an option no matter how successful Daniel became.</p><p>She was thrilled with everything he was accomplishing and the money it was bringing in for all of them, but that didn\u2019t fulfill her like getting behind the camera did. There was something about capturing a person\u2019s emotions on film that spoke to the deepest part of her. She had accepted that she probably wouldn\u2019t get a chance to marry her soul mate or show off a new baby to the world. Hell, she hadn\u2019t even had a high school graduation, just a GED sent in the mail. But somehow, documenting other people\u2019s happy milestones helped fill the space inside her where she should\u2019ve been storing her own. And it was time to start filling it again.</p><p>She picked up her phone to return the first call, but the bells on the studio\u2019s front door jangled, halting Evan from her task. She looked up from her desk with a frustrated huff to find her friend Callie sweeping through the door, her mass of blonde curls staging a riot against the clip fastened at the back of her head. Callie pushed the offending locks from her face and beamed at Evan. \u201cYou\u2019re here! I thought you weren\u2019t coming back to work until Monday. I was just about to call you to wish you a happy early birthday when I saw your car parked out front.\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled as she hung up the phone and stood. Callie dropped her overstuffed purse to the floor and rushed toward her to give her a hug. Evan laughed while the taller woman squeezed her for dear life.</p><p>\u201cWow, I . . . uh . . . missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought Daniel was going to keep you all to himself this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just stopped in for a few minutes to return some calls before I reopen next week.\u201d</p><p>Callie finally released her and put her hands on her hips. \u201cFor the record, you are not allowed to take this much time off ever again. I swear if I have to have one more lunch with Flower Shop Trisha, I\u2019m going to keel over. She\u2019s so prim and proper, I feel like I\u2019m having soup with the queen or something. I know she\u2019s probably lighting candles for me at church after some of the stuff I\u2019ve slipped up and told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell your immortal soul could probably use all the help it can get.\u201d</p><p>Callie plopped into the chair in front of Evan\u2019s desk. \u201cAmen, sister. Though I just finished a weeklong cayenne and lemon juice detox. The way it\u2019s been going, I think even my soul is cleansed.\u201d</p><p>Evan snorted. \u201cWhy on earth are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>Beyond the fact that Callie bashed diets regularly for cutting into her profits at her bakery across the street, she\u2019d always seemed comfortable with her curves.</p><p>Her grin turned sly. \u201cWell, a lot has happened since you went gallivanting around the country with that man of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Do tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a new boyfriend,\u201d she said in a singsong voice. \u201cA new, devastatingly handsome, completely wonderful boyfriend. Even Finn gave him the thumbs-up in the looks department, and you know how picky that kid is. So I don\u2019t want to look like a dumpling next to him when we go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up. A new boyfriend? Cal, I talked to you at least once a week. You didn\u2019t even mention you were seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to jinx it,\u201d Callie said, crossing her arms with a huff. \u201cEvery time I tell you about how great some guy I\u2019m seeing is, I find out the next week that he has some catastrophic flaw\u2014like he has an addiction to hookers or is a diabetic and can\u2019t eat cake. You\u2019re bad luck.\u201d</p><p>Evan shook her head, amused. Her friend did have abysmal luck when it came to men, but somehow she doubted it had anything to do with a jinx. Cal had a tendency of falling fast and asking questions later. Evan had learned that warning her to slow down was like talking to a coffee table. And hell, who was she to give relationship advice? She was marrying her gay best friend.</p><p>She leaned forward and placed her chin on her hands. \u201cAll right, so dish. Who is he? What\u2019s he do? And, more important, does he like baked goods?\u201d</p><p>Callie sat up straighter, obviously bubbling over after holding back the secret so long. \u201cHis name is Brandon. He\u2019s a nurse over at the cancer center. And he\u2019s a total slut for chocolate cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d she said, her eyes getting a little starry. \u201cHe\u2019s picking me up for my end-of-diet lunch. I texted him to meet me over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved the photos you have hanging in the shop, by the way. Said you knew how to make a piece of pie look downright seductive.\u201d</p><p>Evan laughed. \u201cMy claim to fame\u2014sexy cherry pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, pointing at her, \u201cdon\u2019t underestimate yourself. I sell more of the products you photographed than any others. Seriously, you have a gift of making things look irresistible on film.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s stomach clenched a bit with that last part. A gift. Yes, once upon a time she\u2019d made someone a whole lot of money with that innate talent. She rubbed her arms through her sleeves, trying to fight off the creeping chill that always came with those horrid memories.</p><p>\u201cHey now, there\u2019s an idea,\u201d Callie said, completely oblivious to Evan\u2019s sudden discomfort.</p><p>She took a deep breath and tried to refocus on the conversation. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get you to take pictures of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Evan\u2019s eyebrows knitted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d Callie waved her off. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve been trying to come up with something to get Brandon for his birthday, and I bet he would totally be into some sexy boudoir-style pics. We haven\u2019t, ya know, done the deed yet, so maybe that would get the ball rolling. He\u2019s that gentlemanly type and his slow approach is kind of driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Evan frowned. \u201cMaybe slow isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cPfft! I\u2019m not getting any younger. No use burning daylight. So do you think you could make me look as sexy as that cherry pie?\u201d</p><p>Evan pinched the bridge of her nose, Callie\u2019s question only bringing the past farther to the front of her mind\u2014the haunted eyes of the women who\u2019d posed before her camera. The sick feeling that came along with knowing you were sacrificing someone else\u2019s dignity to save your own ass. \u201cI don\u2019t really do that style of picture, Cal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, come on. Don\u2019t be a prude.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s just, are you really going to trust a guy you just started dating with half-naked pictures of yourself? What happens when\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up a finger. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t finish that sentence. I\u2019m doing that whole putting positive energy into the universe thing. I\u2019m not even considering that this guy isn\u2019t going to work out. Now will you take photos for me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s phone dinged and she checked the screen. Her smile turned florescent. \u201cOh, he\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p> <p>Evan hated that Callie already had that smitten-beyond-repair look. Even if this Brandon was a nice guy, giving your heart to anyone that easily had disaster written all over it. Evan had firsthand experience on that one.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting outside. Sorry to stop by and then run off,\u201d Callie said. \u201cBut I only have a little while for lunch. We\u2019re shorthanded so Jessica will probably go on strike if I\u2019m not back by one to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Evan said, ready to get back to her own work anyway. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up next week.\u201d</p><p>Callie pointed a finger at her and arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you are so doing those photos for me. I\u2019ll withhold petit fours otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHateful bitch.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTa for now. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, right. That was exactly what Evan planned to do. Work so hard that she had no space left in her mind, her bed, or her heart for anything else.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Jace straightened the display of erotic novels as his best friend, Reid, selected one of the paddles from the rack on the other side. Reid flipped it around in his hand, testing the weight and feel of it. He held it up to Jace. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Jace shrugged, the sight of his suit-clad friend holding up a paddle with the words \u201cbad girl\u201d scrawled in pink a comical picture. \u201cThe newbies like that kind of thing. Makes \u2019em feel scandalous. It\u2019s got great thud, though.\u201d</p><p>Reid smacked it against his own thigh. Frowned. \u201cBrynn needs more bite than that. Plus, she may laugh herself right out of the scene if she sees what\u2019s on it.\u201d</p><p>Jace grabbed a utilitarian black paddle with holes in it from the shelf. \u201cTry this one. The holes lessen air resistance and give you more impact.\u201d</p><p>Reid took it from him to examine it. He sliced it through the air, the whooshing sound making Jace\u2019s skin itch. God, he loved that sound. Even better was the noise the sub made when it smacked against her bare skin.</p><p>\u201cMmm, better,\u201d Reid agreed.</p> <p>\u201cSo how is that beautiful blonde of yours? You haven\u2019t brought her by in a while. Still afraid she\u2019s going to realize the error of her ways and come sub for me instead?\u201d</p><p>Reid shot him a deadly look. \u201cDon\u2019t make me test this paddle on your skull, smartass.\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed. A more tactful friend probably wouldn\u2019t make a point to remind Reid on a regular basis that Jace had shared Reid\u2019s soon-to-be-wife with him one night. But Jace had never claimed to have tact. Plus, he\u2019d never been able to resist getting his oh-so-calm friend ruffled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be worrying about my woman,\u201d Reid said, tucking the paddle under his arm and moving on to the vibrator section of Jace\u2019s store. \u201cWorry about your own women. I ran into your mother the other day at the grocery store, and she said you never come when she invites you to family dinners. That ain\u2019t right, man. I ended up agreeing to stop by for one because she looked so damn sad about it.\u201d</p><p>Jace sighed. \u201cFamily dinners involve having conversation with my dad. And by conversation, I mean me listening to him talk about what a failure and a fuckup I am. They\u2019ll probably appreciate your company more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, your dad\u2019s a dick, but you need to tough one out for your mom. She\u2019s looking worn down with all this. Maybe having you there will give her a boost.\u201d</p><p>Jace grimaced. He loved his mom and felt like a dirtbag for contributing at all to her being upset, but he hadn\u2019t made it through a family meal since he opened up Wicked without having a knock-down, drag-out fight with his father. Seeing that wouldn\u2019t do his mother any good. \u201cI\u2019ll try to make it over there for one.\u201d</p><p>Reid nodded and turned down the next aisle. \u201cSo how\u2019s business looking?\u201d</p><p>Jace shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s been better. It\u2019d help if I could get Diana to stop drawing alimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI petitioned the court to relieve you of that obligation. Diana\u2019s still maintaining an apartment address, but I had that PI I know follow her for a couple of weeks. She\u2019s living with Greg full time like you suspected.\u201d Reid grabbed a few more items off the shelf. \u201cIt\u2019s still a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUn-fucking-believable.\u201d He\u2019d already given her half of everything when they divorced and had paid a monthly stipend for two years. It\u2019d been more than she deserved since she\u2019d been the one to walk out on him. But he\u2019d been so numb after she\u2019d left that he\u2019d just agreed to whatever instead of going through a nasty court battle.</p><p>Reid grabbed a G-spot stimulator and a pack of nipple clamps then handed all of the items to Jace. \u201cI know, man. I\u2019m doing the best I can. But it might be worth it to try and talk with her. Nicely. Appeal to her reasonable side.\u201d</p><p>Jace scoffed as he walked to the front of the store and dumped Reid\u2019s selections on the counter so his cashier could ring them up. \u201cDiana doesn\u2019t have a reasonable side.\u201d</p><p>Reid tossed his credit card on the counter. \u201cYou better find one. Otherwise, she\u2019s got a decent shot of syphoning more money from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. Isn\u2019t there a point where I stop getting fucked over? You\u2019ve barely lost a case in your life. Can\u2019t we win?\u201d</p><p>Reid frowned as he took his bag from the cashier. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to do everything I can, but it hurts that you didn\u2019t take her to task during the initial divorce. She doesn\u2019t look like the bad guy in the court records.\u201d He laid a hand on his shoulder. \u201cTalk to her, Jace. And I\u2019ll do what I can on my end.\u201d</p><p>Jace walked Reid out then stalked into his office ready to breathe fire. Fucking Diana. Just what he needed. Hadn\u2019t it been enough that she\u2019d ripped his heart out and made him look like a goddamned fool? Now she wanted to suck his bank account dry, too?</p><p>Jace stared out the second-floor window and the darkened shops across the street. Wicked was one of the few stores open this late on a Thursday night. He\u2019d landed a prime piece of real estate tucked between high-end clothing stores, a gourmet chocolate shop, and a salon. It was the perfect shopping spot for women and couples who may not feel comfortable venturing into the seedy part of town and going to a windowless dive with an Adult Videos sign flashing above.</p><p>But the tradeoff for having such a swank spot was that he also didn\u2019t get the cheap and easy business\u2014the guys just coming in to grab a porno or some skin mags. He didn\u2019t sell either. Well, unless you counted some of the how-to videos they had in stock. So he had to count on the customers who weren\u2019t afraid to spend decent money on quality products. And with the economy the way it was, those customers were getting fewer and farther between.</p><p>The money he hoped to get through the deal with Dr. Dan would allow him to beef up his stock and Internet presence and offer more variety in price point. But if Diana kept milking him for alimony, he was going to run out of capital before the Dr. Dan thing even bore fruit.</p><p>He flipped the blinds closed just as his office door opened. Andre stepped in and leaned against the doorjamb, looking every bit the pissed-off cop. \u201cShe\u2019s a leech. Have I mentioned that?\u201d</p><p>Jace snorted. \u201cGuess you saw Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her deal? She\u2019s had years to get on her feet. Feet that I\u2019m sure get a weekly pedicure and massage using your money.\u201d</p><p>Jace sank into his desk chair and rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cThis is the last thing I need. I\u2019ve been crunching numbers all night. If it weren\u2019t for my contract with The Ranch, I\u2019d be in some serious shit right now. I was counting on freeing up the money I was paying her each month to put toward the website and building stock. Now I\u2019ve gotta go play nice and hope she grants me mercy when all I really want to do is ring her neck. And Greg\u2019s. What kind of asshole stands by and lets some other dude support the mother of his kid?\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s shoulder radio squawked, and he pressed the button to respond. He looked up when he was done. \u201cDon\u2019t go see her or Greg yet. You need to take a break and get away from that desk and those P&amp;L statements. You go see them while you\u2019re like this, and I\u2019ll be arresting you for bodily assault.\u201d</p><p>Jace grunted. He\u2019d never lay a hand on a woman without her consent, but Greg was a whole different story. Bodily assault was starting to sound real tempting. Or maybe just massive intimidation and threats to relocate the guy\u2019s nuts. Could he get arrested for that?</p><p>Andre\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cSee, I can already see you contemplating maiming and dismembering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilljoy.\u201d</p><p>Andre pushed off the doorframe. \u201cLook, we both need to blow off steam. I\u2019ve been busting my ass to get that promotion. They have me shadowing the detectives on this huge case and still covering my regular beat. I\u2019ve switched from days to nights so many times these last two weeks, I don\u2019t even know what time it is. Plus, you\u2019ve been a miserable fuck since we got back from South Padre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know your lease is up this month, so you\u2019re more than welcome to move somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Andre flipped him off. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that we should go have some fun this weekend. Recharge.\u201d</p><p>Jace perked up. A fun weekend?</p><p>Andre was right\u2014that was exactly what he needed. Since they\u2019d returned to Dallas, Jace had felt off, like he couldn\u2019t quite get back into the groove. And it had nothing to do with Wicked\u2019s bank account. The moment that had passed between him and Evan had replayed in his mind one too many times. And getting hard night after night thinking about a girl who was off limits was getting him nowhere. He knew just the kind of weekend he needed.</p><p>\u201cAndre, I think that\u2019s a genius plan.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOf course it is. That\u2019s the only kind of plan I come up with.\u201d</p><p>Jace smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with Diana next week. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting her earn any more money off my back. And I\u2019ll figure out this mess with Wicked. I have some new radio and print ads going live this weekend, so maybe that will drum up some new business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always ask your parents to release the rest of your trust fund. The money\u2019s supposed to be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a box than give in and ask them for a penny of that damn money. That shit is so laced with strings, I might as well sign up to be a marionette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if they ever want to send any of it over my way, I\u2019ll happily join the family financial business and toe the line. I\u2019d at least get to sleep sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Jace chucked a pen at Andre, who deftly ducked out of the way.</p><p>\u201cKidding.\u201d Andre checked his watch, his break probably over. \u201cI\u2019ll set things up for the weekend. Any requests?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Yes. A dark-haired beauty with ice blue eyes and a mouth that begged to be tasted. A woman who clearly had never been under a master\u2019s hand, but whose body had responded the instant her hands were tied\u2014in front of a live audience no less. He shoved Evan\u2019s image from his head. \u201cSee if there are any new members.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow. \u201cYou want a newbie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Anything to make him forget an oldie.</p><p>SIX</p><p>This was not how Evan had anticipated spending her birthday. She folded her hands in her lap and tried to keep an interested look on her face as one of the reporters asked Daniel another question about the planned television show.</p><p>She thought she\u2019d have some time to get her head wrapped around the idea that they\u2014well, Daniel\u2014was going to have his own TV show. But two weeks after signing the deal the word was out, and the Dallas papers wanted to know all the details. The glare of the spotlight was already dangerously close to making her break out in hives. She much preferred being the one behind the flashbulb.</p><p>\u201cMs. Kennedy, are you going to be part of the show?\u201d the female reporter asked, turning her head toward Evan.</p> <p>She sat up a little straighter on the couch. \u201cI plan to stay in more of a behind-the-scenes role.\u201d</p><p>Daniel put a hand on Evan\u2019s knee. \u201cEvan\u2019s going to be in the audience most days, and I plan to call upon her when we need a woman\u2019s perspective. Hopefully, we can get her over her stage fright so she can become a bigger part of the show.\u201d</p><p>Evan tensed beneath his grip. What the hell was he talking about? They had never discussed her stepping into that kind of role. She bit the inside of her cheek to keep from blurting out the question for him. She gave the handful of reporters a tight smile.</p><p>After a few more questions were lobbed at Daniel and more photos were taken of the both of them, the group finally filed out of the house. Evan barely waited for the front door to click shut behind them before whirling around and pinning Daniel with a deadly glare. \u201cHave you been drinking? Hit in the head with a blunt object?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows knitted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She put her hands out to her sides. \u201cGet over stage fright? Since when am I supposed to be on camera? That\u2019s not part of the deal. You know I don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p> <p>He gave a put-upon sigh and placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cCalm down, sweets. It\u2019s just something the producers mentioned would be a good idea. You\u2019re beautiful and smart. They think you\u2019ll add to the brand better if you\u2019re not hiding in the background.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding, Daniel. I\u2019m working my ass off with all the detailed stuff you don\u2019t like to deal with. The limelight is your dream, not mine. And how am I supposed to be at all the show tapings and still get my new studio off the ground?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cEvan, you don\u2019t have to worry about turning a profit with your photography. The money from this deal will be more than enough to support all of us.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief, then wriggled from beneath his grasp. So her photography business was expendable\u2014a little hobby that didn\u2019t bring in enough cash to count for anything. She stormed past him before she said everything that wanted to spill out of her mouth. \u201cWhatever, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>Evan ignored the soft knock on her door as she finished putting on her eyeliner. An hour of alone time had eased her down from her boiling point, but she was still at a steady simmer. She had half a mind to go to her birthday dinner alone.</p><p>\u201cEvan, it\u2019s Marcus. Can I come in? I have mail for you.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath and capped the eyeliner. \u201cIt\u2019s not locked. And you could\u2019ve come up with a better excuse than that.\u201d</p><p>He cracked open the door and stuck his head in tentatively, like he was afraid she was going to chuck a shoe at him or something. It would\u2019ve been tempting had it been Daniel. \u201cYou doing all right in here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeachy,\u201d she said with a saccharine smile.</p><p>He opened the door the rest of the way and stepped in, frown lines marring his smooth complexion. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Daniel. His mouth is just moving too fast for his brain. He\u2019s so excited about finally reaching his dream that he hasn\u2019t slowed down to really consider how everyone else might feel about it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and clicked off the light on her makeup mirror. \u201cLook, no one is happier for him than I am. You know that. I know where he came from and how big of a deal this is. I just need him to understand that it\u2019s not my dream. I\u2019m dedicated to making this work for all of us, but my financial interest is so that I can run my studio, not have to stress about money, and be able to . . . take care of a few things. The fame part is not my deal.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cFame might not be that bad, you know.\u201d</p><p>Fame. Her stomach did a flip. She\u2019d spent a lot of time honing this new life\u2014changing her name, refining her look, sloughing off her old life\u2014not just to get a fresh start but to escape the demons lurking in her past. Having her picture splashed across the papers or television wasn\u2019t exactly lying low.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be on camera, Marcus. Get that through Daniel\u2019s head and we\u2019ll all be square.\u201d</p><p>He stepped behind her and set the stack of mail on the vanity table before giving her shoulders a little squeeze. \u201cHe won\u2019t make you do anything you don\u2019t want to, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, why don\u2019t we drop this whole thing for now and focus on going out and celebrating your birthday?\u201d He waggled his eyebrows at her in the mirror. \u201cWe have a gift I promise will put a smile on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord. Now you have me nervous.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cCome on, hot stuff. We don\u2019t want to miss our reservation.\u201d</p><p>By the time dinner wrapped up, Evan found herself without the energy to hold her grudge. Sulking was hard to maintain when so much fabulous food and wine were being consumed.</p><p>\u201cIf your evil plan was to stuff me with buttered scallops and cheesecake so that I wouldn\u2019t be mad at you anymore, it\u2019s working,\u201d Evan said, licking a bit of strawberry sauce off her fork.</p><p>Daniel laughed. \u201cI would never stoop so low as to prey upon your food-whore tendencies.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her cloth napkin at him. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stole the last bite of their shared dessert and pointed his fork at Daniel. \u201cTell her what\u2019s next while she\u2019s still on her sugar and champagne buzz.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the two men, a little twinge of anxiety going through her. \u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d</p><p>Daniel grasped her hand across the table. \u201cSweets, I know we haven\u2019t brought it up since our little discussion in South Padre, but Marcus and I have noticed you\u2019ve been on edge for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, not this again,\u201d she complained. \u201cI told you I\u2019m fine, Doctor. Totally stable.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, amusement dancing in his eyes. \u201cChill out. I\u2019m not psychoanalyzing you. You\u2019ve just been a tad bit . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitchy?\u201d Marcus offered before sipping his drink.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, shooting him an offended look.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say tense,\u201d Daniel said, bumping Marcus with his shoulder. \u201cI really do think it\u2019s this whole celibacy thing getting to you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, the subject catching her off guard. Now they were discussing her lack of a sex life at dinner? Her earlier hint of nerves ratcheted up to dread. \u201cWait a second, what does that have to do with what\u2019s happening next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we thought for your birthday we\u2019d help you with that little issue,\u201d Marcus said, obviously fighting a smile.</p><p>\u201cMy issue?\u201d Her mind took a moment to fully process the words. \u201cWait, with my celibacy issue?\u201d</p><p>Daniel grinned. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand from Daniel\u2019s and stared at the two of them in disbelief. How in the hell could two gay men help her with her celibacy issue? They surely weren\u2019t going to volunteer to go bi or straight for the night. She almost laughed at the notion, but then a disgusting thought hit her, making her choke. \u201cOh, no. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daniel asked in a tone worthy of a halo and wings.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God if you paid for some escort or something, I\u2019m seriously going to kill you two right here at the table.\u201d</p><p>Daniel leaned back in his chair and sipped his coffee with a casual elegance that had Evan ready to throw something more damaging at him than her napkin. He set down his cup. \u201cEvan, we would never do that to you. You deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Marcus said, sliding an envelope onto the table. \u201cLike a membership to The Ranch. Three months fully paid.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the little white envelope and the red R emblazoned on its wax seal. The thing looked innocuous enough, but she had a feeling the gift inside was far from innocent. She raised her gaze, hoping she was wrong. \u201cIs that some sort of spa or something?\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s lips curled into a mischievous smile. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Daniel, tell me it\u2019s not a brothel.\u201d She had no idea if they even had brothels with dude prostitutes, but she wasn\u2019t putting anything past her two friends. They were kinky bastards.</p><p>Marcus rolled his eyes. \u201cStop messing with her, D. You\u2019re freaking her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, neither of you are any fun,\u201d Daniel said, motioning to the waiter for a coffee refill, then looking back to Evan. \u201cIt\u2019s not a brothel, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a resort where people go to live out their fantasies, explore their . . . inclinations with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInclinations?\u201d she repeated. \u201cLike figuring out if they\u2019re gay or straight? \u2019Cause, no offense, but I don\u2019t have any doubts there.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow arched. \u201cI\u2019m sure some go there for that. But this is more about venturing into things you may not have access to in your day-to-day life. Fantasies. Role-playing. Multiple partners. Bondage. In your case, maybe just a confidential sexual partner.\u201d</p><p>Her hands turned sweaty against the booth\u2019s leather seat as she replayed his list in her head. Role-playing. Bondage. She parted her lips, but the words stuck to her tongue.</p><p>Marcus pushed the envelope closer to her. \u201cI\u2019ve been a member for a while. The place is top notch\u2014safe, exclusive, uber private\u2014and has very strict membership requirements.\u201d</p><p>Her brain began to spin. A sex club? They wanted her to go to a sex club? The boys were out of their freaking minds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all very confidential,\u201d Daniel added. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to reveal our situation, but members will know you\u2019re engaged and that your fianc\u00e9 approves of you being there. People there won\u2019t blink an eye at that. They\u2019re used to unique situations.\u201d</p><p>She looked back and forth between the two of them as her ability to form sentences returned in a rush. \u201cYou seriously expect me to just go there and have sex with strangers? Are you nuts?\u201d</p><p>Marcus gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cYou can do whatever you feel comfortable with. No one\u2019s going to make you participate. But don\u2019t shut yourself off to the possibility until you see the place. You may be surprised how things change in that kind of environment\u2014how your mind opens up. They specialize in BDSM, but I\u2019m sure they can accommodate whatever situation or fantasy is most enticing to you.\u201d</p><p>Her mind automatically rewound to the day in the seminar room\u2014Jace tying her hands and being in control, touching her. She\u2019d accessed that scene in her head countless times over the last two weeks, had touched herself as she filled in the blanks of what could\u2019ve happened if they\u2019d been alone and had no past to contend with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>And still, despite the constant fantasy rerun, the effect hadn\u2019t worn off. Even now, heat built low in her belly at the mere thought. She closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose, a champagne headache starting. \u201cGuys, really, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, but I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already packed your bag, and there\u2019s a car waiting for you outside,\u201d Daniel said, causing her head to snap up. \u201cGrant Waters, the owner of the place, has set up a tour for you tonight so you can see it before people start arriving for the weekend retreat tomorrow. We\u2019ve also reserved you a private cabin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d she demanded, trying to keep her voice low enough so that it wouldn\u2019t garner the attention of the people at the other tables. \u201cYou can\u2019t actually expect me to go to this place.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cLook, if you go on the tour and decide not to participate in anything, then take the weekend to enjoy the scenery and the cabin. It\u2019s beautiful out there and surrounded by vineyards. Plus, I think they do have a masseuse on staff if you really want to do the spa thing. I think the break will be good for you regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Daniel and I are going to be doing press for the next few days. If you\u2019re on a \u2018spa\u2019 weekend, it will save you from having to be a part of it,\u201d Marcus added.</p><p>She kept her eyes on them and gulped the last of her champagne, shocked to find herself actually considering the whole thing.</p><p>A weekend away from the press\u2014and the boys, for that matter\u2014did sound kind of tempting. And she hated to admit it, but for some reason, the whole celibacy thing was suddenly driving her mad. Going solo with her vibrator hadn\u2019t fixed anything. In fact, it\u2019d only made her fantasize and want sex more. It was as if seeing Jace again had tripped some wire inside her.</p> <p>She blew out a long breath. She could throw herself into her work like she had planned, but deep down she knew this restlessness wasn\u2019t going to go away so easily. Wasn\u2019t this what she\u2019d really been yearning for? A bit of physical indulgence without all the complications.</p><p>And at least at this place the guy would know she wasn\u2019t cheating, but doing it with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s consent. That helped. Felt less seedy to do it under the pretense of being kinky instead of being a lying cheat.</p><p>Maybe if she could have a real live man to warm her bed for a few days, she could cleanse her mind of these stupid Jace fantasies. She\u2019d been infatuated with him when she was a teenager, weaving daydreams about what it would be like to be with him. Apparently her mind had gone straight back to that old place\u2014forgetting how awful it had been after she\u2019d actually gotten what she thought she wanted. Stupid.</p><p>She needed an exorcism. And this might be just the thing to do it. She grabbed the envelope off the table and nodded at the guys. Resolved.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go. But\u201d\u2014she jabbed a finger at Marcus then Daniel\u2014\u201cif this turns out to be creepy or gross in any way, I\u2019m holding both of you responsible. I will seriously dig out all those toys I know you guys have and beat you with the most painful ones.\u201d</p><p>Marcus snorted. \u201cDaniel might actually enjoy that.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>Daniel ignored Marcus\u2019s comment and smiled at her. \u201cHappy birthday, sweets.\u201d He lifted his coffee cup. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping you have fun. It\u2019ll be like losing your virginity all over again.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, she hoped not. Losing it the first time had been the worst mistake she\u2019d ever made.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Evan\u2019s palms were damp against the arms of the overstuffed chair as she waited for the owner of The Ranch to meet with her. The limo drive to the place had been long, and as the minutes had slipped away, so had her resolve.</p><p>She glanced around the well-appointed sitting room, trying to focus on anything but her reasons for being here. Dark, rustic furniture, wood floors, artwork displaying Texas\u2019s varied landscapes, and a large stone fireplace, which she was sure was more for show than practicality in this climate. If she didn\u2019t know better, she would\u2019ve guessed she was in some high-end ski resort and not a retreat specializing in kink.</p><p>She tilted her head back and groaned. This was stupid. Ridiculous. She wasn\u2019t the type of person to go to a sex resort. Was she really that desperate? She\u2019d lived without sex for over a year. Why was it suddenly such a big deal?</p><p>There could only be one reason.</p> <p>Goddamn Jace. He\u2019d always been able to stir up that part of her without trying. Even when she\u2019d first met him and hadn\u2019t totally recognized the feeling as desire, she\u2019d been drawn to him, wanted to be in his sphere of attention as much as possible. He had a way of making her feel like she was the only one in the room, and after years of being invisible to everyone around her that feeling had been heady, addictive. She should\u2019ve been immune to it by now. But after a few seemingly harmless touches on that stage, Jace had flipped the switch and had her engines firing on all cylinders again. Man, she was screwed.</p><p>A massive wooden door on the opposite side of the room eased open, and an impossibly tall man with wavy dark hair stepped inside. He gave her a smile that seemed to warm the whole room. \u201cYou must be Ms. Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>The deep twang in his voice matched the cowboy boots peeking out of the bottom of his faded jeans. The image totally didn\u2019t fit with what Evan had imagined the owner of this type of resort to look like. She hadn\u2019t expected head-to-toe leather or anything, but a handsome cowboy hadn\u2019t been on her radar of possibilities either.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019d be me. But please, call me Evan.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the room in two long strides and put his hand out to shake hers. \u201cWelcome to The Ranch, Evan. I\u2019m Grant Waters, the owner and operator.\u201d</p><p>She shook his hand, hoping he didn\u2019t notice just how sweaty her palm was. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He held her hand for a moment longer, holding her gaze, no doubt evaluating her, and then stepped back to sit on the couch across from her. He crooked a thumb at the door. \u201cWould you like something to drink? We have everything but alcohol here.\u201d</p><p>No alcohol? Well, so much for plan A on how she was going to get up enough nerve to do this. She shook her head. \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I hear your fianc\u00e9 surprised you with a membership.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs to keep her knee from bumping up and down with nerves. \u201cUm, yes. I\u2019d never even heard of this place until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t exactly advertise.\u201d He braced his forearms on his thighs, leaning forward a bit. \u201cInteresting choice of a gift\u2014to give you a membership and not get one for himself. Any ideas on why he would do that?\u201d</p><p>The timbre of his voice was low, seemingly casual, but she didn\u2019t miss the sharp glint in his eyes. This man was making sure she was on the up and up. She squirmed a bit in her seat. Despite how often she had to do it, she hated lying, especially to someone who looked like he could smell bullshit from thirty paces. She scrambled for some plausible explanation. \u201cI . . . Well, I haven\u2019t been all that sexually adventurous in my life, and I think he\u2019s worried if I don\u2019t sow my oats or whatever, I\u2019ll always wonder after we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Grant seemed to chew on that for a moment. \u201cJust because you get married doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re locked down to non-adventurous sex. Lots of couples come here for m\u00e9nage or to switch partners. Or even if they only engage with each other, there are lots of things a couple can do between themselves to spice things up.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips thinking of threesomes, couple swaps. The ideas should have appalled her, but instead her body awakened as all kinds of illicit images flooded her mind. \u201cDaniel\u2019s not exactly into any of that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Grant gave a sage nod. \u201cAh, I see. Vanilla guy marrying a girl who may not be so traditional.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019m traditional or not. I haven\u2019t really explored very much.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved into a kind smile, one that eased the tension that had filled the room a few seconds before. \u201cSo what are you hoping to experience here, Evan?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her engagement ring round and round on her finger. What was she hoping to experience? She\u2019d had naughty fantasies in her life\u2014who hadn\u2019t? But what would she actually want if giving carte blanche? \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his five-o\u2019clock shadow, considering her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk around the main building? I\u2019ll show you some of the activity rooms and we can see what appeals to you. Maybe it\u2019ll help us tease out what desires are hiding in there.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOkay, that sounds good.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Grant led her up a flight of stairs and into a long, quiet hallway. Sconces provided soft lighting, but the maroon walls and dark wood floors gave the impression of entering a secret lair. She had the urge to whisper her question, but the guy was so damn tall he probably wouldn\u2019t hear her up there in the stratosphere. \u201cSo no one\u2019s here right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we close a few days once a month to do general maintenance. Everyone will start arriving tomorrow.\u201d He slipped a hand onto her lower back and eased her forward. \u201cGo ahead. Each window gives a view into a different room.\u201d</p><p>She took a few steps and turned to look through the first large window that flanked the right side of the wall. A dreary, stone-walled dungeon, complete with manacles and a host of other tools she didn\u2019t recognize came into view. If not for the little security camera tucked into the upper corner of the room, the place could\u2019ve fit into any ancient castle. \u201cWow, this looks authentic.\u201d</p><p>Grant stepped up next to her. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you can imagine, this is one of the more popular rooms since so many of our guests practice BDSM. We have a number of dungeon areas throughout the resort, including a few larger ones for group play.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, anxiety twining through her.</p><p>\u201cThis one makes you nervous.\u201d</p><p>She peeked up at him, surprised by his spot-on assessment. \u201cA little. Not sure I\u2019d want to jump right into that.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>They walked past a few other themed rooms\u2014a doctor\u2019s office, a classroom, a barn, a decadent boudoir, a strip club scene complete with a pole. The sheer level of detail of each room boggled her mind. They were not fooling around here. Some big money had been spent.</p><p>Every scene affected her on some level as her mind automatically placed her in each fantasy. The naughty nurse. The stripper. Her skin had flushed well past the point of comfort as they traveled down the hallway. They crossed in front of the window to the next room, and her heart picked up speed.</p><p>She stared at the mock police station setup. The desk. The jail cell behind it with a narrow bed. What would it be like to have a guy play bad cop? To handcuff her and have her at his mercy? To pass her off to his partner to share her?</p><p>The vision of two cops hauling her into the room, arresting her with plans for their own satisfaction, filled her head. Two above-the-law officers handling her however they pleased. Bending her over that desk and shoving her skirt over her hips, taking her from behind while the other used her mouth for his pleasure.</p><p>Whoa. Where had that come from? She tried to wet her lips, but her mouth had forgotten how to make spit; all the moisture in her body had rerouted much, much lower. Jesus, what was wrong with her? That shouldn\u2019t turn her on.</p><p>Grant\u2019s voice was like dark whiskey as he leaned closer to her. \u201cTell me why this one appeals to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, you\u2019re breathing faster, your face is flushed, and your nipples are so hard, you\u2019re getting me hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head, wanting to cover her face with her hands, but he put a finger under her chin, forcing her face toward him. \u201cNo shame here, Evan. You\u2019re not going to get judgment from me or anyone else who comes here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . I . . . ,\u201d she said, stumbling over her words.</p><p>\u201cYou feel uncomfortable that this turns you on,\u201d he said, his tone gentle. \u201cThis room is usually used for scenes that involve power play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a fancy way of saying \u2018pretend rape\u2019?\u201d she asked, her stomach knotting.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo, not at all. What\u2019s speaking to you is not a rape fantasy. Rape means non-consensual, and I doubt you desire a true loss of consent.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s a dominance/submission fantasy. A cop is a classic role of authority and dominance, the prisoner the counterbalance to that. It\u2019s role-playing mixed with D/s\u2014like most of these rooms. Nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d He laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \u201cAs long as everyone is aware of the risks and it\u2019s consensual, you can embrace whatever desires you have here. Even the dark ones.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, absorbing the power of his words, the freedom of such a concept. Maybe this was the answer to her present situation. Exploring her most forbidden fantasies in a no-strings-attached, safe environment, while still keeping her comfortable situation at home.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSo does this mean I should try the BDSM route?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say it\u2019d be a good place to start,\u201d he said, amusement glinting in his eyes. \u201cThe important question is, in your fantasy, which role are you playing? A cop or the prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows scrunched. Huh. She hadn\u2019t even considered being in the cop role. That didn\u2019t seem nearly as enticing. She glanced up at him. \u201cThe prisoner.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWell, that answers a lot. I think The Ranch is going to be able to provide exactly what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he said, ushering her back toward the door they\u2019d come in originally. \u201cAnd I already know a few members who could be perfect at providing it for you.\u201d</p><p>Anticipation rippled through her. This was either going to be the most exciting or the most idiotic decision she\u2019d ever made.</p><p>Unfortunately, based on her track record with men and sex, odds weren\u2019t in her favor.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Jace tilted back his root beer and watched as other members started to drift into the main room. It would probably be a busy weekend considering The Ranch had been shut down for a few days this week.</p><p>Andre flipped through the packet of papers he\u2019d picked up for them at the door. \u201cThere are five new female subs tonight. Well, Tessa isn\u2019t new. She apparently had a falling out with her boyfriend and wants a new master.\u201d</p><p>Jace set his bottle on the table. \u201cAre the other four guests or new members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo guests, two new members. So only two are going through the mandatory public display of submission,\u201d Andre replied, still going through the pages. \u201cAre you up for that tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jace shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of demanding submission before I\u2019ve even talked to the chick.\u201d</p> <p>Andre chuckled. \u201cConversation, then fucking. Got it. You\u2019re such an old-fashioned guy, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>Andre cocked his head, his smile challenging. \u201cThat could be arranged. But only if you beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Why don\u2019t you hold your breath and wait for that to happen?\u201d Jace had never been one for limits and labels, so he had no issue being sexual with Andre within the m\u00e9nage dynamic. But after living a childhood with a father who dictated every damn thing in Jace\u2019s life, he didn\u2019t do submissive. \u201cJust tell me about our two possibilities.\u201d</p><p>Andre turned the page. \u201cOkay, candidate number one has been in a D/s relationship twice before, but is currently single. She has very few limits and is really into pain play. Open to m\u00e9nage. She\u2019s hoping to find a long-term master but is fine with short-term things as well.\u201d</p><p>Jace leaned back in his chair and grimaced. \u201cOoh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if she wants serious pain stuff, neither of us is the right kind of dom for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, the open-to-relationship ones always have an agenda. Even if they say they don\u2019t. I\u2019m not here to spend the weekend cuddling and getting to know each other.\u201d He didn\u2019t come to The Ranch looking for relationships. He didn\u2019t go anywhere looking for that.</p><p>Andre smirked. \u201cYou know, not every woman here is out to trap you with her white picket fence. You\u2019re not that great of a catch, anyway. Now me, on the other hand . . .\u201d</p><p>Jace flipped him off. He knew Andre was open to finding a steady relationship eventually, but his friend\u2019s bisexuality and penchant for m\u00e9nage tended to get in the way of any lasting plans. It was only a matter of time before Andre would figure out that the whole \u201ctill death do us part\u201d thing wasn\u2019t meant for people like them. Plus, why put your heart in someone else\u2019s hands and give them the power to crush you?</p><p>Jace had learned his lesson on that one and didn\u2019t need a refresher course. D/s would never again be anything more than fun and fucking for him. Period. \u201cJust tell me about the other woman, smartass.\u201d</p><p>Andre turned another page, reading for himself before saying anything. A smile crept to his lips. \u201cHere we go. This woman is a D/s virgin. Shows tendencies toward the sub role and is looking to explore that. Grant wants her to have a master who has gone through the full training here\u2014score one for you. She has a cop fantasy\u2014score one for me. Not seeking anything permanent because she\u2019s already in a committed relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, is she married?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cEngaged, but it says she\u2019s here with her partner\u2019s consent.\u201d</p><p>Jace leaned back in his chair. \u201cYeah, sure she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think she\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019d been married for a few years and was doing it with consent, I may be able to buy it. You know, getting bored, wanting to branch out. But engaged? That\u2019s when people are shitfaced in love with each other. No dude willingly lets the girl he\u2019s engaged to go fuck around on him on her own. Could you imagine Reid sending Brynn out here by herself to fool around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid would burn the place down first. But you never know. I\u2019ve heard some guys get off on that whole girl cheating on them thing. Cuckoldry or whatever it\u2019s called.\u201d</p><p>Jace sniffed. Maybe guys who\u2019ve never actually had a woman step out on them could get off on that, but he knew there was nothing remotely sexy about the humiliation of the real thing.</p><p>Andre lifted his hand at someone behind Jace and waved him over. Jace turned in his seat to find Grant sauntering their way.</p><p>\u201cEvening, fellas.\u201d The owner shook each of their hands. \u201cGood to see y\u2019all out here. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, things have been crazy,\u201d Jace said. \u201cBut we figured we\u2019ve earned a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what can I do for ya?\u201d Grant asked, turning to Andre.</p><p>\u201cThis new member, Sasha. Her bio says she\u2019s engaged but is here with the guy\u2019s permission. How do we know that\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>The corner of Grant\u2019s mouth hitched up. \u201cI don\u2019t have them put anything on that sheet that I haven\u2019t verified. It\u2019s unusual, but the fianc\u00e9 is actually the one who purchased the membership for her as a gift. Apparently, he prefers vanilla, so he\u2019s letting her work a few kinks out of her system before they get married.\u201d</p><p>Jace snorted, almost choking on his drink. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Jace set his bottle down. \u201cIs the guy an idiot? If this woman discovers that she truly is a sub, she\u2019s not going to want to go back and be vanilla for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged. \u201cI know that. And you two know that. But I figure it\u2019s better for them to find that out before they take the plunge instead of after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jace said, \u201cyou\u2019re better than anyone I know at determining it. Is she really a sub or just playing around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sub. I\u2019d bet the vineyard on it.\u201d</p><p>Andre grinned. \u201cGuess we found our girl for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, fellas, not so fast,\u201d Grant said, tapping the papers on the table. \u201cYou must\u2019ve not read all the way down. She checked no for m\u00e9nage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be freaking kidding me,\u201d Jace said, grabbing the packet to read it for himself.</p><p>\u201cYou could always take her on yourself,\u201d Grant suggested, a hint of challenge in his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s over there in the back corner chatting with the other available subs.\u201d</p><p>Jace grimaced, the idea holding no appeal. Since his divorce, he hadn\u2019t had any interest in taking on a sub solo. One-on-one just felt too serious, too intense. He came here to have fun and m\u00e9nage ensured that things stayed light. \u201cWe\u2019ll just find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a nice night, guys. Don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Grant said, moving away to go talk to another table.</p><p>Andre smirked. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that doesn\u2019t rule out much.\u201d</p><p>Jace tossed the papers back on the table in frustration. \u201cLooks like we won\u2019t be taking on a newbie tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. I saw that Melissa chick earlier, and she was hinting that she\u2019d be interested in joining us later. It\u2019ll still be a fun night.\u201d</p><p>Jace rolled his shoulders, trying to fight the tension gathering there. He wasn\u2019t interested in Melissa. She was a pretty girl, but he knew none of it was God-given\u2014fake tits, fake lips, spray-on tan, and enough makeup to put a porn star to shame. That didn\u2019t do it for him. He preferred women who had that natural, girl-next-door type of beauty. Girls who you\u2019d never guess had a kinky streak if you saw them out in the world. Unfortunately, that was sometimes hard to find at a place like The Ranch.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Andre said, pointing at the front part of the room.</p><p>All the rest of the members had taken their seats around the room\u2014some on the plush couches and others at the candlelit cocktail tables. The lights were turned low except for those shining on the staging area at the front. Grant opened the double doors, and the initiates were led in blindfolded with their arms bound behind their backs.</p><p>Even though Jace knew none of the initiates were for him, the erotic sight of women stripped down to the barest essentials and volunteering for submission had his cock twitching in his jeans. The beauty of a woman who knew what she wanted and was brave enough to trust someone else to give it to her was unmatched in his book. He never took for granted the gift the sub gave by putting her trust in his hands. And he made damn sure he thanked her thoroughly for that submission by driving her to whatever heights of pleasure she was capable of.</p><p>He shifted in his chair. Damn. He\u2019d been looking forward to indulging that side of himself tonight. Maybe he should reconsider the girl who\u2019d listed being open to short-term even though she was ultimately looking for long-term.</p><p>Andre craned his neck, looking toward the back of the room instead of the stage. \u201cDoms are already heading over to the single subs area. I can\u2019t see her face, but if the brunette\u2019s the one who\u2019s open to m\u00e9nage, we should go for her. She\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Jace turned and squinted, trying to make out the figure in the darkened back corner of the room. Candlelight lit the outlines of the men and women quietly chatting. A petite brunette had her back to them, but even in the dark, Jace could see the delicate curve of her bare shoulder and the sweet column of her uncollared neck. Something about her called to him in a way that no other woman had so far tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Jace agreed. Maybe an Evan look-alike could purge the fantasies that\u2019d been stalking him since South Padre.</p><p>Jace stood, a little surge of hope going through him. Maybe the night would turn out to be interesting after all. Andre joined him as they headed toward the back of the room. They weren\u2019t the first to reach the brunette, so they stood back a ways as Colby, one of the other doms and a friend of Jace\u2019s, talked to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>The woman was even more enticing close up. Her dark hair spilled forward, shielding her face as she kept her eyes down from Colby\u2019s. She was wearing a simple black bra and panty set\u2014standard issue for an unclaimed sub who didn\u2019t bring her own fetish wear. Jace allowed his gaze to travel down\u2014creamy skin, breasts that looked to be the perfect handful, and legs . . . shit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sub?\u201d Colby asked.</p> <p>\u201cSasha.\u201d</p><p>Andre cringed and leaned toward Jace\u2019s ear. \u201cThe no-m\u00e9nage chick.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s mouth had gone dry as he stared at the faint jellyfish scars that striped \u201cSasha\u2019s\u201d leg. What in the hell was Evan doing here? Then the words from the bio sheet came back to him. Ah, fuck. The engaged chick with the vanilla fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Evan thought she was a sub?</p><p>His burgeoning erection turned into a raging hard-on. God, how he\u2019d love to find out if that was the case. Be the first to draw out the submission if it was really in her. But complicated didn\u2019t even begin to describe getting involved with Evan. Not only was he doing business with her fianc\u00e9, but she\u2019d made it clear in South Padre that she wanted nothing to do with him, couldn\u2019t even bear to have lunch with him. And hell if he could blame her.</p> <p>Plus, even if she had been open to him and m\u00e9nage, sleeping with her again would be ten kinds of stupid. Especially after how he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d walked away from her the last time. She\u2019d been his first lesson in heartbreak. Even way back then, they\u2019d always had this dangerous vibe between them\u2014one that had scared him shitless. She wasn\u2019t a fuck \u2019em and forget \u2019em kind of girl, and he was a cut and run kind of guy.</p><p>Colby\u2019s lazy Houston accent snapped Jace from his thoughts. \u201cWhat makes you think you could be a submissive, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Evan dipped her head a bit, like she was afraid to answer the question.</p><p>\u201cAnswer, sub,\u201d Colby said, his accent not hiding the natural authority in his voice. \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to be shy.\u201d</p><p>Jace stepped closer and had the urge to tell Colby to back the fuck off even though the guy was doing exactly what he would\u2019ve done in the same situation.</p><p>Evan cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019ve, uh, had fantasies about being dominated.\u201d</p> <p>Jace nearly groaned aloud. He should\u2019ve been disturbed. At one time he\u2019d seen this girl as a little sister, had promised his parents he would protect her from the dangers of the world and from guys like him. A promise he\u2019d fucked up royally. And there was still a deep protective urge that rose when she was around. A possessive one that had been there from the beginning.</p><p>But God, somewhere along the way his view of her had warped into something entirely different. He knew the night she\u2019d come to him at sixteen that his feelings toward her were far from familial. But now that the barrier of the strange situation was lifted all he could see was a beautiful woman there for the taking. A beautiful woman who wanted to be dominated.</p><p>Colby glanced up at Jace, noticing him now that he\u2019d stepped next to Evan\u2019s table. \u201cBetter move on, J. The lady isn\u2019t looking for what you guys want to dish out.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cFuck off, Colby.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s head snapped up, her eyes going wide when she saw Jace.</p><p>Colby\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>Jace eyed Colby. The guy was his friend, an excellent dom and one of the trainers here. Evan would be in safe hands. But hell if he didn\u2019t want to choke the guy at the thought of him touching her, bending her to his will, drawing out her submission. His fists clenched.</p><p>Andre shot Jace a don\u2019t-do-this look. \u201cNo, Colby\u2019s right, man. She\u2019s not down with m\u00e9nage.\u201d</p> <p>Jace clenched and unclenched his fists, an urge he hadn\u2019t had in as long as he could remember surfacing. The words were out before he could stop them. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go solo tonight.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyebrows rose, but before Jace could respond, Colby was pulling out a collar and laying it on Evan\u2019s table, letting her know that he was offering to take her on. Jace\u2019s hand, as if acting on its own accord, yanked the strip of leather from his own back pocket. He squeezed the collar in his hand, inches away from laying it down and making his first solo claim in two years.</p><p>Colby stared at him, waiting to see what Jace\u2019s move was going to be.</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit. Anxiety rose in Jace like a tidal wave, drowning the surge of bravado. What the hell was he doing? He didn\u2019t do jealous or possessive. Not anymore. The fact that he was feeling either was a glaring sign he should back the fuck off. Now.</p><p>His good sense screamed for him to bail. To back off. His body and mind warred, but finally, he forced himself to step backward, leaving Evan to Colby, the concession almost physically painful. He had to give her up. Do the smart thing.</p><p>But before Jace could take another step back, Evan looked down at his clenched hand and looked . . . disappointed.</p><p>NINE</p><p>Evan tried to wet her lips, but her mouth had gone arid the minute she\u2019d seen Jace. What in the hell was he doing here?</p><p>\u201cSasha, do you accept my offer?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to the man standing closer to her\u2014dark brown hair and hazel eyes, a friendly smile teasing at the corners of his mouth. Handsome. And built like a brick shithouse. The collar on the table meant he was offering to take her on, which meant . . . Her focus returned to Jace and the collar he gripped in his hand. He was offering, too?</p><p>No, Jace had stepped back and was half-cloaked in the shadows at the edge of the singles area.</p><p>\u201cJace, what are you doing here?\u201d she blurted out before she could stop herself.</p><p>The other man turned to Jace with a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a member,\u201d he said, his voice tight.</p><p>Oh, fan-frigging-tastic. This was so not what she needed right now. The whole point of coming to a place like this was the anonymity, the privacy. And now not only had she run into someone she knew, but Jace, the last person in the world she needed to be around.</p><p>The man turned toward Jace. \u201cYou\u2019ve got history with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do,\u201d Jace said, the words clipped.</p><p>\u201cSo are you making a claim or not?\u201d he asked, his words laced with annoyance. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to overstep if you have some previous connection to her.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s gaze darted back to Evan and for a moment, she forgot to breathe. His jaw flexed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Evan clenched her teeth together, not sure if she was more relieved or insulted. She reminded herself that this was a good thing. Despite the fan club her hormones were forming just from being near him again, getting naked with Jace was a first-class bad idea.</p><p>Mr. Hazel Eyes graced her with a sexy smile. \u201cGuess that means you\u2019re mine, darling. That is, if you\u2019re interested, of course.\u201d</p><p>Nerves thrummed through her. The guy was hot as hell and he had kind eyes, giving her reassurance that he probably wasn\u2019t some psycho. Always a bonus. But was she actually going to do this? Could she hand herself over to a stranger? Her eyes automatically found Jace again\u2014the only anchor of familiarity in a suddenly fast-moving world of unknown.</p><p>Jace shoved his hands in his pockets, his expression softening. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to choose Colby. You don\u2019t have to choose anyone, Ev. You can turn around and go home. Back to the guy you\u2019re marrying. This isn\u2019t something to mess around with if you have doubts that you can handle it.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dipped down and traced over the oh so faint scars on her lower belly. Ones that no one else would know to look for except him. Shame, hot and fierce, burned within her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that kid anymore, Jace. I don\u2019t need someone to protect me,\u201d she said more sharply than she\u2019d intended. She switched her focus to Colby, her anxiety ratcheting up another notch. \u201cI accept your offer.\u201d</p><p>She caught Jace in her peripheral vision, scowling.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Colby smiled down at her and gripped the back of her neck. \u201cNow stand up, sub. I want to sample what\u2019s mine for the weekend and make sure my friend Jace back there knows who you belong to since he seems to be confused.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as Colby helped her from the stool and to her feet. He had her put out her wrists for cuffs, then locked her arms behind her back. \u201cThere, that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his large hands onto her hips and stepped in front of her, pulling her close. His hard body pressed against hers as Jace glared at her from over Colby\u2019s shoulder. Colby dipped his face down until his eyes were inches from hers and his lips only a breath away.</p><p>Holy shit. He was going to kiss her. Right away. With Jace watching.</p><p>Before she could catch her breath, his mouth met hers, warm and inviting. Her eyelids closed automatically, and she tried to give herself over to the kiss. It\u2019d been forever since she\u2019d really kissed someone, and the sensation was something new again. Soft and sensual, his tongue teased hers, testing the waters. He was a good kisser, not giving or taking too much. But despite his skill, the experience felt empty, vacant. All she could think about was the man behind him, standing there watching it happen.</p><p>Colby pulled back and stared down at her, running a thumb over her lower lip. \u201cYou have a beautiful mouth. I can\u2019t wait to feel it against my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without warning, she was yanked sideways by a firm hand on her upper arm, the jolt nearly causing her to tumble onto her ass. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your goddamned hands off her, Colby,\u201d Jace said, his voice full of grit.</p><p>Colby\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole, Austin. I gave you your chance, and you didn\u2019t make a claim. She chose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can change her mind. You haven\u2019t collared her yet.\u201d Jace led her a few more feet away from Colby. She didn\u2019t know what else to do but let him. \u201cI changed my mind. I\u2019m offering. Let the lady choose again.\u201d</p><p>What? Oh, shit. Evan\u2019s heart jumped into her throat. She pinned Jace with a desperate stare. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving you a choice.\u201d</p><p>No. No. No. She didn\u2019t want a choice. She couldn\u2019t be trusted with this choice. Especially not after her lackluster kiss with Colby. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hand around her nape and without any further warning, brought his mouth down on hers. Electricity, sharp and instant, sparked at the contact, waking every nerve ending in an all-encompassing rush. Oh, Jesus. The muscles in her legs quivered, fighting to hold her upright position, and pulsing heat radiated down to her clit.</p><p>He kiss was hard, hungry, not at all tentative like Colby\u2019s. It was a proclamation, a claiming. And God, she wanted to be consumed by it. By him.</p><p>But as quickly as he\u2019d started it, he pulled back and straightened. \u201cJust choose me, Evan.\u201d</p><p>It took her a second to find her voice and her brain. \u201cJace, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes, and his mouth hardened into a line. \u201cI know you\u2019re new at this, sub, but you\u2019re to speak only when spoken to. And you need to address me as sir or Master J in public. All you have permission to do right now is choose your dom for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, the change in his demeanor and stark authority in his voice almost knocking her off her feet. Everything was happening too fast. Her thoughts and hormones were whirling into a firestorm in her gut, and she couldn\u2019t process any of it.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAnswer the question, sub. It\u2019s not that hard. You want Colby or you want me?\u201d</p><p>Ha. There was the question of the day. Physically, she wanted Jace so bad her arms strained to bust out of the bindings just so she could touch him. She couldn\u2019t remember ever having a kiss affect her so intensely. But how could she risk being with him even in a casual way? Nothing with Jace had ever been casual for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>And after what had happened between them in the past, how could she trust him? Back then he\u2019d had her completely convinced that he really cared about her. She\u2019d opened up to him like she had never done with anyone else, and it had all been bullshit. Just Jace fulfilling a duty. A guy trying to make a messed-up girl feel better about herself.</p><p>Too bad she hadn\u2019t figured that out before she\u2019d talked her way into his bed one night and taken things too far.</p> <p>She\u2019d imagined many times that year what losing her virginity to Jace would be like, but being a mercy fuck had never been part of the fantasy.</p><p>Neither had getting pregnant.</p><p>Though Jace didn\u2019t exactly know about that last part.</p><p>So why in the hell was he standing here, asking her if she wanted him? He couldn\u2019t be serious about sleeping with her, dominating her. Her tongue darted out, wetting her lips with a nervous flick. Despite the warning sirens shrieking in her head, the thought had her hot in all the right places.</p><p>No, this had to be about his ridiculous protective streak. He probably just wanted her to select him so he could haul her over his shoulder, stuff her back in the limo, and send her home.</p> <p>She straightened her spine. \u201cI\u2019m serious about trying this, Jace. Don\u2019t do this so you can keep me from participating or give me some edited, half-assed experience. I know you still see me as someone who needs a keeper.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat I see is a girl jumping into a game she knows nothing about just because her fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t doing it for her in bed. But if you\u2019re really here to find out what it\u2019s like, I\u2019m one of the best doms here. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need another sympathy screw. You already covered that with me a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He winced.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Austin. You\u2019re wasting all of our time,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>Jace lowered his voice. \u201cLook, I realize what a dick I was to you back then, and I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how sorry I am. But I\u2019ll make you a deal, Sasha. I can leave everything outside these doors as long as you can. I want you. And based on that kiss, you want me, too. So let\u2019s keep it that simple. This is sex. The past doesn\u2019t exist here. And I promise whatever I do with you, sympathy or pity definitely will not be a factor.\u201d</p> <p>She blew out a breath. Could she really block out everything while she was here? Be someone else for a while? She came here for one reason: to feed her physical side in a no-strings-attached environment. Could she do that with Jace? She wasn\u2019t a desperate, love-struck teenager this time. Jace didn\u2019t mean anything to her anymore. And if they didn\u2019t dredge up the past, her secret was safe.</p><p>Could she just focus on the fact that he was a sexy man who happened to get her hormones firing faster than any other guy ever had? He certainly stirred up a tempest with a kiss whereas Colby had only left her cold.</p><p>Hell, she was a master of compartmentalization. When she\u2019d run away all those years ago, she\u2019d learned very quickly how to lock away painful memories and emotions. It was the only way she\u2019d survived it. And she\u2019d certainly been able to tuck away her libido for the last few years without much incident. So why wouldn\u2019t she be able to do this?</p><p>There was no reason. She was strong enough, and she\u2019d earned this chance for indulgence. If Jace stuck to those \u201cno past\u201d rules, then so could she.</p><p>She glanced at Colby, who nodded at her as if he already knew what she was going to do and understood. She took a deep breath and turned her gaze back to Jace. \u201cI\u2019m all yours . . . sir.\u201d</p><p>The green in Jace\u2019s eyes darkened, clouding the normal humor that resided there. He stepped closer, his intimidating height looming over her as he grasped her elbow and led her away from Colby. Her arms had been bent into L-shapes behind her, so keeping her balance was a challenge, but Jace made sure she didn\u2019t tip over. He took the collar he\u2019d been holding and wound it around her neck.</p><p>\u201cThis will let everyone know you\u2019re mine while you\u2019re here,\u201d he said into her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>He fastened the lock and ran his fingertip along the hollow of her throat. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about half-assed, baby. I\u2019ll make sure you get exactly what you need.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, goose bumps tracking over her exposed skin. This wasn\u2019t a side of Jace she\u2019d ever seen. He\u2019d always kept it lighthearted around her when they were younger\u2014quick with a joke or harmless teasing. The guy who hadn\u2019t taken anything seriously, including her. Master J seemed to be a whole different animal all together. If she focused on that, this different persona, maybe blocking out the past would be easier than she thought.</p><p>He urged her forward, and she tried to find her voice. \u201cGrant said I may have to do something in front of the group.\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head as he led her to the side of the room. \u201cOnly guests are required to submit publicly. You and I? We need to take care of some things in private first. Now move. Andre, get the door.\u201d</p><p>She whipped her head around to see Jace\u2019s friend from the conference a few steps behind them. Andre shot her a saucy smile, then moved in front of her to shove open the door. He swept an arm in front of her. \u201cAfter you, bella.\u201d</p><p>They entered a quiet hallway, her hammering heart and unsteady breath the only sound. She looked between the two of them. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur cabin,\u201d Jace said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not so good at this not speaking thing, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>She huffed.</p><p>They reached the end of the corridor, and Jace grabbed a long silk robe from a hook and draped it over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten chilly.\u201d</p><p>Andre pushed open the exit door, and the cool night air rushed over her as they stepped outside. He crooked a thumb at one of the two golf carts lined up next to the wall of the main building. \u201cI reserved one of the cabins next to the lake. It\u2019s too far to walk with Evan\u2014er, Sasha\u2014barefoot. We can take one of these, or if you want to go scenic, I can call the stable and have them bring around two of the horses.\u201d</p><p>Horses? The place had freaking horses? Damn, how much had Daniel paid for her to get in here?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just take the easy route for now.\u201d Jace moved behind her, running his palms along her arms. \u201cAs lovely as you look all trussed up like this, I\u2019m going to need to undo these. You have to be able to hold on to the cart.\u201d</p><p>She warmed under his touch and the compliment, but kept her mouth shut. She would prove that she could stay quiet even though it was killing her not to ask a hundred questions. Jace unfastened her cuffs and slid them off. She stretched her arms above her head and rolled her wrists.</p><p>When she glanced up, she found Andre watching her, his gaze hot enough to set the cedar-planked building behind them on fire. He put his hands in his pockets, and her focus was drawn downward where the crotch of his black slacks bulged.</p><p>\u201cYour woman\u2019s eyes are wandering, Jace,\u201d Andre teased.</p><p>She quickly looked away, her cheeks heating. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Jace chuckled behind her. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You have permission to look at Andre all you want. And you\u2019re going to have to get used to guys getting hard at the sight of you. You look like a walking wet dream in this getup.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprised I\u2019d say that to you,\u201d he said, his voice close to her ear, his body heat warming her back. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen this side of you. You were always so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful? That\u2019s because you were my foster sister and didn\u2019t need to see this side of me. Didn\u2019t need to see how non-brotherly my feelings had become for you.\u201d</p><p>She stilled.</p><p>His hands gripped her shoulders from behind, causing her to flinch. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Evan. If you don\u2019t hear anything else that I say, hear this. I didn\u2019t sleep with you because I felt sorry for you. I did it because I\u2019d wanted you so bad and for so long that when you offered, I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do the right thing and say no.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and swallowed hard, the revelation rocking her to her foundation. She wanted to ask why\u2014why had he said all those things afterward, turned her away? But she wasn\u2019t sure she needed to hear those answers right now. This was supposed to be free of the past. It wasn\u2019t the time for forgiveness or healing hurt feelings. Venturing into that territory was dangerous. \u201cJace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m going to keep to my promise of no past. I just wanted you to know that before we go any further. Needed you to know that whatever I do with you this weekend isn\u2019t to right some wrong or because I owe you for fucking up back then. It\u2019s because you\u2019re a beautiful woman who\u2019s asking to be dominated. I\u2019ll give you one guess as to what that does to me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to thump harder. He grasped her wrist and drew it low behind her back. Denim rasped against her fingers as he cupped her hand over his rock-hard erection. Her knees wobbled as liquid heat rushed through her.</p><p>\u201cLack of attraction is definitely not a problem. Never has been,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOnly now, I don\u2019t have to hide it.\u201d</p><p>Andre cleared his throat. \u201cUnless you two plan to get it on right here in the doorway, we should probably get a move on.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s lips grazed the curve of her neck before slipping the robe over her shoulders. He took her hand and laced his fingers with hers. \u201cCome on, babe. Andre\u2019s right. No need to rush. We have a few things to discuss first.\u201d</p><p>Rushing was exactly what she wanted to do right now because she feared that if she thought this through too much, she\u2019d be hightailing it out the front gates. But he was right. They probably needed to talk before jumping in, even if it was as two \u201cother people.\u201d This whole lifestyle was a mystery to her, and she had no idea what kind of dominant Jace was, what he would expect from her, and if she could, in fact, handle whatever that was.</p><p>She followed Jace on shaky legs to the cart. Andre sat in the driver\u2019s spot, and Jace joined her on the seat that faced backward. His arm banded around her waist. \u201cHold on, short stuff.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened at the old nickname he used to call her when they were teenagers, the little zing of ancient affection stirring within her. It was affection she didn\u2019t need to reignite. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down her, his eyes flashing with regret. \u201cSorry. It just slipped out.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and looked out at the expanse of vineyards flanking the east side of the property, her chest clenching with cold fingers of fear that she was making a big mistake. That she couldn\u2019t trust her heart to stay out of it with Jace. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just call me whatever a dom calls a sub. No past, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded resolutely as the cart started moving. \u201cRight, pet.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>Jace set his jaw in determination as Andre parked the cart in front of their sprawling cabin. This was a fucking disaster. If he had wanted to venture back into the world of one-on-one, doing it with someone he used to care about was the absolute worst way to go about it. The fact that he was even feeling such a drive to have Evan should\u2019ve been testament enough that this was a bad move.</p><p>But the minute Colby had taken control of her, all of Jace\u2019s solid logic had disintegrated into a cloud of testosterone-laced dust. He\u2019d wanted to break Colby\u2019s fingers one by one for having the nerve to touch her at all. Then Jace had done the stupidest thing of all. Kissed Evan.</p><p>After that, there was no going back. The primitive part of him had staked his claim. She was his. Even if it was only for the weekend. And now he was going to have to deal with the fallout of that decision. The only hope he had left was that maybe she\u2019d become open to the idea of m\u00e9nage, and Andre could come into the picture and ease some of the intensity of the situation. But right now, Jace was done analyzing it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Screw it all\u2014the guilt over how he\u2019d fucked up things in the past, the anger at Evan for leaving and making him worry she was dead on the street somewhere, and the fear that he hadn\u2019t done the one-on-one thing since Diana. All of it was shit he couldn\u2019t do anything about right now.</p><p>What he could do something about was the fact that a beautiful woman\u2014one he\u2019d fantasized about for the last two weeks\u2014wanted him to dominate her, to fuck her. That he could do. Evan clearly didn\u2019t want to dredge up their history, so he definitely was more than happy to go along with that. This was about sex. Plain and simple. That\u2019s all he needed to focus on.</p> <p>He stared past the house to the moonlit lake beyond, channeling the dark part of himself that laid in wait for nights like this, and slipped fully into his dominant role. This is when he felt most comfortable, most free to be himself. Usually he kept it casual and was one of the more laid back doms, subscribing to the belief that fun didn\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive of D/s. But with Evan he was going to need all the armor the dom role could offer him. Boundaries needed to stay hard and clear. She\u2019d said she didn\u2019t want half-assed. Well, she was going to get her wish.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to our humble hacienda.\u201d The cart dipped as Andre climbed out. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone. I\u2019ve got a few things to take care of before I head back to the main building.\u201d</p><p>Jace waited until Andre slipped into the house and then pinned Evan under his gaze. \u201cThe Ranch\u2019s safe word is Texas. No, stop, quit don\u2019t mean anything here. Texas is the only thing that halts whatever\u2019s happening. You can say yellow if you need me to ease off some activity but don\u2019t want to stop everything. If you\u2019re gagged and can\u2019t speak, I\u2019ll give you a hand signal for a safe word. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit, but she nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if your fianc\u00e9 gave you permission to be here. While you\u2019re here, you\u2019re mine. And when you go back home, you will not tell him that I\u2019m the guy you were with. My business is important to me. And no matter how okay Dr. Dan may be with you doing this, no guy wants to work with the man who\u2019s fucked his woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice wavering a bit, but heat flickering in those pale blue eyes.</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted, his confidence about the situation building. She was already feeling it\u2014the rush a sub got when her dom took control. He stood and hooked a finger in the O-ring hanging off her collar to pull her up to stand. He cupped the back of her neck. \u201cDo you have any hard limits\u2014anything you\u2019re absolutely not open to?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted sideways.</p><p>\u201cPet, you need to tell me so that I don\u2019t push you too far.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cFine. I still have a thing about the dark, okay. Blindfolds will be fine as long as I can tell there is light on in the room.\u201d</p><p>The admission tugged at him. She\u2019d never told him why she had that fear, but he knew she\u2019d been left alone for days after her father committed suicide before the authorities had come for her. So he had his suspicions and none of those suspicions were pleasant. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing, so I don\u2019t even know what my limits are.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFair enough. We\u2019ll explore your boundaries together.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He had the urge to lean forward and taste her freshly moistened mouth, but he held back. Patience would make it better for all involved.</p><p>\u201cNow, I want you to go into the house, find the sliding glass doors in the back, and go onto the deck. There\u2019s a hot tub there that looks out on the lake. It should already be heated, but go ahead and turn on the jets. Wait for me there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and moved to head that way, but he caught her arm in a firm grasp.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get in without me. And don\u2019t take off anything. I want the pleasure of undressing you myself.\u201d</p><p>Even in the moonlight, he could see her cheeks color. And hell if that alone didn\u2019t make his cock strain against his zipper. He was used to women who\u2019d been there done that, who weren\u2019t shocked by much. How was it possible that after all these years Evan still had that edge of innocence she\u2019d carried with her at sixteen?</p> <p>Back then, it\u2019d been a glaring warning for him to steer clear, but now . . . Well, now it had him imagining all the things he wanted to do to her to make her skin turn that shade of pink.</p><p>Evan stood in front of the bubbling hot tub, steam swirling with her view of the dark night and the black water of the lake a few yards beyond. It was similar to the night she\u2019d stood on the beach in South Padre, except this time, she wouldn\u2019t be alone. The water wasn\u2019t going to be what caressed her tonight. No, the man who\u2019d haunted the periphery of every fantasy she\u2019d ever conjured was going to take her over. Use her. Give her pleasure.</p><p>A shiver stole over her, and she rubbed her arms through the silk robe. Emotions were spinning through her like numbers on a slot machine.</p><p>Anticipation. Need. Fear.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know exactly what she was getting into, and having Jace be on the other end of it was like playing Russian roulette. But she had a feeling the danger of it was adding to the edgy excitement coursing through her.</p><p>Hot hands gripped her upper arms from behind, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Jace said against her ear, his voice melting over her like butter on hot cornbread. \u201cYou take direction well. That earns you rewards.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her thighs together as damp heat gathered between them, his words as effective as a stroke. \u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t follow instructions?\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was soft and sensual as he ran his hands over her shoulders and pressed against her back. \u201cPlan on being naughty, pet?\u201d</p><p>His blatant and unashamed manner had her normal inhibitions shriveling like grapes in the sun. Jace didn\u2019t apologize for what he wanted, and neither should she. If she was going to do this, she needed to really do this. She tilted her hips, seeking him, and nestled her ass against the steel length of his cock. \u201cDepends on what happens if I am.\u201d</p><p>His fingers found her hair and yanked back, catching her by surprise. He ran his tongue up the column of her neck like a cat licking up cream, and she nearly buckled at the knees. \u201cThen you get punished, which can be fun, too. Just depends how rough you like it, babe.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. Based on how much her sex was throbbing at his tight hold on her hair, she had a sneaking suspicion of which side of the pain fence she would fall on. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He released his grip on her hair and slowly stepped in front of her. His gaze drifted down the length of her as if assessing his prize. \u201cDefinitely too many clothes on. Take off your robe.\u201d</p><p>With trembling hands, she undid the tie at the front and let the robe fall open, revealing her scant bra and panties beneath, then slipped the silk off her shoulders. Jace\u2019s green eyes turned hungry as he stepped forward and ran a finger along the lace edge of her bra. Her nipple tightened to an aching point.</p><p>\u201cSo sexy, pet. You\u2019re going to test my restraint. I find I don\u2019t want to be gentle with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t be,\u201d she said, her words coming out before she could stop them. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted, his eyes boring into hers. \u201cHow\u2019s that fianc\u00e9 of yours going to feel if you go home with marks on you\u2014my marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d she said, her mouth going dry at the thought of Jace marking her, of branding her. \u201cHe knows what goes on here.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIs Dr. Dan really vanilla or is he a guy who gets off knowing his woman is being fucked by someone else? Because I\u2019m not here to get him off.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis is all for me. I swear. This is what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? \u2019Cause there\u2019s nothing pretty or romantic about what I do. It\u2019s raw and rough. You\u2019re mine to use however I want, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her throat contracted, the words turning her on more than she cared to admit. If he was trying to scare her off, it wasn\u2019t working. \u201cYes, sir. I want that. I didn\u2019t come here for flowers and poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve to me how bad you want it, then.\u201d He grasped her shoulder, pushed her down to her knees without finesse, and started unfastening his jeans. The discarded robe protected her knees from the wooden slats of the deck, but the bite of discomfort was still there. For some reason, that only dialed up her excitement more.</p><p>The rasp of his zipper drew her attention to the view in front of her. Jace pulled his fly wide and released his impressive erection. Lord, help her. She\u2019d thought her mind had exaggerated his size because she\u2019d been a virgin at the time and it had hurt, but damn, he had a pretty cock.</p><p>He gave her a predatory stare. \u201cTell me exactly what you\u2019re thinking, pet. I like that look in your eye.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze, a wave of confidence coming with this new role. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I want to taste that beautiful cock, sir.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled into a smile. \u201cWell, well, look who has a dirty mouth. May need to keep it busy to silence you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his shaft and closed the distance between them. With his other hand, he grabbed at her tresses again, tugging hard enough for her scalp to tingle. \u201cOpen for me.\u201d</p><p>She parted her lips, and he moved her head exactly where he wanted it before sliding his cock into her mouth. Slow and easy. She closed her eyes, savoring the salty flavor of his skin, the uniquely male taste. He groaned and titled his head back. \u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. Convince me what a good girl you\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>He controlled her movements with his tight grip on her hair, taking what he wanted without apology. She swirled her tongue around his length, drawing all her focus to making Jace feel as fabulous as she did being there at his feet and at his mercy. She\u2019d never minded giving a guy head, but there was something so different about doing it this way. Of being used for his pleasure. It was intoxicating.</p><p>She boldly raised her gaze to meet his as she pressed the tip of her tongue along the sensitive vein on the bottom and then drew all the way back to lavish attention along the smooth head.</p><p>\u201cAh, shit, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>She took all of him again, so far to the back of her throat she had to work hard to keep her reflexes relaxed. He pumped into her harder, his careful control slipping a bit, and she closed her eyes to enjoy the rush of feminine power, of knowing that she could unglue him, too. His voice was gravelly when he spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re not so sweet and innocent anymore, are you, pet? You\u2019ve learned some tricks.\u201d</p><p>She made a mmm of affirmation, and his cock seemed to swell against her tongue. Trusting her instinct that he probably liked to take it as rough as he liked to give it, she lifted her hand and scraped her nails across the tender skin of his testicles while increasing the suction around his shaft.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, Evan.\u201d He tilted his head back and his fist tightened on her hair. With one last thrust and groan, the heat of his release jetted against the back of her throat.</p><p>She closed her eyes and savored the moment he gave himself over to it. Taking all he had to give her. Quick and dirty and oh so nice.</p><p>A minute passed before he pulled his softening cock from her mouth. She pressed the top of her head against his belly, the hard plane of muscles heaving with his ragged breaths. His hand slid over her scalp, gentle where he\u2019d been rough a moment before. \u201cJesus, that was good. Remind me to reward you for that.\u201d</p><p>She raised her face to look up at him, but the sound of the sliding glass doors opening behind her had her vaulting to her feet. Jace put a firm hand on the crown of her head, pushing her back down. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to get up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He tucked himself back into his jeans and zipped his fly.</p> <p>Andre stepped onto the deck, carrying a tray of sandwiches and bottled soda. He glanced over at the two of them, the corner of his mouth curving. \u201cI thought maybe the two of you would want some dinner. Although, it looks like you may have already jumped to dessert.\u201d</p><p>Evan felt the blush work up the length of her, and her gaze darted to the ground.</p><p>Jace put two fingers under her chin, lifting her face to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed. I don\u2019t want you to feel shame with me or Andre. You look beautiful right now. There\u2019s nothing sexier than a sub giving herself over to this process and pleasing her master. I like others to see what\u2019s mine and wish it were theirs. Andre\u2019s just jealous that you\u2019re not kneeling before him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Andre agreed, setting down the tray and stretching out on one of the lounge chairs that surrounded the hot tub.</p><p>Her gaze wandered over to their new companion. He\u2019d changed out of the slacks and into a pair of black cargo shorts and a snug-fitting T-shirt. And damn, the man looked good\u2014all tawny skin and tightly packed muscle, his dark features a reverse image of Jace\u2019s light ones. He gave her a wicked smile, and the embarrassment she\u2019d felt began to morph into something else, something far more pleasant than shame.</p> <p>\u201cAh, you like Andre looking at you,\u201d Jace observed.</p><p>Her focus snapped back to him.</p><p>\u201cStand up, pet.\u201d Jace put a hand under her elbow and helped her to her feet. \u201cIf you enjoy Andre seeing you like this, then maybe you should give him something to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d she asked, her heartbeat thumping in her ears.</p><p>Jace stepped behind her and walked his fingers along her spine until he reached the hook of her bra. With a flick of his hand, the strap unhinged, and he slid the bra down her arms, exposing her breasts to the night air and to Andre.</p><p>On instinct, her hands lifted to cover herself, but Jace caught her arms and tucked them behind her back. His mouth went to her bare shoulder and teeth grazed her skin. \u201cTell me, Andre, you think my little sub likes you seeing her beautiful tits.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip, feeling vulnerable, but unable to deny the effect the exposure was having on her body. Every part of her ached to be touched, licked. She was so slick with heat she was sure both men could see it soaking her panties.</p><p>Andre sat up on his elbows, the reflection of the hot tub lights flickering in his brown eyes. \u201cI would say those nipples are begging to be tasted. They\u2019re so tight and pink.\u201d</p><p>Jace stepped back around her and let his gaze roll slowly over her. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. Hook your arms around the railing behind you, pet, and keep them there.\u201d</p><p>She followed his instructions, the movement causing her small breasts to jut out further. Jace\u2019s hands gripped her waist then slid up and over her ribs until he plumped both breasts in his palms. Her breath quickened at his firm touch. She arched back, needing more.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Evan.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d used her real name for the second time, but she no longer cared what he called her as long as he gave her some relief. \u201cPlease. I need your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Andre will see,\u201d he pointed out, his tone filled with feigned concern.</p><p>\u201cLet him,\u201d she gasped. \u201cJust please.\u201d</p> <p>His head dipped down and his mouth closed over one of her nipples, causing her to cry out. He sucked and licked on one side and used his hand on the opposite breast, rolling the nipple between his fingers and sending shots of pleasure straight to her core.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lordy,\u201d she murmured, her head lolling back.</p><p>His teeth grazed against the hardened nub, then bit. She jolted at the sharp snap of pain, but then pleasure, hot and wicked, chased the sensation. Holy shit. Her nipples had always been wonderfully sensitive, but hell if she wasn\u2019t on the verge of coming from that stimulation alone.</p><p>A sound akin to a growl rumbled low and deep from Jace as he lifted his head. \u201cYou like being watched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and rasped a thumb over her nipple. \u201cI think you do know. How wet did you get for me that day on stage?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered at the low, coaxing tone of his voice, the devil inviting her to take his hand for a little walk.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think? I think if the lights hadn\u2019t gone out, you would\u2019ve let me slide my hands up the rest of the way under that dress, would\u2019ve let me fuck you with my fingers while your fianc\u00e9 and all those people watched.\u201d His hand traced down her belly and teased at the band of her panties, but his eyes never left hers.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His gaze turned hooded as he moved his hand beneath the triangle of silk and found her wet heat. She hissed, so ready to tip over the edge. Just a few glides over her clit would do it.</p><p>\u201cThat night I stroked my cock, remembering the sweet scent of your pussy, all slick and ready for me. Imagined how good you would feel coming around me.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back and whimpered as he dipped two fingers inside her. \u201cShit. Sir, please, I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, look how nicely you asked. You\u2019re a quick learner.\u201d In one swift motion, he yanked her panties down and off, leaving her fully naked against the railing. The cool air licked at her freshly shaven skin. She\u2019d made the last-minute decision the night before to shave herself bare, and suddenly she was very, very happy she had made that call. Jace went to his knees, grasping the backs of her legs and lifting them. \u201cJust hold on, baby.\u201d</p><p>She locked her arms more tightly around the railing behind her, her muscles straining, but she was far beyond feeling pain. Jace spread her thighs wide and guided her legs over his shoulders, putting his mouth centimeters from her sex. Using the tip of his tongue, he traced the delicate folds as if he had all the time in the world, teasing her, making her writhe against him. His hands clamped down hard on her thighs, holding her in place for his painstakingly gentle assault.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said, kissing the inside of her thigh, so close to where she really wanted his mouth. \u201cYou taste so good. I may just do this all night.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI won\u2019t survive it. I . . . It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>The words tumbled out before she had time to think them through, and she wanted to smack her forehead when she realized what she\u2019d said.</p><p>Jace\u2019s lips paused along the trail he was kissing up her thigh. \u201cBaby, if that boyfriend of yours isn\u2019t worshipping this beautiful cunt every chance he gets, he deserves to have some other guy fuck you because that\u2019s a goddamned crime.\u201d</p><p>His words were coarse, dirty, but the heat behind them had her temperature climbing as high as the steaming hot tub behind him. No longer in teasing mode, Jace ran the flat of his tongue along her pussy, sending tremors through her entire body. Then he locked his lips over her, sucking her clit into his mouth.</p><p>The sharp cry that ripped out of her was unrecognizable to her own ears. Jace hummed his approval against her skin, moving his mouth and tongue over her with the skill of a man who knew his way around a woman\u2019s body.</p><p>Another wave of hot moisture flooded her sex, and the erotic sounds of his mouth licking and sucking against her skin had her mind buzzing and her body quivering. Pleasure, fast and fierce, lashed at her, driving her higher and higher. It had been . . . so . . . damn . . . long. No matter how much she had tried to convince herself, masturbation had nothing on this\u2014nothing on a real man whose sole intent was to send her into oblivion.</p><p>One of Jace\u2019s hands left her thigh and two fingers dipped inside her. Her inner muscles clenched around him, her body\u2019s need turning desperate. Oh, my. She arched up, but Jace didn\u2019t lose his hold on her. His fingers pumped inside her, while his lips and tongue paid homage to every inch of her sex.</p><p>She tried to hold off for another moment, not ready for the mind-blowing sensations to end. But when he sucked her clit back between his lips and nipped at her with his teeth, every cell inside her seemed to split open.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Jace!\u201d Keening cries passed her lips, and her hips rocked against his mouth as her orgasm overtook her. She didn\u2019t care that they were outside, that someone was watching, or that the sounds coming from her throat were probably broadcasting her climax for anyone in a one-mile radius. In fact, she kind of liked the exposure\u2014spread and open to this man\u2014offering her pleasure to him. To Jace.</p><p>Sweat slicked her body despite the cool evening, and as the remnants of her release coursed through her, her arms begin to slip from the rail behind her. She quickly tried to adjust, grasping for purchase, but her arms trembled and gave out. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>She winced, expecting to hit the ground, but her back landed on something hard and warm. Two arms. \u201cI got you, bella. Easy.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her eyes focusing on Andre, who stared down at her, smiling. He eased her upper body to the ground as Jace gently grabbed her thighs and slipped out from under them. The two of them set her down on top of her discarded robe.</p><p>Jace pushed a lock of damp hair off her forehead as Andre stepped away. \u201cYou okay, pet?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a tentative smile, suddenly feeling shy about her very vocal display. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my arms, but I\u2019m pretty fantastic otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and leaned forward, capturing her mouth with his. Her eyes fluttered closed, and her hands immediately laced in his hair. This kiss started off soft and gentle, but soon his tongue parted her lips and took possession of her mouth. His spicy flavor mixed with the taste of her own arousal, which still clung to his lips. Despite the rocking orgasm seconds before, desire, hot and heavy, rose anew. Good Lord, the man could kiss.</p><p>Just as she was about to be bold and let her hands travel to more than his hair, he pulled back. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop before I haul you off to fuck you without feeding you dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not that hungry.\u201d</p><p>Amusement crinkled the corners of his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to take care of you right now. And I know new subs are famous for skipping meals their first day here because of nerves.\u201d</p><p>She looked down guiltily. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast.</p><p>He ran a thumb over her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The night is young.\u201d</p><p>With that, he climbed to his feet, bent down, and swept her up into his arms. She let out a little sound of surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in the house to take care of a few things. You are going into the hot tub to relax and eat something.\u201d He cocked his head to the side. \u201cAndre, I\u2019m putting you in charge of her. Make sure she eats.\u201d</p><p>Before she realized what was happening, he lowered her into the bubbling tub. The heated water enveloped her naked body, and her gaze shot to Andre.</p><p>Jace ran a hand over her hair. \u201cAre you okay staying with Andre alone?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel any threat from Andre. In fact, just looking at him made her want to praise God for creating the male form. But what was her role? Was she supposed to please Jace\u2019s friends, too? The thought sent a surprising jolt of desire through her. \u201cYes, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jace gave her a reassuring smile. \u201cAndre is one of my best friends. I\u2019d trust him with my life, so I trust him with you. If at any point you want to touch him this weekend, you have my permission. But he won\u2019t touch you unless you ask him to. You understand?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if it was the temperature of the water or the mind-blowing dynamic Jace had just laid on her, but she felt a bit lightheaded. She nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, chill, eat. I\u2019ll be back for you in a little while.\u201d</p><p>She listened to Jace\u2019s retreating footsteps as Andre leaned forward and propped his forearms on the side of the hot tub. \u201cSo, gorgeous, mind if I join you in there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Evan took a deep breath\u2014as if that would do a damn bit of good\u2014and nodded at Andre. \u201cSure. Come on in.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed an easy smile and grabbed the tray of sandwiches off the lounge chair and set it on the side of the hot tub. \u201cStart eating, bella. I have a feeling Jace has big plans for you, and he won\u2019t put up with you skipping meals. Don\u2019t want you passing out.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way he said bella\u2014bey-yah\u2014made her all fluttery inside. Like her female genes were wired to be a sucker for the way that spice-laced accent rolled off his tongue. Made her want to find out if those lips tasted as good as his words.</p><p>She reached over and grabbed one of the sandwiches to give her shaky hands something to do. Her normally voracious appetite had been non-existent all day, but after round one with Jace, she was already feeling a little weak. Sustenance wasn\u2019t optional. She bit into the sandwich right as Andre peeled off his T-shirt.</p><p>Bad idea. She nearly choked on the first bite.</p><p>Hot damn, he was beautiful\u2014hard, well-honed muscles, naturally tan skin, and a faint trail of black hair tracking from his navel down. Her gaze traveled up his torso and paused at silver glinting in the moonlight. Nipple rings. She\u2019d almost forgotten that sexy little detail from the night in South Padre. There was something so darkly enticing about that kind of piercing on a man. A blatant, unapologetic pronouncement of sexuality.</p> <p>She bit her lip, wondering what it would be like to run her tongue over one of the rings, to tug it with her teeth. She shoved another bite of sandwich into her mouth before she did something stupid. Like give Andre permission to do whatever the hell he wanted to her.</p><p>He hooked his thumbs in the waistband of his shorts and then glanced down at her. She must\u2019ve looked like a deer in headlights; she certainly felt like one. He chuckled. \u201cSorry. Habit. I\u2019ll keep these on.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she was relieved by his decision or damn disappointed. God, what the hell was wrong with her? She already had an equally potent man to herself for the weekend. How could she even be tempted to want more than that? She barely knew if she could handle Jace without melting into a puddle of uselessness.</p><p>Andre straddled the side of the tub and then slid into the water, taking a seat on the opposite side from her. \u201cAhh, that\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Hell yes, it was. She was suddenly very happy for the water concealing her body because she was certain her nipples had hardened as soon as he\u2019d gotten near. Ugh. This had to be a side effect of long-term abstinence.</p><p>He stretched his arms out along the edge of the hot tub and sank lower, letting his head rest against the side, but keeping his eyes on her. \u201cRelax, Evan. Jace wasn\u2019t kidding. I\u2019m not going to make a move on you.\u201d</p> <p>Unless she asked. He didn\u2019t say it, but the rest of the sentence hung in the steam-filled air between them. She set her sandwich down. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not sure I get this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cDefine this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, so many questions springing to her lips she didn\u2019t even know where to start. \u201cObviously I\u2019m new to the whole BDSM scene, but I assumed that possessiveness went together with dominance. I guess I\u2019m confused about Jace being cool if I touched another guy when he took me on as his slave, sub, whatever, for the weekend. He certainly didn\u2019t seem to want Colby around me.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. \u201cJace would most definitely not be cool with you pursuing some other guy. And God help the man who tried to flirt with you while you\u2019re here with Jace this weekend. Fists would fly.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knitted. \u201cThen why\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Andre frowned as if trying to formulate an explanation she could understand. \u201cJace and I are roommates and long-time friends. He trusts me. We share a lot.\u201d</p><p>Awareness smacked her over the head like a two-by-four. Duh. Why hadn\u2019t that possibility hit her before? \u201cYou share women.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, sweet Jesus. Thoughts of the two of them naked, both taking what they wanted from her, assailed her. Her internal thermometer jumped back into the red zone. But at the same time, the idea scared the shit out of her. Jace was already an overwhelming prospect, his dominance promising to send her to a place she hadn\u2019t been before. She wasn\u2019t entirely convinced she could handle him alone, much less add Andre to the mix. It would be sensory overload.</p><p>Although . . .</p><p>She snuck another glance at Andre. If she really did want to keep this purely physical with no risk of her emotions getting involved, maybe sensory overload was exactly what she needed. The third person could create sort of a buffer, ensuring no quiet one-on-one intimate moments with Jace. Just carnal indulgence. Her mind whirled with possibilities.</p><p>All she managed to say was \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s no pressure here. We know you didn\u2019t list m\u00e9nage as something you were open to right now. I think the only reason Jace allowed me out here to watch is he suspects you have an exhibitionist streak.\u201d</p><p>If her cheeks weren\u2019t already flushed from the warm water, she would\u2019ve turned bright red. She put her hands over her face. \u201cI still can\u2019t even believe I did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, bumping his foot against hers under the water and making her look up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed. You were beautiful, and it was sexy as hell. I feel privileged that you let me stay and watch.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small smile, embarrassment still flaring bright within her. \u201cSo is that why you like m\u00e9nage? Because you get to watch as well as participate?\u201d</p><p>He moved forward, coming within inches of her as he reached past her for one of the sodas on the sandwich tray. Wisps of his cologne wafted past her\u2014a soft musk with notes of ginger. Her breath caught with the knowledge that she wanted to reach out and touch him, to lick off the beads of water that tracked down his well-built chest, but she kept her hands\u2014and tongue\u2014to herself. He slid back to his spot and took a swig of the drink.</p><p>\u201cYes, I won\u2019t lie. Seeing another guy pleasuring a woman, bringing her to the edge, definitely does it for me. As does having someone watch me do the same thing. But m\u00e9nage is more than that. It pushes everyone to heights you can\u2019t get to with just two people. It\u2019s intense and edgy. Add in BDSM to that and it\u2019s unbelievably hot.\u201d</p><p>Desire stirred deep within her at the picture he painted. Then another thought hit her, but she wrangled in her next question before it slipped out.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAsk your question, bella. I can see it on your face that you just swallowed one back.\u201d</p><p>God, was her every thought that obvious? Or was it just a dom thing to be able to read people so well? She cleared her throat. \u201cOkay, so, when you and Jace are sharing, do you two, you know . . . interact?\u201d</p><p>The idea sent a strange thrill humming through her veins even though it shouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d seen enough male-on-male action at home to last a lifetime.</p><p>He glanced past her shoulder as if to make sure Jace hadn\u2019t come out of the house yet. \u201cIt happens from time to time. Things get hot, and boundaries that exist outside the doors tend to weaken. But a woman usually seeks m\u00e9nage because she wants all the focus on her, so we typically oblige that desire.\u201d</p><p>She considered that for a moment. \u201cSo are you and Jace together outside of here?\u201d</p><p>His smile turned wry. \u201cWe\u2019re not lovers, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. We keep the sexual play confined to when we\u2019re with a woman. Jace is pretty open sexually, but he\u2019s primarily straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to elaborate? Or is that too personal of a question?\u201d</p><p>He took another long sip from his bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. And honestly, if I could figure out a hard and fast label for it I would. But I guess most would call me bisexual. My relationships have been exclusively with women. But I do find myself on occasion sexually attracted to a guy and have acted on it . . . within the confines of a place like this. I don\u2019t broadcast it. The people in my life wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess m\u00e9nage serves a few purposes for you then. The whole cake and eat it too thing.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve got the whole cake, but a pretty good slice I guess.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, something in his tone telling her that wasn\u2019t the full story, but it wasn\u2019t her business. She grabbed her own soda and uncapped it. \u201cSo what happens when Jace takes on someone solo like this? Do you go and find someone as well?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll figure that out. He hasn\u2019t gone solo in years.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, the bottle halfway to her mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jace paced around the living room. He\u2019d set Evan up to be alone with Andre, thinking that his oh-so-suave friend would open up her mind to the possibility of m\u00e9nage. This one-on-one thing was crazy. Jace hadn\u2019t even fucked her yet, and he was already surging with things that hadn\u2019t been in his vocabulary in years\u2014possessiveness, jealousy, protectiveness. He could put a fist through the wall knowing that in a few days she\u2019d return to Dr. Dan\u2019s bed\u2014a guy who clearly wasn\u2019t giving her what she needed, at least not in the bedroom.</p><p>Jace raked his hands through his hair. What the fuck was wrong with him? He should\u2019ve known better. Something about Evan had always tested his limits, had made him question himself at every turn, and apparently her effect on him hadn\u2019t dimmed with time.</p><p>Damn, he needed to change this dynamic fast or he was going to end up getting himself in trouble. But the thought of Andre entering the picture had him all knotted up. Sharing a woman was the ultimate turn on for him. It fed all his kinks in the most decadent ways. And he could already tell Evan was attracted to Andre. There was no doubt she\u2019d gotten off on him watching as Jace made her come. But now Jace had this ridiculous urge to race back out to the deck, pluck her out of the water, and hoard her away all for himself.</p><p>What if he walked out there and she was fooling around with Andre? Would he be turned on like he normally would be or would he want to kick Andre\u2019s ass for touching her? He sank onto the leather chair in the living room with a groan. Christ, he didn\u2019t know the answer.</p><p>Evan\u2019s melodic laugh drifted into the house from the deck, hitting him straight in the solar plexus. Andre was making her laugh. Probably laying on that charm that came so easy to him and flirting with her in Spanish, which seemed to get women to drop their panties faster than anything Jace had ever seen. Smooth motherfucker.</p><p>Or maybe Andre had already won Evan over and was running his lips along the tender column of her neck, tickling her with his tongue, sliding his hands over those beautiful tits and nestling himself between her naked thighs.</p><p>Jace shot to his feet and stormed toward the back of the house. He shoved open the door and steeled himself for what he may find when he stepped onto the deck. But as the hot tub came into view, all he saw was Andre sitting opposite Evan, a broad smile on his face. His friend\u2019s eyes darted Jace\u2019s way, and Evan turned her head.</p><p>Her skin had gone dewy from the steam and her normally straight hair was curling around her face. She looked like a beautiful water nymph come to life. A tentative smile teased at the corner of her mouth along with a definite ripple of apprehension. The combination nearly sucked the air from his chest. She was happy to see him, but was also knocked a bit off balance by his presence. Everything a sub should feel for her dom.</p><p>The women he chose to be with these days didn\u2019t take the sub thing all that seriously. It was fun and games. Roles played. He kept it at that level now because true D/s stripped down too much, not just for the sub but for the dominant. It exposed people\u2019s deepest vulnerabilities, shone light into those ugly corners. He\u2019d learned that the hard way. But Evan had never played this game, so she was coming at it green, with an honesty that he was finding hard to resist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He leaned against the railing of the deck. \u201cSo what\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>Evan shot Andre a warning look. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>Andre grinned. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get Evan to spill the details about her naughty cop fantasy.\u201d</p><p>She splashed water at him. \u201cTraitor.\u201d</p><p>Jace couldn\u2019t stop the laugh that bubbled out. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t blame the guy for asking, Ev. He is a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Mortification crossed her face. \u201cI\u2019m just going to drown myself now and save myself the rest of this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, had he not told you that part yet?\u201d Jace asked, enjoying the fact that she could be naked in a hot tub, talking to two guys who\u2019d seen her screaming in orgasm already, but still be embarrassed about a dirty fantasy.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shot Andre a glare.</p><p>He held up his palms. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. But you should at least tell Jace about it. How\u2019s your dom supposed to know how to please you if you don\u2019t tell him what turns you on? Everyone has those fantasies that they\u2019re afraid to tell others. That\u2019s the beauty of a place like this. You don\u2019t have to keep them tucked away.\u201d</p><p>Jace watched as she gnawed her lip, her nerves evident. But he could tell the temptation to open up to them was there, too. He walked over to the edge of the hot tub and propped his forearms on it.</p><p>\u201cAs my sub, I expect you to be open with me. If you\u2019re not, I\u2019ll eventually draw out whatever those desires are by other means. You won\u2019t be able to hide them forever. But I\u2019m not going to command you to share with us right now if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d He reached out and cupped her cheek, holding her gaze. \u201cBut know that you\u2019re safe with me. And with Andre. No judgment. I guarantee that for every dark fantasy you have, we probably have a hundred more sordid ones to match. Especially Andre, he\u2019s a sick bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, wait a second,\u201d Andre protested.</p><p>She smiled and the anxiety pinching her features seemed to ease as she took in his words. She nodded, her eyes not leaving his. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He had the urge to bend down and press his lips to hers. Just because. But he held off. If they weren\u2019t in the middle of a D/s scene, he needed to keep his distance. That kind of casual intimacy was not what either of them had signed up for. \u201cLet me grab you a towel and get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>The minute he turned his back, her soft voice halted him. \u201cI . . . I have a capture fantasy.\u201d</p><p>The words shot straight to his groin and snapped him right back to what he was supposed to be focused on with Evan\u2014sex. But he didn\u2019t move, knowing that if he faced her she may lose her nerve to continue. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo rogue cops. Arresting me. Being rough. Taking what they want from me however they want it. Forcing me to get them off.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. Jace closed his eyes and took a long breath, his body thrumming from the erotic images assaulting his brain. His cock hardened to the point of agony. She wanted to be manhandled and fucked by two men? The idea set fire to the darkest parts of him\u2014appealed to the primitive core of his dominant streak.</p><p>Part of him wanted to whirl around, grab her, and make that fantasy come true for her. Right. This. Minute. But she wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of thing yet. He\u2019d never done a capture scene, but he knew they were seriously intense. The pretense of no consent\u2014even with a safe word\u2014was a powerful thing for the psyche to process. For someone so new to D/s, she could get too freaked out to enjoy it. Plus, he had no idea if she was emotionally strong enough to handle that kind of mind fuck. He hadn\u2019t forgotten those cuts he\u2019d found on her the night they\u2019d slept together.</p><p>A frown touched his lips. There was no way he could take that risk with her. That was the kind of thing you did with a long-term partner, one you\u2019d built total trust with. The type of relationship he\u2019d never have with her, or anyone else for that matter. He wasn\u2019t built for trust anymore.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t mean they still couldn\u2019t have a great time tonight doing a whole list of other things. His frown lifted, his darkening mood rallying at the thought.</p> <p>He grabbed a thick towel from one of the benches and went back to the hot tub. \u201cThank you for trusting us with that. I know that wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stared down at the water. Jace ventured a glance at Andre and almost burst out laughing. The guy looked like he was in pain. Probably from the raging hard-on he suspected Andre was hiding beneath the water.</p><p>Andre checked that Evan wasn\u2019t looking in his direction and mouthed, \u201cLucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jace grinned, although he did feel a little sorry for the guy. Andre had watched Evan get off, sat with her while she was naked, and had heard about a fantasy that he could definitely help fulfill. All without being invited into their bed for the night.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here, babe,\u201d Jace said, offering a hand to Evan.</p><p>She peeked up at him from under her lashes, but before she took his hand, she slid along the bench of the hot tub toward Andre. Andre froze as she neared him, as if he were afraid if he moved anything, he\u2019d maul her. Lifting out of the water, high enough to give both men a view of the top curve of her luscious breasts, she leaned over and laid a lingering kiss on his cheek. Andre closed his eyes, and Jace could almost see him quivering with restraint.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the chat, Andre. And for being such a gentleman,\u201d she said, a shy note to her voice.</p><p>Andre cleared his throat. \u201cAnytime, bella. Any. Time.\u201d</p><p>Jace heard Andre\u2019s unspoken offer. I want you. Just ask. He doubted Evan had missed the intent behind the words.</p><p>Something tightened low in Jace\u2019s gut, the conflicting feelings boiling over. Seeing the little spark between her and Andre had him hot all over, but also ridiculously jealous. Her cop fantasy proved she at least was a little open to m\u00e9nage, so he could probably guide her down that path. And Lord, she\u2019d be gorgeous bound and spread for the two of them. But goddamn it, he didn\u2019t know if he could share her.</p><p>And sharing was what he did. Who he was.</p><p>Maybe he just needed to get this first time out of his system with her. Satisfy whatever primal part of him wanted to stake his claim on her before Andre touched her.</p><p>Yeah, that had to be it.</p><p>Evan glided back to the spot in front of him and took his hand, her eyes like blue fire. \u201cI\u2019m all yours, sir.\u201d</p><p>The intent in her words and resolute expression made every cell in his body vibrate with anticipation. His concerns melted away under her hungry gaze.</p><p>To hell with the psychoanalysis. All he needed right now was Evan.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>He\u2019d figure out the rest later.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Evan followed Jace into the house, her legs like Jell-O beneath her after the long soak in the hot tub and the erotic overload of sharing her fantasies with the two men. But the wobbly muscles didn\u2019t prevent tension from reclaiming her as she mulled over her talk with Andre.</p><p>She pulled the towel more snugly around her and took a deep breath. \u201cJace?\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the doorway to the bedroom and turned around to look at her, frowning when he saw her expression. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>She had the urge to look down at the floor, but forced herself to keep her gaze. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the doorframe. \u201cI thought we already covered that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndre said you never take on a sub alone. That you always do m\u00e9nage.\u201d</p><p>His jaw muscle flexed. \u201cAndre has a big mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you doing this with me?\u201d</p><p>He pushed off the doorjamb and pointed to the spot in front of him. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, she walked the few steps forward to stand before him.</p><p>He cupped the back of her neck and captured her gaze. \u201cI told you. I\u2019m doing this because I want you. No, I don\u2019t do one-on-one a lot\u2014that\u2019s why I hesitated at initiation. But when I saw you with Colby, I realized that even if you weren\u2019t into m\u00e9nage, you belonged in my bed this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Her chilled skin warmed under his words and possessive tone. She nodded and swallowed hard, building up courage for her next words. \u201cI\u2019m open, Jace.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on her neck, making the collar dig into her tender skin. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She shifted her weight from foot to foot, her nervous energy fighting to break loose, but kept her eyes on his. \u201cI\u2019m open to what you like\u2014to m\u00e9nage, to you and Andre.\u201d</p><p>A storm cloud crossed his face, as if her proclamation both pleased him and pissed him off all at the same time. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to change your limits for me, Evan. I don\u2019t need m\u00e9nage to enjoy myself. You\u2019re more than enough alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I\u2019m curious?\u201d she said, her voice gaining some strength despite her frantically beating heart. \u201cI checked no for m\u00e9nage because I was already freaked out enough turning myself over to one stranger. Not because the idea of two guys isn\u2019t appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now the thought of me sharing you with Andre turns you on?\u201d</p><p>Her body shuddered with a hell yes but she kept her response neutral. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can both be pretty demanding,\u201d he said, his voice darkly sensual as he threaded his fingers through the damp hair at her nape. \u201cWhat makes you think you can handle us both?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin up. \u201cWhat makes you think I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>His lips curled in a wicked smile. \u201cConfident, aren\u2019t we? Drop the towel. Let\u2019s see how you handle your own master first. Then I\u2019ll determine if you\u2019ve earned the pleasure of being shared. M\u00e9nage is not for the faint of heart, pet.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the hand that was holding the towel around her and allowed the terrycloth to fall to the floor. Unashamed. Aching for him to touch her. \u201cI\u2019m tougher than I look, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have no doubt about that.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slow once over and ran his hand down her back until he cupped her ass and drew her against him. She didn\u2019t resist. \u201cGood girl. When you\u2019re with me, that\u2019s all I want to see you wearing. My collar and that pretty flush you get when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>He seated the crotch of his jeans against her sensitive flesh, sending ripples of pleasure through her. Her fists balled against his T-shirt. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head, kissing the sensitive spot beneath her ear. \u201cNow, let me show you what happens when you question your master and make unsolicited suggestions.\u201d</p><p>In one effortless motion, he hoisted her up over his shoulder, placing her face against his back, and smacked a palm against her bare ass. Hard.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d He locked his arm around the backs of her thighs and carried her into the bedroom, leaving the door open behind them.</p><p>She bit her lip as the stinging began to tingle. Oh, my.</p><p>The bedroom was a good bit bigger than the one in her cabin, but looked to be decorated in the same rustic style. Nice cozy bungalow. The only things that alluded to its purpose were the metal rings hanging from some of the walls. She caught a glimpse of the bed in the mirror above the dresser and saw that Jace was carrying her over to the foot of the bed where a long padded table was set up.</p><p>He sat her down on the edge of it. \u201cFace down, pet.\u201d</p><p>She looked to his face to try to get a read on what he was going to do, but his expression was stoic.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me tell you again.\u201d</p><p>Hurriedly, she turned over on her stomach and moved to the end of the table. It was a massage table of sorts, but she doubted he was going to give her a rubdown. She rested her head in the cushioned face cradle, her heartbeat pounding so loud she didn\u2019t catch his next command.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re earning more punishment by hesitating. I said lift your head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She followed his instructions and he tied a band of silk around her eyes, blocking out most of the light. Anxiety wound through her.</p><p>A hand brushed over her hair. \u201cYou have my word that I won\u2019t turn out the lights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, his reassurance easing her a bit.</p><p>He grasped her wrist, drew it down the side of the table, and slid something around it. The clink of metal echoed through the room as he locked the cuff to the leg of the table. She pulled back, testing the hold, but the cuff didn\u2019t give at all. She could flex her wrists but that was it. He quickly followed with the same treatment on her other arm. A rush of nerves went through her.</p><p>\u201cJace, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thwack! His hand landed on the back of her thigh, making her jolt. \u201cYour job is not to think, pet. Your job is to feel. Trust that I know what you need.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her protest, the sting from the spanking sending a bolt of hallelujah straight between her legs. Whoa. She wasn\u2019t a stranger to pain being linked to relief\u2014her years of cutting had taught her that. But never had she considered it could be arousing.</p> <p>His finger traced the area on her thigh he had spanked. \u201cYou know how fucking sexy you look with my handprint marking you? You look better than the art hanging in my store.\u201d</p><p>Her hands flexed in the bindings, the words rolling over her like sensual fire. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>His tongue replaced his finger as he drew it along the back of her leg, licking her burning skin. Her thighs pressed together as moisture, hot and slick, coated her sex. She had the urge to press against the table, provide some relief to her clit as it swelled to an aching mass. He locked a hand over her other leg to keep her from squirming. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to stimulate yourself without my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I bet you can.\u201d His hand came down on her ass again and she moaned. \u201cYou like being spanked, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d It was a lie. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to admit how much it was turning her on. If he kept at it, she wasn\u2019t entirely convinced she wouldn\u2019t come simply from that and the slight brush of the table\u2019s padding against her clit.</p> <p>His chuckle was low and dangerous. \u201cSo if I slid my hand between those beautiful legs of yours, I wouldn\u2019t find that pussy wet and clenching for my cock?\u201d</p><p>His crude words sent a hot shudder through her, and her inner muscles flexed as if punctuating the accusation. Her pulse seemed to relocate and settle directly behind her clit, her body going into full-out begging mode. Unable to fight off the need, she spread her thighs for him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find out, sir?\u201d</p><p>He made a tsking sound. \u201cSuch a smart mouth, sub. Need to teach you some manners.\u201d</p><p>A metallic sound filled her ears and the lower end of the table collapsed beneath her. She gasped. His hands caught her legs before she could fall, and he lowered them until she was standing on the balls of her feet, her arches stretched. The part of the table still supporting her torso angled downward until she was prone in a bent-over position. Totally helpless.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs.\u201d Jace nudged her feet apart with his foot. \u201cYou want me to find out how wet you are, then show me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hammered against her ribs as she followed his instruction, making herself as physically vulnerable as she\u2019d ever been. He could do whatever he wanted to her in this position, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him. She squeezed her eyes shut as need railroaded through her. The loss of control shouldn\u2019t excite her like this, but hell if she could stop her body from responding.</p><p>Jace ran his hand up her inner thigh and palmed her sex, gripping her like he owned it. Like her pussy had been created for him and he\u2019d only leased it to her for a while. He rocked his hand against her, painting her delicate skin with her juices. \u201cMmm. So slick and hot for me already. Good girl.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered. The pressure against her clit was maddening, pushing her closer and closer to the edge. She moved her hips in time with the motion of his hand, chasing the orgasm that hovered on the horizon. But the stimulation wasn\u2019t enough. She needed Jace inside her, filling her, driving into her.</p> <p>\u201cStop squirming.\u201d He smacked the flat of his fingers against her cunt, sending a rocket of shocking pleasure straight up her spine.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she panted. \u201cJace, I need more.\u201d</p><p>Blessedly, he put his fingers against her again. His other hand caressed her back, her tailbone, drawing lower and lower until his fingertip brushed along the cleft of her ass. \u201cHow much more, babe?\u201d</p><p>Her muscles automatically flinched, but the position had her spread for his perusal, and there was no escaping. His fingertip grazed the untried opening, the feather-light touch sending bolts through her, making her buck against her bindings. Holy fuck. Was that supposed to feel that good?</p><p>\u201cMmm, so responsive,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHave you ever been taken here, pet?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead into the table, the combination of sensations and his suggestion nearly undoing her. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to do m\u00e9nage? What if one of us wants to fuck your sweet ass while you ride the other\u2019s cock?\u201d</p><p>She felt lightheaded and more turned on than she\u2019d ever remembered being in her life. Forming words had to happen between the sharp breaths she was dragging in. \u201cJust because I haven\u2019t . . . done it before . . . doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m . . . unwilling. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer, pet. Here\u2019s to exploring your limits.\u201d Cool and slippery liquid replaced his light touch for a moment, eliciting a squeak of surprise from her, and then his finger was back and no longer tentative. He smoothed the lubricant over her opening, teasing her and lighting up all of her nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jace. I\u2019m going to come. Please, I want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo coming until I give you permission. If you go before, I won\u2019t give you what you want.\u201d He moved his finger against her ass and pushed gently, easing past the resistant ring of muscle, and instantly vaulting her to another level of bliss\u2014the dark, forbidden thrill of it pinging through her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she ground out, trying to move against him, wanting him to pump forward. To move.</p><p>\u201cHold on, baby, not yet,\u201d he said, slowly moving his finger back and forth and removing his other hand from her clit. \u201cNot until I feel you around me.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the rasp of his zipper, the sound of him tearing a condom wrapper open\u2014no doubt with his teeth since his other hand was busy fucking her ass with a maddeningly slow pace. And then he was against her, the tip of his cock brushing against her pussy.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jace. Please.\u201d She knew she was begging. Sounded desperate. She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cOh, pet, you sound so pretty begging for my cock. I could get used to the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>Within one blissful second, he was thrusting forward, filling her, stretching her until she thought the sheer onslaught of sensation would kill her. It had been so long since she\u2019d been with anyone and never had she experienced something like this. The combination of his long cock inside her, the slide of his finger in her ass, and the bindings cutting into her arms had her riding an unfamiliar high. One she didn\u2019t want to come down from. It was edgy and disorienting . . . and freeing.</p><p>Jace groaned as he seated himself fully inside her then drew back, rocking her against the table with each thrust, the movement providing perfect stimulation to her clit. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful like this, Evan. Bound and pleading for release. Even if you didn\u2019t feel like heaven around my cock, I could come just looking at you.\u201d</p><p>Her breaths were coming short and fast now, his words only pushing her higher, her orgasm rushing toward her like a freight train. His pace increased, pistoning into her with the singular focus of launching them into the stratosphere.</p><p>She fought hard, clinging to the last vestige of control she had over her orgasm, the double assault of sensation barreling her toward oblivion. She balled her fists tighter, her fingernails digging into her palms.</p><p>He moved a second finger inside her back opening as he fucked her hard and fierce. Her senses shorted out\u2014the smack of skin against skin, the scent of sweat and arousal, and Jace inside her all twining into a ball of pulsing light behind her eyelids. She couldn\u2019t hold on.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jace demanded, his own dwindling control lacing his voice. \u201cCome for me, baby. Let me feel you let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace!\u201d A rough scream ripped out of her chest and metal clanged as she reared up against her bindings and let the orgasm sweep her under. Dots of color exploded in her vision and for a moment, she lost all sense of where she was.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck . . . Yes.\u201d Jace\u2019s groan soon joined with hers as he buried deep and gave her his own pounding release.</p><p>His body collapsed against her when he was finished, the two of them a heaving pile of sweat-slicked, shaky limbs.</p><p>Seconds passed. Or was it minutes? Evan wasn\u2019t sure. All she was sure of was that Jace was draped across her back, his cock still inside her, and she\u2019d never felt so sated in her life.</p><p>She\u2019d always enjoyed sex, but this was something unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced before. She had no idea it could be so intense, so all-encompassing. So fucking good.</p><p>Jace kissed the back of her shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I think so?\u201d she said, her voice hoarse.</p><p>He gave a little laugh, his chest bouncing against her back before he pushed up and off her. He slipped off her blindfold. \u201cLet me get cleaned up real quick, and I\u2019ll come get you out of these bindings.\u201d</p><p>He left her alone for a minute, and she heard the sink turn on and off, then he was back at her side, clad in a pair of pajama pants, a smile teasing at the corners of his mouth. He freed her wrists, helped her off the table, and slipped a fluffy terrycloth robe around her before settling her onto the bed.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the mattress and stared down at her, looking like he had loads to say but was holding it all in. She reached out and touched his mouth. \u201cWhy are you fighting that shit-eating grin?\u201d</p><p>He smirked beneath her fingertips. \u201c\u2019Cause I don\u2019t want to get all teenage boy, \u2018wow that was awesome\u2019 on you. It could kill my bad-ass dom reputation.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, suddenly feeling less self-conscious about what had just transpired. This was the Jace she remembered\u2014the quick with a joke, lighthearted guy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your reputation is intact. And yeah, that was . . . something.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cSomething, huh? As in something you enjoyed or something that totally freaked you out?\u201d</p><p>She touched her throat. \u201cI think that answer is pretty obvious. I may not have a voice tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a thumb over her bottom lip. \u201cI love how vocal you are. It\u2019s hot. But I just want to make sure you\u2019re okay since you\u2019re new to all this.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m little weirded out that I liked it that much. I\u2019m not exactly a person who enjoys taking orders in everyday life. It\u2019s one of the reasons I went into business for myself.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ll find that people\u2019s everyday personalities don\u2019t always match their sexual ones. There are a lot of CEOs wearing collars around here, not to mention mild-mannered librarian-types brandishing whips. You just never know. You are what you are.\u201d</p><p>She threaded the belt of the robe between her fingers, staring down at it. \u201cSo is that how you see it? You\u2019re either built this way or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I believe, but . . .\u201d He put his hand over her fidgeting ones. \u201cDon\u2019t get stressed out already, okay? Just because you enjoyed what we did doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re a submissive.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cIt just means you\u2019re hella kinky,\u201d he said with a broad smile. \u201cAnd of course, that I\u2019m a kickass lover.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing and shoved his chest. \u201cEgotistical asshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComes with the territory, babe. I didn\u2019t land on the dom side of things by chance.\u201d He climbed off the bed and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going to run you a bath. The rest of tonight is for relaxing.\u201d</p><p>She yawned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I can take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve put you through your paces, and it\u2019s my job to see that you\u2019re attended to. Part of the pleasure of being a dom is taking care of a sub after she\u2019s served so well.\u201d</p><p>She sank back into the pillows and laced her fingers behind her head. \u201cWell then, far be it from me to deny you that pleasure. Get to it, master.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and saluted her. \u201cRight away, slave girl. And while you\u2019re bathing, I\u2019ll let Andre know that his infamous charm has worked on you, and he\u2019s now invited to play in our sandbox this weekend, too.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip, nerves creeping back in. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He paused, something akin to worry on his face. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. No, this was already feeling too comfortable with Jace, too easy. She hadn\u2019t felt this content in as long as she could remember. Dangerous territory. A few nights of this and she\u2019d be in big trouble. She needed to get safety nets in place. Right. Now. \u201cNo, you can go ahead and tell him. I\u2019m up for anything.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened, something unreadable crossing his face. \u201cBe careful saying things like that, pet. Anything is exactly what they specialize in around here.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Evan padded out of the bathroom in Jace\u2019s oversize pajama top after soaking in the tub for way too long. Her nerves were still twitching like a faulty circuit board. She had no idea how she was going to handle the sleeping arrangements. But as she stepped into the bedroom, relief flooded her. Jace was sprawled out on the left side of the bed, fast asleep.</p> <p>He\u2019d left a bedside lamp on. The soft light gilded every line in his muscular back and the golden strands of his mussed hair, making him look like a sun-kissed Greek sculpture. Her entire being ached to run her hands along his bare skin, through that hair, to crawl next to him in the empty space he\u2019d left for her, and curl up with him for the night.</p><p>But there was no way she could go there. Not tonight. Not ever. So instead, she grabbed a pillow off the bed and the quilt that was thrown over the chair by the window and tiptoed out of the room, clicking the door shut behind her.</p><p>The living room was dark except for a few lit candles that were taking the place of logs in the fireplace. She eyeballed the suede-covered couch. It wouldn\u2019t be as cozy as that big bed, but it would do. Tomorrow night, she\u2019d let Jace know that she wanted to head back to her own cabin whenever they were through for the evening so she could have her own space.</p><p>She stepped around the coffee table, tossed her pillow and blanket onto it with a sigh, and headed toward the fireplace so she could blow out the candles.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, bella?\u201d</p><p>Her heart nearly hopped out of her chest. She spun around to find Andre leaning against the doorway to the kitchen area, sipping a glass of water.</p><p>She put her hand to her chest. \u201cGood Lord, you scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned in the dim candlelight. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t realize anyone was still awake.\u201d He nodded at the couch. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p> <p>She shifted her weight from foot to foot, feeling like a kid caught sneaking out after curfew. \u201cI, uh, thought I\u2019d sleep out here tonight. Jace is already sleeping and I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared to share his bed.\u201d</p><p>She choked on her attempt at a laugh. \u201cOf course not, I just did a lot more than that with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d He gave her a wry smile and set his glass down on the dining table before joining her in the living room. He propped a hip on the back of the loveseat, drawing her attention to the fact that along with his T-shirt, he was only wearing a pair of black boxer briefs, underwear that were made for a body like his. She forced her gaze upward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable, you know? To feel weird about it. You are engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, \u2019cause my moral code on that is stellar. I just had sex with someone else.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSometimes sex can be easy to keep separate, but sharing a bed overnight is a whole different animal. Especially with someone you used to have feelings for.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against the wall and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not at all.\u201d Andre stepped closer and held out his hand. \u201cCome on, take my bed, and I\u2019ll sleep out here.\u201d</p><p>She waved him off, heading toward the couch. \u201cOh, no, really, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve slept in worse places.\u201d Much worse.</p><p>\u201cNot a request, bella,\u201d he said, his tone firm. Her gaze snapped up as he moved in front of her and closed the space between them, his brown eyes flickering with more than candlelight. He braced a hand against the wall, caging her between him and the fireplace. \u201cJace told me about your invitation. I\u2019m honored. But now you\u2019ve got two bossy men on your hands. So, no, you won\u2019t take the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Blood began to thrum against her pulse points, his heady, masculine scent mixing with the vanilla of the candles. She searched for her voice. \u201cI, uh, guess you accepted the invitation?\u201d</p><p>Smooth, Evan. Real smooth.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cI\u2019m making you nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, giving him a shaky smile. He must be a force of nature in an interrogation room. She certainly felt ready to confess her darkest secrets to him. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this side of you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any right to show it to you.\u201d His lips curved as he reached out and drew the tip of his finger along the edge of her collar. \u201cBut feel free to tell me to back off.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little shake of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because you know what I\u2019ve been trying to do all night?\u201d His tone and touch were soft, hypnotizing, lulling her into some suspended state between reality and dream.</p><p>She held his smoky gaze, her breathing loud in her own ears. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen trying to make myself go back to the main house and find someone for me to spend the weekend with like I should. Give you and Jace some privacy. But instead . . .\u201d His gaze slid down the length of her, making every inch prickle with awareness. \u201cAll I could think about was how the person I wanted was already here. How I\u2019d rather watch you with Jace and listen to your sexy screams tonight even knowing I couldn\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>His words snaked over her, stirring urges she thought had been exhausted for the night. Now she knew what it felt like to be truly and utterly seduced. There was no other word for it. \u201cWell, now you can.\u201d</p><p>His smile was slow, confident, his whole demeanor a shocking departure from the easy-going guy in the hot tub. It was as if she could feel the dominance rising within him, a floodgate being unlocked. \u201cIndeed I can. But you\u2019re not sure that\u2019s what you want right now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, his words not registering for a second.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I . . . Yes, I want . . . But I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Her words came out a jumbled mess. There was no doubt she wanted to pull Andre down to her, feel his mouth on hers, touch him. But there was a tug in her chest, a strange urge to ask Jace first even though he\u2019d already given her permission. She glanced over at the door to Jace\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He followed her gaze. \u201cAh, bella. It comes so naturally to you already, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She turned her focus back to him, her brows knitted. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He brushed her hair off her forehead and smoothed her brow. \u201cTo be loyal to your dom. To make sure that what you want will please him as well.\u201d</p><p>She started to deny it, but snapped her mouth shut when the accuracy of his words set in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to see. And hard to resist.\u201d He bent and put his lips to hers, a gentle press, a taste with a promise of more. She laid her palms against his chest, enjoying the pounding of his heart beneath her fingers and the feel of his mouth on hers. So different from Jace\u2019s, but no less potent. He pulled back way too soon. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He palmed her hip, drew her against him, and let her feel just how aroused he was. \u201cBelieve me, there\u2019s nothing more I\u2019d like to do right now than lay you out on this rug and taste and touch every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, her panties instantly dampening as he molded her against him.</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019ve had a long night, and I don\u2019t want you going into anything with doubts.\u201d He eased away from her. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until tomorrow when Jace can be here with us, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all night you\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTortured?\u201d he asked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cBasically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve been on stakeouts that lasted for weeks and have interrogated suspects for hours on end, all with just a smidgen of a chance that I\u2019ll get what I want.\u201d He put his hand out to her again. \u201cSo, I can be infinitely patient when the end result is worth it.\u201d</p><p>There was an underlying warning in his words. She could only imagine what that level of patience and self-control could mean in a D/s situation. A guy who wasn\u2019t rushing to get to the finale. One that could erotically torment his sub until he or she couldn\u2019t be pushed any further. She took his hand. \u201cMust make you a formidable master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, guess you\u2019ll find out,\u201d he said, pulling her to his side. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get you to bed before I make a liar out of myself.\u201d</p><p>Knowing it was no use protesting further, she followed him to the other side of the cabin and into his room. It was almost a mirror image of Jace\u2019s, except that the bed at the center was bigger than any she\u2019d ever seen before and was half covered with file folders and papers. \u201cHoly crap, that thing is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways what a guy wants to hear when a woman walks into his bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a custom bed meant to serve the polyamorous of the world. You put two big guys and a woman in a king bed, it gets a little tight.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she remembered that from the few times she\u2019d slept in Daniel and Marcus\u2019s bed. \u201cDo you and Jace usually sleep all together with the woman you\u2019re sharing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we use this bed for play, then Jace goes to his own room for the night.\u201d He stepped around the bed and started gathering all the paperwork he\u2019d apparently been working on when he\u2019d gone out to get that glass of water. \u201cOnce we\u2019re outside of a scene, Jace usually likes to be alone. Plus I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s totally comfortable with the idea of sleeping naked with his roommate. Like I said earlier, sex and sleeping together are two totally different things.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Jace seemed like the most sexually open person she\u2019d ever met. It seemed odd he\u2019d be uncomfortable about that. But it wasn\u2019t her business.</p><p>Andre grabbed the stack of papers he\u2019d gathered and walked toward the desk in the opposite corner of the room. \u201cLet me get all of this out of the way. I was trying to get some work done since I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on a day off?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make detective. There are a few people competing for the position. I\u2019m one of the younger ones. Figure I can\u2019t out-experience some of them, but I can damn sure outwork them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He put his hand out to her. \u201cCome on, gorgeous. Let\u2019s get you into bed. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and let him lead her by the hand to the bed. Andre peeled back the comforter and patted the mattress. She climbed beneath the covers. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been tucked into bed since I was a little girl.\u201d</p> <p>He laid the blanket over her and placed a light kiss on her lips, the latter sending warmth to the best places. His gaze softened. \u201cI feel privileged to be the one to break the dry spell then.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he and Jace were breaking her dry spell all right.</p><p>\u201cGood night, bella. Get some rest.\u201d He leaned over to click off the bedside lamp.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>He paused, his fingers on the switch, looking over at her.</p> <p>She was going to tell him to leave it on because of her fear, but something else sprung to her lips instead. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She pushed the comforter back down. This was ridiculous. She spent enough nights alone. Screw that. This was supposed to be her fantasy weekend. And she had no history and mixed-up feelings to worry about with Andre. She just liked him, plain and simple. Enjoyed talking to him, and well, touching him wasn\u2019t so bad either. \u201cStay with me?\u201d</p><p>He eyed the bed a bit warily. \u201cEvan, I\u2019ll be fine. The couch won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d She looked away quickly, biting her lip. What in the hell was wrong with her? She\u2019d almost slipped up and told him she was tired of sleeping alone. \u201cI mean, I was thinking before we jump into the whole m\u00e9nage thing, this might help me get more comfortable with you, be less nervous.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cJust how comfortable are we talking? Because I pride myself on self-control, but I\u2019m not dead.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and raised her hand, remembering his Boy Scout reference from a few weeks before. \u201cScout\u2019s honor. We\u2019ll just sleep. I won\u2019t even run my tongue along your nipple rings and tug them with my teeth, even though I really, really want to.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head then peeled off his shirt. \u201cWe better be careful around you, bella. We may have met our match.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off the lamp, bathing the room in moonlight, and climbed into bed. Without saying another word, he stretched out behind her and gathered her against him, as if they were lovers who had slept this way for years. She couldn\u2019t prevent the little sigh that passed her lips as his arms and heat enveloped her.</p><p>It was lovely and sexy and comforting.</p><p>Almost perfect.</p><p>The only other thing that would make it better would be to have a certain blond stretched out against her other side.</p><p>And that realization scared her more than anything had in a long, long time.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p> <p>Jace stomped out of the bedroom, squinting through the bright morning light filling the living room. He\u2019d woken up cold, alone, and pissed. Pissed that Evan wasn\u2019t in bed next to him and really pissed that he cared.</p><p>He should\u2019ve never given in to his need to claim her last night. She\u2019d responded so well under his hand, thrived beneath the dominance like a daisy in sunshine. The rush he\u2019d gotten from her reactions had left him reeling. So much so that he\u2019d gone and dropped his guard without realizing it. He had joked around with her like he used to, had even wanted her to share his bed overnight, which was something he never did with anyone. He\u2019d let himself feel something for her, goddammit.</p><p>Which is exactly why last night could never happen again. Even if the mere thought of having Evan all to himself for another round had his dick stiffening in his pajama pants. The only way he was touching her again was if Andre was there, too. End of story.</p><p>He glanced around the living room, his gaze landing on the couch, a pillow and blanket spread out on it. Oh, hell no. If Evan had slept on that hard sofa instead of waking him and admitting she wasn\u2019t cool with sharing a bed, he was going to spank her ass. He\u2019d told her he would take care of her this weekend. Why wouldn\u2019t she let him?</p><p>But if she had slept out here, where the hell was she? He looked around the room again and noticed an abandoned glass of water on the dining room table.</p><p>Ah, fuck.</p><p>The answer hit him like a knee to the groin. He knew exactly where she was.</p><p>And he should be damn happy about it, but instead he had to breathe through a wave of anger he had no right to have. He\u2019d set this up. Talked to Andre himself last night. Rolled out the goddamned red carpet. This is what needed to happen, right?</p><p>Unable to stop himself from confirming his suspicions, he crossed to the other side of the cabin until he was standing in front of Andre\u2019s door. He probably should knock.</p><p>No, screw that. He needed to see the unedited version and get it through his thick skull that he had no claim to Evan. And she owed him no loyalty either. Gritting his teeth, he turned the knob and pushed open the door.</p><p>What lay inside wasn\u2019t unexpected, but twisted him up just the same. The comforter was in a tangle, exposing Andre and Evan, both half-dressed and sound asleep. Evan\u2019s shirt had ridden up, and Andre had a hand splayed possessively over her bare belly.</p><p>He blew out a breath.</p><p>So they\u2019d fucked. Without him.</p><p>And then Evan had chosen to curl up with Andre for the night\u2014a stranger to her\u2014instead of with him. Well that was just fucking fine. Perfect.</p><p>Andre was the one who was better at the romantic, cuddling shit with women anyway. Shouldn\u2019t Jace just leave him to it? Mr. Suave had probably murmured sweet words to Evan after they\u2019d had sex. Told her how beautiful she was, how happy he was to be next to her. Kissed away her fear of the dark.</p><p>Bitterness burned at the back of Jace\u2019s throat.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>He resisted the inclination to slam the door and clicked it shut instead. So, problem solved. Let the two of them screw until the sun went down if they wanted. Because each time Jace knew Evan was with someone else, it would help him put another stone back into the foundation she\u2019d rocked by stepping back into his life. Would remind him of what this was. And what it most definitely was not.</p><p>He made his way back to the kitchen and put on the coffee, planning to drink a cup on the back deck so he wouldn\u2019t have to hear it if Evan and Andre did decide to have a little pre-breakfast action.</p><p>But before the coffee finished percolating, Andre shuffled into the kitchen, sniffing the air. \u201cMmm, coffee. Thanks, bro. I\u2019ll take one sugar. And how \u2019bout some pancakes, too? I like mine in Mickey Mouse shapes.\u201d</p><p>Jace shot him a deadly glare and shoved past him to grab mugs from the cabinet.</p><p>Andre smirked as he leaned against the counter. \u201cWhat crawled up your ass?\u201d</p><p>Jace grunted and turned his back to him to pour himself a cup, trying to get a hold on the jealousy, the anger, the frustration that he was feeling either of those things in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just need some caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d Andre pushed up from the counter as soon as Jace moved away from the coffeepot so he could get his own fix. \u201cI barely slept last night.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s teeth clenched, but he forced himself to look unaffected. None of this was Andre\u2019s fault. The guy had only done what the two of them always did\u2014shared a woman without concerns about jealousy. Jace kept his tone relaxed. \u201cYeah, well, tough to sleep when you\u2019re too busy screwing.\u201d</p><p>Andre turned around and sipped his coffee. \u201cNo kidding, she\u2019s got some stamina, that one. Man, so fucking hot. The way she\u2014\u201d</p><p>Red clouded Jace\u2019s vision as fuming heat flooded his system. He slammed his cup down on the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t need a goddamned play-by-play, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Andre smirked. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>The smug tone made Jace\u2019s fists curl. He\u2019d never punched a friend, but there was a first time for everything.</p><p>Andre nodded in his direction. \u201cYou can stop plotting my murder. I\u2019m just proving a point.\u201d</p><p>Jace barely heard him over the angry buzzing in his brain. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything with Evan\u2014well, besides kissing her. She was reluctant to go further without talking to you first, and I wasn\u2019t going to go down that road if she didn\u2019t feel ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Jace\u2019s chest shouldn\u2019t have puffed up, shouldn\u2019t have filled with a rush of relief and . . . satisfaction. He couldn\u2019t stop the idiotic smile that crept to his lips, so he tried to cover it by picking up his mug again and taking a swig of scalding coffee.</p><p>\u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d Andre said, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, man. Not with her.\u201d</p><p>Jace opened his mouth to ask him what that was supposed to mean, but Andre raised a hand to halt him.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not blind, okay? You\u2019re broadcasting \u2018mine\u2019 vibes with a damn bullhorn. This girl means something to you. I get it. And it\u2019s good to see you still have that in you. But this is not the girl to do that with. No matter what happens this weekend, you need to remember she\u2019s not yours, mine, or ours.\u201d</p><p>Jace made a dismissive snort, even though Andre\u2019s words dug right beneath his skin. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of who she belongs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Andre gave him a narrow look and then walked around the island to slide onto a barstool on the other side. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re all of a sudden looking at me like I\u2019m the enemy?\u201d</p><p>Jace blew out a long breath, realizing that trying to bullshit Andre was like trying to punk the CIA. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll be fine, all right. I just need to get back to what we do best. No more one-on-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the smartest thing you\u2019ve said since we got here. Now just don\u2019t try to tackle me the first time I touch her. Because I am going to touch her, Jace. She may have developed some sense of loyalty to you, but you\u2019re not the only one she\u2019s attracted to.\u201d</p><p>The smooth assurance in Andre\u2019s voice had Jace\u2019s jaw tightening again, but he gave him a quick nod. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s coffee I smell,\u201d said a hoarse voice, halting further conversation.</p><p>Both of them turned to see Evan pad barefoot into the kitchen, looking rumpled and oh so tempting in Jace\u2019s shirt.</p><p>Jace handed her a mug, determined to prove to Andre\u2014and himself\u2014that he could move past whatever had come over him and make this simply another fun, relaxing weekend with a hot woman. \u201cGood morning, sunshine. Sounds like you swallowed a mouthful of gravel.\u201d</p><p>She took the cup from him and pushed up on her tiptoes, surprising him with a soft kiss, then a saucy smile. \u201cI swallowed something for sure.\u201d</p><p>Andre chuckled. \u201cTen seconds.\u201d</p><p>Both Jace and Evan turned toward him. She lifted a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amount of time you need to be in the room before all my blood rushes south.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, an open and unashamed sound that did indeed make Jace\u2019s cock begin to stiffen. Yesterday, Evan had been unsure, cautious, but now the vixen he\u2019d gotten a glimpse of in his room last night was emerging. They were making her feel safe\u2014free to be herself. The transformation gave Jace some weird twinge of pride.</p><p>She looked up at him, those blue eyes and her palm against his bare chest making him forget his train of thought. \u201cI want to kiss Andre, too. You okay with that?\u201d</p><p>Choking back the fuck no that first jumped to his lips was like swallowing broken glass, but he covered it with a casual shrug. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Some unreadable expression flickered over her features, but then she mirrored his shrug. \u201cNo reason. I guess I\u2019m still figuring out the protocol of this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI appreciate your diligence, babe, but I already told you I don\u2019t care what you do with Andre\u2014kiss, fuck. Him. Me. Both of us at the same time. That\u2019s the beauty of m\u00e9nage. We\u2019re all just here to have a good time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>The words weren\u2019t charming, but he had to say something to put all this shit back into perspective. Remind everyone, including himself, why they were doing this.</p><p>Her lips pressed together, a little crease forming between her brows. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around the no-jealousy thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dating either of us. Can\u2019t get jealous over someone who isn\u2019t yours in the first place.\u201d He nodded at Andre, though it took everything he had to do so. \u201cGo ahead, I think he\u2019s been patient enough.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to Andre, and he gave her a disarming smile. \u201cI can be as patient as you need me to be, bella. I have no doubt you\u2019ll be worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>Jace grunted. Silver-tongued bastard. Jace was no slouch in the flirting department, but somehow Andre always knew the right thing to say to make girls go all gooey.</p><p>Evan handed Jace her coffee mug, effectively dismissing him, and crossed over to the island. He had the impulse to grab her arm, stop her, kiss her until she couldn\u2019t remember her own name, much less Andre\u2019s. But instead he kept his hands locked around her cup, gripping it until his knuckles turned white.</p><p>She leaned over the counter toward Andre, exposing her little black panties and luscious ass to Jace, probably purposely taunting him after his I-could-give-a-shit-if-you-kiss-him speech. Jace tried to look away, but couldn\u2019t help himself from watching.</p> <p>Andre\u2019s gaze met his briefly, as if challenging Jace to stop him, but Jace wasn\u2019t going to make any move to prevent it. This is what needed to happen. Andre gave a satisfied smile, then hooked a finger in Evan\u2019s collar and captured her lips in a heated kiss.</p><p>Jace braced himself against the edge of the counter as the wave of possessiveness enveloped him. The deepest, most primal part of him wanted to lash out, to rip her away from Andre. But as Evan sank into the kiss and the raw need between the two of them became more and more apparent, Jace\u2019s fiery anger turned into some other emotion\u2014one it took him a second to identify.</p><p>Guilt? Where the hell had that come from? What did he have to feel guilty about?</p><p>Then it hit him.</p><p>Evan deserved to be happy.</p><p>He\u2019d seen how sad she\u2019d looked on that beach in South Padre, how lost she\u2019d seemed. And God knows she\u2019d had it rough as hell as a teenager. Now that same person was in front of him\u2014lighthearted, turned on, enjoying her time with him\u2014and though he hated to admit it, with Andre. She\u2019d come here for a fantasy weekend, an escape from her normal life, not to be caught up in whatever mixed-up crap Jace was feeling toward her.</p> <p>There. He\u2019d admitted it. There were residual feelings from the past that seeing her again had stirred up. So what. Didn\u2019t change a damn thing.</p><p>He needed to get it through his head that this weekend was about her. Not him. Not Andre. And certainly not about some pissing contest over which guy she wanted more. Especially when the guy she actually wanted was in some house in Dallas planning his upcoming TV show. Evan was only there for a few days, and Jace was wasting time acting like some insecure teenager. Stupid.</p><p>No more. She came to them with a purpose, and he was going to make damn sure she accomplished her goal. Whatever fantasy she had tucked away in that pretty head of hers, he wanted to give to her. If sharing her with Andre was one of them, then so be it. Jace could tamp down the useless jealousy and lock it away. Hell, he\u2019d locked away worse.</p><p>And God knows he enjoyed seeing her come apart with pleasure\u2014what did it matter if there was an extra set of hands bringing her there?</p><p>In fact, he knew how much more sexually intense things could get with someone as responsive as Evan if Andre were added to the mix. It\u2019s why Jace preferred m\u00e9nage in the first place. Some levels could only be reached with a third person involved. And man, if that\u2019s where Evan sought to go, he wanted to be the one to take her there. Wanted to watch her give herself over completely to sensation, to submission.</p><p>Visions of Evan in the throes of passion assailed him\u2014both he and Andre pushing her further and further, her blue eyes going hazy with bliss, her lips parted in a silent plea . . .</p><p>A jolt of desire sliced through his tangle of emotions, dimming everything except the need to see Evan let go again. He wanted to fall to his knees with relief. Thank God. Finally a reaction that made sense! This he could work with. Screw all the rest of it. He\u2019d shove the other stuff down and grab on to the desire.</p><p>Jace set the cup down, his palms suddenly hotter than the coffee inside it, and moved a step closer to Evan, making himself focus on what the kiss was doing for her rather than worrying that it wasn\u2019t him on the other end of it.</p> <p>Andre continued to work her over, the good-morning greeting morphing into a lust so palpable Jace could taste it in the air. His cock stirred to awareness, thickening at the erotic sight. Evan had one hand threaded in Andre\u2019s hair, but the other one was gripping the edge of the island as if it were the only thing holding her back from climbing across the counter to get closer. He half wished she\u2019d just let go and hop up there. He couldn\u2019t think of anything better for breakfast than Evan sprawled out on that island like a hedonistic buffet.</p><p>A little mewl of pleasure escaped her, and Jace tamped down the remaining whispers of hesitation. He stepped up behind her, nestling his growing erection against her backside and sliding his hand onto her abdomen. She tensed in surprise, then softened, not breaking the kiss but melting against him. God, she felt good. Pliable. Trusting. Totally fucking into it.</p><p>He moved his hand lower, teasing at the band of her underwear, stroking her bare skin. She rocked against him, fitting the cleft of her ass against his cock. He groaned at the friction and kissed the back of her neck, inhaling the scent of both her apple shampoo and Andre\u2019s lingering cologne. \u201cHmm, seems like you want more than coffee this morning, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>She eased away from the kiss and untangled her fingers from Andre\u2019s hair, her movements as languid as a sleepy cat. She peered over her shoulder at him, a wicked glint in her eyes. \u201cI never want anything more than coffee.\u201d</p><p>The halt in action had his body protesting, but he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re a vicious tease, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called worse.\u201d</p><p>He gave her ass a playful swat, enjoying the flash of lust the move incited from her. \u201cGo ahead. You can have your caffeine. We have all day to taint you with our lecherous demands.\u201d</p><p>She spun to face him and smiled, her lips tantalizingly swollen from Andre\u2019s kiss. \u201cGuess I better make a fortifying breakfast for all of us then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hold on, bella,\u201d Andre said, settling back onto his stool, his movements a little jerky, no doubt from a monster hard-on. \u201cJust because you\u2019re the submissive in this arrangement, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the kitchen bitch, too. We\u2019ve been bachelors a long time. We know how to put a meal on the table.\u201d</p><p>She moved around Jace and headed for the fridge. \u201cOh, hush, I\u2019m not offering because I\u2019m your slave or whatever. I\u2019m offering because I enjoy cooking.\u201d She stuck her head in the refrigerator and her voice became muffled. \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve had bachelor fare. I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>Jace sniffed. \u201cHey, Andre can make some mean chilaquiles. And I can . . . Well, I kick ass at making toast and coffee.\u201d</p><p>She emerged from the fridge and set her treasures next to the stove. \u201cHave a seat, Iron Chef. I got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur sub is kind of bossy, Andre,\u201d he said as he slid on the stool next to his friend, trying to ease the earlier tension between them.</p><p>Andre smirked. \u201cYeah, but if it involves me getting to watch her flit around the kitchen half-naked, cooking something better than burnt toast, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Jace watched her as she moved with efficient grace from one task to the other. Breaking eggs, lining up bacon in the pan, stirring a pot of grits, tasting a bit on the tip of her finger before tossing salt into the pot. She was beautiful. And more at ease than he\u2019d ever seen her. Like she felt right at home with them, casually cooking breakfast and teasing them with the easy sway of her hips.</p><p>Andre set his elbows on the island, apparently as fascinated by the scene as he was. \u201cSo what do you like about cooking?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, keeping her back to them and stirring the grits. \u201cI remember my mom cooking for me. Never anything fancy, but all really good, comforting stuff. Baked macaroni and cheese. Chicken and dumplings. She worked overnight shifts, so she always made sure I had something good to eat before she left for work. I looked forward to that time every day. Watching her prepare everything and having her listen to my chatter.\u201d</p><p>She paused as if lost in thought, her spoon still. Jace frowned, knowing the story wouldn\u2019t end well.</p><p>\u201cShe died right before I turned seven. And pretty much everything in my life, including those home-cooked meals, stopped.\u201d She started stirring again. \u201cSo I figured when I got older, I would learn how to do it. Make the people around me feel as well taken care of as I did back then.\u201d</p><p>The thought of everything warm and comforting in her life disappearing when she was still so young made Jace\u2019s chest ache, made his own family drama seem ridiculously petty in comparison. He\u2019d never gotten the full story from her, but his parents had told him Evan\u2019s background when she\u2019d come to live with them. Her mother had been killed on her way home from work by a drunk driver, and her father had completely fallen apart after her death. He\u2019d spiraled into depression during the years following, had neglected Evan completely, and had eventually taken his own life, leaving his daughter with no one in the world.</p><p>Jace shifted on the stool, searching for what to say. He wanted to pull Evan onto his lap, tell her he was sorry she had to go through that, that no kid should have to experience such tragedy. But he knew she\u2019d resist any attempts at sympathy from them and would see it as pity. He was surprised enough that she\u2019d even shared the story about her mother. When he\u2019d last known her, all discussions about her past had been strictly off limits.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWell, we\u2019re honored that you deem us worthy of taking care of this morning.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder, giving him a thank-you-for-not-pushing smile. \u201cNo worries. I don\u2019t get to do this too much lately with all the travel we\u2019ve been doing. Plus, Daniel\u2019s more of a restaurant guy than an eat-at-home person, so it\u2019s nice to get back to it.\u201d</p><p>Just the mention of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s name set Jace\u2019s teeth on edge, but he refused to let his opinion show on his face. Dr. Dan was sounding more and more like an idiot every second. Obviously the man wasn\u2019t satisfying Evan\u2019s sexual needs. And apparently he wasn\u2019t appreciative of her nurturing side. What the fuck did she see in the guy?</p><p>Money? Fame?</p><p>He didn\u2019t picture Evan as the trophy wife type, but what did he know. He hadn\u2019t pegged his ex-wife for that either, and it had turned out to be her life\u2019s mission. Maybe growing up like Evan had made those things too tempting to pass up.</p><p>Andre drummed his fingers against the counter, and Jace could feel his friend\u2019s agitation. Uh-oh. Something was on Andre\u2019s mind, and he wasn\u2019t one to hold his tongue. Jace shot him a warning look, but Andre\u2019s mouth was already opening. \u201cI know it\u2019s not my business, but do you really love this guy, Evan? It seems like you two don\u2019t have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>Jace kicked Andre under the counter, giving him a what-the-fuck look.</p><p>Evan stiffened, and Jace wished he could see her face. A few seconds passed before she answered. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s none of your business. But yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>Andre frowned. \u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry. That was out of line. Sometimes my mouth opens before the filters get involved.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Now you just owe me an answer to a wildly personal question of my choice later on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. Why don\u2019t we just forget I said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p> <p>Silence fell between the three of them while she finished cooking, and Jace worried that Andre had pushed Evan back into her shell with that ridiculous question. But when she divvied out portions onto plates and turned around, her easy smile had returned. She set a plate down in front of each of them and rolled her eyes as she took in their expressions. \u201cRelax, guys. I\u2019m not going to run out the door because you asked me a question. I\u2019d just rather not discuss my relationship while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>That made two of them. Jace would rather forget Dr. Dan existed at all, at least for the weekend. \u201cWe promise not to tread there again, Ev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now eat before it gets cold.\u201d She pointed at their plates, and they both obliged her. She joined in, taking a few bites from her own plate as she studied the two of them. Her gaze turned serious. \u201cListen, I know this is an odd situation, and I\u2019m still figuring things out as I go along here. But I want you both to know that when I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m fully with you. I\u2019m not thinking of anyone else or anything outside of here. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Her declaration had Jace wanting to be with her again right at that moment, but he forked a bite of scrambled egg instead. If he jumped her every time he had the urge too, they\u2019d never make it through a meal. \u201cSame here, babe. You\u2019re our sole focus this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur obsession, really,\u201d Andre added, his expression comically solemn. \u201cI doubt either of us could even conjure up the image of another woman if we tried.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and pointed the piece of bacon she\u2019d lifted off her plate at him. \u201cYou\u2019re only obsessed because you\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t gotten laid in the last twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>Andre looked her up and down with unabashed appreciation. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short, mamacita. Me wanting you has nothing to do with a few hours of deprivation. If it were only about a stiff dick, I could\u2019ve gone back to the main house last night.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples became noticeable points beneath her shirt\u2014Andre\u2019s words as good as a pinch\u2014and Jace\u2019s mouth went dry. Andre leaned forward on his elbows and peered into her mug. \u201cWell, would you look at that? Seems you\u2019re all done with that coffee.\u201d</p><p>Evan licked her lips, obviously registering Andre\u2019s meaning. She peeked over at Jace, checking in with him, giving him the reins whether she realized what she was doing or not. The rush of power it gave him was like a needle full of adrenaline. She was stunning regardless, but when she slipped into the sub role, it tore the air right from his lungs. He didn\u2019t deserve the gift, didn\u2019t deserve that level of submission or loyalty from her. But hell if he was going to turn it down right now.</p><p>He shoved his plate aside. \u201cI think you\u2019re done with breakfast, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems so, sir.\u201d The corner of her mouth quirked up, but Jace also sensed nervous energy rolling off her.</p> <p>Nice. He liked her a little on edge. It would only make things better for all involved. He opened his mouth to give her the next command, but Andre\u2019s hand landed on his shoulder, stopping him. \u201cLet me top her this time, J.\u201d</p><p>Jace choked back the groan of frustration before it made its way out. Leave it to Andre to immediately push him right to the limit. Andre rarely asked to be the lead dom in a m\u00e9nage, so Jace had a feeling this was more about their conversation this morning than anything else. Knowing Andre, he\u2019d probably relegate Jace to a watch-but-don\u2019t-touch role just to prove a point.</p><p>Jace glanced at Evan, who was observing their exchange intently, and reminded himself that this weekend was about her. He loosened his fists, which had automatically clenched. \u201cNo problem. Evan agreed to be submissive to both of us, so go ahead.\u201d</p><p>He said the words with what he hoped was a relaxed tone, even though it was going to be a tortuous test of will to watch Andre dominate her and not be the one controlling the situation. He could do this. He wanted Evan to have the experience of being shared\u2014of knowing what it was like to pleasure and be pleasured by two very different men.</p><p>And despite the possessiveness he\u2019d been wrangling with, he knew he could trust Andre with Evan. The guy could piss him off, but he was also one of his best friends and would never do anything out of line. Andre\u2019s restraint with Evan up until this point had proven that.</p><p>Plus, Jace knew if he could focus on the right things, seeing Evan submit to Andre would turn him on. Beyond the sheer forbidden aspect of watching two people fuck, Andre\u2019s method of dominance brought out a different side of a woman than Jace\u2019s more in-your-face style. The guy turned it into an art form and it was sexy as hell to watch a girl get worked over by him.</p><p>Many women suspected Andre\u2019s smoother approach would make him an easier master. But Jace knew better. Andre was velvet-gloved seduction, but he also was filled with unnatural amounts of patience. He\u2019d seen some of the toughest subs break down into desperate tears, outright begging for release by the end of a session with Andre.</p><p>Of course, Andre never denied a woman that reward. He just didn\u2019t rush to get there.</p> <p>Though based on the hooded gaze Andre shot Evan, Jace wondered if she had even managed to drive Mr. Slow Hands to his breaking point. Every man had his limits.</p><p>Jace just hoped that Evan wouldn\u2019t push him past his own.</p><p>Andre knew it was killing Jace to not be in charge right now, but he was doing it this way for the guy\u2019s own good. Hopefully, this would force Jace to get a grip. Because whether Jace wanted to admit it or not, he looked at Evan differently than he had any other woman Andre had ever seen him with.</p><p>And nobody wanted to see Jace open up his heart again more than Andre did. He\u2019d watched Jace\u2019s bitch of an ex-wife break down a man who\u2019d had such a hopeful, idealistic spirit and turn him into the guarded soul Jace was now. But Evan couldn\u2019t be the one. When Andre had asked her the question about her fianc\u00e9, he could feel her honesty in her answer. She was already in love with someone else. Getting attached to her wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>The knowledge pained Andre as well. He hadn\u2019t done more than kiss Evan and already he was feeling an undeniable draw toward her. There was something about her that tugged at him, made him want to know everything about her life. What made her laugh. What made her toss and turn so much at night. Why she loved some guy who didn\u2019t seem to fit her at all.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t his right to delve into those areas. He had to be content with the here and now, focus on the physical. It was something he was used to doing. Hell, he\u2019d kept his feelings hidden from Jace well enough all these years. He certainly should be able to keep emotion out of things for a weekend.</p><p>Andre turned to Evan, the stark anticipation in her pale blue eyes drawing all his thoughts back to where they should be. He crooked a finger at her. \u201cCome here, bella. I want to feel that beautiful body of yours next to mine.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth tugged at her bottom lip, but after a second\u2019s hesitation, she moved around the island and slipped between his and Jace\u2019s chairs. Jace swiveled on his stool, bracketing Evan from behind with his spread knees, but not touching her. Evan\u2019s eyes widened a bit, the awareness that she was caged between two men obviously not lost on her. Good.</p><p>Andre tucked a lock of her dark hair behind her ear, then cupped her jaw. \u201cAny more doubts? If so, you need to tell me now.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her cheeks coloring. But there was humor in her expression. \u201cNo, I\u2019m officially a hussy who wants two men.\u201d</p><p>Jace chuckled behind her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make you a hussy, pet. Just makes you awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes you perfect, actually.\u201d Andre ran a thumb along her moistened bottom lip, and her entire body shuddered, causing her pert nipples to strain against the thin material of the dress shirt. Man, he loved that\u2014loved that a simple look or brush of skin could rouse her. He hoped to get the chance to explore that gift to its fullest. Bring her to the edge with the slightest of touches, warm breaths, and sensual suggestion. Have her half out of her mind with desire before he even allowed himself the pleasure of being inside her.</p><p>Imagining all the possibilities had his dick throbbing, and he closed his eyes briefly to reel himself in. He prided himself on his patience, but the repeated erotic overload with no release was taking its toll. If he didn\u2019t stop weaving fantasies about all the ways he wanted to be with Evan he was going to shoot off like an excited teenager before he even got her naked.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, Evan was watching him, a shy smile teasing at her lips. \u201cI\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re thinking, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout I show you instead.\u201d He leaned forward, unable to resist sampling her mouth for another second. She let out a little sigh as her lips parted, accepting his kiss and then matching his pace when he dialed up the intensity. The earlier kiss had been a test of his restraint, but now he had no more reason to hold back. Right now he was going to indulge in what he\u2019d wanted since the moment he laid eyes on her in that hotel lobby.</p><p>He moved his lips to her neck and blazed a trail of open-mouth kisses down her throat and sternum, savoring her flavor. Mmm. Like salted caramel\u2014sweet femininity mixed with earthy arousal. He nuzzled her breast, eliciting a shiver from her, then claimed her nipple through the thin shirt, sucking and teasing until the cotton turned translucent. She let out a soft moan and arched backward, leaning into Jace\u2019s arms for support.</p><p>Andre glanced upward to catch Jace staring down at the scene, green eyes swirling with hunger. Andre\u2019s own desire jumped up a notch as he met his friend\u2019s gaze. These were the moments that kept Andre going. The times when the barriers of friendship and sexuality fell away and he got to indulge in both a beautiful woman and his best friend without worry. Nothing else ever gave him the same feeling of freedom. And he couldn\u2019t deny that having Evan between them added a sense of rightness that he hadn\u2019t felt before.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful.\u201d Andre brought his full focus back to Evan\u2019s sweet, yielding flesh and tugged at the open collar of her shirt. \u201cI barely slept last night thinking about how good you felt against me. Don\u2019t make me wait another second to see you naked.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to her top button, but Jace grasped her wrists and pulled them back. \u201cAllow me, pet. It\u2019d be my pleasure to undress you . . . for Andre.\u201d</p><p>Andre could tell those last two words were difficult for Jace to add. Damn. Never before had he seen the guy struggle so much with sharing. Jace thrived on m\u00e9nage\u2014it was part of who he was, his sexual makeup.</p><p>Guilt niggled at Andre. Maybe forcing Jace to play second with Evan was a bit cruel, but there was no going back now. It was for everyone\u2019s own good. He couldn\u2019t stand by and watch Jace fall for the wrong girl again. He hadn\u2019t stepped in when he\u2019d suspected Diana was more manipulator than submissive to Jace. He\u2019d thought his own mixed-up feelings for his friend had clouded his judgment. But then Diana had crushed Jace in a way that Andre had feared could never be repaired.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t stand by again\u2014even if Evan\u2019s effect on Jace was unintentional\u2014and watch Jace get hurt. Andre would do whatever it took to protect Jace from himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with me undressing her?\u201d Jace asked, his voice tight.</p><p>Evan looked at Andre, her pupils dilated and her face flushed with heat.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, please do.\u201d</p><p>Jace lowered Evan\u2019s arms to her sides and then reached around her to start unbuttoning the shirt from behind. He worked from the top down, each unfastened button revealing another tempting expanse of smooth ivory skin. And even though Andre had seen her naked the night before, he found himself holding his breath as he waited to see all of her again, knowing that this time he wasn\u2019t restricted to keeping his hands to himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Evan\u2019s eyes became all-consuming as her gaze drifted down his face, to his torso, and finally down to his boxer briefs. He had to suppress his own shiver. Man, she knew how to make a guy feel wanted. For a moment, it was as if she was the dom and he the sub, sitting there waiting for the next command. Her heated perusal was as effective as a tangible stroke against his skin, causing his erection to press so hard against the elastic of his underwear, he worried his blood supply was going to be cut off.</p><p>\u201cBella, I don\u2019t know what I did in my former life to deserve this. But I must\u2019ve been a very good boy.\u201d</p> <p>Jace laid a kiss on the back curve of her neck. \u201cAnd I must\u2019ve been canonized a saint.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cJust so you know, flattery will get y\u2019all everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Andre arched an eyebrow at her. \u201cEverywhere, huh?\u201d</p><p>Jace reached the last button and slid the shirt from her shoulders, allowing it to fall to the floor. Andre took his time enjoying the mouth-watering view and the way the flush on her face worked its way down her body, chasing his gaze. She ducked her head in deference, but a wicked little smile touched the edge of her mouth, letting him know she enjoyed him looking at her like this. He shook his head. So sweetly submissive, but so damn spunky all at the same time.</p><p>He was starting to understand what Jace was going through. Evan had something about her that got to Andre on more than just a sexual level. Lord, how was he going to be satisfied with just having this one weekend with her? There were too many layers he wouldn\u2019t get a chance to explore, too many avenues he and Jace wouldn\u2019t get to take her down.</p> <p>However, now wasn\u2019t the time to worry about those things. Not when she was looking so sinfully gorgeous and aroused. Her pert nipples were tight and moist from his earlier treatment, and he was tempted to pay homage to those again. But as his eyes tracked lower, other things climbed higher on the list. The soaked state of her black satin panties for starters.</p><p>Boy, she\u2019d probably go off like a rocket with the simplest of strokes.</p><p>Too bad he wasn\u2019t going to make it that easy.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Evan\u2019s heart was pumping so fiercely, she had no doubt Andre could see her carotid jumping beneath her skin. But despite her nerves, she wouldn\u2019t have chosen to be anywhere else than standing between these two men\u2014even if she did sense a bit of a weird vibe between them this morning.</p><p>Andre cupped her face in his large hands, the chocolate color of his eyes almost hypnotic. \u201cBella, I plan to make you feel very, very good, but you will not come before I say so. There will be consequences if you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d In that moment, with his smoky tone and the way he was looking at her, she may have agreed to anything.</p><p>She was tempted to pinch herself to double-check that she was awake. She\u2019d always had a rich imagination\u2014the fantasies she could conjure up while pleasuring herself were dirty enough to shame a hooker. But the reality of being surrounded by these two powerful men was blowing all those previous daydreams out of the water. And boy, was she happy she hadn\u2019t bailed after things got too comfortable last night.</p><p>She\u2019d tossed and turned in bed all night, torn on what to do, but then Andre had pulled her close and whispered, \u201cLet that busy mind rest. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>After that, Evan had fallen into a sound, contented sleep. She\u2019d also awakened with renewed resolve to enjoy herself this weekend and to stop focusing on how being around the guys was affecting her. So she had a little affection blooming for Jace and Andre. Who cared? It was a natural reaction to sharing some hot moments and a bit of intimacy for the first time in a long while. It wasn\u2019t real, but was just another piece of the fantasy that would go away when she returned to reality on Monday.</p><p>And until that reality returned, she was going to be fully present with these two men. Not that she could think of much else right now even if she\u2019d tried.</p><p>Andre peeled off his shirt, which nearly sent her into full-scale panting mode, and Jace crowded behind her, all warm breath and body heat lapping against her skin. Neither was touching her, and that alone had her body ready to go mad with anticipation. Moisture coated her sex, and the deep throbbing that had begun the moment she\u2019d entered the kitchen this morning turned downright unbearable. She flexed her fingers, fighting the desire to reach out and grab one of the guys and take over.</p><p>She could be patient. After all, neither of the guys looked like they planned to wait long, not with the beautifully full erections that graced the front of Andre\u2019s boxer briefs and Jace\u2019s pajama pants.</p><p>Andre tossed his shirt to the side. \u201cTake off your panties for me. I want to see all of you.\u201d</p> <p>Andre\u2019s voice glided over her like thick cream, causing another rush of liquid heat to find its way to her pussy. She was sure the moment she took off her underwear, the evidence of her arousal would track down her thighs. How she could be so desperately aroused after her rocking night the previous evening was a wonder. Usually a good orgasm could keep her satisfied for days, but now it was as if the more she got the more she needed, like crack or chocolate-chip cookies.</p><p>She hooked her fingers in the waistband of her panties and slid them down her legs, enjoying the tickle of cool air against her hot skin.</p><p>When she returned to a full stand again, she found Andre staring with hungry interest at her newly bared flesh. \u201cLook how sexy and wet you are for us already. I bet you taste as sweet as you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Jace said, his voice soft and sexy against her ear.</p><p>Andre slid off his stool and crouched down, laying a hand on her hip and bringing his face to within inches of her. He nuzzled the spot where leg met pubic bone, inhaling deeply, then ran his tongue along her inner thigh.</p><p>Oh, Jesus. She tensed and grabbed his shoulder for support, fearing her knees would give out beneath her.</p><p>Warm hands palmed her waist and steadied her. Jace. \u201cYou can lean into me, pet. Let him taste you.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed against Jace and focused on simply feeling all the sensations. Andre\u2019s touch roamed over her legs, and his tongue traced the edges of her vee\u2014so close to her aching clit, but never actually touching it. She automatically widened her stance, silently asking for more, for some kind of relief. But instead of obliging, he drew the tip of his tongue along her outer folds, making her arch in his direction. Jace held her firm, not allowing her to place Andre\u2019s mouth where she most needed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, gorgeous?\u201d Andre asked, his tone teasing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d She let her head tilt back, and Jace took the opportunity to move his hands upward, finding her nipples and giving them a firm pinch. A deep groan escaped her. \u201cBoth of you. Absolutely killing me.\u201d</p><p>Andre chuckled. \u201cI promise no one has ever died from this. I like to take my time to explore.\u201d He flicked his tongue against her clit\u2014one sharp, teasing stroke that had her ready to beg. \u201cHow else will I figure out what makes you writhe, what makes you get this hot and wet?\u201d</p><p>He moved his hands up her outer thighs, tracking higher until his palms found her ass. His fingertips teased along the cleft. She quivered at the memory of Jace\u2019s fingers inside her the night before. Her nails dug into Andre\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMmm, so you like me touching you here,\u201d Andre said, drawing a finger lightly over her back opening. \u201cHave you let anyone have you here before?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBut you want to try it,\u201d Andre said, more a statement than a question.</p><p>A day ago, she would\u2019ve said no, but after her experience with Jace, the overwhelming sensations he\u2019d drawn out of her, she was more than curious about how it would feel to take it a step further. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready for both of us yet,\u201d Jace growled, his entire body seeming to turn into marble behind her. Andre sat back on his heels, his eyes narrowing as he looked past her to stare at Jace. She didn\u2019t turn around, but some silent, not entirely friendly communication seemed to be coursing between them.</p><p>When neither said anything, her nerves begin to rise. \u201cIs, uh, everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s expression softened as he brought his attention back to her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, bella. Jace here is just having a hard time letting me top you. It seems you inspire his selfish side. But, I didn\u2019t give you permission to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He drew his finger down the line of her abdomen, then leaned forward and kissed the spot above her mound. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll make you both wait a little longer for your pleasure now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>Those sensual lips of his curled. \u201cYou both need to learn better manners. Bella, follow me.\u201d He stood and took her hand, then shot a pointed look at Jace. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll deal with you in a second.\u201d</p><p>Jace would give Andre one more minute before he charged into his bedroom to see what the hell he was doing with Evan. Jace knew he was being an asshole. He\u2019d agreed to play second, and he didn\u2019t make agreements he didn\u2019t keep. But he was having trouble relinquishing control even though he was trying as hard as hell to be cool with it.</p><p>If he was smart, he\u2019d turn around and walk out of the cabin right now. Being around Evan was bringing up dangerous shit inside him. Old feelings he\u2019d thought had been buried deep enough never to resurface. But he couldn\u2019t will himself to move.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand through his hair and paced. Another minute passed, and Jace was ready to stalk across the house to bang on the bedroom door. But Andre slipped back into the kitchen, his dark eyes flaring, to intercept him. \u201cWhat the fuck is your deal, man?\u201d</p><p>Jace ignored the question. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Andre folded his arms across his chest in his take-no-shit cop stance. \u201cI left her in the bedroom so we could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell there isn\u2019t.\u201d Andre stepped closer, crowding Jace against the counter until he was so close, his body heat radiated onto Jace\u2019s bare chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this. You\u2019re fucking falling for her! Falling for someone else\u2019s woman, Jace. Are you that much of a masochist?\u201d</p><p>Jace groaned. \u201cCalm the hell down. I\u2019m not falling for her, okay? I used to love her. The possessiveness is just hard to shake.\u201d</p><p>Andre put a hand on Jace\u2019s shoulder and pinned him with his gaze. \u201cWell, I\u2019m about to help you shake it real fast because if you keep acting like this, I will lock that door and fuck her alone. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be caught in the middle of some stupid tug-of-war.\u201d</p><p>Jace clenched his fists, the thought of being cut out of the picture making him want to break stuff. But he knew Andre was right about it not being fair to Evan. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want that. And neither do I.\u201d Andre moved even closer and his hand went to the nape of Jace\u2019s neck. The firm grip and his nearness had Jace\u2019s heart picking up speed. He sensed some shift in his friend, and the change knocked Jace a bit off balance. The effect wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant. \u201cBut since you can\u2019t seem to adjust your attitude on your own, the only way I\u2019m letting you in that room with us is if you give me all the power. You need to see that you\u2019re nothing special to her. She\u2019ll give herself to me just like she did you. She\u2019s here for the fantasy. That. Is. All.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s jaw flexed. \u201cI\u2019m already letting you lead.\u201d</p><p>Andre gave him a smug smile. \u201cNo, Jace. All the power. I know you had to bottom when you trained, so I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t forgotten how to take an order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jace\u2019s jaw went slack. \u201cYou want me to fucking sub for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the only way to get it through your hard head that Evan isn\u2019t yours is to give up complete control. To me.\u201d With his other hand, he reached down and cupped Jace, smirking when Jace hardened beneath his touch. \u201cTrust that I\u2019ll make sure everyone has a good time, and we\u2019ll solve this little possessiveness problem you\u2019re having in the process.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Despite the shock of the suggestion, Jace shivered with pleasure at the touch, his hands gripping the counter behind him as Andre stroked the length of him through his pants. He had no idea what had come over Andre\u2014they\u2019d never touched like this outside of a scene, and Andre had certainly never challenged him for dominance, but he could tell the guy was dead serious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from anyone,\u201d Jace said though gritted teeth.</p> <p>\u201cYou will from me if you want in that bedroom. Otherwise, you can stay out here and take care of this hard-on by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jace tilted his head back, the simple stimulation doing more to him than it should. \u201cScrew you, Andre. I\u2019m not here to feed your let\u2019s-humiliate-Jace fantasies.\u201d</p><p>Andre stepped back\u2014the disgust clear on his face\u2014and his hand dropped to his side, leaving Jace hard and sweating. \u201cYeah, \u2019cause that\u2019s what I do, right\u2014humiliate subs?\u201d</p><p>Jace cringed. \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, one day you\u2019re going to figure out that not everyone is out to tear you down. I\u2019m trying to fucking help you not make the same mistake again.\u201d Andre turned his back to him to head toward the bedroom. \u201cEnjoy your morning, asshole.\u201d</p> <p>Jace squeezed his eyes shut, trying to get a hold of the funnel cloud of conflicting emotions and desires whirling through him. He hadn\u2019t meant to insult Andre, but he\u2019d never given control over to anyone. Even in training, the domme in charge of his submissive experience had accused him of trying to top her from the bottom. Anytime someone tried to direct him, he just wanted to lash out. His father\u2019s talent for humiliation had left him with more than just a bitter taste for authority.</p><p>But was he really going to stand by and listen to Andre and Evan screw while he sat out here like an idiot, nursing his pride?</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Andre looked back over his shoulder, his annoyance obvious. \u201cTalk fast, Austin. I\u2019ve got a beautiful woman bound and waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sub for you.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s jaw ticked slightly, but his eyes remained hard. \u201cTry to top me and I\u2019ll kick you out.\u201d</p> <p>Jace inhaled a deep breath through his nose, fighting the urge to tell Andre to fuck off. If Jace wanted his problem solved with Evan, this probably was a surefire way of doing it. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Andre\u2019s gaze tracked over him like a beast sizing up its prey. \u201cNow give me your wrists and shut your fucking mouth.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Evan flexed her wrists against the leather cuffs binding her arms together in front of her, unintentionally jangling the chain that attached the cuffs to a hook in the ceiling. Andre had left her standing there in front of the bed, her legs spread with a metal bar linking her two ankles, and had given her no further instructions.</p><p>She had no idea how long they planned to leave her like this, but all she knew was the longer she stood there, the wetter and more desperate she got. Never had she imagined being so deeply attracted to two different men at the same time, but she was discovering all kinds of secrets about herself this weekend. Including the fact that this whole bound and submissive thing was working for her on a number of levels. Time would only tell if all this self-discovery was a good or bad thing. Some switches may have been better left unflipped.</p><p>The door squeaked and she looked up, a gasp escaping as soon as she saw the state of the two men. Andre had his hand around the back of Jace\u2019s neck, leading him in, and Jace\u2019s wrists were bound behind his head, his fingers laced against the back of his scalp. The muscles in Jace\u2019s chest and arms were on full display in that position, the tribal-style tattoos on his bicep like rippling works of art. Evan\u2019s throat went dry at the beauty of him. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s gaze met hers and then roamed down the rest of her body. \u201cI could say the same to you, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause Jace couldn\u2019t play nice this morning, I now have two lovely slaves to play with.\u201d He pushed Jace forward. \u201cNow, go ask the lady to take off your pants. Both of you have lost the right to clothes this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jace looked like he wanted to throw a barb back at Andre, but he clenched his jaw and walked toward her. When he stopped in front of her, his eyes were green fire. \u201cWould you mind getting me naked, please?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her bindings and the spreader bar at her feet. \u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bright girl, bella. I suggest you get creative,\u201d Andre said, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>Jace raised an eyebrow in challenge. She yanked on the chain attached to the ceiling, making sure she had enough slack, then eased down until she was able to tilt forward and fall to her knees. The planes of Jace\u2019s well-honed abdomen were now eye level with her. He stepped a little closer, and she had the urge to lick him from head to foot. Instead, she leaned forward and drew her tongue along the irresistible v-line of his pelvis, tasting salt and a fine sheen of clean sweat.</p><p>He shuddered beneath the treatment and his cock, which was already beautifully hard, twitched against his pants. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say to torture me, pet.\u201d</p><p>Andre laughed as he stepped up beside them. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, but I appreciate your initiative. Feel free to taste him anywhere except that cock I know you like so much. Your mouth is mine today. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Jace and could see the amount of strength it was requiring for him to stay quiet and still, to let Andre be in control. It was obvious being submissive wasn\u2019t Jace\u2019s natural state, but she also couldn\u2019t miss the heat in his gaze and the response of his body. Natural state or not, he was as turned on as she was.</p><p>She nuzzled his navel with her cheek before grabbing the waistband of his pants with her teeth and tugging downward. As carefully as she could, she drew his pants down, freeing his erection and leaving him as bare as she was. He stepped out of the puddle of cotton on the floor, and she lifted her head to smile in victory at Andre.</p><p>\u201cNicely done, bella. Now back on your feet.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to get steady again and then pulled on the ceiling chain, drawing out the slack. Her arms rose in response until they were stretched above her head, leaving her spread and on display for the two of them.</p><p>Andre laid a hand on Jace\u2019s shoulder and pushed. \u201cOn your knees, Jace. Help me thank Evan for being such a helpful little sub.\u201d</p><p>Jace dropped to a kneel, and Andre stepped behind her, his arms wrapping around her hips and his fingers finding her heat. Andre gently spread the lips of her sex with this thumbs, exposing the evidence of exactly how aroused she was to Jace. Wet and swollen and pulsing with need.</p><p>Jace leaned forward and placed a soft kiss against her clit. \u201cSo, so pretty, pet.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps pricked her skin, Jace\u2019s rapt attention and the feel of his breath against her skin almost too much to bear. She couldn\u2019t remember ever aching for someone so damn much. The way the two guys made her feel\u2014like she was something to be worshipped, like no other woman had existed before this moment\u2014had more than her erogenous zones tightening.</p><p>Jace tasted her again with a patience that belied the hungry look in his eyes. Soft and teasing. Like he was savoring each nuance of her. Exploring which lick and nibble would make her tremble.</p><p>She panted softly. Even with the carefully measured strokes, his tongue was a lethal weapon against any control she\u2019d been maintaining. He nipped at her clit, and she arched up, the chains rattling loudly above her. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, no coming, bella.\u201d Andre slipped a finger inside her, while Jace continued to coax her into oblivion.</p><p>Pleasure, hot and overwhelming, made it near impossible to follow that instruction, but she held on with every ounce of willpower she had. She forced her eyes open so she could take in the erotic image of Jace bound and beautiful at her feet and Andre\u2019s tan fingers working against her pale skin.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are a good team,\u201d she said, her voice thick.</p><p>Andre nipped at her earlobe. \u201cBella, you have no idea.\u201d He shifted his position, letting his finger slip from inside her, and grabbed Jace\u2019s chin, halting him. \u201cEnough. You haven\u2019t earned the right to make her come.\u201d</p><p>Jace backed away, though he looked reluctant to do so, and rose to his feet, clearing the way for Andre. But when Andre stepped around her, he didn\u2019t face her. Instead, he locked eyes with Jace. \u201cI\u2019m going to unlock your wrists, but if those hands touch anything without permission, including yourself, I will secure you to that wall and make you watch. You got that?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s muscles flexed in the bindings, as if he were a lion ready to pounce the minute he was freed. But he nodded.</p><p>Andre\u2019s smile was wry as he stepped forward and unlocked the link securing the two cuffs to each other. Jace lowered his arms and rolled his shoulders, but otherwise remained where he was standing, his focus on Evan.</p><p>Andre walked over to the armoire against the wall and unlatched it. When he turned back around he was holding a riding crop. Evan\u2019s heartbeat ticked upward. She had enjoyed her little venture into spanking the night before, but this seemed like a whole different zip code. Andre rolled the thin shaft of the crop between his fingers, his attention on her. \u201cJace said you seem to like a little edge to your pleasure, bella. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe?\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s smile was soft. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I can turn that maybe into a yes. You remember your words?\u201d</p><p>She took a steadying breath. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Andre closed the distance between him and Jace, and with two quick snaps hit Jace\u2019s nipples with the riding crop. Jace sucked in a sharp breath and his cock flexed in response.</p><p>Andre smiled with satisfaction as he reached down and stroked Jace\u2019s length. \u201cSee, it\u2019s not so bad. Even a big tough dom like Jace knows how sweet a little pain can be.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s gaze darted down to Andre\u2019s grip then back to Evan, concern flashing in his eyes. \u201cI, uh, don\u2019t know if Evan\u2019s into, um, us. We didn\u2019t discuss that limit.\u201d</p><p>Evan barely choked back her own moan at the unashamed contact between the two men. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t censor yourselves for me. I could come just watching how hot the two of you look right now.\u201d</p><p>Jace raised his eyebrows, and Andre gave her a sly grin. \u201cJace, I think we have a naughty voyeur on our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we have a naughty everything on our hands,\u201d Jace said, giving her a smile that damn near melted the marrow from her bones.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Maybe it\u2019s time we make use of that.\u201d Andre stopped stroking Jace and handed him the riding crop. \u201cYou will hit her until she comes. And Evan, you will not come until I give you permission.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to do?\u201d Jace asked, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Andre leaned close to Jace\u2019s ear, but Evan could hear the resolute words nonetheless. \u201cI\u2019m going to make her fantasy come true.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to pause midbeat, but Andre was headed her way before she could fully process what she\u2019d heard. He reached out and touched her cheek. \u201cWhy the wide eyes, bella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little scared,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d He pushed her hair away from her face. \u201cJace and I would never hurt you. We only want to bring you to the place we know you can get to. Can you give us your trust?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, focusing on the sincerity swirling in those endless brown eyes. Trust wasn\u2019t something she dished out easily. People throughout her life had shown her time and again that it was a gift to be abused, but for some reason she found the answer jumping to her lips. \u201cYes. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The smile he gave her was tender, not at all like the stern face he\u2019d been wearing since he\u2019d slipped into his dominant role. He brushed a thumb across her lips, then leaned down and tasted her mouth in a sensual kiss, one that made her toes curl into the area rug. Gentle but demanding, Andre drew her out of her busy mind and into another place where her thoughts came slow like honey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Soon, a second set of hands touched her hair, her nape, and then lips were on her neck. Jace. The soothing comfort of having him there behind her added to the dreamlike buzz overtaking her senses. She wanted to dissolve into a puddle between them. Her limbs went liquid and the energy around them seemed to shift. This was supposed to be exciting, edgy, fun. That\u2019s what m\u00e9nage was about. But being between the two of them suddenly didn\u2019t feel as scandalous as it did right. Warmth was spreading not just between her legs but deep in her chest.</p><p>She had never really imagined what it would be like to be the recipient of so much attention. Hell, she\u2019d spent much of her life cutting her own skin just to prove to herself that she wasn\u2019t, in fact, invisible to everyone. But this amount of focus and affection was almost too much for her to process.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love how you taste, your scent,\u201d Jace whispered against her skin as he placed open-mouthed kisses along her spine. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been so damn perfect, Evan. Always.\u201d</p><p>The words and his use of her name were too much, the niggling worry exploding into an all-encompassing surge of anxiety. She yanked against the chains holding her arms above her head and pulled back from Andre\u2019s kiss. \u201cYellow.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyes met hers, his concern obvious, and Jace stopped what he was doing behind her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, bella?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, taking in a full breath, trying to hold it together. She couldn\u2019t do this. Couldn\u2019t do lovemaking. She wasn\u2019t strong enough for that. Not with these two. \u201cPlease, nothing romantic. I just want . . . I . . . Just the game. Please. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s frown was deep when she opened her eyes again, but after a searching gaze, he nodded. Without another word, he uncuffed her hands, bringing her arms down to her sides, and then squatted to unhook her ankles from the spreader bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s . . .\u201d She let the words trail off, not sure how to finish the sentence.</p><p>Jace stepped out from behind her, his face an unreadable mask. He tapped her chin with the flat end of the riding crop. \u201cNo more talking, pet. Andre\u2019s in charge, not you.\u201d</p><p>Andre rose after freeing her from the bar and pulled off his boxers. He gripped his erection and stroked his thumb over the glistening tip. \u201cThis is what you want, bella? No kissing and sweet stuff, just a hard cock ready and willing? \u2019Cause I can do that, too.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. She wanted all of those things\u2014the sweet and the dirty\u2014more than she cared to admit. But the romantic part was way too dangerous. Her heart always led her down the wrong path. She refused to follow its siren call again. She needed to keep her mind centered on the physical, on the insistent ache between her thighs and not the one the guys were causing in her chest. \u201cYes, sir. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>He moved past her and sank onto the bed, spreading out on his back, beautiful and naked and aroused. \u201cJace, bring her here and get her head back in the right place. If she\u2019s thinking this much, we aren\u2019t doing our job.\u201d</p><p>Jace grabbed the back of her collar, the pressure pushing against the front of her throat. \u201cCome on, pet. Let\u2019s get you focused.\u201d</p><p>Jace led her to the bed and hauled her onto it. Once she was on her knees, his fingers threaded into her hair and gripped tight. \u201cShow Andre what a talented mouth you have.\u201d</p><p>Without finesse, he pushed her head downward, and she opened her mouth to take in Andre\u2019s awaiting cock. Andre let out a deep grunt of appreciation, and between that response and Jace\u2019s almost painful grip on her hair, there wasn\u2019t any room left for thought. As Jace guided her up and down with unrelenting precision, her jangled nerves faded into the background, and her senses took over\u2014Andre\u2019s masculine flavor, the two men\u2019s intermingling scents, and Jace\u2019s control over her movements.</p><p>She focused on giving pleasure, on truly submitting, and on the consuming sensation of that loss of control. There was safety in that mindless state.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, Ev. You know what to do.\u201d Jace released her hair, and the bed dipped as he adjusted his position. She continued to swirl her tongue around Andre\u2019s length, loving the fact that with each swipe his thigh muscles tightened beneath her like he was barely maintaining his own control.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jace,\u201d Andre ordered.</p><p>Before she registered what he\u2019d said, the sharp bite of the riding crop smacked the back of her thigh. She gasped around Andre\u2019s cock as the stinging sensation raced over her skin. Jace gave her a second\u2019s pause, enough for her to call a word if needed. But when none came, he rained a set of lightning-fast blows against her bare bottom and thighs. Holy Lord. Fire lit up her nerve endings and sent luscious zinging heat straight to her most sensitive parts. She hummed her pleasure against Andre\u2019s shaft.</p><p>Andre rocked his hips forward, guiding her to take more of him. \u201cOoh, you like the feel of the crop, sweet bella. Jace does a good job, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as best she could.</p> <p>\u201cSpread your knees for him,\u201d Andre directed. \u201cGive him a pretty little target.\u201d</p><p>She braced her hands on Andre\u2019s thighs and adjusted her position, leaving her knees spread and exposed from behind while she continued to pleasure him.</p><p>The riding crop traced along the bottom curve of her ass, slowly, methodically, and then flicked, sharp and quick, against her pussy. She cried out around Andre\u2019s cock, the rush of pain and pleasure almost launching her into orgasm.</p><p>Andre grabbed her head. \u201cEnough. You\u2019re tempting me to finish this way.\u201d</p><p>She followed his directive and looked up to find him propped up on his elbows, eating her up with his gaze. Her eyes automatically shifted downward. \u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, look at you. Not just beautiful but submissive by instinct. You\u2019re going to be the fucking death of us both.\u201d He reached out and grabbed a condom from the side table. \u201cCome here, bella. I\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>After donning protection, Andre palmed her waist and she scooted up to straddle him. Jace slid off the bed, his eyes never leaving hers. She bit her lip, the reality that Jace was going to watch her fuck another man settling in. The knowledge came with equal parts guilt and illicit desire. Did they really do this with no jealousy? She couldn\u2019t imagine standing by while either one of them had sex with some other chick. The thought made her want to grow talons and scratch the hypothetical bitch\u2019s eyes out.</p><p>Jace gave her a nod, reading the question on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ev. I\u2019m fine. You\u2019re not the only voyeur in the room. Enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s hands traced up her sides, bringing her attention back to the handsome man beneath her. \u201cBlindfold her, Jace. I only want her focused on one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, bella. Not your choice.\u201d</p><p>Jace grabbed a strip of fabric from a drawer in the side table and tied it tight over her eyes, blocking out all but the faintest hint of light. Her heart began to hammer, but she didn\u2019t have time to worry further because Andre\u2019s large hands spanned her hips and drew her down onto his cock without ceremony. Oh, my. The sweet invasion dragged all her attention back to center, to the sensation of her body stretching to envelope his hard heat. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Andre soothed as he guided her up and down in an impossibly patient rhythm. \u201cRide my cock. You feel so good around me\u2014so hot and wet.\u201d</p><p>A ragged breath sounded to her right, and she knew Jace was watching them, listening to Andre\u2019s words. Picturing Jace standing there, hard and ready, getting off by seeing her take her pleasure with someone else was beyond erotic.</p><p>\u201cYou know how perfect you look right now, bella?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she dug her nails into Andre\u2019s ribs, keeping the slow pace though she ached to have him fuck her harder, faster. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo perfect that Jace can\u2019t help breaking the rules by stroking his own cock while he watches you,\u201d Andre said, his voice like velvet against her ears.</p><p>She groaned and another rush of heat flooded her sex, enveloping Andre\u2019s already slick shaft. She could picture Jace there\u2014muscles tight, sweat dampening his blond hair, his hand giving slow, firm strokes to himself while he watched her ride Andre\u2019s cock. Oh, God. Pleasure, quick and urgent, coiled low in her belly, and she had to suck in a deep breath to reel herself in. One touch to her clit and she would go off like a firecracker.</p><p>Using her hands to guide her, she leaned down to Andre\u2019s chest, finding those nipple rings she\u2019d been fantasizing about and brought her mouth down on one of them. She drew her tongue around the hardened nub and sucked the metal ring into her mouth, tugging in the process.</p><p>\u201cShit, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Andre said, his muscles going tense beneath her.</p><p>The cool touch of leather tracked down her spine as she worked\u2014Jace\u2019s riding crop cataloguing each vertebrae. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy, Ev. Andre likes the bite of pain with his fucking just like you do.\u201d</p><p>The riding crop snapped against her upper back in three successive jolts, lighting up her skin in radiant waves. She automatically bit down on Andre and he quaked beneath her, digging his fingers deeper into the curves of her hips and muttering a string of Spanish.</p><p>She took that as positive feedback and moved to the other side, pulling the ring with her teeth and clenching her inner muscles around him as she plunged down on his cock again. She loved that she didn\u2019t have to hold back, could be as bad as she wanted to be because neither of them was going to judge her. This was nothing like sleeping with the few guys she\u2019d dated in the past where she was always trying to guess what was the right or wrong thing to do. With Andre and Jace, it was all instinct, a primal place where there was no wrong way.</p><p>Jace continued with the riding crop, making her feel as if static had replaced the blood in her veins, and Andre finally gave in and picked up his pace, thrusting into her with near abandon.</p><p>Their bodies turned glossy with sweat and Andre\u2019s grip on her hips began to slide. \u201cLean back, bella,\u201d he said, his voice gritty.</p><p>She braced her hands behind her on his thighs and tilted her head back, letting her hair tickle the skin that Jace had lit on fire. Andre brought his hands down lower and flicked his thumb over her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she ground out, the word catching in her throat.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, bella,\u201d Andre warned. \u201cNot until I say.\u201d</p><p>Her nails bit into his skin as he continued to strum his thumb over her hot button. She didn\u2019t know if she could wait, if she could hold on much longer. Desire wicked through her like wildfire and she could feel the orgasm hovering on the edge of her control. Just one more stroke and . . .</p><p>Smack! Smack!</p><p>Fire lit up her nipples and she cried out, her voice echoing off the wood floors. Then ecstasy, hot and fierce, slammed her. Jace hit her again and her mind went fuzzy with the sensation of it all. She couldn\u2019t even lift her head\u2014all she could do was ride Andre and feel everything.</p><p>A deep moan ripped out of Andre, and his cock pulsed inside her, giving her his release with the force of a bullet train. But just when she was about to tip over with him, he moved his hand away from her clit. She whimpered in protest.</p><p>\u201cLift up, bella. You\u2019re not done.\u201d He grabbed her arms and braced her hands against his chest. His breathing was rapid beneath her fingertips. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned her, Jace. Take her.\u201d</p><p>She pushed upward, lifting off Andre\u2019s cock, and firm hands palmed her waist from behind. Her mind was still reeling, but the chill of gel being spread over her back opening jerked her back to the present.</p><p>Jace kissed the base of her spine. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready to take both of us together, but you\u2019re going to take me.\u201d</p><p>Andre found her clit again and stroked her with fingers slick with her juices. She closed her eyes behind the blindfold, the delicious pleasure almost sending her straight into orgasm. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Jace touched her gently then positioned himself at her back entrance, pressing the tip of his cock against her. \u201cFocus on letting me in, baby. Relax your muscles and push against me.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s fingers didn\u2019t stop their ministrations, and she held on to that sensation as she followed Jace\u2019s instruction. Her body resisted the invasion, making it feel like there was no way she could ever take him, but she wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She took another deep breath and focused on relaxing, on accepting him. The first thrust felt like she was going to rip apart, but then he pushed past the ring of muscle and all went white behind her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God . . .\u201d Her body turned as taut as a guitar string and every shred of her being seemed to jerk to hyper-awareness. Pleasure wasn\u2019t even a fair word for it.</p><p>Jace hissed out a breath as he pulled back and eased into her again. \u201cOh, Evan, baby.\u201d</p><p>His words stopped making sense and so did her thoughts. Andre\u2019s thumb took over her clit, and his fingers plunged deep inside her, stroking her as Jace continued rocking into her.</p><p>She felt . . . invaded. In the best possible way. Invaded and utterly dominated by the two of them. Her pleasure was no longer in her conscious control. Her arms began to quiver, and sweat trickled down her neck. Breath started to come in short fits and starts. She felt alive and electric and half out of her mind. The feel of both of them inside her something she\u2019d never forget. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . know . . . how much . . . longer . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Andre soothed. \u201cYou both have permission to come. Let it take you, bella. Let me watch both of you fall apart above me.\u201d</p> <p>With his free hand, Andre yanked off her blindfold and she found his eyes full of stark desire and something else, something far more intense.</p><p>Jace\u2019s own breathing became erratic, and his tempo went from canter to gallop. \u201cCome for me, Evan. Come for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyes stayed locked with hers as he stroked her clit with increasing pressure. Then his fingers curved inside her, hitting the spot that she\u2019d thought was a myth, and the world around her exploded.</p><p>A wretched cry tore out of her, and she thrust against Jace in a mindless frenzy, her entire body seeming to contract around him. She was no longer in control of her muscles\u2014her body was taking what it wanted, pushing her higher and higher into a place she hadn\u2019t been before. She was floating. No pain or worry. Just thoughtless bliss.</p><p>Somewhere in the distance, she heard Jace\u2019s own moan of ecstasy, felt his heat spill against the condom and the resulting softening of his grip on her waist.</p><p>Andre grabbed her quivering arms, and she collapsed against him in a boneless heap. Her mind couldn\u2019t process anything\u2014emotion, ecstasy, pain\u2014all of it wrapped around her in an overwhelming rush.</p> <p>Then, she lost it.</p><p>Tears\u2014something she hadn\u2019t felt against her cheeks in a decade\u2014sprung forth without warning or control. She didn\u2019t even realize what was happening until she found herself sobbing against Andre\u2019s sweat-slicked chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, bella.\u201d His hand caressed her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>The bed dipped and Jace grabbed her hand, running a thumb over her palm. \u201cAre you all right, Ev? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against Andre, the sobs continuing to wrack her like she was some delirious lunatic.</p><p>Jace kissed her knuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just let it out, sweetheart. This can happen sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Andre rolled to his side, taking her with him, and Jace stretched out along her back, spooning her. With soft caresses and soothing words, both men held on to her, letting her go through whatever craziness had taken her body and mind hostage until she didn\u2019t know which was more frightening\u2014that she was crying for the first time in years or that she was happy.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p> <p>Jace sank onto the couch across from Andre. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Andre was sitting forward on the loveseat, his elbows on his knees, fingers steepled. He nodded, though he looked lost in thought. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Jace ran a hand through his towel-dried hair. The shower hadn\u2019t cleared his mind like he\u2019d hoped. It\u2019d only left him more worried. And Andre looked to be on the same mental path as he was. \u201cSeemed like more than just a reaction to subspace, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Andre sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen people get emotional afterward, but it felt like more. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t that always the theme with Evan? Everything always felt like more. More intense. More important. More special. He glanced at Andre, debating whether or not he should share what he knew about Evan. Share the fear that wouldn\u2019t stop tapping at the back of his brain. If they were going to continue doing this with her, Andre needed to know.</p><p>Jace blew out a breath. \u201cShe used to have emotional problems . . . as a teenager. Maybe something like this is too much for her to handle.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s gaze lifted. \u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d</p><p>Jace held his stare. \u201cThe night I slept with her, I found healing scars on her stomach. Some old, some new. Deep cuts. All in a perfect alignment.\u201d</p><p>Andre winced. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>Jace sank against the couch cushions, the weight of the memory making him feel tired. \u201cI was so freaked for her when I figured out what she was doing, and then I was so fucking pissed at myself for falling into bed with her. We were close then and I should\u2019ve seen that she needed help, that she was lost. But I was too damn preoccupied with how much I wanted her to realize anything was wrong. Dude, she told me she loved me that night, and I fucked it up completely.\u201d</p><p>Andre rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s heavy stuff to process, especially at nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had this perfect night in bed. The lights had gone out from a summer storm, and the whole evening seemed to bring us to some other world where reality didn\u2019t exist. But while we were lying there afterward, the electricity came back on, and I saw her scars. I panicked and backpedaled like a damn coward. Told her that I should\u2019ve never touched her, that I had drunk too much and made a mistake, that she needed to tell my mom what she was doing or I was going to say something for her.\u201d He tilted his head back and stared at the wood-beamed ceiling. \u201cThen my parents came home unexpectedly and found us together, still half-naked. My dad kicked me out of the house for good that night and told me he would report me for statutory rape. Evan disappeared before brunch hit the table the following morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, man. No wonder you were relieved to see that Evan was okay. It had to be brutal not knowing where she was or if she was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Jace had spent months not sleeping, always carrying around the knowledge that wherever Evan was, it was his fault. His parents had asked him to look out for Evan when she\u2019d come to live with them, and he\u2019d been determined to show his father that he could be more than the family screw-up. He\u2019d befriended Evan, gained her trust, had made her feel safe in a new place. Then after all of that, he\u2019d still gone and proven his father right. He\u2019d fallen for a girl he didn\u2019t have any right to, one who needed a friend not a lover.</p><p>\u201cDid your dad actually turn you in?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cOf course he did. Bill Austin doesn\u2019t make idle threats. But I denied it and they couldn\u2019t find Evan, so I was never charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saved you by leaving.\u201d</p><p>Jace lifted his head. \u201cYeah, talk about guilt. But jail probably would\u2019ve been better than the nightmares I conjured up wondering what had happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t told you anything since she\u2019s been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We agreed to no past. I\u2019m not sure I want to know.\u201d His cell phone vibrated from the spot where he\u2019d left it on the dining room table. He ignored it. \u201cShe seems like she\u2019s got it together now, but there are shadows behind her eyes. And after the breakdown she had in there, I\u2019m not sure what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was exorcising something. I don\u2019t think it was a bad thing.\u201d Andre propped his feet on the coffee table. \u201cBut I can tell you one thing for sure: If Dr. Dan is vanilla, Evan is signing up for a life of frustration. I\u2019ve never seen someone as green as she is take to the sub role so well. Vanilla is not going to satisfy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me another reason to want Dr. Dan out of the picture.\u201d Jace stood and paced to the window at the front of the cabin. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the one reminding me why I shouldn\u2019t try to shoulder in on another guy\u2019s woman. Especially a guy who\u2019s about to give Wicked a much needed injection of cash flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching me with her didn\u2019t break the hold she has on you?\u201d Andre asked, his words measured.</p><p>Jace closed his eyes and pressed his forehead against the window. He\u2019d gone into that bedroom anticipating that seeing Evan with someone else would solve his problem. But it had only made it worse. Seeing her give herself over to the two of them, even watching Andre dominate her had gotten to him in a way that m\u00e9nage never did. He tapped his head against the glass. \u201cIt only made me want her more.\u201d</p><p>The couch squeaked as Andre shifted, and Jace vaguely registered the sound of his cell phone buzzing again. \u201cAnd having me there, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelt right.\u201d</p><p>Andre released a breath. \u201cSo I guess that leaves us with two options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We be smart and walk away now. Save us both the risk of getting attached and then getting our guts handed to us when she walks away.\u201d</p><p>Jace groaned and turned around. He was already knee-deep in attachment. \u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>Andre leaned forward, his expression weary. \u201cOr both of us spend the next two months showing her what she\u2019s going to be missing if she goes through with the marriage. Give her a chance to make that decision with her eyes wide open. And accept that we\u2019ll probably be sending her a goddamned blender as a wedding gift at the end of the process anyway.\u201d</p><p>Well, didn\u2019t each of those options sound like a frolic in the fucking flowers. Kick in the face now or kick in the balls later? Whichever path he chose, Jace knew Evan would leave at the end of it. It\u2019s not like he and Andre could offer her anything permanent even if she decided to renege on her engagement. There was no happily ever after waiting for her here. But at least in the second plan he\u2019d have the chance to touch her again and maybe he could save her from making the marriage mistake like he had.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can let her go yet,\u201d Jace admitted, the heft of that knowledge like sandbags on his shoulders.</p><p>Andre raked his hands through his hair, weariness clear on his face. \u201cThat makes two of us then. Aren\u2019t we a couple of masochistic assholes?\u201d</p><p>Jace walked over to the couch and perched on the arm of it. \u201cShe may not even agree to it. You saw how she reacted when things got too intimate. Maybe this is only a one-weekend, get-the-kink-out deal for her.\u201d</p><p>Andre snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying a person can cure themselves of being straight or gay. We know she\u2019s submissive. So we need to show her how nice it can be to fully embrace that.\u201d</p><p>The plan was starting to take shape in Jace\u2019s head, sounding more tempting as Andre kept talking. But he knew without parameters, they could all end up in a disastrous tangle at the end\u2014hurt feelings, possessiveness, jealousy, guilt. He\u2019d damaged Evan enough the first time around and didn\u2019t want to set her up for more pain. And hell, he needed to keep his own expectations in check. This weekend had proven that Evan could get through the cracks of what he thought was impenetrable armor. They all needed a parachute cord\u2014fine print at the bottom of their agreement\u2014that would allow them to go in with the end in mind.</p><p>Jace shoved his hands in his pockets and looked at his closed bedroom door, picturing how content and beautiful Evan had looked when he\u2019d left the room. \u201cAt the end of the two months, all of us walk away, no questions asked, no obligation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Andre frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we have to spell that out. What if she doesn\u2019t want to leave? What if we don\u2019t? A lot of possibilities could open up.\u201d</p><p>Jace stared at Andre as if he\u2019d spoken in tongues. \u201cPossibilities?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe the three of us could work out something less . . . time limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike be the guys she comes to on weekends to get her off so she can go back home to the good doctor with a smile on her face?\u201d The thought made the muscles in his neck tighten. \u201cI\u2019m not some . . . concubine. Or whatever the dude version of that would be.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyebrow arched in a way that rose Jace\u2019s hackles. \u201cOh, right. \u2019Cause what? Having a woman use you just for sex makes you feel cheap? News flash: That\u2019s your fucking MO, man.\u201d</p><p>Jace crossed his arms over his chest, the dig landing squarely. He knew it was his method\u2014no strings, no commitment, just a good time. But something about having only that tiny piece of Evan while knowing she\u2019d be giving everything else to someone else would be too much to tolerate. \u201cNot an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe we can be the guys she comes to without Dr. Dan in the picture at all. We can offer her a lot more than he can.\u201d</p> <p>Jace scoffed. Now Andre was venturing into the ridiculous. \u201cYou\u2019ve officially lost your mind, amigo. We can\u2019t compete with all that fairy-tale shit\u2014the dream wedding, the famous husband, the picture-perfect two and a half kids I\u2019m sure she wants. All we are is good in bed. Women fuck around with guys like us, but they want forever with guys like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that pile of bullshit, Jace. You know that both of us are more than capable of giving her what she needs even if it\u2019s not in the traditional way. And don\u2019t pretend this is all about sex. What just happened between the three of us in there felt a hell of a lot different than some carefree fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really have been drinking tainted Kool-Aid. What little picture have you painted in your mind, dude? A cute little house in the suburbs where we live together and share Evan? Maybe give her a kid or two and figure out who the daddy is by the hue of their skin? Have the neighbors call us fags and Evan a whore? Yeah, that sounds like a lovely life for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Andre paled a bit. \u201cNo, of course that wouldn\u2019t work. And I have no clue where things could lead. But maybe one of us could be with her publicly. No one else has to know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors.\u201d</p><p>Jace gave a derisive laugh. \u201cRight. Because God forbid your buddies on the force find out who you really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure it\u2019s not. Those guys know that you share women with your roommate? Or that you like to fuck other dudes sometimes? Cane \u2019em on occasion?\u201d</p><p>Andre winced. \u201cFuck you, Jace. Don\u2019t be an asshole just because you don\u2019t have the balls to open yourself up to something real for a change.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s neck muscles tightened, his blood beginning to roar in his ears. \u201cLast time I checked, learning from an utter failure was smart not chickenshit.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Andre\u2019s jaw ticked, a sure sign his own anger was grabbing hold. \u201cYou did not fail your marriage, Jace. Diana used you. She manipulated you so well with that fake-ass victim, please-take-care-of-me act that she still has you thinking you\u2019re the one who wasn\u2019t good enough. She wanted your money and to control you. When those two perks went away, she found someone else to manipulate. End of story. You were just too smitten to see her for what she was\u2014a well-groomed leech. Evan is not Diana.\u201d</p><p>Jace ground his teeth, the images of the day he walked in on his wife packing her bags flooding his brain. Jace had been busting his ass trying to get Wicked off the ground, doing his best to prove to Diana\u2014who\u2019d been categorically against the venture\u2014that leaving his father\u2019s business wouldn\u2019t alter the comfortable lifestyle she enjoyed. He\u2019d had his first big day of sales and had come home with an armful of roses and her favorite bottle of wine only to find her preparing to leave. A total fucking blindside.</p><p>Without a lick of emotion in her voice, Diana had told him she\u2019d been cheating on him with his former co-worker for months and that she was pregnant.</p><p>When Jace had asked if the baby was his, she\u2019d shrugged and said, \u201cHow could I trust you to raise a child? You can\u2019t even take care of me.\u201d</p><p>The child had turned out not to be his, but he\u2019d felt the loss as much as if it had been. He never wanted to feel like he had when she\u2019d walked out his door that night. He\u2019d rather be alone forever than experience that kind of emotional filleting ever again.</p> <p>\u201cThis discussion is over,\u201d Jace said, going cold at the memory. \u201cTwo months . . . if Evan agrees. We\u2019ll be exclusive with her during that time. Then we all wash our hands of it. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyes burned with all the things Jace could tell he wanted to say, but finally he nodded, his jaw tight. \u201cFine. Two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, the fight draining from his voice. As insane as Andre was, he couldn\u2019t blame the guy for considering more with Evan. She\u2019d opened up an ache a mile wide inside of him, too. But clearly they hadn\u2019t had the same effect on her. She hadn\u2019t given them any indication she wanted anything more than sex. She was in love with someone else, and they needed to keep that vital fact at the forefront of their minds.</p><p>Andre gave a weary sigh and crooked a thumb in the direction of the dining area. \u201cThat\u2019s the third phone call you\u2019ve gotten in ten minutes. You may want to get it.\u201d</p><p>Jace stalked across the room, his mind still spinning from the argument, and grabbed the phone. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally! Where the hell are you?\u201d his sister demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get ahold of you all morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of town . . . at a client\u2019s. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s in the hospital. They think she had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d All the air whooshed from Jace, and his grip tightened on the phone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cThey\u2019ve stabilized her, but they\u2019re doing a lot of tests to see what the problem is. She may need surgery.\u201d</p><p>He headed toward his bedroom. \u201cWhich hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Baylor in Southlake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about an hour outside of the city. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, relief in her voice. \u201cAnd fair warning, Dad\u2019s on a rampage about everything\u2014the ambulance response time, the nurse, you name it. He even snapped at Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, the apocalypse must be near.\u201d Jace couldn\u2019t even recall his dad throwing a firm word in his oldest brother\u2019s direction. Wyatt, with his genius IQ and oh-so-responsible nature, had never been able to do any wrong in his father\u2019s eyes. Jace had been half-convinced his brother had come out of the womb a grownup. \u201cTell Mom I\u2019m thinking of her and will be there in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Jace exchanged good-byes with his sister, tossed the phone on the bed, and grabbed his bag off the floor to start packing his clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Andre asked from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to head back.\u201d Jace explained the situation as quickly as he could while gathering his things and stuffing him into his duffel bag. \u201cCan you tell Evan what\u2019s going on? I hate running out like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Jace sighed. The last thing he wanted to do was leave Evan behind after all that had happened in the last day and a half, but he had to see for himself that his mom was okay. At least he knew Andre would take good care of Evan for the rest of the weekend. \u201cIf Evan agrees to the deal, tell her that I want her back here next weekend. No excuses. She has two months before she gets married. I plan to help her make the most of it.\u201d</p><p>Andre smirked. \u201cAnd I plan to show her why she shouldn\u2019t walk away.\u201d</p><p>Jace slung his bag over his shoulder and pushed past Andre to go back into the living room. \u201cWe\u2019re not that good, Andre. Don\u2019t make this into something it can never be.\u201d</p><p>Something Jace could never be.</p><p>Good enough for Evan.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Jace climbed out of his Dodge Viper, the only luxury item he hadn\u2019t been able to part with when he gave up his financial gig, and checked his watch. He\u2019d made it to the hospital in half the time it would\u2019ve taken a normal person to complete the trip. Sometimes a fast car and a roommate who could get you out of speeding tickets came in handy.</p><p>He hurried up to the floor his older sister, Leila, had told him their mom was on and found her and Wyatt talking quietly in the waiting area. Leila stood when she saw Jace approaching, pushing her hair behind her ears\u2014something she did nonstop when she was stressed. She gave him a tight hug when he reached her. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know how fast you drove to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>She huffed as she pulled back from the embrace. \u201cThank God you finally answered your phone. You had me freaking out this morning that something had happened to you, too. Where the hell were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some business outside of town.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt sniffed. \u201cYeah, right. Was the business blonde or brunette this week? Or maybe both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Wy,\u201d Jace said, shooting his brother an annoyed glance. \u201cNot all of us want to spend our time jerking off to Excel spreadsheets.\u201d</p><p>Leila raised a palm to each of them. \u201cCan it, boys. This is not the time. Here comes Dad.\u201d</p><p>Jace glanced over his shoulder to find his father stalking toward them. How the man managed to be in a full suit even though it was a weekend and his mother had supposedly been rushed to the ER in the wee hours of the morning was a wonder. Perhaps he\u2019d taken to sleeping in them.</p><p>Jace knew the second his father registered his presence because his lip curled in that derisive way that seemed especially reserved for his youngest son. \u201cWell, look who decided to show up.\u201d</p><p>Jace ignored the remark, as he did most of the things his father said to him.</p><p>Wyatt rose from his chair when their father stopped in front of them. \u201cHow\u2019s Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tired. Said they\u2019ve poked and prodded her so much she feels like a head of cattle. They haven\u2019t determined what the exact problem is yet, but I\u2019m not sure if that doctor would know an ass from an elbow. I\u2019ve requested a specialist.\u201d</p><p>Leila sighed. \u201cDaddy, that doctor was the specialist. One of the top in the field from what the nurse said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wonder how much he paid her to say that,\u201d his father muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan I see mom?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re concerned?\u201d his dad asked. \u201cSeems she ranks pretty low on your list since you couldn\u2019t even bother to get here until lunchtime. Wyatt\u2019s been here since five and even Leila got here by seven and she had to drop the kids off at a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>Jace clenched his teeth. \u201cI got here as soon as I found out.\u201d</p><p>Leila touched Jace\u2019s arm. \u201cShe\u2019s in room three thirty-three.\u201d</p><p>Jace stepped around his father, trying to keep his smartass gene in check, and headed toward his mother\u2019s room. He was here for her. Not to spar with his dad.</p><p>When he tapped on the door and peeked into the room, he was met with a view of his mother linked up to a tangle of beeping machines. Her skin was paler than he\u2019d ever seen it and her light hair, always perfectly coiffed, was sticking up on end. The whole scene made his chest hurt. She looked like she\u2019d aged ten years since he\u2019d seen her.</p><p>Reid had told him how rundown his mom was looking, but Jace still hadn\u2019t rushed over there to see her. He\u2019d been a damn coward. Thank God she was okay. If she had . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His mom cracked open her eyes, cutting short his runaway thoughts, and gave him a soft smile when she saw him standing there. \u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d His mother had always called him by his given name, insisting that she hadn\u2019t gone through the trouble of picking out a name, only for it to be shortened.</p> <p>\u201cYour father told me you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cLike I would miss the chance to drink free coffee and stare at hot nurses.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little laugh. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He sat down next to her and captured her small hand in his.</p><p>\u201cFor not coming in here with the doom and gloom face. Your brother and sister are looking at me like I\u2019m going to be playing cards with St. Peter next week. And don\u2019t even get me started on how your father is acting.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cThey just don\u2019t realize how tough you are. I know you\u2019re not going anywhere. Anyone who can live with Dad this long can handle way worse than some lame heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019m never going to be allowed back in this hospital after your father is finished with them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that means you better stay healthy from now on, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, I\u2019ll probably have to give up bacon. Not sure if that\u2019s a life worth living.\u201d She adjusted herself to sit up a bit more. \u201cBut enough about all this. I\u2019m tired of talking about it. Tell me what\u2019s going on with you. You haven\u2019t been by in a long time.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, guilt tugging at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just been busy with the store. I landed a big contract and have been working on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Is that what\u2019s got that light back in your eyes?\u201d She nodded in his direction. \u201cYou look happier than you have in a while.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI guess so. It could mean a lot of money for the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her eyes narrowed, giving him that look that mothers had the patent on. \u201cIf money made you that happy, you never would\u2019ve left your father\u2019s business. What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, not sure if he should bring up Evan when his mom was in a fragile state. It was good news but he didn\u2019t want it to stir up any of the negative memories of when Evan left.</p><p>\u201cSpill it, Jason.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou missed your calling as a police interrogator.\u201d</p><p>Her perfectly manicured brow arched.</p><p>\u201cI saw Evangeline.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think it was possible for his mom to pale any further, but she did. She pulled her hand from his and brought it to her chest. \u201cYou found her? Is she\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s great, Mom. Beautiful, successful, engaged.\u201d He almost choked on that last descriptor, but managed to get it out. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even recognize her. I didn\u2019t at first.\u201d</p><p>She blinked hard, tears lining her bottom lids. Her voice was barely a whisper. \u201cThank you, Lord. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Me, too.\u201d He grabbed one of the paper cups from the side table and poured her a glass of water, worried that he\u2019d stressed her too much with the news. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She took the cup from him, her hand shaking a bit, and sipped. \u201cHow did you find her?\u201d</p><p>Jace explained how he\u2019d stumbled upon Evan in South Padre, but his mom seemed to only be listening with half an ear. He finished the story, and the room filled with the quiet beeping of the machines. He shifted in his chair and cleared his throat. \u201cMaybe after you\u2019re back on your feet I can bring her by so you can see how well she\u2019s doing for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her water for a while longer, then finally spoke. \u201cI doubt she\u2019d want to see me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and leaned forward, bracing his forearms on his knees. \u201cWhy not? You two always got along.\u201d</p><p>His mom looked toward the room\u2019s only window, her whole body seeming to sag deeper into the sheets. \u201cBecause she has no reason to want to see me. I was just another person who failed her in her life. I knew how much support she needed when we signed up to have her in our home. But when she wouldn\u2019t open up around me, I felt useless and fell back to working my crazy hours. I gave up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t exactly an easy shell to crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou managed to get by her defenses.\u201d A humorless smile touched her lips. \u201cThat was always your gift. Wyatt the brilliant mind, Leila my artist, and you the big heart. You have a way of caring for people that makes it impossible for them to not let you in and love you.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI think I got the short end of the gene pool on that one, Ma. And that superpower definitely didn\u2019t work on Diana.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Diana was a spoiled waste of space. And you think your brother or sister wouldn\u2019t kill to have a little bit of your charisma? You have friends like Reid and Andre who would literally take a bullet for you. You have every woman you meet wanting to be part of your orbit. People are drawn to your kind spirit.\u201d</p><p>Jace almost said that the woman thing wasn\u2019t because of his spirit, but remembered he was talking to his mother. \u201cI think they may have doped you up a bit too much there, Ma. You\u2019re getting sappy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that when none of us could get through to Evangeline, you got her to let her guard down, to smile. I thought it was a good thing for both of you. You were showing your father and I you were capable of being responsible, and Evangeline had someone to relate to.\u201d She shook her head and looked down at her hands. \u201cBut as time went on, I knew I\u2019d made a mistake. I saw how you two began to look at each other. I sensed the shift, and I didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMom, stop. What happened wasn\u2019t your fault. I was old enough to know better. I should\u2019ve had the strength to stay away.\u201d</p><p>His mom didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds and when she lifted her head to face him again, her eyes were full of regret. \u201cYou were all she had holding herself together. When we kicked you out that night, the glimmer of light behind her eyes went out. She begged your father to let you stay, that she could go live somewhere else for a while. But your father told her she shouldn\u2019t waste time being a martyr for you, that you\u2019d have another girl in your bed by the next night, that she didn\u2019t mean anything to you.\u201d</p><p>Jace sucked in a breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She swiped at the moisture on her cheek. \u201cI should\u2019ve stepped in and stopped him. Or at least stayed up with her that night and talked to her more. You\u2019d made a huge mistake, but I knew you honestly cared for her.\u201d</p><p>Jace put his head in his hands, his heart breaking for Evan all over again. He\u2019d tried to sneak back into her room that night, apologize for the things he\u2019d said, but she\u2019d refused to open the window for him. Now he knew why.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning, there was a note tucked into my coffee mug. She told me she was sorry and for me not to be angry with you. She said she\u2019d loved you and had wanted it to happen, but realized afterward that she\u2019d made a mistake. She pleaded for me not to let your father kick you out for good\u2014that you didn\u2019t deserve to lose your family, not over someone worthless like her.\u201d</p><p>His gut twisted. All those things he\u2019d said to her that night and she\u2019d still defended him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me about the note?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, and set the cup down, the beeping on her heart monitor ticking up a bit. \u201cBecause it was a suicide note, honey.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s breakfast threatened to come up. He gripped the arms of his chair.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I couldn\u2019t let you bear that on your conscience if she had gone through with it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou made a bad decision, but Evangeline was a fragile soul. That night was simply the tipping point. We all could\u2019ve handled things differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all this time, you thought she was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019ve never forgiven myself for what happened. It was my negligence that started that ball rolling.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, maybe she had gotten the ball rolling but his stupidity and his father\u2019s hateful words had dropkicked that ball over the edge. His jaw clenched, imagining how Evan must\u2019ve felt when his dad had told those lies about him. \u201cShe ran away thinking I\u2019d used her. That everything between us had been a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hadn\u2019t it been?\u201d said a voice from the doorway.</p><p>Jace jerked his attention to the door to find his dad leaning against the jamb, newspaper tucked under his arm. Apparently he\u2019d been standing there long enough to follow the conversation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t know what you were doing back then\u2014the kind of crowd you were hanging out with, the types of parties you were going to,\u201d he said, stepping inside the room. \u201cYou were cycling through women like a chain smoker goes through Marlboros. Evangeline wasn\u2019t anything to you except another conquest. She was just so desperate for someone in her life to love her that she read what she wanted to in the situation. I was the only one who had the guts to tell that poor girl the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jace had spent a lot of his life angry with his dad, but as he stood across from him right then, he realized that the anger had finally morphed into hate. \u201cShe could\u2019ve killed herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault would that have been?\u201d he asked, his voice as cool as the gray of his eyes. \u201cWhatever that girl has been through since she walked out our door\u2014and I guarantee you the street wasn\u2019t kind to a kid like her\u2014has been on you, son. Your fault. Because no matter what we\u2019ve tried with you, you\u2019ve always managed to be a fuckup.\u201d</p><p>His mother gasped. \u201cBill! Stop it.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s words sliced through Jace like a jagged hunting knife, skinning him until everything inside him felt bloodied and raw. He couldn\u2019t even form the words to respond.</p><p>His father made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat as he headed toward his mother\u2019s bed. He tossed the newspaper onto the rolling table, knocking over his mother\u2019s empty cup. \u201cI got you your paper, Sherry. Seems our son is now set on humiliating us in front of the whole damn city.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s eye caught one of the headlines on the page his dad had folded: Councilman Speaks Out Against Suggestive Ads by Local Sex Shop. A picture of both their local councilman and Jace\u2019s store were included.</p><p>His father righted his mother\u2019s cup and poured a glass of water like he hadn\u2019t just ripped his son to shreds. He took a swig of the water, his back to Jace. \u201cI thought if I was hard enough on you I could make you into a man, but all you continue to be is an embarrassment to this family. I\u2019m ashamed to call you my son.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s eyes were wide as she looked between the two of them. \u201cBill, take a breath. Let\u2019s calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t bother. Let me relieve you of your hardship, Bill,\u201d Jace said, finally regaining his voice. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have to call me anything from now on. For all I care, you can tell people you\u2019re the father of two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, wait,\u201d his mother pleaded.</p><p>Jace stepped around the other side of her bed and leaned down to kiss her cheek. \u201cI love you, Ma. I\u2019ll check on you later, but I can\u2019t be around him anymore. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still not answering?\u201d Evan asked, nervously swirling her spoon in the soup Andre had insisted she eat when she\u2019d woken up from her nap.</p><p>Andre tossed the cell phone onto the dining room table and leaned against the wall. \u201cNo. I called his sister, and she said he left the hospital over an hour ago after he had some blowout with their dad. Apparently the two have vowed to never speak to each other again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She cringed. \u201cGuess things haven\u2019t improved with Jace and his father. They were always at each other when I lived with them.\u201d</p><p>Andre snorted. \u201cHis dad\u2019s a jackass. He has this amazing son who\u2019s breaking his back to run a business he\u2019s passionate about\u2014with no help from the family fortune, by the way\u2014and all his father can see is that Jace doesn\u2019t fit into the mold he\u2019s created for him. Jace would never admit it to anyone, but his father\u2019s constant digs tear him up.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down at her soup. She\u2019d woken up from her nap planning an escape route. The two men had stripped more than her clothes in that bedroom this morning. Her defenses had been left in a tattered heap on the floor, and she needed time to reconstruct them before facing either of the guys again. But the thought of Jace somewhere alone, feeling worthless in his family\u2019s eyes, had her chest feeling tight.</p><p>She pushed her chair away from the table and looked up at Andre. \u201cYou need to go find him.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyebrow quirked. \u201cYou want me to leave you to find Jace.\u201d</p><p>She straightened in her chair, feeling more resolute by the second. \u201cYes. I\u2019m not going to be able to relax and have fun here if I know he\u2019s somewhere else feeling shitty. Go find him, take him out for a beer, do whatever guys do to make each other feel better. I\u2019ll be fine spending the rest of the weekend in my cabin catching up on my reading.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Andre\u2019s mouth tilted up and he pushed off the wall. \u201cBella, I agree with you that Jace probably doesn\u2019t need to be alone right now, but I\u2019m not leaving you anywhere. You want me to find him, then you come with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, flustered at the suggestion of taking any of this outside The Ranch\u2019s gates. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I mean . . .\u201d She scrambled for an explanation that wasn\u2019t I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m falling for the two of you. \u201cMy agreement with Daniel is for here, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t tell him you left. You can stay with us tonight. We have a guest bedroom if you need your own space.\u201d</p><p>Stay with the two of them? At their place? The whole thing sounded stupid and ill-advised and way too enticing. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, bella. Let\u2019s not pretend this isn\u2019t the same thing under a different roof. Being at The Ranch doesn\u2019t make what we\u2019re doing any less real.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands. Real. That was exactly what this was. Too fucking real. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Jace and then I\u2019ll go home. I\u2019ll tell Daniel I wanted to end the weekend early.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHow about we cross that bridge when we get to it? We need to track down Jace first.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, feeling better now that she had an escape hatch rigged up. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your stuff packed up, and I\u2019ll call Grant. He\u2019s not going to let you leave with me unless he verifies that it\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m a grown woman. I don\u2019t need permission to go with someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you do,\u201d Andre said, crouching down in front of her and laying a light kiss on her lips. \u201cGrant doesn\u2019t mess around with people\u2019s safety. He\u2019ll just make sure that you\u2019re going with me on your own volition and not because I ordered you as your dom to do so.\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve entered an alternate universe.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck, sending warmth trickling down her spine and beating back some of the anxiety that had crept in. \u201cAnd what do you think of the natives?\u201d</p><p>I think I\u2019ve found my home planet. But she didn\u2019t share that thought. \u201cI think they\u2019re cocky and high-handed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly against her skin.</p> <p>\u201c. . . And pretty damn irresistible.\u201d She let herself fall under the spell of his touch and laced her fingers in his hair, enjoying the satiny slide of his dark locks between her knuckles. \u201cWell, two of them, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. We have a bit of a soft spot for you, too. In fact, I have something to propose to you on the way over.\u201d He pulled back to look at her, his grin sly. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t stop kissing you now, we\u2019ll never leave this cabin. Jace will be on his own.\u201d</p><p>She drew her hands down from his hair to his stubbled cheeks and sighed. It was really unfair for him to be so damn delicious. He made it next to impossible to hold on to her resolve. \u201cAll right, call the Grand Poo-bah so I can get permission to leave with you, kind sir.\u201d</p><p>She and Andre didn\u2019t have to search too hard for Jace. His little sports car was parked on the side of the building that housed both Wicked and the guys\u2019 third-floor loft. Andre entered the code to open the gate for the private parking area and pulled into the spot next to Jace\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what the damage is. My guess is he\u2019ll either be a total brooding pain in the ass or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAct like absolutely nothing is wrong.\u201d</p><p>He cut the ignition and smirked at her. \u201cHasn\u2019t changed much since his teenage years, huh?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt always seemed like the harder his dad came down on him, the more devil-may-care he became. Like he was determined to show his father his opinion didn\u2019t even make a blip on his radar.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s brown eyes reflected the same sadness she felt for Jace. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to go remind him that not everyone thinks he\u2019s a jackass.\u201d He pushed open his door. \u201cWell, unless he is acting like a jackass, then all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Andre led her to the front door of the store. \u201cLet\u2019s check his office first. He\u2019s been spending a lot of time in there lately.\u201d</p><p>The bottom floor of Wicked was more a lobby and didn\u2019t have any products displayed. Instead, the most gorgeous black-and-white erotic photography Evan had ever seen adorned the dark maroon walls. Soft classical music filled her ears as well, but she had trouble dragging her focus away from the artwork. She touched the corner of one large piece\u2014a collared woman was in the process of disrobing and in the background, two men sat in the darkened corner of the bedroom, leaning back in their chairs, their attention held captive by the display.</p><p>The photographer had captured the light so perfectly. The soft curves of the woman\u2019s body gleamed, and the dark angles playing over the faces of the men she was undressing for promised wickedness to come. Something that could\u2019ve looked pornographic under an amateur\u2019s camera had been morphed into something stunning and pure. \u201cGod, I wish I was this good.\u201d</p><p>Andre slid a hand onto her lower back. \u201cI have no doubt you are. I can\u2019t wait to see your photography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do this type of work,\u201d she said, looking at the price on the picture and trying to keep a straight face at the astronomical amount.</p><p>Evan let Andre lead her up the stairs to the main store. She paused at the glass door leading into the shop, which had poetry scrawled across it in calligraphy. She read it aloud, running her fingers over the lettering:</p><p>Where true Love burns Desire is Love\u2019s pure flame;</p><p>It is the reflex of our earthly frame,</p><p>That takes its meaning from the nobler part,</p><p>And but translates the language of the heart.</p><p>SAMUEL COLERIDGE</p><p>Andre smiled. \u201cThat was Jace\u2019s mission statement when he started Wicked. He wanted a place lovers could come to without shame. A place where desire and sex were simply seen as natural extensions of people\u2019s love for one another.\u201d</p><p>She reread the poem, absorbing the words. \u201cI had no idea he was that much of a hopeless romantic.\u201d</p><p>Andre pushed open the door. \u201cHe used to be, bella. Life can tear that out of you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Jace turned out not to be in his office so Andre led her to an unmarked door at the back of the building and typed in a code on a keypad to unlock it. \u201cWe have to trek up another flight of stairs, but the view\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said as she followed him up, though she wondered why someone who came from gaudy money like Jace chose to live in a walk-up above his business.</p><p>Andre peeked back at her and sniffed when he saw her expression. \u201cDon\u2019t ever play poker, Evan. You\u2019ll get taken for everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wear your every thought on your face.\u201d He started climbing the stairs again. \u201cJace lives here because he turned away his family\u2019s money. They won\u2019t give him access to his trust fund unless he returns to the family business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also why we\u2019re roommates. Helps both of us to split the expenses.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only reason you live with him.\u201d</p><p>He paused, looked back down at her again, his posture rigid. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poker face isn\u2019t in place all the time either, officer,\u201d she said, her voice gentle. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, he has no clue.\u201d</p><p>Andre shook his head, his expression resigned. \u201cI knew you were going to be the death of me, bella.\u201d</p><p>When they both reached the top of the stairs, Andre swung open the door to find the TV blaring ESPN and two empty beer bottles sitting on the coffee table, but the living room otherwise empty. She peered over his shoulder. \u201cMay have some brooding on our hands.\u201d</p><p>They stepped inside the loft, and she locked the door behind her. The place was much bigger than she\u2019d expected from looking up from the street. High ceilings with exposed ductwork, a solid wall of windows draped with simple white curtains at the far end of the place, and gorgeously aged brick walls flanking the left and right sides of the space. Every area was open to the next\u2014kitchen, dining area, living room\u2014with only a few supporting columns here and there. A metal staircase in the corner of the dining space spiraled up to an open second level where the bedrooms were located.</p><p>\u201cWow, y\u2019all aren\u2019t exactly slumming it, Andre.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off the television, grabbed the beer bottles off the table, and walked toward the kitchen. \u201cJace worked a good deal for this when he leased the store space on the two bottom levels. Plus, believe me, it didn\u2019t look like this when we first moved in. Someone had divided up all the space with cheap sheetrock. Took me a year to tear this thing down to the bones and get it in this shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did all this?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the bottles in a trash can and shot her a deviant smirk. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? All Mexicans know how to do construction. It\u2019s like a requirement to be a card-carrying member.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cSmartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I worked at a Home Depot to get through college and took every DIY class I could. After the crap I see every day at work, sometimes it\u2019s nice just to just zone out and hit shit with a hammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally get that.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the windows. \u201cJace is probably out on the balcony. You should go out there first. You\u2019re better-looking than me, so there\u2019s less of a chance of getting your head bitten off.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath, trying to shore up her emotions. She needed to make sure Jace was okay and leave. That was it. \u201cAll right. Wish me luck.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back the curtains and found the sliding door that led to the outside balcony. Jace was perched on the edge of a lounge chair, forearms braced on his thighs, looking off into the greenbelt that bordered the back of the building. His head turned in her direction when she shoved open the door and stepped outside.</p><p>His expression remained flat when he saw it was her. \u201cYou were supposed to stay with Andre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking Andre,\u201d he muttered, turning back to stare at the view.</p><p>She took a tentative step forward. \u201cYour mom okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cProbably going to need bypass surgery, but yeah.\u201d His words were clipped, his tone without emotion.</p><p>Evan didn\u2019t know how to handle this version of Jace. She was so used to the guy who seemed like nothing ever got to him. She risked moving closer and sat on the lounge chair next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine your mom slowing down long enough for them to even keep her in a hospital bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh, no kidding.\u201d He laced his fingers between his knees, still only looking out at the trees. A long stretch of silence passed, and she began to feel like an intruder in whatever world he was lost in. It was stupid to think that she could offer him any comfort. What was she to him besides the girl he\u2019d messed around with this weekend? He\u2019d made it obvious that he hadn\u2019t wanted Andre to bring her here. She shifted forward, planning to stand up and leave him to his thoughts, but his quiet voice halted her. \u201cMom told me what my dad said to you the night you ran away.\u201d</p><p>The statement knocked her back on her butt. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her, the wear of the day evident in every line of his face. \u201cI need you to know that what he said wasn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cJace, look, that was a long time ago. Let\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say the right things to you that night either. I know that. When I saw your cutting scars, I got scared.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down at her hands, her cheeks heating with shame. \u201cYou were right to be worried. I was a mess back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were hurting, and I should\u2019ve been there for you. Should\u2019ve seen that you needed a friend, not a bed buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who kissed you first. I wanted it to happen. You had been an amazing friend to me, but I wanted all of you. Wanted you to look at me the way you looked at those girls you dated. To feel beautiful and important. It was a stupid teenage crush.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and grabbed her hand. \u201cAnd I should\u2019ve stopped things before they turned sexual. I was nineteen and knew better. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t real for me, too. You were never just some girl to me. I loved you long before you kissed me that night, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you that when you needed to hear it the most.\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened with the old grief of that night\u2014the devastation she\u2019d felt when he\u2019d turned away from her. \u201cI was a messed-up kid, Jace. I pinned all that hope on you because you were the first boy who ever made me feel like I was worth something. It wasn\u2019t a fair burden for you to carry. Whether you loved me back shouldn\u2019t have been a life-and-death matter.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cWhat happened when you left? Mom told me about your note.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, the turmoil she\u2019d felt inside back then still branded onto her psyche. \u201cI sat on the edge of a bridge, watching the black water swirl, thinking that if I jumped no one would miss me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and caught the pain that crossed his face. \u201cOh, Ev . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sat there for what seemed like forever, trying to get the nerve to just do it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stopped you?\u201d</p><p>Her lips lifted into a humorless smile. \u201cThis cocky street kid ambled by and plopped down next to me like I\u2019d invited him to sit there. He told me, \u2018Ya know, they\u2019ve done studies and shit. Every person who\u2019s survived a suicide jump has said they regretted jumping halfway into the fall. Makes you feel pretty bad for the dumb fucks who don\u2019t live to fill out that survey.\u2019 Then he offered to share his bag of Cheetos with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeh. And that convinced you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMade me think of my dad. Made me wonder if he would\u2019ve changed his mind if given the chance. And suddenly I didn\u2019t want to end up like him. I shared the Cheetos and let the kid lead me back onto solid ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the kid\u2019s angle? Trying to get in your pants?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, the thought altogether ridiculous. \u201cNo, you would\u2019ve been more his type than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me back to an apartment he was crashing at. Gave me a place to stay and eventually a way to make money. Saved my life basically.\u201d</p><p>Frown lines appeared on Jace\u2019s face. \u201cA way to make money?\u201d</p><p>She bit the inside of her lip, not wanting Jace to know the shameful things she\u2019d done, but knowing he deserved honesty. \u201cHe knew a guy who owned a dinky little photo studio. The guy paid me under the table, and I learned everything I could about photography.\u201d</p><p>Jace cringed, too smart not to read in between the lines. \u201cBehind the camera or in front of it, Ev?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI really would rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Ev. I need to know what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, the guy wanted me for photos. His Internet business thrived on underage teens. But all my . . . scars made me unmarketable.\u201d</p><p>Jace paled. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered to help with the camera work and whatever errands he needed me to run. It made me sick to do it, but it was do that or end up selling more than my photography skills on the street.\u201d</p><p>Jace put his head in his hands. \u201cGod, Ev. Why didn\u2019t you just come home? Even if you hated me, why put yourself through that?\u201d</p><p>She looked out at the expanse of green, so he wouldn\u2019t see the truth on her face. She\u2019d found out shortly after that she was pregnant and knew she\u2019d never be able to go back to the Austins\u2019. Scared out of her mind, she\u2019d called the number on an adoption ad in the phonebook. The small amount of financial support she\u2019d received through the agency had saved her life, but handing over her and Jace\u2019s baby had been like yanking out her soul and setting it on fire.</p><p>She let out a breath. \u201cBecause I knew if I went back, I would just be sent to a girls\u2019 home to wait it out until I turned seventeen before I got turned out on my own anyway. What did it matter? I was so lost in my depression it didn\u2019t really matter where I was anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how sorry I am, Evan. I feel like I ruined everything for you.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a tired smile, the sadness over the past making her limbs feel heavy. \u201cWe both made stupid mistakes. Mistakes that other teenagers everywhere make every day. The price for me was higher because I was an emotional powder keg. I made you my life raft and that isn\u2019t anything anyone should have to be for anyone else. Especially at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you now, Evan? Really.\u201d His green eyes were awash with concern, his tone tender.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Really. When I finally earned enough money to get on my feet, I started seeing a counselor, did the antidepressant thing for a long time. Learned how to channel my need to cut into more productive things. Now if I\u2019m stressed, I go for a punishing run instead of a razor. Or take out my camera. Or maybe spend a weekend with two guys who like to tie me up and have their wicked way with me.\u201d</p><p>He finally smiled at that. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all that scary stuff is in my rearview mirror.\u201d</p><p>And had stayed in her rearview because she\u2019d taken the dangerous variables out of the equation. Can\u2019t feel worthless if you don\u2019t seek anyone else\u2019s approval. Can\u2019t feel abandoned if you don\u2019t trust people to stay. And can\u2019t get a broken heart if you don\u2019t fall in love.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re happy now?\u201d he asked, his gaze searching her face.</p><p>She absently twirled her engagement ring around her finger and sighed, her most truthful response since he\u2019d come back in her life falling from her lips. \u201cI\u2019m happy enough.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in the lounge chair, closing his eyes for a moment as if absorbing her answer, then reached out and took her hand. \u201cCome \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>Jace was tired. Too tired to continue thinking about the fallout with his dad. Too tired to be pissed at Andre for bringing Evan here when it was beyond crossing the line. And too tired to continue fighting how he felt about Evan.</p><p>His dad had been right on one thing\u2014it was Jace\u2019s fault, all the things Evan had gone through after she\u2019d run away. Which meant it was his job to make sure he made it up to her. Fuck \u201chappy enough.\u201d That shit wasn\u2019t acceptable. If Evan had told him she was truly content, he would\u2019ve told her to get off his balcony and go home. He\u2019d been prepared to let her go for good if that\u2019s what was best for her.</p><p>But that\u2019s not what her answer had been. So if Dr. Dan wasn\u2019t making her goddamned ecstatic, then Jace figured the guy deserved to have some competition. If Evan spent two months in Jace and Andre\u2019s bed and still wanted to be with Daniel, then so be it. But Jace was going to do everything possible to show her that she had options. No, they couldn\u2019t offer her a fairy tale, but he and Andre could show her all they had to give.</p><p>He dragged Evan onto his lap, her warmth a welcome respite from the chill he\u2019d carried since leaving the hospital. The rays of the late-afternoon sun slid over her left side, plunging the other half of her in shadow. Darkness and light. Sweetness with an indelible edge. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Ev. Really, knock-me-on-my-ass beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She smirked, though the sarcasm didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve had too much to drink I think.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been able to see how amazing you are. It\u2019s a terrible habit.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted herself, sitting astride him, and reached out to run her fingertips through the hair at his temples. \u201cI think we share the same affliction.\u201d</p><p>He cupped a hand around the back of her neck and brought her mouth down to his. Her lips parted without hesitation, filling him with a tenderness that hadn\u2019t been present in their previous kisses. Their tongues twined in a languid and sensual rhythm that belied the burning need that was beginning to pump through his veins. Her fingers tracked through his hair, her nails scraping along his sensitive scalp.</p><p>God, she felt good. Like she\u2019d been made to fit against him like this.</p><p>Heat spread down his nerve endings, landing squarely in his crotch. His cock swelled against her, the straddling position and her thin cotton skirt leaving hardly any barrier between them. He rocked against her, knowing she\u2019d be able to feel the rasp of his jeans against her pussy. She moaned into the kiss, but he didn\u2019t break the connection.</p><p>She ground herself against his erection and their kiss turned from tender to hungry. His fingers went searching for more of her. He found the hem of her blouse and moved his hands beneath it, sliding over her ribs and palming her lace-covered breasts. With one quick flick, he unfastened the front hook and freed her from the bra. God, she felt good beneath his touch. Soft and sweet and burning hot.</p><p>He wanted to pull the shirt off her, take her pert nipples in his mouth, so he could hear that sexy whimper she sometimes made, but he knew they were already pushing it being out there on the balcony. The back of the building was pretty private with the greenbelt, but not gated.</p><p>He pinched her nipples between his fingers and she fell away from the kiss, her head tilting back as a soft cry escaped. The sound wrapped around his cock, beckoning all his blood there.</p><p>\u201cI love that you like it a little rough, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>She brought her gaze down to his, the flame behind those baby blues enough to set his every cell on fire. She reached down and gathered her skirt up to her thighs so that there was one less barrier as she rubbed against his crotch again. \u201cI love that you like to give it rough.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, her candidness driving him to the edge. \u201cThe dirty talk sounds good on you, Ev. No one would peg you for a bad girl.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a wicked grin and lifted her skirt just a tick in the front, exposing her beautifully smooth cunt pressed up against his denim-clad erection.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck. A dirty mouth and no panties?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cAndre forbade me to wear any. Said we were coming here to cheer you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I liked that guy for some reason.\u201d Jace\u2019s hands tracked up her inner thighs, his thumb reaching out to caress her heat. The pad of his thumb went slick the instant he found her swollen nub. So wet and ready for him.</p> <p>She sucked in a sharp little breath as he stroked her clit, the afternoon breeze making her skirt flutter around her thighs. \u201cLord, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you. Now.\u201d</p><p>She walked her hands up his chest, forcing him to recline all the way on the lounger. \u201cSo take me then.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrists and kissed each one. \u201cOut here?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at his hold on her wrists, her voice going husky. \u201cOut here, sir. Please.\u201d</p> <p>Her change in demeanor alone would\u2019ve made his cock hard if he hadn\u2019t already been ready to pound into her the minute she\u2019d climbed on his lap. He pulled her close and turned until he had reversed their positions on the lounger. Thank the gods of sex he\u2019d left his wallet in his pocket when he came home. He reached for a condom.</p><p>She plucked the foil wrapper from his fingertips and tore it open with her teeth. He laughed. \u201cIn a hurry, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. May I?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She unfastened the button of his jeans and dragged down the zipper at an impossibly slow pace. Her eyes stayed on his as she spread his fly and wrapped her fingers around his cock. She stroked with just enough pressure to make him shudder. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m not the only one who went commando today.\u201d</p><p>He rocked into her adept grip. \u201cI had to rush out to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like it. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never wear underwear again if this is what I get as a reward.\u201d She drew her nails along his balls, adding an irresistible sting to the pleasure. He grabbed her wrist, stilling her. \u201cBut if you keep that up, this may be a one-sided quickie.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and he released her so she could roll the condom along his length. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d He hiked her skirt up and positioned himself between her thighs, bracing himself on his forearms. \u201cTell me now if you\u2019re too sore from this morning.\u201d</p><p>She locked her legs around him. \u201cBring it on. I\u2019m tough.\u201d</p><p>Of that he had no doubt. He sank into her, his whole body seeming to groan with satisfaction as her velvet clasp enveloped him. She sighed beneath him, and he wished he could capture that sound in a bottle\u2014so darkly seductive. He could get off simply listening to her take her pleasure.</p><p>He canted his hips backward, sliding his cock until only the tip was inside her. Looking down their bodies, he watched as he moved back inside her. In and out, the connection as erotic a visual as he\u2019d ever seen. He glanced up and caught her watching the same thing.</p><p>\u201cYou like seeing me fuck into you, pet?\u201d he asked, his voice like sand in his throat.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said\u2014no shame, no embarrassment. He gave her a hard thrust, and her teeth pressed into her bottom lip. \u201cMakes me wish I had my camera with me. You\u2019re too beautiful not to photograph.\u201d</p><p>His balls tightened, the idea of Evan taking photographs starring the two\u2014or three\u2014of them an enticing fantasy. \u201cMaybe next time. Or the time after that. Or after that.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted on a gasp as he pushed deeper, burying himself to the hilt and grinding his pelvis against her clit.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m never going to get enough of you, Evan.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut and tilted her head back, exposing the damp column of her neck. \u201cJace.\u201d</p><p>A simple plea. Maybe to fuck her harder. Maybe to stop making long-term promises. He didn\u2019t know. And at the moment he didn\u2019t care. He lowered his mouth to her neck and pressed his teeth to the tender skin, eliciting a moan and a buck of her hips.</p><p>Fuck. Her response to the roughness sent electricity curling down his spine and winding around his cock. Her cunt clenched around him, and his own groan of pleasure filled the balcony. His hips dialed up the speed without his conscious awareness as he mouthed her throat. The lounger creaked beneath them, mixing with their ragged breathing.</p><p>She dug her nails into his shoulders. \u201cJace, I\u2019m so close. Can I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The request rippled through him like fire. She was asking. Asking to fucking come. Without the pretense of a scene happening. Every muscle in his body seemed to coil tighter, her submission like sexual heroin to his already climbing pleasure. \u201cYou have my permission, baby. Let me feel you come.\u201d</p><p>He reached down to give her even more pressure on her clit and stroked. Her torso arched and he claimed her neck again, this time sucking her skin so hard he knew it\u2019d leave a hickey. A proud, visible mark for Dr. Dan and the world to see. Mine. The word whispered through him, feeling more right than anything had in a long time.</p><p>He held on, driving into her with rocketing need. A freight train without brakes. Sensation enveloped him. Evan cried out in orgasm, calling his name and burying her face against his chest.</p><p>And that\u2019s all it took. The pleasure pooling at the base of his spine exploded like a sunburst, and waves of bliss rolled through him as his cock pulsed inside her. \u201cOh, baby. God. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Mine.</p><p>When their breathing slowed, he eased out of her and settled her skirt back down. She didn\u2019t open her eyes, simply laid there with a sated smile. He quickly discarded the condom and zipped back up, even those few seconds too long away from her. He settled back down next to her, and she cuddled against him, both of them perfectly content lying in silence next to each other.</p><p>As he lay there watching the sky turn to dusk, feeling her heart slowing to a steady beat against his side, he realized that two months would never be enough. That he wanted her to walk away from Dr. Dan. That he\u2019d never stopped missing her. And that he\u2019d claimed her as his long before he\u2019d known what that meant.</p><p>There was no walking away unscathed. It was already too late.</p><p>\u201cSo Andre told me about your proposition,\u201d she said long after he thought she\u2019d dozed off.</p><p>He traced his fingertips down her arm. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Her sigh was weary, but she snuggled closer. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t imagine going back to The Ranch and letting anyone else touch me.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, letting her statement wash over him. \u201cGlad to hear it, Ev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel gave me two months of freedom before the wedding and the move, so I might as well spend it how I want it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf cour\u2014\u201d Every tendon in his body went stiff as he registered the rest of her comment. \u201cWait, what move?\u201d</p><p>She sat up on her elbow to look down at him, her brow furrowed. \u201cTo L.A. For the show. As soon as we get back from our honeymoon we\u2019re going to start packing up to head west. I thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>Her words twisted his windpipe into a knot. He tried to clear his throat, but no response came out. Two months and she\u2019d be gone? Like cross-country gone?</p><p>She ran her thumb along his forehead, smoothing the creases. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard, forcing down the lump. \u201cNothing, it\u2019s just, I\u2019m a little surprised is all. I didn\u2019t know. I mean, I knew that we would end this part when you got married, but I was hoping to still be a friend afterward. I just found you again. And now you\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Her smile held heartbreak. \u201cYou think Daniel would\u2019ve let me do this with someone local, someone I\u2019d have a chance of seeing after we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. Of course not. The guy may be an idiot but he wasn\u2019t stupid. \u201cI see your point.\u201d</p><p>She laid her head against his chest again. \u201cGuess we just need to make these two months count.\u201d</p><p>Fucking-A he was going to make them count. Screw it all\u2014his rules, his fears, all of it. No way was he letting Evan walk out of his life again. Not without doing everything in his power to stop her.</p><p>He curled his arm more tightly around her, his resolve hardening like steel inside him.</p><p>Game on, Dr. Dan.</p><p>Game fucking on.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>\u201cTuck your tits in more. You have nip showing,\u201d Finn advised as he adjusted the lighting on Callie\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cProfessionalism, Finn,\u201d Evan reminded her intern from behind her camera.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Finn cocked his chin up in a haughty pose. \u201cPardon me, Ms. Jessup, for my crassness, but there may be a wee bit of your naughty bits exposed on top.\u201d</p><p>Callie giggled and adjusted her boobs in the snug red bustier she\u2019d donned for the first part of her boudoir photo session. \u201cNo worries, dollface. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a real customer. But the British accent does sound cute on you.\u201d</p><p>Finn blew her an air kiss.</p><p>\u201cThat looks good. Keep the light at that angle. And muss up the pillows behind her on the bed. They look too perfect.\u201d Evan adjusted a setting on her camera, then straightened. \u201cYou look gorgeous, Cal. You still sure this is what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Callie shot Evan an eager smile. \u201cDefinitely. I didn\u2019t spend four hundred bucks on lingerie and have you drag an air mattress in here for nothing. I\u2019m going to show Brandon exactly what he\u2019s missing if he keeps hanging out in the slow lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trashy whore,\u201d Finn teased.</p><p>Callie stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cSays the man slut.\u201d</p><p>Evan waved Finn out of the shot. \u201cEnough you two. Let\u2019s work on some make-your-man-drool magic. Ready?\u201d</p><p>Callie smoothed her expression and gave the camera her best come hither look. Evan snapped a few shots, then checked the preview window to make sure the lighting looked as good on film.</p><p>\u201cLooks all right?\u201d Callie asked, her voice not quite as confident as it was before.</p><p>Evan sized her up in mock evaluation, then smiled. \u201cI\u2019d do you.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Evan spent the next hour and a half snapping shots of Callie and adjusting each background in between Cal\u2019s outfit changes. Finn also jumped behind the camera for a small chunk of the session to get some practice. He kept telling Callie to look fierce, which inevitably made Cal laugh instead of looking fierce at all. But even with that, there was no doubt they had gotten some great shots.</p><p>By the time Callie had headed out in her street clothes to meet Brandon for a date, it had gotten dark outside. Evan checked the time on her cell phone. Damn. She\u2019d told Jace and Andre that if the session didn\u2019t run too long, she\u2019d try to stop by before heading home for the night. But she was going to have to text one of them and cancel.</p><p>They\u2019d all gotten in the habit over the last month of stealing whatever time they could together, not bothering with the pretense of going to The Ranch anymore. That home turf boundary had already been crossed the day she went to Jace\u2019s apartment and made love to him on his balcony. She\u2019d stayed the night there with the two of them, cutting through every safety net she\u2019d set for herself.</p><p>No matter. She could fall for them just as easily wherever they were having their interludes. Her heart certainly didn\u2019t care about the location.</p><p>But having \u201cthe end\u201d looming at the end of eight\u2014now four\u2014weeks had kept her in check. Ever since she\u2019d broken down and cried at the cabin, she\u2019d made sure to hold a piece of herself back when she was with them. It\u2019d taken her a few days to get her footing again once she\u2019d returned home, but now her guard was solidly back in place. Leaving herself that vulnerable again was not an option. Especially after she\u2019d felt the shift in Jace.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, he\u2019d morphed from Mr. Distant Dom to a grown-up version of the boy she used to know\u2014playful, sweet, and so fucking flirty that it was hard to believe that when the bedroom door closed, he could be such a ruthless cuss. The combination was the sexiest damn thing she\u2019d ever encountered. Add in Andre with his relentless charm and giving nature, and a girl could completely lose herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She wanted to lose herself.</p><p>But that\u2019s exactly why she couldn\u2019t. There was no way she would give someone else that power again\u2014the ability to define if her life was happy or sad. She was in charge of her happiness now, and she would be in charge of it when she got on a plane to California in a few weeks. She\u2019d prove to herself she could survive all on her own when she walked away from Jace this time. Pass the ultimate test and stop worrying that one emotional slip-up would send her spiraling back into dangerous depression. Maybe then she could go forward and live her life without the white knuckles.</p> <p>Evan turned off the last of the lights in the studio, too tired to pack up the bedding and equipment. She\u2019d take care of it tomorrow. She headed back toward her office in the front. Finn, who\u2019d parked himself in her chair, looked up and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got all the shots loaded onto the computer.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the corner of the desk. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re almost sexy enough to make me think straight thoughts. We did good.\u201d He clicked a few buttons to send the pictures to a flash drive. \u201cThey\u2019ll still need some touch-up, but if that stick-in-the-mud boyfriend of hers doesn\u2019t jump her bones after this, then he\u2019s just after her for her free cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he plays for your team,\u201d Evan teased.</p><p>Finn\u2019s expression turned sardonic. \u201cIf that were the case, he would\u2019ve checked out my ass when he stopped in here last week, not yours.\u201d</p> <p>Evan cringed and instinctively glanced at the door Callie had gone through to go out on her date. \u201cDid he really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. Ogled actually.\u201d He rose from the chair and stretched. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Men are pigs, and that skirt you were wearing that day was kind of daring a guy to look.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed, affronted. \u201cI had just changed. I was on my way out to go . . . dancing.\u201d</p><p>Well, not really dancing, per se. Not vertically at least. Jace and Andre had sent over a box with a brand-new outfit and a note to leave the panties at home. The V-neck blouse, snug little leather skirt, and matching boots had definitely been a step out of her comfort zone. But driving over to their place, knowing she was bare beneath, had gotten her heart racing and her thighs damp by the time she\u2019d stepped out of her car. The three of them had barely made it out of the foyer before the guys had bent her over the back of the couch, skirt shoved around her hips.</p><p>A little flutter of heat tickled her sex at the memory. Finn\u2019s eyebrows disappeared beneath his shaggy bangs. \u201cMust\u2019ve been some night out. You\u2019ve gone all blushy.\u201d</p><p>She automatically lifted her hands to her cheeks, feeling the burn beneath her fingertips. \u201cWhat? No. I\u2014I\u2019m a little embarrassed that Brandon checked me out. Cal\u2019s really gone on him. I want it to work out for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fine. He\u2019s a little stiff, but it seems like the guy is treating her well.\u201d Finn lifted the flash drive. \u201cMind if I work on some of these at home? If you don\u2019t like my edits, the originals are still on your hard drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just make sure to guard the files. The pictures are private. No working on it with your classmates or anything.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and tucked the drive into his pocket. \u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll guard them with my life.\u201d</p><p>A sharp rapping on the main door made them both jump. Evan looked toward the front, but she\u2019d closed the blinds on the front door when Callie had left and couldn\u2019t see who was on the other side. Weird. No one would be looking for a photographer at eight at night. It was probably the homeless guy on the corner wanting a bathroom. Or maybe Cal had forgotten something. \u201cLet me go see what that\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>Finn frowned. \u201cIf you don\u2019t recognize whoever it is, don\u2019t open the door. Callie said one of the shops down the street was robbed at gunpoint a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her stomach tightening a bit. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take a peek. I won\u2019t let anyone in. You stay by the phone in case we need to call the police.\u201d</p><p>She made her way over to the door and discreetly lifted one slat of the blinds. Familiar chocolate-brown eyes met hers, and her shoulders sagged in relief. Unlatching the dead bolt, she called over her shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Finn. It\u2019s a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>She pulled open the door and had to swallow down her gasp. Andre. In full uniform. Holy mother of God. Black button-up shirt stretched broad across his chest, badge gleaming in the streetlight, pants that fit him in all the best places. But her body\u2019s lightning-fast response was thwarted when she took in the worn expression on his face. She lifted her hand, planning to reach out and touch his cheek, ask him what was wrong, but she remembered they weren\u2019t alone. She lowered her arm quickly.</p> <p>\u201cHey, bella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at Finn, who\u2019d stepped away from the office area and into the main part of the gallery. \u201cFinn, this is my friend Andre.\u201d</p><p>Andre gave a cursory nod to Finn. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Then he looked back to Evan. \u201cAm I catching you at a bad time? I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d still be working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we just wrapped up a little while ago. Both of us were about to leave.\u201d She sensed a disquiet coming from Andre, something unruffled in his normally smooth exterior. \u201cFinn, why don\u2019t you go ahead and leave? I\u2019ll finish locking up, and Andre will make sure I get to my car safely.\u201d</p><p>Finn eyed Andre, wariness in his hazel eyes. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>She offered him a bright smile, one that hopefully didn\u2019t say get the hell out of here please, which is what she\u2019d been tempted to say. \u201cYes. Go. I\u2019ve already worked you into the ground tonight. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Evan waited until she made sure Finn had driven away on his motorcycle without getting mugged, then dead-bolted the door and turned to Andre, who had sank into one of the club chairs in the waiting area she had near the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace said you weren\u2019t going to be able to come by tonight. And I just . . . needed to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy session ran late and I told Daniel I\u2019d be home by ten.\u201d She squatted down in front of him, placing her hands on his knees. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and touched her hair with gentle reverence as if making sure she was really there at his feet and not a mirage. She hadn\u2019t seen him in a few days and, since then, bags had taken root under his normally sparkling eyes. \u201cI just needed to see something good after the shift I had.\u201d</p><p>The simple sentiment tugged at her. She leaned her face into his touch, feeling the warmth of his palm against her cheek and adjusted from a squat to a sitting kneel. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Just working a pretty gruesome case with the detectives. It\u2019s what I signed up for. But it never gets easy seeing innocent people die,\u201d he said, the words as tired sounding as he looked. \u201cI can\u2019t get the images of the crime scene out of my head tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed away the crease in her brow. \u201cAnd look at me, laying this macabre shit on you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He glanced around at her studio. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have even come here. I know this is your job. If I had known your employee was still here, I would\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh . . .\u201d She laid her hand over his. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. He thinks you\u2019re my friend. No harm done.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth hitched a bit. \u201cAm I your friend?\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head. \u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why does it always feel like more with you, bella? Why when I had a shitty day are you the first person I wanted to see?\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched, the naked honesty in his voice catching her off guard. He hadn\u2019t said it in that patented Andre seduction tone, but in a way that made her believe he really was curious about her answer. She glanced up at him, her shields flying up in defense. \u201cBecause you had a bad day and wanted to get laid.\u201d</p><p>Hurt descended over his features, making her immediately regret her glib remark.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you and Jace are way too much alike sometimes.\u201d He shifted forward in the chair. \u201cCome on. Do what you need to do and lock up. I\u2019ll walk you out so you can get home to Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She put a hand on his thigh and pushed him down before he could stand up fully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t really mean that. It\u2019s just . . . I can\u2019t be that person. For you or for Jace. In a month, if you have a bad day, I\u2019m not going to be here. We can\u2019t pretend like this is something more than it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t go on pretending that it\u2019s not,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She looked down, her eyes stinging. \u201cWon\u2019t change the outcome.\u201d</p><p>He slipped a finger beneath her chin, tilting her face toward him. \u201cSo be it. But at least be honest when you\u2019re with us. Trust us with the real you. Not some edited version. Do you think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, the tempting idea sending cold fear through her. \u201cI can try. But this scares the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>His hands cupped her face as he leaned down until his mouth was just a breath away from hers. \u201cJoin the club, bella.\u201d</p><p>His lips met hers in an unhurried tenderness, one that belied the fierce grip he locked around her hair. She adjusted her legs beneath her so she wouldn\u2019t lose her balance. His tongue stroked hers, his taste and scent filling her senses and lulling her down from fear to something far more pleasant. Her fingers gripped his thighs, the durable fabric of his uniform pants making a scratching sound beneath her nails. She smiled against his mouth.</p><p>He pulled back, amusement replacing some of the sadness that had been there when he\u2019d first walked in. \u201cYou little harlot. The uniform\u2019s doing it for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her grin turned sheepish. \u201cOnly because you\u2019re underneath it. But I did have the urge to break the law as soon as I saw you standing there.\u201d</p><p>He spread his legs, bringing the erection pressing against the front of his pants into view, and gave her a look that had her toes curling. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you want to test me tonight, bella. After the day I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve got a lot of frustration to work out. You might get more discipline than you bargained for. Especially after calling me \u2018just a friend.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, the thrill of the game usurping the lingering nerves about Andre\u2019s admission of having feelings for her. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever you think is fair, sir.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head toward the front of the gallery. \u201cThose blinds leave quite a gap on each side. You have some place more private? Or do you want anyone passing by on the street to know how much you like to get your ass whipped by your friend?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, the combination of his authoritative demeanor and his uniform making heat surge between her legs. \u201cI, uh, still have a bed set up in the back for the photo shoot I just finished.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an arch look. \u201cA bed for a photo shoot? You taking naughty pictures, Ms. Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take some of you.\u201d</p><p>He stood, pulling her to her feet with him. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re in them with me.\u201d</p><p>Andre stretched out on the air mattress Evan had set up for the earlier photo shoot and kept his gaze glued to her every move. He\u2019d taken off his gun belt and radio, but otherwise had kept his uniform on. No doubt for her benefit. She hadn\u2019t thought he was serious about the photos, but when they\u2019d stepped into the room, he\u2019d given her explicit instructions.</p><p>She snapped a test shot, the flash filling the room. She hadn\u2019t turned on any of the main lights, only one small one. But even with the subtle lighting, Andre looked downright edible in her preview screen. \u201cI should just stay behind the camera. You\u2019re an inspiring subject.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cAlready breaking the rules, bella? You must want to be punished tonight.\u201d He pointed at the spot on the side of the bed. \u201cOver here. I\u2019m losing my patience.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips and hit the button that would set up the continuous timer. \u201cYes, sir. It\u2019s all ready now.\u201d</p><p>Before she could lower herself to the bed, he barked another order. \u201cGet undressed.\u201d</p><p>She did as she was told. Slipping out of her pants and blouse, then divesting of her bra and panties. The camera flashed, startling her though she knew it was set to go off every thirty seconds.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDefinitely a moment worth capturing.\u201d He leaned back on his elbows, taking in every inch of her nudity, making her feel both vulnerable and beautiful all at the same time. \u201cNow I won\u2019t have to just conjure you up in my mind when I stroke myself. I\u2019ll have my very own pictures.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. The image of him sliding his hand along that beautiful cock, thinking of her while he pleasured himself was enough to make her muscles wobble beneath her.</p><p>\u201cThat idea pleases you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Very much.\u201d</p><p>He unbuttoned his trousers and eased the zipper down. The camera flashed. He freed his cock from his boxer briefs and stroked the length of it. A soft gasp escaped her. The need to touch him making her fingers twitch at her sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about when you get yourself off, bella?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed, and she dropped her focus to a spot on the side of the bed. \u201cLots of things, sir. Lately, I simply replay my times with you and Jace and just, uh, expand on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes on mine,\u201d he said, his tone brooking no argument. She instantly dragged her attention back to his face. His gaze was fierce, predatory. \u201cExpand on it, huh? We\u2019re not being hard enough on you? Maybe we need to push you further.\u201d</p><p>She held his eye contact but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Apparently he took that as an affirmative. \u201cI see. Well, since the cat seems to have stolen your tongue, show me how you touch yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to\u2014\u201d She glanced at the camera.</p><p>Flash.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stutter. Punishment doesn\u2019t always come in the form of physical pain. Show me, bella.\u201d He fisted his cock with another rough stroke. \u201cIf not, I may just please myself and leave without touching you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment. Centering herself. She\u2019d been in every position possible between Andre and Jace. They\u2019d seen her with her ass in the air, striped with their marks. Why should she be embarrassed about masturbating? But something about sharing the intensely private nature of self-pleasure had her heart hammering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting. If you\u2019re not wet, you have permission to skip this punishment.\u201d His smile was sly, knowing.</p><p>While holding his gaze, she brought her hand to the lips of her sex, the tissues already swollen with need. Her finger parted her folds and rubbed, the evidence of her arousal slicking her skin. A quiet moan escaped her as she put pressure against her clit.</p><p>Flash.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, bella. You look so fucking gorgeous right now. Let me and the camera see what pleases you.\u201d</p><p>His approval washed over her, giving her the confidence to continue. She moved her fingers along her labia, dipped inside her pussy, and massaged her clit, but not directly. Over the last few weeks she\u2019d learned the sweet satisfaction of delayed gratification, of not coming unless one of the guys gave her permission. Her free hand drifted up her belly and she cupped her breast, pinching her nipple hard, imagining it was Andre\u2019s teeth instead of her fingers.</p><p>A louder, more urgent moan escaped and she could no longer maintain eye contact. Her head tilted back and her fingers increased the pressure between her legs. Her legs felt weak beneath her and she wondered how long she could remain standing. Her knees tried to give out, but she fought to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let yourself fall. Sit on the floor. Legs spread. Don\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Andre directed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how he and Jace did it, but somehow they were always in tune with her body, her needs. Even the slightest flinch didn\u2019t go unnoticed. She eased down to her knees and then followed his instruction, the polished concrete hard and cold beneath her heated bottom. He could\u2019ve invited her on to the bed where it\u2019d be more comfortable, but this was punishment.</p><p>She parted her knees directly in his line of sight, exposing every bit of herself to him. Moisture glistened at the tip of his cock and he rubbed it over the head with his thumb, the move so natural and unashamed, so ruggedly male, that it made her mouth go dry. Flash.</p><p>\u201cShow me how wet and ready that pretty cunt is, bella. I want to know how much you need me inside you.\u201d</p><p>She buried two fingers inside her channel and pumped once, twice. Her body clenched around the invasion, desperate for something besides her own hand. The scent of her arousal permeated the small room when she lifted her fingers to him, the glossy state of her skin obvious.</p><p>He climbed off the bed, tucked his erection back into his pants, and stalked her way. When he stopped directly in front of her, she didn\u2019t dare move. He planted his feet, his stance wide, foreboding. He was so close she had to tilt her head back to an uncomfortable angle to look up at him, the effect making her feel even smaller next to his large body.</p><p>The camera flashed again, lighting his face in a menacing combination of shadows. \u201cIf the three of us are just stroke material for one another, Evan, just people playing out fantasies, then go ahead and make yourself come. You don\u2019t need my help to get off. I\u2019ve already played the role you wanted to cast me in tonight, right? The guy who came here to use you. A guy you can write off because I\u2019m just part of the game.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cAndre . . . no.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand, palm up. \u201cThen prove me wrong, bella. Come over to the bed with me and let me make love to you. You. No roles. Only Andre and Evan.\u201d</p><p>She tucked her knees to her chest, her skin damp from the combination of the lingering arousal and the abject fear of what he was suggesting. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what? Letting down your guard and falling for one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr both,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He crouched down in front of her, his stern expression softening. His hand landed warm against her shoulder. \u201cBella, I know things are complicated. But the power is all in your hands. If you can fall for us then maybe what you have with Daniel needs a long, hard look. At the end of this, if you don\u2019t want to walk away from us, you don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead to her knees. They weren\u2019t going anywhere, but she was. She had a promise to keep. One she wouldn\u2019t default on.</p><p>But in that moment she realized her fear was useless. The thing she was most trying to protect herself from had already happened. She\u2019d fallen for Andre. And had been in love with Jace from the moment he\u2019d kissed her again. No amount of backpedaling or game-playing could save her heart from these men.</p><p>\u201cTake me to the bed, please.\u201d She looked up at him, caught his gaze. \u201cAndre.\u201d</p><p>The smile he gave her nearly broke her open, but now wasn\u2019t the time for tears. Now was the time to let go and be real with one of the men she loved. Something she hadn\u2019t done since she\u2019d snuck into Jace\u2019s room that night when she was sixteen.</p><p>Andre slipped his hands beneath her, carried her over to the mattress, and laid her down with quiet ease. His fingers went to the buttons on his shirt, but she reached out and stilled his work. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>Evan sat up a bit and taking her time, she slipped each button through its eyelet, exposing the hard expanse of his tan chest. The pace of his breathing beneath her fingertips increased with each button freed. She pushed the shirt over his shoulders and down his arms. She laid a hand over his heart, concern swamping her. \u201cNo bulletproof vest?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his hand over hers. \u201cThey\u2019re hot. I took it off when my shift ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She moved her hand and kissed the spot where it had been. \u201cGood. Because I was about to yell at you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have an appreciation for a little pain, but not the getting shot in a vital organ kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, a little pain, huh?\u201d She lowered her head and used the tip of her tongue to play with the ring through his nipple. She sucked the silver into her mouth, tugging none too gently.</p><p>He rewarded her with a soft grunt.</p><p>Her hand snaked down to his already unfastened pants and pushed past the fly of his boxer briefs. His cock was hard and hot in her hand. She stroked the smooth length of it, wishing that she could have him bare inside her. She knew both he and Jace had to be tested regularly to maintain membership at The Ranch. And God knows she was clean. But both men thought she was sleeping with Daniel, so they had to protect themselves from the unknown. And she certainly couldn\u2019t share the truth with them.</p><p>She bent down and gave the head of his cock an open-mouthed kiss. Since he\u2019d touched himself, she\u2019d wanted nothing more than to taste him against her tongue, a salty, spice-laced flavor she now had memorized.</p><p>He touched her hair. \u201cHold on, bella. These boxers are strangling me.\u201d</p><p>Momentarily dislodging her from her task, Andre shucked his pants and boxers, took a condom from his wallet, and then tossed the clothes off in the corner of the room. The camera had continued to flash, but she no longer noticed. All she could focus on was the sheer male beauty in front of her. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her lips lightly. \u201cMuch.\u201d</p><p>He tried to shift their positions, to take over. But she pushed him back on his butt. \u201cI wasn\u2019t done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>He sat back with a smile, leaning on his elbows, shameless in his nudity. \u201cWell, far be it from me to thwart you from your mission. Go for it, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She drew her knees beneath her and her mouth was back on him, licking, savoring, enjoying the freedom to touch and taste as she pleased. Part of being submissive to Andre and Jace had meant she\u2019d spent a lot of time on her knees, working to pleasure them at their command. Before she\u2019d met them, giving head had just been a fun little foreplay exercise. Something to do to help out the guy. But the experience with these two men had shifted her entire perspective.</p><p>Now she relished her ability to give pleasure. To make a strong man quiver beneath her ministrations. Having been blindfolded and bound numerous times had also focused her senses, had allowed her to appreciate the earthy taste of a man\u2019s skin, the scent of his body heating up with arousal\u2014clean sweat and soap for Jace, musky cologne for Andre. The experience had been transformed into a sensual immersion she craved. Even the infinitesimal tension that ebbed and flowed through Andre\u2019s muscles as she moved her mouth along him registered on her sexual Richter scale.</p><p>Deciding to push it a little further than she had in the past, she took him in her hand and licked the base of his cock, then ventured lower. With a languid pace, she drew her tongue along the seam of his sac.</p><p>He gripped her hair and his muscular thighs widened, giving her even more access. \u201cThat feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. A man who kept himself this clean-shaven deserved to be rewarded. She mouthed one of the sensitive globes of his sac, swirling her tongue around it.</p><p>He grabbed her head with both hands, his body shuddering beneath her. \u201cYou keep that up, bella, and you may get a new form of hair gel.\u201d</p><p>She moved back the merest of space. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m getting you back for all the relentless patience you\u2019ve used on me.\u201d</p><p>Sweat glistened on his forehead when he looked down his body at her. \u201cOh, is that right?\u201d</p><p>She kissed her way up his chest, crawling along his body, and ended with a nibble along his bottom lip. \u201cNo, in all honesty, I just love sucking your cock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His eyes darkened in that way that made her insides coil tight. \u201cYou\u2019re the most perfect woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI bet you say that to all the girls.\u201d</p> <p>He cupped her cheek, his gaze as serious as she\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cNo, Evan. I don\u2019t.\u201d He ran his thumb over her mouth. \u201cMi alma es tuya.\u201d</p><p>Evan parted her lips to ask him what that meant, but he was already pulling her down for a kiss. His mouth slanted over hers and their tongues twined in a heated dance\u2014one that sent every molecule in her body humming. She sensed a fierceness in the embrace, almost a desperation, like Andre was afraid she\u2019d evaporate if he didn\u2019t hold her tightly enough. She wanted to reassure him that she was right here, that she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. But they both knew that wasn\u2019t true. They needed to treat every time like a cherished gift. Because this was an indulgence neither of them would have for much longer.</p><p>She pressed her forehead against his. \u201cPlease, Andre. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Hands and legs tangled, the condom somehow made it on, and soon she found herself rolled onto her back, Andre above her. \u201cI need you too, bella. So much.\u201d</p><p>The camera flash captured the second their bodies collided.</p> <p>Dueling moans mixed with the rustle of sheets as he buried himself deep inside her. She closed her eyes, overwhelmed by the delicious feel of his invasion, but his voice snapped her back to attention. \u201cDon\u2019t. Look at me. I want to see all of you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded as she lifted her lashes and looked at him. She\u2019d thought she couldn\u2019t get any more naked, but this\u2014staring into his brown depths as he rocked into her\u2014was as exposed as she\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, lifted it to his mouth, and laid a kiss atop it, all the while not breaking his rhythm. She shivered beneath the simple brush of his lips. \u201cNow you can touch yourself, bella.\u201d He lowered her palm to where he wanted it. \u201cLet me feel you come around me.\u201d</p><p>She kept her focus on him, but slid her finger along her clit, the little bundle of nerves slick and swollen and desperate for relief. The instant she applied pressure, her sex clenched around Andre and the pleasurable jolt registered on his face.</p><p>Oh, my. She\u2019d never watched a lover so intently. Seeing every nuance of sensation cross his features. Beautiful and sexy and beyond intimate.</p><p>She swirled her finger as he continued to move inside her, his pace increasing to match hers. Sharp zings of sensation wicked through her nervous system, making every inch of her skin, her soul, feel alive. She wouldn\u2019t last much longer, not after all this and not with his eyes fucking her as completely as his body was. But part of her wanted to hang on just a bit longer. Savor this. No. Savor him.</p> <p>She reached up with her free hand and ran her hand along his stubble, his skin hot beneath her touch. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty damn perfect, too.\u201d</p><p>The lines around his eyes creased, almost as if the words were too much to hear, and he leaned down to claim her mouth. Her lips parted for him, accepting everything behind his kiss\u2014the desire, the pain, the loss both of them knew was looming. All of it consumed them and the rhythm of his hips increased as they both began to unravel. Her neck arched, pulling her out of the kiss, and a plea escaped. \u201cAndre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go, bella. Let everything go. For me.\u201d</p><p>Her body responded to his command like a well-trained soldier, all the combined sensations crashing down over her in a maddening rush. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>She cried out as the orgasm overtook her, and Andre chased her climax with his own, the two of them riding the high together. She found his mouth again, inhaled his own groan with the kiss, and held on while her body continued to contract around him. The heat of his release was like sweet fire inside her.</p><p>The camera continued its methodical flashing as they both eased down from their high. After a few minutes of lying there with only their labored breathing as a soundtrack, Andre pressed his lips to the curve of her neck, the sweat on his brow mixing with the sheen on her skin.</p><p>\u201cNot bad for our first time,\u201d Andre whispered.</p><p>She ran her hand along the damp hair at the nape of his neck. \u201cOur first time?\u201d</p> <p>He lifted his head to look at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been with only me. I\u2019ve always just been the third for you.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d first gotten involved with Andre and Jace, she\u2019d thought Andre would simply be an extra bonus\u2014a gorgeous buffer to help her keep perspective about Jace. But over the last few weeks, she\u2019d realized her heart hadn\u2019t made that distinction. Her heart wanted them both. Loved them both.</p><p>She pressed her forehead to his. \u201cAndre, you\u2019ve never \u2018just\u2019 been anything to me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but the distinct sound of footsteps had them both freezing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Andre said, rolling off her, instantly on full alert.</p><p>But before Andre could say anything else, a man stepped into the studio.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d</p><p>Evan hauled the sheet up to cover herself and Andre, her heart ready to burst through her ribs. \u201cShit, Daniel. You scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, gosh, Evan, excuse me,\u201d he spat out, the sarcasm at full tilt. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to walk into the building I pay rent on and frighten you mid-screw.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>Daniel scoffed as he looked from her to Andre, then back. \u201cCalm down? Calm down? Who the fuck is this guy?\u201d</p><p>Andre shifted, no doubt taking the condom off beneath the sheet. \u201cNot really your concern, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t,\u201d Daniel yelled, then looked at her expectantly. \u201cEvan?\u201d</p><p>The goddamned camera flashed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . .\u201d Daniel glanced at the equipment set up, his face getting redder by the second. \u201cOh, un-freaking-believable! How could you be so stupid, Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Andre barked.</p><p>She laid a hand on Andre\u2019s forearm, trying to stop him from making a bad situation worse. \u201cDaniel, please. Get out of here and let us get dressed. You and I can talk privately about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. So now you worry about discretion? A little late for that.\u201d He kicked a leg of the tripod and sent her favorite camera crashing to the floor.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw went slack. \u201cDaniel!\u201d</p><p>Andre bolted off the bed, stark naked and pissed. Daniel\u2019s eyes widened right before Andre grabbed him by the front of his collar and hauled him up against the wall. \u201cNot one more fucking word, asshole. You did this to yourself, so don\u2019t you dare try to insult Evan over something you gave her permission to do.\u201d He twisted Daniel\u2019s shirt tighter in his fist. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I won\u2019t kick your ass\u2014with or without pants on.\u201d</p><p>A little gasp passed Daniel\u2019s lips, and he squeezed his eyes shut. Andre paused, glanced down, and stepped back a bit. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s gaze followed his, and even in profile, she could see the bulge in Daniel\u2019s pants. Oh, fuck. Apparently Daniel\u2019s body had a very different reaction than fear in response to Andre\u2019s naked form and dominant handling of him. Andre let go of Daniel\u2019s shirt and looked to Evan then back to Daniel. Once. Twice. She could almost hear the click when the puzzle pieces snapped in place for him.</p><p>She stood, keeping the sheet tucked around her. \u201cAndre, please. Just go, okay? I\u2019ll be fine. Let me talk to Daniel.\u201d</p><p>Daniel turned away, his shame at his body\u2019s betrayal obvious. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at home, Evan.\u201d</p><p>Andre stalked to his pile of clothes and got dressed without looking at her. He didn\u2019t bother strapping his gun belt back on, just slung it over his arm. The silence between them was thick enough to choke on. He spun back around, all the tenderness he\u2019d held in his face a few minutes earlier gone. \u201cIs it the fame thing, Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndre\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr are you really just money hungry?\u201d he asked, the words as sharp as barbed wire.</p><p>She reeled back, the accusation stinging as much as if she\u2019d been slapped. \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>The sharp smack of the door slamming reverberated through the loft and almost made Jace drop the beer he\u2019d grabbed. He kicked the refrigerator shut with his foot and peeked around the corner of the kitchen to find Andre storming through the living area, fury on his face.</p><p>Hell. Jace had thought he\u2019d had a bad day, but based on Andre\u2019s grand entrance, someone had already cornered the prize for shittiest day.</p><p>\u201cUm, hey,\u201d Jace said cautiously.</p><p>Andre threw his keys onto the glass coffee table with a loud clink and collapsed into the armchair. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Andre looked up, glanced at the beer in Jace\u2019s hand. \u201cWe have any Jack Daniels left?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. \u201cYeah, I think so. I\u2019ll grab it.\u201d</p><p>Jace pulled the nearly full bottle out of the liquor cabinet and poured a shot into a juice glass.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucking gay,\u201d Andre announced without preamble. \u201cGay!\u201d</p><p>Andre stared at him as if he should know what he was talking about. Jace frowned. Considered the glass. Made the shot a double. \u201cOkay . . . who are we talking about? Your suspect?\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyebrows knitted. \u201cWhat? No. Dr. Dan.\u201d</p><p>Jace gripped the glass. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan\u2019s fianc\u00e9. She\u2019s going to move away from us to marry a guy who doesn\u2019t even like girls.\u201d</p><p>Jace stared at him. Digested the words. Downed Andre\u2019s whiskey.</p><p>The liquid burned the back of his throat and he coughed. \u201cAnd you know this, how?\u201d</p><p>Andre ran a hand over the back of his hair. \u201cI went to see her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt her job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to see her. I . . . I had a bad day and, God, I don\u2019t know, I wanted to see her.\u201d</p><p>Jace knew the feeling. He\u2019d been more than disappointed when Evan had texted him that she wouldn\u2019t be stopping by tonight. But going to her studio was a big no-no. They\u2019d all agreed to keep their relationship\u2014or whatever the fuck this was\u2014separate from her \u201creal\u201d life. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I fucking know that? I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Jace poured another shot and walked it over to Andre. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made love to her. Not sex, Jace. Way more than that.\u201d He knocked back the shot, made an ugly face. \u201cAnd, goddammit, I know she was feeling it, too.\u201d</p><p>Jace sat on the other side of the couch, his breath whooshing out of him. \u201cYou love her?\u201d</p><p>Andre set the empty glass on the coffee table, his expression turning guarded. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s allowed that privilege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lov\u2014\u201d Jace scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shared his plans with Andre when he\u2019d decided to pursue Evan after that evening on the balcony. He\u2019d gone on pretending that this was a two-month deal. To protect them all in case it didn\u2019t work out. But he\u2019d never been able to hide anything from Andre. The guy read people as if their thoughts were printed on their foreheads in Sharpie. \u201cYou knew.\u201d</p><p>Andre smirked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone on her since the moment she stepped back into your life. And I\u2019ve seen how much your guard has dropped these last few weeks when she\u2019s around. You\u2019ve been courting her like your life depended on it.\u201d</p><p>Anger, hot and fierce, welled up in Jace. \u201cThen why did you go and fucking fall for her too? If you knew I felt that way about her?\u201d</p><p>Andre laughed without humor. \u201cOh, right. \u2019Cause I\u2019m not allowed to feel anything. I\u2019m just dick number two, enter stage left? What the fuck, man?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Jace groaned and raked his hands through his hair. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2014God. When did this get so damned complicated? Now she\u2019s got three guys fighting over her?\u201d</p><p>The couch squeaked as Andre rose and headed to refill his glass. He grabbed the bottle and poured, his back to Jace. Seconds passed, Andre staring down at the glass but not drinking.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not fighting you for her, J,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cI want you both . . . I love you both.\u201d</p><p>The admission hit Jace in the chest like an anvil, stealing any ability to draw breath, much less respond.</p><p>Andre loved him? Not like dude-you\u2019re-my-best-friend love. He could tell from Andre\u2019s tone, the hunch of his pose that this was something much more serious, something he\u2019d been holding back for a while.</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d shared women with Andre for years. They\u2019d both enjoyed fooling around with each other during some m\u00e9nages, but never had he considered that Andre wanted anything more than that. It\u2019d always been . . . casual. Even though Andre was admittedly bisexual, Jace knew his friend had always strived for a traditional relationship. A quick, anonymous fuck with a male sub at The Ranch on occasion, maybe. But being in a relationship with a guy had never been on Andre\u2019s radar\u2014not with his job and his very strict Catholic family. It would flip his life on its head.</p><p>Jace set his head in his hands. He didn\u2019t know what to say. Or even how he felt. He enjoyed being sexual with Andre. And it\u2019s not like Jace had any hang-ups about his own sexuality. He was primarily attracted to women but had never believed in restricting himself to some label. But a committed relationship? A true triad with another man and woman.</p> <p>\u201cAndre, I\u2014\u201d He looked up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d Andre drained the glass, his back still to Jace. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fucking matter anyway. Evan\u2019s going to move to L.A. She didn\u2019t make Dr. Dan leave tonight\u2014not after he was a complete ass-hat to her. And not after he got hard seeing me naked. She made me leave. Her loyalty lies with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would she want to have a sham for a marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know, brother.\u201d He turned to look at Jace, his eyes a swirl of emotion. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s figured out that love is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>With that, Andre headed toward his bedroom and shut the door behind him, the quiet snick more deafening than if he\u2019d slammed it.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p> <p>Evan stormed into the house, seeing red. How she\u2019d managed to drive home without breaking every traffic rule in the book was a miracle. Her knuckles ached from gripping the steering wheel so hard. How dare he? How dare Daniel talk to her like that, break her camera, throw a fucking hissy fit like he was her real lover?</p><p>She shoved open the door to Daniel\u2019s office, the heavy wooden door hitting the wall with a loud thud. Both Daniel and Marcus jerked their heads up from what they were viewing on Daniel\u2019s computer screen. Daniel rose from behind his desk. \u201cEvan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell was that?\u201d she demanded, cutting him off.</p><p>Daniel\u2019s fist hit the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me that? You were the one fucking your brains out with some stranger in front of a goddamned camera.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stepped around the desk and sat in a chair on the opposite side, obviously wanting out of the line of fire.</p><p>She threw her hands out to her sides. \u201cAnd what the hell difference does that make? You wanted me to find a lover. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a club. A private club where no one would see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from the club. And no one saw us except you.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel turned, ripped a page from his printer, and slammed it down on the desk. \u201cTonight. But what about when you decided to screw Jace Austin? You know who saw you then?\u201d His booming voice rattled her eardrums. \u201cSomebody with a goddamned hi-res camera!\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the photo he\u2019d laid out on the desk, her profile coming into focus. Her skirt hiked up her thighs, head tipped back in pleasure, Jace\u2019s hand between her legs. Jace\u2019s face was obscured by the thin metal railings of the balcony, but there was no denying the clarity with which they\u2019d captured her own visage. She gasped, her hand going to her mouth. \u201cHow did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gossip site that\u2019s running the story tomorrow sent me a heads-up. An anonymous source sold them the picture. They haven\u2019t figured out who the guy in the picture is yet\u2014though Marcus could tell right away\u2014but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s you. They wanted to know if I had a statement.\u201d He sank into his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cJesus, Evan. The newspapers will pick up on it after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel, I\u2014I don\u2019t know what to say. I thought the balcony was private.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cHow could you be so careless? This could blow up everything.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach flipped over as she found her way into the chair next to Marcus. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Marcus put a hand on her knee and squeezed. \u201cTake a breather. Both of you. This isn\u2019t a done deal yet. We just have to spin this. Make it work for us instead of against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d Daniel snapped. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be the fucking relationship doctor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Danny,\u201d Marcus said, eyeing Daniel with what Evan now recognized as the look of a dominant giving his sub an order. \u201cPeople in relationships cheat sometimes. It happens. So we have Evan admit that she\u2019s made a mistake. You admit that with all the travel, you\u2019ve been neglecting your own relationship. And then you both talk about how you are committed to each other and are going to work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d Evan said, her eyes widening. \u201cI have to be painted as a cheater.\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cWell, of course. There\u2019s no other way.\u201d</p><p>She looked from him to Daniel with disbelief. \u201cOh, yes there is. Like we have an open relationship. Or, I don\u2019t know, how \u2019bout some honesty for a change and you tell people you\u2019ve discovered you prefer men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Both men shut her down in unison, and she wanted to knock their heads together.</p><p>\u201cEvan, I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Daniel said, his tone lowering from pissed to pleading. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to accept either one of those. I\u2019ll lose all but my most liberal of fans. Everyone else will write us off. We\u2019ll lose the TV deal before we can even blink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo instead we\u2019ll just sacrifice my reputation? Make me out to be the whore who cheated on my oh-so-perfect fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the blame for neglecting you. Talk about how sometimes cheating is a couple\u2019s problem, not just the individual who strayed.\u201d He reached for her hand across the desk. \u201cSweets, I know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but I need you to go along with this. Don\u2019t kill our future before we even get started. Will you do this for me?\u201d</p><p>She stared down at his offered hand, her insides twisting into a sickening knot. Daniel had saved her once upon a time. Had protected her with unwavering ferocity when they were on the streets. The reason she\u2019d never been raped, beaten, or killed while they were out there was because of him. The big brother she\u2019d never had.</p><p>How many times had he taken a fist to the jaw on her behalf? Or worse . . .</p><p>Besides her mother, he\u2019d been the only one who\u2019d ever been truly loyal to her. The only one to always be there no matter what. She inhaled a deep breath and laid her hand in his open palm. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Both Marcus and Daniel seemed to sag in their chairs with relief. Daniel laced his fingers with hers. \u201cThank you, Evan. This means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cJust tell me what I need to say and do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make you do the talking. I don\u2019t want to make you lie blatantly on camera. We\u2019re going to send you to a hotel for a few days until the initial flash of interest burns out.\u201d Marcus flipped over the picture, which was still lying face up on the desk. He tapped it. \u201cAnd you need to let Jace Austin know that his affiliation with this company\u2014and with you\u2014is over, effective immediately.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand from Daniel\u2019s, her full attention switching to Marcus. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWe can\u2019t very well have him associated with the book or show in case he\u2019s identified as the guy you were sleeping with. And you certainly can\u2019t continue any contact with him. The press will be watching you like a hawk.\u201d</p><p>The room suddenly felt twenty degrees colder and like all the air had been sucked out of it. No more Jace? Ever? And his business . . . \u201cYou can\u2019t pull the affiliation. Jace\u2019s store is depending on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should\u2019ve thought of that before he fucked my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Daniel snapped.</p><p>She smacked her hand flat against the desk. \u201cYou gave us fucking permission, Daniel! He\u2019s a member of The Ranch.\u201d She wet her lips. \u201cAnd . . .\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd what, Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we have a past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Daniel leaned forward, elbows on the table.</p><p>\u201cHe was the one, Daniel. The one I loved. The one I ran from. . . .\u201d</p><p>Awareness dawned over Daniel\u2019s face. \u201cThe guy who got you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know about that part though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Marcus groaned. \u201cThis could really blow up if the press finds out who he is and digs that far into either of your pasts.\u201d</p><p>Fear curled over her spine. No . . .</p><p>\u201cThe name change should protect you for now. And your foster care records are confidential. If we can smooth all this over quickly, no one will have any reason to delve deeper.\u201d Daniel rolled his chair back from his desk and stood in a huff. \u201cGo pack a bag. And get rid of Jace, Evan. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his business is going to suffer, and if they figure out who he is, he\u2019ll look like a homewrecker,\u201d she protested. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve either of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKarma\u2019s a bitch,\u201d Daniel said on his way out the door. \u201cMaybe he deserves to hurt a little after what he put you through back then.\u201d</p><p>She looked back to Marcus, hoping for a different answer, but his expression was resigned. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way, sweetie. You were going to have to say good-bye soon anyway.\u201d He stood and patted her shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference if it\u2019s a few weeks early?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. No difference.</p><p>She\u2019d always known she\u2019d have to walk away from Jace and Andre. But she never anticipated leaving destruction in her wake. And she never expected it to feel quite like this.</p><p>Like her stable existence was breaking apart beneath her feet.</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t want to face a tomorrow that didn\u2019t have Jace and Andre in it.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Panic, sharp and bitter, flooded her, turning her skin clammy and damp. No, she wasn\u2019t this person anymore. And she wasn\u2019t like her father. She didn\u2019t have those kinds of destructive thoughts. She squeezed her eyes shut and wrapped her arms around herself, rocking as the panic charged through her system. Her nails dug deep into her arms, the pain a last-ditch effort to center herself.</p><p>She would not get this way. Not again.</p><p>She was stronger than this.</p><p>Leaving Jace and Andre . . . Would. Not. Break. Her.</p><p>She slipped her hand into her pocket, pulling out her phone. Her fingertips were numb as she scrolled through her contacts. He answered on the first ring. \u201cEv?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed past the paralysis trying to claim her throat. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Evan opened the door, fortifying herself with a deep breath, and let Jace into the hotel room. The last thing she\u2019d wanted to do was meet with him in such an intimate setting, but she hadn\u2019t had many other options. His loft and anywhere in public was out in case anyone was already watching her. And she definitely wasn\u2019t inviting him over to the place she shared with Daniel. So her hotel hideout for the next few days had been the only option left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Jace walked past her, hands in his pockets and expression unreadable. She clicked the door shut behind him, but didn\u2019t turn around, her hand frozen on the knob. She could feel his stare burning into her back. How was she supposed to do this? She couldn\u2019t even look at him without wanting to break down and cry.</p><p>\u201cA two a.m. invitation to a hotel room is usually a booty call, but somehow I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here,\u201d he said, his voice flat.</p> <p>Her shoulders sagged. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndre told me about Daniel.\u201d</p><p>Ha. The earlier revelation seemed trite compared to what she had to lay on him now. \u201cI figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Ev? Why are you marrying him?\u201d</p><p>His tone was as even as the horizon, but she didn\u2019t miss the little catch in his throat on the last word. The hurt. She turned to face him, her hands gripping her elbows as if she could physically hold herself together. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . my best friend. I love him.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned against the desk. \u201cLike you used to love me?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her gaze away from his, tears already threatening to fall. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not the same thing. Daniel and I\u2014 It works. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not okay,\u201d he said, his dominant side seeping into his tone. \u201cYou won\u2019t convince me that you\u2019re better off in some sexless marriage. Not when I\u2019ve seen how you come apart with me and Andre. You deserve everything a relationship has to offer.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, gathering her strength again and trying to ignore the pang of want his words had caused. \u201cSomeone took pictures of us on the balcony, Jace. They\u2019re being released tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He hissed out a breath. \u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><p>She dared a glance at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m the only one identified in the picture. If we end this now, you\u2019ll probably go undetected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnd this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wiped her sweaty palms on her jeans and moved away from the door. He had propped himself against the small desk in the room, so she perched on the foot of the bed\u2014as far away from him as possible. \u201cI\u2019m going to admit to cheating on Daniel. Tell everyone we\u2019re working it out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fucking do what?\u201d He pushed off the desk and rose to his full height. \u201cEv, no way. I don\u2019t care how good of a friend Daniel is, you\u2019re not going to ruin your own reputation just to save his chickenshit ass from stepping out of the closet and owning who he is.\u201d</p><p>She clasped her hands in front of her, focused on her engagement ring. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I owe him.\u201d She peeked at Jace from under her lashes. \u201cHe was the boy on the bridge that day. And the one who protected me every day after that.\u201d</p><p>Jace winced as he collapsed into the desk chair and raked his hands through his already disheveled hair. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved me and I promised myself I would help him achieve his dream. He would\u2019ve never gotten to where he is if people knew he was gay.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd this offers me what I\u2019ve never had. Stability. A guarantee that I won\u2019t ever go back to how things were before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStability?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAt what cost, Ev? Is the money worth giving up a chance at real love? At being with a man . . .\u201d He paused, wet his lips. \u201cOr men who can give you everything you need without all the fine print.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cSex isn\u2019t love, Jace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw that bullshit out at me. Believe me, I know the difference.\u201d He rose from the chair and crossed the room to squat in front of her. His large hands closed around her shaking ones. \u201cAnd I know what I feel for you. What I want with you.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled, and she clamped her eyelids shut.</p><p>He continued on. \u201cI can\u2019t compete with major TV deals, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t pay my bills. Even if the store were to fold tomorrow, I could go back to a finance job with a simple phone call.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t turn my back on him. Daniel was there for me.\u201d She bit her bottom lip.</p><p>His hands slipped from hers, his tone cooling. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t it at all, but she saw the door open, the way to push him away and save both of them. \u201cI need someone I can count on. A sure thing.\u201d</p><p>Jace stood, his arms crossed and his expression hard. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a good time, but I\u2019m just part of a game for you and Andre. One of your dalliances.\u201d She almost stopped when she saw him flinch like she\u2019d slapped him, but she forced herself to keep on. \u201cHow many other girls at The Ranch have been between you two? How long do you give them before you get bored and move on to the next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re more than that to me,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been with me a month, Jace. One. Month. You\u2019re ready to give up threesomes, settle down, have a nice little suburban life?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks tinged red. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know, Evan. This is all new to me, too, all right? All I know is Andre and I both . . .\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed, her breath catching. Andre and Jace both what? She couldn\u2019t decide if she longed to hear the words or wanted to stick her fingers in her ears and hum.</p><p>He stalked toward her and planted a hand on each side of her on the bed, not touching her but close enough to make her lean back. His muscles bunched with tension beneath his T-shirt as if he were fighting the urge to grab and shake her. He lowered his face level with hers, meeting her eyes. \u201cYou know what? Never mind. You\u2019re right. Why would you want what we have to offer? Instead you can have your nice little manufactured fairy tale. The successful husband who looks like he dotes on your every word, the money to buy you whatever you want, and the guarantee that you\u2019ll never get hurt. Because it\u2019s . . . Not. Fucking. Real.\u201d</p><p>The last three words lashed her like whip strokes. She struggled to catch a breath\u2014his accusation, his hulking presence, God, his heat, all sending her brain into control-alt-delete mode. Her body, despite her mind\u2019s protests, responded to his nearness, her nipples becoming tight points beneath her thin T-shirt. \u201cJace.\u201d</p><p>His name came out as a plea, but she wasn\u2019t sure if she was pleading for him to go or to stay.</p><p>His gaze flicked downward, heated. \u201cTake off your jeans.\u201d</p><p>Her focus snapped back like a rubber band. \u201cWhat? No, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pushed off the bed, straightening to his full six feet. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask again, sub. You promised me another month. If you\u2019re going to break your agreement, then you at least owe me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue turned to sandpaper\u2014the dominant tone, the beauty of him standing before her, the love she felt for him almost too much to bear. She closed her eyes, fighting the pulse of desire beating low in her belly. \u201cJace, please.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her arm and hauled her to her feet, causing her to gasp in shock. His fingers found the button of her jeans, unfastened them, then yanked her pants down her legs. His rough handling should\u2019ve scared her, should\u2019ve made her want to run. This couldn\u2019t happen. But she couldn\u2019t will herself to move. Could only watch him. Wanting him.</p><p>He rose and grasped her chin in his hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to say it, say it now, sub.\u201d</p><p>The safe word. She knew what he was asking. But the word wouldn\u2019t form on her lips.</p><p>He released her. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>Her leg muscles seemed to collapse without her conscious will, making her land hard on the carpet.</p><p>He sat on the bed and spread his legs wide. She thought he was going to have her go down on him, but instead he dragged her over his lap, belly down. She automatically reached out to steady herself on the floor, but he was quicker. He grasped her wrists and put them at her sides, then banded his arm over her waist, pinning her limbs down in the process.</p><p>\u201cYou will not move,\u201d he commanded, his voice low and dangerous. His free hand jerked her panties down her thighs and then cupped her heat. She knew what he\u2019d find. He moved his hand away and rubbed his slick fingers along her thigh as if to say, Your mouth may lie, but your body answers to me.</p><p>\u201cJace, don\u2019t do this,\u201d she pleaded, knowing that if he started, she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him, that her undeniable response to him would take over her better sense.</p><p>His palm came down hard on her ass, sending stinging pain radiating over her skin. She jerked, but his hold on her didn\u2019t allow much movement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking an agreement with your dom. There\u2019s a price for that.\u201d He swatted the other cheek, not sparing her any of his strength. She yelped but he didn\u2019t pause. \u201cAnd I think you need a good solid reminder of what it means to feel something.\u201d</p><p>He smacked the back of her thigh. \u201cWhat it means to be vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>The blows continued, the pain coalescing with the rush of endorphins, making her dizzy and breathless and so desperate for him she had to fight not to beg.</p><p>\u201cWhat it means to not just love somebody but to ache for them.\u201d Swat! \u201cTo crave them.\u201d Swat! \u201cTo think about them when they\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>The tears she\u2019d been fighting all night filled her eyes, dripped onto the carpet. Jace. She thought she\u2019d whispered it, but realized no sound had come out.</p><p>He hit her again, but this blow didn\u2019t have any ferocity behind it. His hand stilled against her tingling skin. \u201cI love you, goddammit. And I refuse to let you run away from me, convincing yourself that this was all some meaningless fuckfest. Don\u2019t do that to me, Ev. I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>No longer able to hold back her rioting emotions, her chest bounced with sobs. \u201cI know . . . it\u2019s not . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His tense leg muscles loosened against her belly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, baby.\u201d He flipped her over gently and cradled her against him, his own breath coming fast. \u201cJust be honest. We at least owe that to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She buried her face in the curve of his neck. \u201cI love you, too, Jace. I\u2019m not sure I ever stopped.\u201d</p><p>His entire body seemed to sigh against her as he ran a hand over her hair. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>He stood, lifting her with ease, and walked her around the edge of the bed, then set her in the middle of it. Her bottom throbbed against the cool sheets, but that only served to make her body ache for him more. Regardless of everything going on outside of this room, she needed him. On her, around her, inside her. It was no longer an option.</p><p>He undressed her with practiced patience, taking care to caress and touch only enough to stoke her embers. A kiss here. A pinch there. Every contact new and different because there wasn\u2019t just lust behind it but love. When she finally lay bare before him, her whole being was vibrating like a tuning fork.</p><p>She wanted to plead for him to give her more than just a touch, to fall into bed with her, but she was afraid to speak. Afraid to break the spell weaving around them. Tomorrow her world would fall apart, but right now . . . right now was sacred.</p><p>He peeled off his T-shirt and shucked his shoes and jeans, allowing her to drink in the sight of him. His blond hair falling over his eyes, the long, lean body of a swimmer, the intricate tribal tattoo wrapped around his biceps\u2014a bad boy archangel who had already claimed her soul.</p><p>He climbed onto the bed and nudged her thighs apart with his knees, parking himself between them. \u201cHave you been with anyone besides me and Andre since you\u2019ve been tested?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I.\u201d He stroked the back of his knuckles over her clit, a whisper of a touch, but it sent shivers through her. \u201cAre you protected otherwise?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His finger traced a path around her navel, raising goose bumps. \u201cI want to feel you skin to skin, Ev. You okay with that?\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes, trying to steady her ragged breathing. She could think of nothing she wanted more.</p><p>\u201cYes . . . sir.\u201d She added the last part not because she had to, but because it felt right. She knew she\u2019d never call another lover that. Jace and Andre owned her even if she couldn\u2019t give herself to either of them for good.</p><p>He slipped his hands under her knees, lifting her legs and hooking them around his hips. His cock nudged her entrance, the feel of the smooth, bare head making her whimper in need. He rocked his hips forward, sliding into her heat with a groan. \u201cOh, Ev.\u201d</p><p>His body trembled against her as he held himself still inside her. She was still tender from her earlier lovemaking with Andre, but the feel of Jace filling her, no barrier between them, was like having the sweetest, most luscious piece of chocolate melting on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cGod, you feel like heaven.\u201d He sank onto his forearms, the length of his body pressing against hers, and captured her mouth in a breathless kiss. She tangled her fingers in his hair, letting her ache for him pour into the kiss. His hips slowly began to move, fucking her with his cock as well as his mouth.</p> <p>Every time he eased his pelvis back in that slow rhythm, her inner muscles clenched, missing his presence the second he was gone. She moved her hands to his shoulders, her nails digging into the honed muscles, a silent plea for him to take her all. To take her hard. To make her forget about tomorrow.</p><p>He broke away from the kiss. \u201cYou okay, baby? I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I know you and Andre . . .\u201d</p><p>A hot flash of shame lit up her cheeks at the reminder she\u2019d already slept with one man tonight. Her gaze darted away from his. She mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He cupped her face, forcing her to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be embarrassed. I\u2019m not Daniel. I won\u2019t make you pay for something I gave you permission to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with Andre without you there. I didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him?\u201d</p><p>She tried to look away again, but he held her chin firm. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t love you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who, baby?\u201d He ran a thumb over her lips. \u201cWe both love you back. Fuck the rules.\u201d</p><p>She blinked away fresh tears.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what it fucking does to me thinking of you two rolling around in that studio of yours?\u201d His cock flexed inside of her, answering for him. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry I wasn\u2019t there to watch.\u201d</p><p>She peeked at him from beneath her lashes. \u201cWe took pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d he said, the agony of restraint crossing his features. He thrust into her hard enough to make her cry out. \u201cYou drive me crazy, Ev. If you\u2019re sore, you better tell me now, \u2019cause otherwise, I\u2019m ready to fuck you into next week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab the headboard and don\u2019t let go,\u201d he ordered. He lifted himself to a kneel and shoved her knees toward her chest, spreading her so wide she thought she might break, and then he plunged deep.</p><p>She moaned so loud she worried she\u2019d wake those in the neighboring rooms. The position seated him so gratifyingly deep. He planted his palms on the back of her thighs, holding her in place, and fucked into her with erotic brutality.</p><p>Her eyelids wanted to fall shut, the wallop of sensations overwhelming, but she didn\u2019t want to miss the view. The ferocity burning in Jace\u2019s green eyes, the golden skin now glazed with sweat, the muscles bunching in his chest. God, how would she ever be able to go back to not having him? Her fingers strangled the simple square slats of the headboard as she forced all thoughts away and let herself fall into the moment.</p><p>Jace changed the angle, set her ankles on his shoulders, and freed his hands so that he could touch her clit while he continued to move inside her. Her entire being seemed to contract at the first touch to the swollen nub, his cock simultaneously rubbing against a spot inside her that sent a zing through her nerve endings. Oh, my.</p><p>The corner of his mouth rose in a wicked smirk as if to say, Gotcha.</p><p>Before she\u2019d met the two guys, she\u2019d determined that the G-spot was a myth. But just like with everything else, Jace and Andre blew what she thought she\u2019d known about herself out of the water.</p><p>\u201cJace,\u201d she pleaded as he continued his dual assault, her knuckles aching from her grip. \u201cSir, I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it, baby,\u201d he said, short of breath himself. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>Her breath wheezed out as she let the tide take her under. The feel of his cock, his fingers, her still stinging bottom, the burn of her muscles from the position, all of it swirled into one massive ball of electricity, pulsing through her with relentless force. Then he hit that internal spot again and everything burst through the seams.</p><p>Her scream seemed yanked from the core of her being as the orgasm claimed her body. Words, some intelligible some not, spewed from her lips. She called his name, she called him sir, she called to God . . . but when she called out I love you, Jace went over his own precipice.</p><p>Fluid, hot and sweet, jetted into her, and his groan joined hers as they tumbled into oblivion together.</p><p>Afterward, he rolled off her and gathered her against him, spooning her with his large body. Minutes passed and she thought he\u2019d dozed, but his quiet voice slipped in her ear. \u201cThank you for that. I\u2019ve never gone bare since I was with you the first time.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. \u201cWhat? Not your wif\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondoms for birth control.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you were my first.\u201d</p><p>The sentiment tugged at her, made her heart ache. How was she going to do what she needed to do? She retreated to the safety of teasing. \u201cMe, too. I thought it was impossible for me to be your first anything, Mr. Experience.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAre you calling me a slut?\u201d</p><p>She waggled her rear against his crotch. \u201cNah, I was thinking more man whore.\u201d</p><p>He pinched her butt. \u201cSmartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the pot to the kettle.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her shoulder. \u201cHow \u2019bout being my first love? Does that count for something? \u2019Cause you\u2019ve been holding that title for a long time, Ev.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cI was just a dumb kid, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both were, but that doesn\u2019t mean my love for you was any less real.\u201d His voice clogged with emotion. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you what it was like when I woke up the next day and realized you were gone\u2014that I might never see you again.\u201d</p><p>Dread curled in her stomach. He rolled her over to face him, but she couldn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>He pushed the dampened hair off her forehead. \u201cAsk me to stay, Evan. Ask me to stay, and we\u2019ll face whatever tomorrow brings together. Don\u2019t run away from me again.\u201d</p><p>The soft plea in his voice wrecked her. Ripped out her heart and left it beating helplessly in his hands.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer, so she kissed him long and deep, lacing her fingers in his hair, holding him against her, memorizing the feel of him, his scent. Imprinting every nuance on her brain.</p><p>Because of all the commands he\u2019d given her, he\u2019d finally given the one she couldn\u2019t obey.</p><p>An hour later, he was asleep and she was dressed and packed. She took one last look at him sprawled over the bed, his chest rising with steady breaths, his face smoothed of worry. A picture she knew she\u2019d never be able to erase from her memory.</p><p>Then she opened the door and walked away. Leaving her heart behind with him.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Jace stretched an arm across the bed, reaching for warmth, for Evan, but his hand hit the nightstand before he found anything solid. And without even opening his eyes, he knew. Knew she wasn\u2019t in the shower or downstairs getting a cup of bad hotel coffee.</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been enough to keep her there.</p><p>He rolled onto his back, disappointment enveloping him like an oil slick, weighing down his limbs and coating his throat. He\u2019d lost her again.</p><p>She\u2019d told him she loved him back. He\u2019d believed her. But she\u2019d left anyway to go take the goddamned fall for a friend, sacrificing her own chance at something true. All to keep a promise? Or was that just an excuse to let Jace down easy? If Daniel wasn\u2019t in the picture, would Evan have given something with him and Andre a real go?</p><p>He\u2019d offered Evan everything he had\u2014his heart on a silver platter complete with a little sprig of parsley and an I love you. And she\u2019d turned tail anyway.</p><p>He stared at the ceiling, the hazy light of dawn shifting across and changing shades as the sun rose higher and peeked through the parted curtains. The jet-engine blast of the hotel\u2019s air conditioner offered an ear-numbing soundtrack to his warring thoughts. What the fuck was he supposed to do now?</p><p>Every ounce of caveman in him demanded that he get his ass out of bed and go after her. Track her down and cuff her to him until she agreed to give him another chance. Show her he could make her happy. But he\u2019d made the mistake of chasing a woman who didn\u2019t really want him. Once.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to have his nuts handed to him again. He\u2019d pursued Diana until she\u2019d given in. She\u2019d played his ego with PhD level expertise\u2014an intricate dance that had hypnotized Jace into believing that he was the only man for her. The only one who could take care of her the way she needed. She\u2019d exploited his need to feel capable, the need to prove he could be someone\u2019s hero and not just the family screw up.</p><p>Looking back, he could see how manipulative and unstable she\u2019d been. His divorce attorney had called Diana a borderline personality\u2014needy, attention-seeking, emotionally destructive. But Jace had fallen in love and stumbled right into the snare she\u2019d set out for him. He\u2019d spent the marriage like a lovesick idiot trying to be Mr. Ultimate Husband. She\u2019d spent it emptying his bank account and fucking the guy she really wanted.</p><p>Never would he let himself be humiliated like that again. If Evan thought her designer imposter relationship with Dr. Dan was what would make her happy, then so be it. Jace was done campaigning otherwise. Evan had proven the mantra he\u2019d been preaching for the last five years. He was just a good time, a fun lay, not anyone\u2019s superhero.</p><p>And the first rule in life: Stick to what you\u2019re good at.</p><p>Now it\u2019d be even easier to do that. Because whatever hope for love that had survived after his divorce had officially snuck out of his hotel room without even leaving a note.</p><p>Evan sat in the lobby area of The Ranch, fastening and unfastening the clasp of her watch, the rhythm of the repeated clicking like a metronome for her frayed nerves. Breathe in. Breath out. Don\u2019t think. Don\u2019t feel.</p><p>She\u2019d driven away from the hotel with no idea where she was headed, simply knowing that she couldn\u2019t stay there and she couldn\u2019t go home. Wherever home was anyway. Suddenly she felt like the last \u201chome\u201d she\u2019d had was when her mother was alive. Everywhere else she\u2019d lived after that, she\u2019d been an outsider. A burden in some cases. An accessory in others.</p><p>Her car had found its way to the interstate heading out of the city without much conscious guidance from her. She had no idea if The Ranch was the kind of place you could drop into without a reservation, but it was worth a try. At least here she could hole away in some cabin and fall apart without an audience.</p><p>The front desk attendant had been nice enough when Evan had dragged her bloodshot self through the front door, her suitcase trailing after her like an I-have-no-place-to-go banner. But she\u2019d also noticed the way the man\u2019s eyes had assessed her wrinkled clothes, her hastily finger-combed hair. She probably looked like she should be checking into rehab instead of a resort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He\u2019d directed her to wait in one of the cowhide upholstered chairs, then had disappeared behind a large mahogany door that seemed to scream do not effing enter. That had been a solid ten minutes ago. Now she was beginning to wonder if he was coming back at all. Maybe she should just go. Find some roadside motel.</p><p>But the grit scraping her eyeballs every time she blinked reminded her that if she got back on the road, her car would probably end up with a tree for a hood ornament.</p> <p>The door opened finally and instead of the front desk guy, Grant Waters stepped through. He was in his standard-issue Wranglers and had a plaid work shirt thrown over a wifebeater, but his dark wavy hair was clearly bed-rumpled and he had flip-flops on instead of his usual boots.</p><p>\u201cMs. Kennedy,\u201d he said in an East Texas drawl that could probably inspire the panties off a nun. \u201cTo what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d she said, getting up to meet him halfway. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going pull you out of bed. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, I was in the military. I can handle an early-morning wake-up call. Especially for one of my members.\u201d Instead of taking her hand, he placed a knuckle beneath her chin, tilted her face up to him, and evaluated her expression like a parent trying to catch a child in a lie. \u201cCamden said he thought you could be on something, but that\u2019s obviously not the case. What\u2019s going on, darlin\u2019? Who put that lost look in your eye?\u201d</p><p>She stepped away from his touch, his all-too-knowing gaze. \u201cI just need a place to stay. Is there any room tonight?\u201d</p> <p>He crossed his arms over his chest and peered down at her, his fingers drumming against his bicep. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually. There\u2019s a big collaring ceremony this weekend. Multiple couples participating. So we\u2019re booked through the next few days.\u201d</p><p>His answer landed like a sack of rocks on her shoulders, making her bones feel like they might snap beneath the weight of all she\u2019d dealt with today. \u201cOh. I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said, sounding truly apologetic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed anyway.\u201d She reached for the handle of her suitcase. \u201cI\u2019ll just drive a little farther and find a motel. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>She attempted to lift her suitcase and barely got it off the floor. The bag seemed to be filled with bricks, even though she knew there were only a few changes of clothes in it. Grant caught sight of her struggle and reached down, placing his hand over hers on the handle. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She released the bag and straightened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her for a long moment, his gaze seeming to tunnel into her, unzipping her casing and peering inside. Instinct told her to look away, look down, look anywhere but at him, but the stare held her as captive as Andre\u2019s handcuffs would\u2019ve.</p><p>Finally, he broke the eye contact and hefted her suitcase with ease. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me. You\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, then his suggestion registered. Oh, shit. The Dom with a capital D commanding her to stay with him? Did that mean . . . ? \u201cWhat? Oh, no, I couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said as if he were Supreme Master Ruler of the Universe. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you get on the road and risk killing yourself or someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laid his free hand on his shoulder. \u201cCalm down, Evan. This isn\u2019t a sexual invitation. If it were, you would know. I have a guest room. It\u2019s nothing fancy, but you can stay there this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Her muscles loosened beneath his reassurance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be. Now come on, let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d He put his arm fully around her shoulders, and she couldn\u2019t help but sag against his side, her body\u2019s internal battery fully depleted.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, she may have put up more of a fight. May have been more wary of sleeping at some stranger\u2019s house. But right now, all she wanted was a bed and the oblivion of sleep. Right or wrong, she trusted Grant. On some primal level she sensed his goodness, his honest nature.</p><p>Grant led her to a golf cart parked outside the main building and helped her get seated before securing her suitcase in the back. The ride to his corner of the property was blessedly quiet. She\u2019d expected more questions from the ever watchful owner, but apparently he wasn\u2019t going to pry. For now. She had a feeling all bets were off in the morning.</p><p>The house they parked in front of was a modest version of the cedar-planked cabins that dotted the grounds of The Ranch. Wraparound porch. Views of the vineyards from two sides. Beautifully simple. Much smaller than she would\u2019ve expected for a man with Grant\u2019s kind of money.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside,\u201d he said, climbing out and grabbing the suitcase. \u201cSun\u2019s starting to rise, and I have horses to feed.\u201d</p><p>The inside of the cabin was as understated as Grant\u2019s wardrobe. Comfortable furniture, simple decor. Not even a family photo in sight. The only make-a-Realtor-go-wild feature was the two-story wall of windows in the living room that framed the vineyard and the horizon beyond. \u201cWow, that\u2019s some view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s why I picked this spot.\u201d</p><p>She let her gaze go all the way to the top of the windows where they narrowed to a peak. Not a curtain anywhere. \u201cSacrificing a little privacy though. Anybody working in the vineyards could totally see you if you decided to have a romantic evening on the couch or something.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he led her through a hallway, his large hand like a heating pad on the base of her spine. \u201cNot an issue. I don\u2019t bring women here.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cWait, like ever?\u201d</p><p>He opened the door on his right and set her suitcase down inside the bedroom. \u201cI have a whole playground at my fingertips. I don\u2019t need to bring someone into my personal space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you letting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you needed me to.\u201d He flipped on the light switch in the bedroom. She followed him inside. \u201cAnd because you\u2019re the sub of two very good friends of mine. They would want me to keep you safe and off the roads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let them know I\u2019m here,\u201d she said, the words whipping out of her mouth before she could reel them back.</p><p>He walked around the bed and folded the comforter down. \u201cOh, and why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 There\u2019s just a lot going on and I need to be away from it all to think. I don\u2019t want anyone knowing I\u2019m here\u2014my fianc\u00e9, Jace, Andre, none of them. And if any reporter calls\u2014\u201d</p><p>He paused in turning down the bed, looked up. \u201cDarlin\u2019, no press would even know the number to call. As far as the rest of the world knows, we don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cI need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree men on your tail. Sounds like you\u2019ve gotten yourself into quite a bind.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cAre you seriously being punny right now? Because if I wasn\u2019t so tired, I would totally throw something at you for that.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, the baritone sound making his chest bounce. \u201cSorry, unintentional. Is there anything else I should know? No bodies in your trunk, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone for now. Though a few people may want my head on a stake by the end of the day. It\u2019s going to come out in the media that I\u2019ve cheated on Daniel.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, pinned her with his stare. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t. I talked to Daniel myself when he set up your membership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, open relationship isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to fly with the general public. If I don\u2019t take the fall, he\u2019ll lose his television deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Disapproval marked his face like a thundercloud rolling over the calm plains. She shivered. His poor subs must fall over themselves trying to avoid that look.</p><p>Even though he wasn\u2019t her dom she found herself scrambling for some way to make it better. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your life, darlin\u2019. But in my opinion, any man worth his salt would never let his woman take the hit for something that was his doing. His job is to protect you from anything and anyone who may hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her I-am-woman-hear-me-roar gene snapped to attention. \u201cI don\u2019t need some guy to protect me. I\u2019ve handled way worse than bad press.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to her and laid a hand on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t get your feathers all fluffed. I have no doubt you could slay the hounds of hell if faced with them. But the question is, should you have to? And would a man who\u2019s supposed to love you, make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Jace.\u201d</p><p>His lips hitched at the corner. \u201cThat guy\u2019s wiser than people give him credit for.\u201d</p><p>Jace. Her chest ached like she\u2019d been running for miles. \u201cThanks for the room.\u201d</p><p>Grant lowered his hand and headed to the door. \u201cGet some rest, darlin\u2019. You have my word that I won\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re here. You\u2019re safe from it all for now.\u201d</p><p>Grant closed the door and left her in silence.</p><p>Safe. But alone.</p><p>Seems she could never be one without the other.</p><p>Maybe it was time she accepted that.</p><p>She walked over to her suitcase and unzipped it, staring at what she\u2019d tucked in the front flap. Daniel had handed them to her before she\u2019d left, and she\u2019d wanted to toss them back his way. But now the little prescription bottle beckoned her with its promise. She pulled out the antidepressants she hadn\u2019t touched in months, rolling the bottle between her fingertips.</p><p>She looked at the empty room, her empty bed, and then went into the bathroom for a glass of water. She tilted one of the pills onto her palm and swallowed it.</p><p>Time to get on the train back to numb. Living life in 3-D hurt too much.</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>Jace sat at a table in the back of the bar, trying to drown his thoughts in beer and rock music. He\u2019d planned to go home and do the same in a more comfortable chair. But when he\u2019d walked into the loft, Andre had been packing boxes.</p><p>Fucking packing!</p><p>Jace had asked what the hell was going on, but Andre had simply shrugged. \u201cGoing to stay with my brother for a while. I\u2019ll get the rest of my stuff when I find a new place.\u201d</p><p>The few remaining bricks in Jace\u2019s already cracked foundation had seemed to crumble into dust beneath him. Andre was leaving? The two of them hadn\u2019t talked much in the days following Andre\u2019s confession. Jace had been knocked on his ass by the one-two punch of losing Evan and finding out how Andre felt and hadn\u2019t even known where to start. But the last thing he wanted was for Andre to bail. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fucking move out.\u201d</p><p>Andre had looked up, his expression flat. \u201cYeah, man. I do.\u201d</p><p>And what had Jace done? Had he insisted Andre sit down and talk with him? Had he told him that the reason he\u2019d been quiet was because he had no fucking idea what to do with the stir of feelings Andre\u2019s admission has caused inside him?</p><p>No. He\u2019d turned on his heel and walked out. Like a fucking coward.</p><p>And now Jace had lost not one, but both the people who actually meant something to him.</p><p>He swigged another gulp of beer and leaned his head against the booth, the pulsing beat of the music like a hammer against his throbbing skull. He should\u2019ve never let himself care. He\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t open up to anyone again, but maybe he had a deeper masochistic streak than he thought. Because it seemed his whole life he\u2019d done nothing but fuck himself over and let down the people he loved.</p><p>\u201cAdding alcoholism to your long list of vices?\u201d a familiar female voice asked.</p><p>Jace\u2019s head snapped upward just as Diana slid into the other side of the booth, her cherry-red lips curled into a sneer.</p><p>He had no idea why she was there or how she\u2019d tracked him down, but he didn\u2019t care. Now was not the time to have a discussion with her\u2014not when he had more anger and alcohol coursing through him than good sense. \u201cGo away, Di. I\u2019m not in the mood to deal with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019re in the mood for,\u201d she said, her expression pinched. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to leave me destitute, and I\u2019m not about to sit back and let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, give me a fucking break. Destitute?\u201d He looked at her diamond earrings and the Rolex circling her wrist. \u201cYou haven\u2019t worked in the last five years, and you\u2019re living with a guy who drags in twice what I was making when we were married. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be standing in the soup line any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreg\u2019s money is not mine. He doesn\u2019t believe in marriage, so our accounts are separate. And after all the hell you put me through in our marriage, you owe me this. I was there when you built that store. It\u2019s half mine.\u201d</p><p>Jace closed his eyes, counted to five. I will not yell at a woman in public. I will not grab her by her shoulders and shake her. \u201cLeave, Diana. I don\u2019t owe you a damn thing. We\u2019ll deal with this through the courts.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a manila folder from her purse and set it on the table between them. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who can hire a private investigator, asshole.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the folder as she peeled back the cover. On top was the photo of him and Evan on the balcony\u2014the one that had been released to the press.</p><p>Red leaked into his vision, blinding him with the flood of rage. He gripped the edge of the table, breathing through all the things he wanted to scream.</p> <p>\u201cYou conniving bitch,\u201d he said, his voice low and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Does this make you mad?\u201d she asked coyly. \u201cNow that my ex-husband is trying to take my money, I had to go find funds somewhere else. And his slutty new girlfriend was quite convenient for giving the PI fodder.\u201d</p><p>Jace slammed his fist on the table, the noise blending into the loud music. \u201cYou call her that one more time and I swear to God . . .\u201d</p><p>Diana flipped the photo to the side, cutting off Jace\u2019s threat and revealing another picture beneath. He and Evan at Christmas back when she was still living with his family.</p><p>Shit. Diana knew.</p><p>Another flip. A black-and-white photo of a teenage Evan standing by a window. Jace frowned. He didn\u2019t recognize the location, but Evan looked the same as when she\u2019d run away, her hair just a little longer. His gaze tracked down the picture and froze. Evan\u2019s waistline was rounded, peeking out of the bottom of her T-shirt.</p> <p>He went cold all over.</p><p>Diana smiled. \u201cGuess my PI is better than yours. Did you know your little girlfriend was investigated for a pornography ring? They have a whole file on her. Apparently, she learned her photography skills in a not-so-traditional way.\u201d She tapped the picture. \u201cAnd, huh, wonder where that baby ended up?\u201d</p><p>Jace barely heard what Diana was saying. The sounds and lights of the bar swirled around him in a haze as things crashed together in his mind. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward on the table, hawk-eyeing him. \u201cThe website gave me fifty thousand for that first picture. Imagine what they would give me for these.\u201d</p><p>No. No way would he let Evan be exposed like that. She\u2019d lose everything.</p><p>He pressed his fingers against his temples. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, the face he once thought of as pretty looking like a twisted nightmare. \u201cFive hundred thousand dollars. You give me that, I give you all the information I have. And I\u2019ll relieve you of alimony.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in disbelief. \u201cHalf a million? You\u2019re out of your damn mind, woman. I don\u2019t have that kind of money lying around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut your daddy does.\u201d</p><p>His stomach turned, the implication of her words crawling through him like a deadly virus.</p><p>She didn\u2019t just want money.</p><p>She wanted to destroy him. To make him grovel before his father and lose the business he worked so hard to build.</p><p>To win.</p><p>And with Evan\u2019s reputation on the line, he was going to let her.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>Andre crossed his arms and sighed heavily as he leaned back against the bar. \u201cHow much has he had?\u201d</p><p>Eddie, the bartender, checked the tab. \u201cEnough. His ex stopped by, and he switched from beer to whiskey after she left. I was going to call a cab, but figured I\u2019d try you first.\u201d</p><p>Andre nodded, watching Jace from across the busy dance floor. Jace lifted his glass and swigged from it, his throat working as he downed it. Andre shook his head. Whiskey. Not a good sign. Jace wasn\u2019t a big drinker, so anything besides beer meant he was chasing demons.</p><p>Andre swiped a hand across his face. He\u2019d hoped to not have to talk to Jace for a while. To give them both some space. Telling him how he felt had been a world-class mistake, and seeing Jace completely shut down around him afterward had damn near killed him. In one swing, Andre had knocked out his chance for more with Jace and irrevocably wounded a longtime friendship. Wham. Done.</p><p>But when Eddie had called him, Andre couldn\u2019t bring himself to turn his back and send Jace home in a cab. So here he was. Like some asshole who didn\u2019t know when to quit.</p><p>Andre pushed his way through the throng on the dance floor and slid into the booth. Jace lifted his gaze from his empty glass and winced when he saw it was Andre.</p><p>Perfect. He was cringe-worthy now.</p><p>Andre cleared his throat. \u201cLook, I get that I\u2019m not who you want to talk to right now, so you don\u2019t have to say anything. But it\u2019s time to get out of here. Eddie\u2019s cutting you off and sending you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a kid,\u201d Jace said, his words slurring together.</p><p>Andre frowned. Great. Drunk and babbling nonsense. Fun times. \u201cWho? Diana?\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head, a slow move that seemed to take all his effort. \u201cNo. She had a kid. My kid.\u201d</p><p>Andre blew out a breath. \u201cCome on, man. Let\u2019s get out of here. I think the whiskey\u2019s talking.\u201d</p><p>Jace shoved the empty glass out of the way. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked up everything. I always do.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. This was going nowhere good, fast. Andre climbed out of the booth and hooked an arm under Jace\u2019s. \u201cEnough. Let\u2019s go, amigo. Whatever\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll figure it out in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, Jace didn\u2019t resist. Andre led him to his car, helped him in, and locked the seatbelt around him. Jace didn\u2019t say a word. Just kept a pensive look on his face\u2014like he was trying to do trigonometry equations without a calculator. Andre had no idea what had passed between Jace and Diana, but apparently it had been more than an alimony discussion.</p><p>Andre wanted to ask. Wanted to help Jace with whatever was giving him that look. But the gap between them had yawned wide over the past few days. And Andre doubted there would ever be a bridge back to the comfortable relationship they\u2019d had. So he stayed silent and counted the blocks between stoplights.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Andre had Jace back at their loft. No, Jace\u2019s loft, Andre reminded himself. This wasn\u2019t going to be his home anymore.</p><p>Jace had sobered a bit on the ride home and was able to keep steady on his feet for the most part, but Andre helped him to his room anyway. He told himself it was because he didn\u2019t want Jace falling and cracking his head open. That is wasn\u2019t because he simply enjoyed having his arm around him. God, he was fucking pathetic.</p><p>He helped Jace to the edge of the bed and then crouched down to pull off Jace\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you moving out?\u201d Jace asked, his words less slurred but still rolling lazily off his tongue.</p><p>Andre looked up to meet Jace\u2019s intent stare. The green of his eyes swirled with so many things, Andre didn\u2019t even attempt to try to pick an emotion. Drunk. That was the emotion, he reminded himself. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>Jace put a hand on Andre\u2019s shoulder, leaning in with some pressure. Despite the fact that he knew Jace was acting out of his head, the effect of having Jace over him in that position had Andre\u2019s cock stirring to awareness. Freaking perfect.</p><p>Silence stretched and Jace\u2019s eyes narrowed as he evaluated Andre. Andre shifted his position a bit, but Jace\u2019s gaze flicked downward, no doubt catching sight of exactly what Andre was trying to hide.</p><p>Jace\u2019s brow wrinkled. A beat passed and then awareness dawned. \u201cYou\u2019re a switch?\u201d</p><p>Fucking hell. Apparently Jace\u2019s instincts didn\u2019t dull with alcohol. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. So if you answer me, I probably won\u2019t remember.\u201d He smiled in that disarming way that came so easily to him.</p><p>Andre rocked back on his heels, meeting Jace\u2019s stare. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a switch. With guys. Happy? Now do you need help getting undressed or are you going to sleep in your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d Jace peeled off his T-shirt, revealing a view that Andre had seen countless times, but that had never failed to stir something in him. Andre swallowed hard, and Jace stood and unfastened his jeans, surprisingly steady on his feet. \u201cI\u2019m not as wasted as you think I am.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s muscles were coiling tighter by the minute, and the air in the loft seemed too thick. If Jace stripped completely, there\u2019d be no way for Andre to tame his hard-on. He needed to get out of here before he made an awkward situation worse. \u201cGood, then I\u2019ll leave you to it. My brother is expecting me back.\u201d</p><p>Andre shoved his hands in his pockets and headed toward the door. Get out, get out, get out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go, you know,\u201d Jace said, halting Andre in his tracks. \u201cOr move out.\u201d</p><p>Andre shook his head, keeping his back to Jace. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best. I don\u2019t want to lose our friendship. And if I stay here, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>The sound of clothes shifting filled his ears, but Andre didn\u2019t dare turn around. He didn\u2019t need to see if Jace was getting naked. He took another step toward the door, but before he could reach it, breath hit the nape of Andre\u2019s neck. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably exactly what would happen.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s blood seemed to still. He turned around to find Jace within inches of him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>That was a good fucking question. But with everything that had happened tonight, Jace was acting on pure instinct. He knew he\u2019d had too much to drink, but the fresh air and the car ride over had cleared his head enough for him to realize that regardless of everything else, he wanted Andre to stay.</p><p>No. He wanted Andre period.</p><p>And he had no idea what to do with that urge except to give himself over to it. Jace lowered his head and cupped Andre\u2019s neck, meeting the naked emotion in Andre\u2019s eyes. Fear. Sadness. Want for something Andre had already given up on.</p><p>Then Jace kissed him.</p><p>A cautious kiss, a soft melding of lips that quietly shattered every unspoken boundary between them. Andre\u2019s spine stiffened against Jace\u2019s fingers, the shock evident, but after only a blink of hesitation, Andre sank into it, parting his lips and deepening their connection.</p><p>Instead of awkward\u2014the way Jace would\u2019ve expected kissing another man would be\u2014everything about being there with Andre felt comfortable, a natural extension of what was already between them. Sure they\u2019d been sexual together, but this was different. Intimate.</p><p>Andre pulled away and stepped back, his jaw clenching. \u201cDon\u2019t. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why I started drinking tonight, Dre?\u201d Jace said, deciding to lay it all on the line. Now or never. He had nothing fucking else to lose tonight. \u201cBecause you were moving and I didn\u2019t have the balls to tell you I wanted you to stay. That it confuses the ever-loving shit out of me, but somewhere along the way things have shifted between us.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life without Evan. But when I saw you packing your bags, I realized even if I had her, something would be missing. You would be missing. I need you both.\u201d</p><p>Andre closed his eyes and took a breath, as if shoring up his defenses. And for a moment, Jace feared Andre was going to walk out anyway. Just like Evan. But Andre\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cI swear on everything that is holy in this world, if you wake up tomorrow morning and blame all of this on being wasted, I will fucking beat you with my billy club.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Jace grinned. Tomorrow he would deal with the shit that had descended over his life. Deal with the crushing news he\u2019d discovered. But tonight . . . Tonight he needed to lose himself in something good. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a rare day when I can say I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s gaze skated down the length of Jace, making Jace acutely aware of exactly how much things had changed between them. The look was assessing, appreciative, ravenous. How long had Andre been hiding such blatant desire?</p><p>All the blood in Jace\u2019s body charged southward. Clearly, his cock didn\u2019t care that the person standing before him was male instead of female.</p><p>Andre moved closer. \u201cHow \u2019bout tonight I just show you how good of a switch I am?\u201d</p><p>Jace lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you rush into this. Things are crazy in your life right now. When you fuck me for the first time, I want you to be damn sure you\u2019re ready for that, and that it\u2019s not because you\u2019re looking for some escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDre\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my limit for tonight,\u201d he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. \u201cI want you. Fuck, do I want you. But that\u2019s not on the table yet.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded, knowing Andre was right. It wasn\u2019t fair to cross that big of a boundary when his brain had been blended tonight. \u201cSo what do you propose we do, sub?\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s eyes flared with heat and anticipation at the term. \u201cLet me make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>Blood pounded through Jace\u2019s veins, pulsing at his temples and moving lower. They were really going to take this leap. No going back. Jace wet his lips, letting his dominant instincts fill the spaces nerves were trying to edge into. He may have never done this before, but he knew how to be in charge. \u201cAre you going to make me take off these jeans myself?\u201d</p><p>Andre glanced down the stretch of Jace\u2019s torso to the open button at his waistband, then back up to his face. \u201cYou really want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestioning me already, sub?\u201d Jace hooked his thumbs in his pockets. \u201cFind out if I want this.\u201d</p><p>Andre, never one to back away from a challenge, moved closer and slipped his fingers in Jace\u2019s waistband, finding the zipper and pulling it down. His hand closed around Jace\u2019s already hard cock, the thin cotton of his boxers the only barrier.</p><p>Jace\u2019s body tightened beneath the firm grip. Andre had touched him this way before, but somehow the change in dynamic, the intensity vibrating between them, made it feel like it was the first time. He\u2019d always kept Andre at a distance even in the bedroom. Part of that had been because he\u2019d wanted to keep their friendship boundaries in place, but the other part was that he\u2019d always thought Andre to be one hundred percent dominant. Being in the submissive role was never a comfortable place for Jace so starting up something with another dom would\u2019ve been an exercise in frustration.</p><p>Andre stroked Jace\u2019s length, and Jace laid a hand on his shoulder to steady himself. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were a switch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was easier with you thinking I was only a dominant. I didn\u2019t want there to be any weirdness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt,\u201d Jace ordered.</p><p>Andre complied without hesitation, tossing his shirt to the floor. Jace gave him a long hard look and flicked his nipple ring\u2014hard\u2014eliciting a sharp hiss from him. \u201cI should\u2019ve fucking suspected. You\u2019ve got masochist written all over you.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s smile was wry, but his pupils had dilated from the spark of pain. \u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Kind of makes me want to tie you up and see if you can take it as well as you give it.\u201d The words tumbled out before Jace had a chance to consider them. And the surprise on Andre\u2019s face mirrored the astonishment Jace felt at his own statement. But as he looked at Andre\u2014the quickened breath, the smooth hard muscle, the erection pushing at the fly of his jeans\u2014Jace realized the thought of dominating and fucking Andre no longer felt bizarre at all. It felt . . . enticing and edgy in the best possible way. And he felt honest disappointment that he couldn\u2019t indulge in all of that completely tonight.</p> <p>He pinned Andre with a stare. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>Andre went to the floor immediately and in perfect form\u2014not one leg at a time but instead he rocked down straight from a stand to a kneel. Someone had trained him well. Jace grabbed Andre\u2019s hair, tilting his face toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for me to beat you tonight. I\u2019m not drunk, but I\u2019m not totally straight either.\u201d</p><p>Andre burst out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely right on that last part.\u201d</p><p>Jace pushed his tongue into the side of his mouth, fighting not to join in the laughter. \u201cBe careful, smartass, or I may change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Andre pressed his lips together, his brown eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cSorry, I appreciate your concern for my welfare, s\u2014 Wait, what should I call you?\u201d</p><p>Because sir was hers. They both knew it. Jace doubted either of them would ever be able to have another sub use that term again.</p><p>\u201cCall me J.\u201d Jace stepped back and crossed his arms. \u201cUnzip your pants and show me how bad you\u2019re aching to please me.\u201d</p><p>Andre smoothly unbuttoned his pants and opened his fly, then took his thick cock in his hand. The tip was already shiny with desire. Jace walked over to his bedside table and grabbed a bottle of lube. He tossed it to Andre, who caught it with ease in his free hand.</p><p>Jace nodded at the bottle. \u201cYou have permission to stroke yourself, but you don\u2019t get off until I do. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, J.\u201d Andre uncapped the bottle and spread the slippery liquid over his cock with a slow, methodical stroke\u2014one that had Jace\u2019s own dick begging for attention.</p><p>He made his way back to stand in front of Andre, openly watching Andre\u2019s tanned fingers slide up and down his erection. Andre kept his focus on Jace\u2014like the thing that was giving him the most pleasure was Jace and not his own hand. Fuck, that was hot. He shoved his jeans and boxers down. \u201cYou good at sucking cock, Andre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard any complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Andre continued to work himself with that slow, steady stroke, but he opened his mouth and took the head of Jace\u2019s cock onto his tongue and closed his lips around it. Jace groaned as the hot hollow of Andre\u2019s mouth sucked the head in and then slid down the shaft, enveloping Jace in the decadent, wet heat.</p><p>Andre moved back and forth, pressing the flat of his tongue along the base and increasing the suction. Holy shit. Andre hadn\u2019t been lying. The world spun a bit. Jace put a hand on the top of Andre\u2019s head to keep himself from swaying. \u201cGet undressed and let\u2019s finish this on the bed. I don\u2019t want whiskey and that mouth of yours knocking me on my ass.\u201d</p><p>Andre shucked his pants and boxers, and Jace reclined onto the bed. Without further instruction, Andre climbed in between Jace\u2019s spread knees and got back to pleasuring him. Jace\u2019s head sank back on the pillows and he gave himself over to the moment. The guy he drank beer and watched football games with was giving him head. And it felt good. And right.</p><p>The only damn thing missing was the woman they both loved joining in the fun.</p><p>Andre\u2019s lubricated hand cupped Jace\u2019s balls and squeezed with gentle pressure, yanking Jace from the morose thought. Jace\u2019s erection swelled. \u201cFuck, Dre. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Andre lifted his head. \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d</p><p>Jace knew what he was asking. And hell if Jace\u2019s whole body didn\u2019t tighten with anticipation. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you that you couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s mouth closed around him again, but those slick fingers cupping his balls moved down further with confident precision, finding his perineum and rubbing. Electric darts of fuck yeah blasted through Jace. He arched, nearly lifting off the bed.</p><p>Andre\u2019s rhythm didn\u2019t falter, but no doubt encouraged by Jace\u2019s reaction, a lubed finger teased at Jace\u2019s back opening. Jace instinctively tensed, but then reminded himself of the instructions he gave subs and forced himself to relax. The domme he\u2019d done his sub training under had used a plug on him and he\u2019d enjoyed it, but it\u2019d been a long time. And there was something about crossing this line that had Jace\u2019s heart hammering. Jace sucked in a sharp breath and Andre pushed past the resistance, increasing his pace with his mouth as a finger eased inside Jace.</p><p>Jace groaned, his balls drawing up, an orgasm fighting to break free. Fuck. He prided himself on being able to last a long time, but there was no way he was going to be able to deny his pounding urge much longer.</p><p>Another slippery finger joined the first and Andre stroked along the sensitive spot inside. Jace gripped the sheets, willing himself to hold on for another minute\u2014the sensations ratcheting up his spine and down his legs were too good to cut short. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re good at this.\u201d</p><p>As if he wanted to put an exclamation point on the end of that sentence, Andre took Jace to the back of his throat. All semblance of control flew from Jace\u2019s psyche as sharp pleasure, quick and brain-numbingly wicked, went through his system. His fists balled and a choked moan tore out of him as he came, the hot fluid of his orgasm pulsing out of him in blessed release.</p><p>Andre swallowed without a flinch and eased his fingers out of him, leaving Jace sweating and panting. Andre moved off his knees and to the other side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cTo get a towel to clean the lube off you.\u201d</p><p>Jace sat up on his elbow and glanced down at Andre\u2019s slicked-up cock. \u201cI\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight was about you. I can take care of things on my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd last I checked, I\u2019m the one in fucking charge right now. Get on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace. We agreed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me get your cuffs out.\u201d</p><p>Andre hesitated, but only for a moment. He rolled over and got in position. Jace climbed into place behind him, his legs still shaky from his orgasm. He ran a hand along Andre\u2019s spine from tailbone to the back of his neck, enjoying the slight tremor Andre\u2019s muscles gave in response to his touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to betray your limit, Dre. But I\u2019m also not going to let you get yourself off. Your orgasm is mine tonight.\u201d Jace draped himself along Andre\u2019s back and wrapped an arm around him to take Andre\u2019s cock in his hand. He gave him a strong stroke, taking his time about it.</p><p>A soft curse passed Andre\u2019s lips.</p><p>Jace\u2019s own cock nestled against Andre\u2019s backside and stirred to awareness even though he\u2019d been fully sated a minute before. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you set your limit early, my friend. \u2019Cause right now, I\u2019m real tempted to lose my last vestige of virginity.\u201d</p><p>Andre rocked against him, rubbing himself against Jace\u2019s shaft. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere unless you tell me to. I won\u2019t turn you down next time.\u201d</p><p>Jace twisted his hand a bit, gripping and stroking Andre firmly enough to remind him it wasn\u2019t a chick jerking him off. \u201cYou want to come, Dre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yes,\u201d he said between gritted teeth.</p><p>Jace slowed his stroke to what he knew to be a tortuous speed. \u201cAsk me nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jace bit the back of Andre\u2019s shoulder and sucked, tasting the salty sheen glazing Andre\u2019s skin. Andre groaned and his cock seemed to swell in Jace\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice, sub.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s head lolled forward between his shoulders, the muscles in his back as tight as bowstrings. \u201cPlease, J. Let me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Go ahead.\u201d Jace increased the pace and rubbed his own cock against Andre\u2019s ass.</p><p>Andre bowed up and with a shout, spurted onto Jace\u2019s fingers and the sheets below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>When Andre\u2019s muscles went slack, Jace rolled them both to the other side of the bed. Neither of them said anything for the longest time. They simply lay there on their backs, breathing hard and absorbing the impact of what had happened.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Andre asked, finally breaking the heavy silence.</p> <p>Jace kept his gaze on the ceiling. \u201cYeah, you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was great.\u201d He paused, as if positioning his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted for a long time.\u201d</p><p>The sentence hung in the air, as if there were a second half to it. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Andre released a breath. \u201cI miss her, man. I want this. But . . .\u201d</p><p>Andre didn\u2019t have to explain. Jace knew exactly what he meant. What was happening between the two of them was great, but if Evan wasn\u2019t with them, would any of it ever feel truly complete?</p> <p>Jace climbed out of bed, reality settling down on him like a wet blanket. \u201cI know. Believe me. I know.\u201d</p><p>Andre sat up on his elbows. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let her go.\u201d</p><p>Jace grabbed two fresh towels out of his laundry basket, tossing one to Andre. \u201cShe\u2019s never going to want to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know tha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got her pregnant, Dre. I took her virginity, and I got her pregnant.\u201d He shook his head, his lungs\u2019 capacity seeming to shrink. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even trust me enough now to tell me I have a kid.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p> <p>Jace watched the fountain in the center of the building\u2019s lobby get smaller and smaller as the glass elevator climbed to the top floor. The panel dinged, announcing he\u2019d arrived, and Jace briefly considered punching the button to go right back down. He didn\u2019t belong here anymore. He didn\u2019t want to belong here.</p><p>But after looking at every possible scenario, including selling everything he owned, he\u2019d come to the same damn conclusion. If he wanted to protect Evan, he had only one choice.</p><p>He stepped off the elevator and into the busy but quiet hallway. Men and women in expensive suits politely nodded at each other as they made their way in or out from their lunch break. Jace\u2019s stomach turned.</p><p>He\u2019d worked here for years, doing all he could to prove to everyone that he was worth something. That he could be as successful as his father. And Jace had managed to put a dent in that goal. Three years out of college, he\u2019d been one of the top five earners in the company. And he\u2019d been completely fucking miserable. All the slick smiles, the false handshakes, the endless small talk. Like you actually cared about your client\u2019s golf swing.</p><p>The whole thing had been like one endless role-playing game where everyone had a script to read from and a cue to follow.</p><p>And now Jace was going to step back into that hell.</p><p>He straightened the tie he\u2019d dug out of the back of his closet, straightened his shoulders, and headed down the hall that led to his father\u2019s office. Might as well get it over with. A kick in the nuts wouldn\u2019t hurt any less later.</p><p>He passed a couple of open doors, but kept his attention forward. One step in front of the other. The muffled sound of hard-soled shoes on ugly gray carpet mixing with the faint click of keyboards. Jace imagined that\u2019s what a death march sounded like. Click. Click. Tap.</p> <p>He turned to round a corner, but a voice held him up.</p><p>\u201cJace?\u201d</p><p>Jace glanced behind him to find his older brother leaning out of one of the offices. Great. Just what he needed. An audience to witness his humiliation. \u201cHey, Wy.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt gave Jace a head to toe once-over, a crease forming in his forehead. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Jace pulled at the knot of his tie. \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt cocked his head toward his open doorway. \u201cCome in here a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWy, I really don\u2019t have time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, little brother. You\u2019ve got time. Dad\u2019s in a meeting.\u201d He disappeared back into his office.</p><p>Jace shoved his hands in his pockets and followed him. Wyatt probably wanted to gloat and tell him what Jace\u2019s assistant duties would be. Good times. He stepped into Wyatt\u2019s posh office and sat on one of the two leather couches.</p><p>Wyatt propped a hip on the edge of his desk, evaluating Jace with cool blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re here to give in to Dad.\u201d</p><p>Just the words made Jace want to heave. Give in. To Dad. \u201cCan we talk about something else? Don\u2019t you have a new award or something to show off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit, Jace. You know Dad\u2019s the one who does that. Not me.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI know you couldn\u2019t care less about all this stuff or what I do.\u201d</p><p>Jace pressed his lips together, a hint of guilt poking at him. \u201cHey, if this does it for you, that\u2019s great. Honestly. I sometimes wish you\u2019d been born after me instead of before. Trying to live up to your level of success is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt scoffed. \u201cYeah, my success. I\u2019ve got millions in the bank and don\u2019t have a damn second to spend any of it. Or anyone to spend it with. I\u2019m on top of the world, little bro.\u201d</p><p>Jace stared at him, shock stealing his words. Wyatt\u2014wunderkind financier and golden child\u2014wasn\u2019t happy? Sure, Jace knew the guy didn\u2019t date or spend a lot of time on the social scene, but he\u2019d always figured that was how his brother preferred things.</p><p>Wyatt ran a hand through his short-cropped dark hair. \u201cLook, just tell me what\u2019s going on. I know if you\u2019re coming to Dad, things must really be in the shitter.\u201d</p><p>Jace leaned back on the couch, resigned. What did he have to lose by telling his brother? Wy would know soon enough anyway. No doubt his father would tell anyone in shouting distance how right he\u2019d been, how his wayward son had come groveling back to him for help.</p><p>\u201cDiana\u2019s blackmailing me. If I don\u2019t pay, she\u2019s going to ruin the reputation and career of someone I care about.\u201d He looked down at his hands. \u201cMy store is stable and I know I can grow it, but I don\u2019t have the money to pay Diana off right now. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt released a whistling breath. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to give up your dream to save someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more important than my store. I figure I can suck it up and work here again for a few years. Get your coffee and type your e-mails\u2014whatever the hell an assistant does. Then save my cash and maybe try a business again one day.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt laughed, a big and hearty one that almost didn\u2019t look right on him. Jace realized he hadn\u2019t seen Wy laugh like that since they were teenagers. \u201cI admire your selflessness. But you would be the worst assistant ever.\u201d</p><p>Jace couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cWhat? I can type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, bro, I know things haven\u2019t been great between us for a while. But the only reason I get pissy with you is because I\u2019m damn jealous sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Jace smirked. \u201cRight, jealous of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of you, smartass. You\u2019re the free spirit of the family. The one who shoots the bird at every rule and expectation and does your own thing. The guy who the girls wanted and the boys wanted to be friends with.\u201d His expression turned serious. \u201cI don\u2019t want Dad to break you of that.\u201d</p><p>Jace blinked and stared at Wyatt as if he were seeing his brother for the first time. How had he never noticed how isolated and overworked his brother had become? While Jace had been busy finding every way he could rebel, Wy had been left with the burden of shouldering all of their father\u2019s highest expectations.</p><p>\u201cWy, I appreciate what you\u2019re saying, but I don\u2019t know what else I can do. I can\u2019t let Diana release the information she has.\u201d</p><p>His brother crossed his arms. \u201cHow much does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be in your account tomorrow with an extra hundred grand to put toward your store.\u201d</p><p>Jace stood, waving him off. \u201cNo, dude. I can\u2019t take your money. It\u2019s not your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay me back when the store expands,\u201d Wyatt said, standing as well. \u201cI\u2019ll consider this an investment in a good business.\u201d</p><p>Jace couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Wyatt was going to trust him with that much money? Just like that. And put money into Jace\u2019s business? \u201cYou want to invest in Wicked? Have you ever even been in a store like mine before?\u201d</p><p>Wyatt\u2019s smile was droll. \u201cI don\u2019t date a lot. But I\u2019m not dead, moron.\u201d</p><p>Jace raised his palms. \u201cSorry, big brother. I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d lost your V-card yet.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt punched Jace\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFucker.\u201d</p><p>Jace stuck out his hand. \u201cNo, but seriously, man. This is . . . Well, just thank you. Really. It means more than you know.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt took Jace\u2019s hand in a firm shake, then pulled him in for a gruff hug. \u201cHappy to help. Now get your ass out of here before Dad catches your scent like a dog on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Jace stepped back. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to repay you. Not just the money but the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I already have something in mind.\u201d Jace turned and headed out the door, hiding a smile. Once everything settled down, Mr. Workaholic was getting a first-class ticket to a nice big ranch outside the city limits.</p><p>Because Jace wouldn\u2019t need his own membership anymore.</p><p>Being there without Evan was a form of torture he refused to sign up for.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Evan leaned against the trunk of an ancient oak tree as she scanned through the photos she\u2019d taken of the vineyards. The little digital camera wouldn\u2019t have been her equipment of choice, but she hadn\u2019t thought to pack one of her own cameras when she\u2019d left the house.</p><p>Grant had asked her to take some pictures for a new brochure he was developing for the official winery side of his property. Apparently, in his free time he offered tours and tastings for the public. He\u2019d given her his camera to use even though she\u2019d protested that she\u2019d never get good enough shots with it.</p><p>He\u2019d told her to take some test photos to give him an idea of what she could do. Evan suspected he was just being kind and giving her something to focus on while she was holed up at his place. But she\u2019d done the work nonetheless. And it had distracted her. For a while.</p><p>But she knew she\u2019d have to head back to town soon. She\u2019d read the Internet stories over the weekend. The cheating scandal had broken and the press was not being kind to her. It didn\u2019t help that Daniel was playing the role of the poor, wronged fianc\u00e9 a little too convincingly. The media had heaped praise and sympathy on top him like he was some sort of self-help sundae.</p><p>He\u2019d called her a number of times, but she couldn\u2019t tolerate talking to him yet. She\u2019d texted him that she was somewhere safe and she\u2019d be home soon. Maybe once her medication kicked in more she could walk back into his house and play fianc\u00e9e without wanting to either sob or punch someone in the face. Right now, she was still too raw.</p><p>She hit the delete button on a few shots that had captured too much of the late-afternoon sun and had thrown off the lighting. Her cell phone buzzed in her pocket and she accidentally deleted a photo she\u2019d wanted to keep.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d She set the camera down and pulled her phone from the pocket of her jeans, expecting it to be Daniel calling yet again. But instead, Andre\u2019s name lit up the screen. Her chest contracted. How could she talk to him without losing it? She could barely think of his or Jace\u2019s name without wanting to do tequila shots with a Xanax chaser.</p><p>But she\u2019d walked out on the both of them like a yellow-bellied coward. Hadn\u2019t even told Andre good-bye. She knew he deserved better than that. By the third ring, she\u2019d built up enough nerve to hit the button. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>A breath. Then: \u201cHey, bella.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, just the sound of his voice, the way he said her pet name, making her bones ache. \u201cHey Andre.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen better,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAndre, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShh, bella. Listen. I want to talk to you, but I\u2019m calling because of Jace.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cA lot\u2019s happened. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>She looked out at the peaceful rows of grapevine stretching out in the distance, the scene in direct contrast to the riot of emotions beating her raw on the inside. \u201cI\u2019m at The Ranch.\u201d</p><p>A long pause.</p> <p>She cringed, realizing too late how bad that sounded. \u201cGrant gave me a place to stay. I\u2019m just . . .\u201d Avoiding. Hiding. Wallowing. Hating my life. \u201cResting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to come back to town and talk to Jace. He knows about the baby,\u201d he said, his voice so quiet, she almost thought she\u2019d imagined what he said.</p><p>She gasped, the words like a fist to the sternum. Jace knew. \u201cWh\u2014How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis ex-wife hired a private investigator to get dirt on you so she could use it against him. Apparently, the PI has been posing as your friend Callie\u2019s new boyfriend so he could get close to you.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s nails dug into the soft earth beneath the tree, trying to find a grip in her spinning world. Jace knew. He knew she\u2019d betrayed him in the worst possible way. \u201cOh, God, he must hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBella, you need to tell him the truth. Can you come to the loft tonight so we can all talk?\u201d</p> <p>She leaned her head back against the bark of the tree, tears filling her eyes. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>Evan wiped off the sweat that had formed on her forehead after making the trek up the stairs to Jace and Andre\u2019s loft. She hiked her purse up higher on her shoulder, gripping the strap as if it was the only thing holding her upright. On the long drive here, she\u2019d gone over and over how she could have this conversation. But there was no way to make it any easier. She\u2019d had Marcus meet her a few miles before she hit city limits to give her something she needed to pass along to Jace, but other than that, she had no plan.</p><p>The fact was Jace knew a secret that should\u2019ve never been kept from him.</p><p>And he probably hated her. Deservedly so.</p><p>And now it was time to tell him the information she should\u2019ve provided him with all those years ago.</p><p>Her hand shook as she raised it to the door, but she managed to knock and not run back down the stairs. A few seconds passed and she thought maybe they weren\u2019t home, but then the door swung open. Andre stood there in track pants and a standard-issue Dallas PD T-shirt, his tired eyes lighting when he saw her standing on the other side.</p><p>She almost imploded with the need to throw her arms around his neck and bury herself in his comfort. But that wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d come here for. And she had no idea where she stood with Andre. She hadn\u2019t betrayed him like she had Jace, but she had walked away from his love to go to Daniel.</p> <p>\u201cBella,\u201d Andre said, the word so soft, but landing heavily against her. His gaze traced over her face.</p><p>She automatically touched her cheek, knowing her face was probably puffy from crying. \u201cHi. Is Jace home? I\u2014 We all need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Andre extended the arm that was holding the door, pushing it wide and giving her a view of Jace sitting in the living area behind him. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>Jace looked her way when she stepped inside, pain marching across his face at the mere sight of her. He turned to the news on TV, his voice coming out hollow. \u201cAndre called you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jace sniffed.</p><p>Andre\u2019s large hand cupped her elbow as he stepped up beside her. \u201cCome on, bella. Sit. You two need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He led her to an armchair then sat down on the couch next to Jace, leaving her alone to face the both of them. Andre took the remote control from Jace\u2019s hand and clicked the TV off. Jace didn\u2019t stop looking in that direction. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the information going public. I took care of things with Diana.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he\u2019d paid that wretched woman. Which made Evan feel even more like shit. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Quiet filled the room, the airy loft filling with the thick sludge of silence.</p><p>She set her purse on the floor and then laced her fingers in front of her in her lap, staring at her hands like they held the script on how to say the right thing. They didn\u2019t, so she went for the only thing she could say. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t tell you, Jace.\u201d</p><p>He winced, closed his eyes. \u201cYou told me that night you were on the pill. I would\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was on it. I didn\u2019t know you had to take it longer than a month for it to be effective.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her finally, grief not anger shifting his features. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back to me, Ev? I would\u2019ve helped you. Would\u2019ve given you . . . and our baby whatever you needed.\u201d</p><p>The hurt in his voice was like tiny particles of glass digging into every vulnerable spot inside of her. \u201cYou were nineteen. And you were . . .\u201d</p><p>His lip curled. \u201cGo ahead. Say it. I was what? Irresponsible? A fuckup? The guy who took advantage of you because he didn\u2019t know how to keep his dick in his pants? Believe me, it\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice sharper than intended. \u201cI loved you, dammit, and you were on your way to being something. I wasn\u2019t going to be the person to screw that up.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYeah, \u2019cause look how great I turned out, right?\u201d</p><p>She held out her hands. \u201cYou did turn out great! Look at what you\u2019ve built for yourself, the man you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy who owns a sex shop, Ev. Who\u2019s been disowned by his family. And who is apparently a deadbeat dad who didn\u2019t even know I had a child out there. Yeah, some man. No wonder you\u2019d rather marry Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jace. My choices were mine. Sleeping with you. Running away. I knew you wouldn\u2019t have turned your back on me if I had come to you pregnant. But\u201d\u2014sadness choked her\u2014\u201cmy whole life since I went into foster care was about people pretending to care about me. Out of obligation. Because there was paperwork and money exchanged. I couldn\u2019t bear to have you be one of those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Evan, it wouldn\u2019t have been like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that pregnancy saved my life,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cMy depression was out of control long before I slept with you. You were right to be worried when you found my scars. There wasn\u2019t a day that passed back then that I didn\u2019t cut. Not a week went by without me wanting to end it all.\u201d Tears finally made it past her resistance and tracked quietly down her cheeks. \u201cKnowing that baby was growing inside me kept me putting one foot in front of the other. Gave me a reason to stick around.\u201d</p><p>The green in his eyes went shiny. \u201cWhat happened to our baby, Ev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found an adoption agency. Lied and told them I didn\u2019t know who the father was. They helped me with my doctor bills and some of my living expenses. It\u2019s what allowed me to save up money to escape the guy I was taking photos for.\u201d She swiped the moisture from her cheeks and leaned over to pull an envelope from her purse. She sat it in her lap, smoothing a folded edge. \u201cHer name is Dahlia. And she\u2019s gorgeous and smart and . . . happy.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his daughter\u2019s name reached into Jace\u2019s psyche and sliced through all the tethers holding his emotions in control. He choked on the knot of grief that filled his throat. He had a child. One he\u2019d never know. Never get to hold. Or tell he loved.</p><p>The knowledge swamped him, leaving him speechless, gutted.</p><p>Andre laid a steadying hand on Jace\u2019s shoulder, a silent pillar of support.</p><p>Evan pushed forward when she saw Jace wasn\u2019t going to respond, her voice as shaky as her hands. \u201cI placed her with a couple who lives in Oklahoma. They never adopted any other children, so she\u2019s the center of their universe.\u201d She wet her lips and set the envelope she\u2019d been holding on the coffee table. \u201cThey send me pictures every few months.\u201d</p><p>Jace couldn\u2019t move. There was no way he could handle looking at a photo of his daughter right now. He raised his gaze to Evan, who looked bruised and battered with her own emotions. He wanted to be angry with her. To lash out. She\u2019d taken away his chance to know his child.</p><p>But all he could feel was sadness over the paths they\u2019d taken, over the too harsh consequences for a simple mistake of youth. \u201cDoes she have everything she needs?\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s throat worked as she swallowed. \u201cShe has love and safety. Her parents are middle class, so they have the same financial concerns any family would. I\u2019ve been saving everything I\u2019ve earned over the past few years and have put it into a college fund for her. It\u2019s not much, but I figured once Daniel\u2019s show started, I\u2019d be able to put enough in there to cover her through all her schooling.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cSo your arrangement with Daniel was more than just obligation to him.\u201d</p><p>She touched her left ring finger, that fucking engagement ring still encircling it. \u201cI\u2019d never be able to earn enough money in time on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDahlia\u2019s college will be covered,\u201d he said, his tone leaving no room for her to argue.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, Jace. I know your business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the money,\u201d he said, cutting her off. With Wyatt\u2019s boost, no doubt Wicked would be fully back on its feet in no time. And there was no way he was letting his kid go without something.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked down at her hands. Took a breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jace. I know you must hate me.\u201d</p><p>Her assumption was like a kick to the ribs. Did she really think that was possible? That he\u2019d hate her over mistakes she made when she was a teenager? \u201cYou don\u2019t have much faith in me, do you?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her palms on her jeans, her whole demeanor going into retreat mode. \u201cI need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Andre said, leaning forward, forearms on his thighs. Jace could tell it was taking every ounce of Andre\u2019s restraint not to scoop up Evan and comfort her.</p><p>Her gaze flicked to Jace.</p><p>But Jace couldn\u2019t muster up the words to say what he wanted to. He loved her. Couldn\u2019t imagine his life without her in it. But how were they supposed to start something meaningful when she believed he\u2019d bail at the first sign of strife?</p><p>The kind of relationship they\u2019d be entering into would require the ultimate trust\u2014not just the D/s aspect, but a triad to contend with. A setup that would dissolve into jealousy, mixed feelings, and insecurity if all three partners weren\u2019t completely confident in the bond they had. Right now, she wasn\u2019t ready for that. She\u2019d sabotage it. They\u2019d destroy each other.</p><p>And the realization of what that meant he needed to do just about killed him.</p><p>\u201cTell us what you want, Evan,\u201d Jace said, authority underlining his tone.</p><p>She glanced from him to Andre, then back to him, the turmoil behind her eyes like a raging spring storm. \u201cI love you both. I want to be with you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jace raised his hand, blocking the rest of her statement. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Andre sent him a what-the-fuck-are-you-doing glare, but Jace ignored it. Evan might walk out the door and never look back, but this was a risk he had to take. Otherwise, the three of them were going to build something on a foundation of silt. A little rough water and they\u2019d go under in a blink.</p><p>Jace stood. \u201cWe all deserve better than \u2018I love you, but.\u2019 When you can take the qualifier out of that sentence, you let us know. And we\u2019ll talk. Until then, I think it\u2019s time for you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Part of him wished she would dispute him. Stomp her foot and tell him there was no qualifier. They could sweep her up, kiss away her tears, and make her forget the pain of the last week. But the sag of her shoulders told him he hadn\u2019t read her wrong. She wasn\u2019t ready to give herself over completely to this, to them. Maybe would never be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>And that flayed him. Made him want to chain her to his bed and spend the night convincing her otherwise. But he\u2019d learned that love couldn\u2019t be forced or commanded or even won. It was something that shouldn\u2019t take convincing. It just was or wasn\u2019t.</p><p>And for her, for now, it wasn\u2019t. At least not fully.</p> <p>So what could he do but let her leave?</p><p>Evan rose from the chair, her gaze on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right. You both deserve better than what I can give you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBella,\u201d Andre protested when she headed toward the door.</p><p>Jace put a firm hand on Andre\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet her go, Dre.\u201d</p><p>Andre didn\u2019t say anything else as they watched Evan walk away.</p> <p>The front door shut behind her. She hadn\u2019t looked back.</p><p>She\u2019d let them go.</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>Today was the big day. Evan adjusted her dress for the umpteenth time and then touched the twist in her hair, making sure everything was still in place. Her heart was pounding so hard it could\u2019ve substituted for the bass in a death metal song.</p><p>She\u2019d never liked being in front of a crowd like this. One misstep or wrong line and it\u2019d be splashed all over every gossip website. She\u2019d rehearsed her part in her head, going over and over the words last night.</p><p>The man who\u2019d been acting as her handler this morning stepped into her dressing area. \u201cHe\u2019s ready for you, Ms. Kennedy.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and took a deep breath, smoothing her dress once more. \u201cThanks, Eric.\u201d</p><p>Eric smiled. \u201cYou look beautiful. No need to be nervous.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. The biggest decision she\u2019d ever made in her life, but no need to get the jitters. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>He took her arm and led her out of the room and into the hallway. She focused on breathing in and out and not tripping in the completely indulgent heels she\u2019d gotten for the occasion.</p><p>Eric eased her around the last corner and into the main area. Daniel smiled at her when he caught sight of her. If he shared her nerves, he didn\u2019t show it. His suit, hair, and expression were as nonplussed as ever. In that moment, she\u2019d never loved him more. This was the right decision.</p><p>Eric guided her to the edge of the stage, adeptly keeping her out of the way of the bustling crew and the cameras. \u201cAs soon as Daniel welcomes the audience back from commercial, he\u2019ll call you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d He patted her shoulder and then put his headset back on.</p> <p>They cued Daniel, and he gave a smile to the camera that was the perfect mix of welcome and reverence for what he was about to discuss. The audience, when this pilot premiered, was going to be eating out of his hand. Women and gay men everywhere were going to want to comfort him\u2014the handsome relationship doctor who was going to announce the dissolution of his engagement on national television. The man who was going to wish the woman who was leaving him all the best and assure everyone that they would stay the closest of friends.</p><p>The execs who\u2019d freaked when Evan\u2019s affair had hit the news were now drooling like men at a titty bar over the chance to launch the show with Daniel as the ultimate sympathetic hero. The no-such-thing-as-bad-press clich\u00e9 had proven golden.</p><p>And thank God for that because she\u2019d realized when she\u2019d left Jace and Andre\u2019s apartment that even without them in her life, she couldn\u2019t go on playing a role for Daniel. The last few months had been like biting that Garden of Eden apple. No amount of antidepressants or denial were going to let her \u201cun-feel\u201d what she\u2019d experienced with Jace and Andre. They\u2019d tattooed themselves onto her bones, shifted everything inside her to the point where she\u2019d never again be satisfied with \u201cgood enough.\u201d</p><p>So even if she had to go through her life alone, at least she\u2019d be authentic about it. Her mother and father had both died too young and continuing to live her own life on autopilot seemed the ultimate insult to the both of them.</p><p>Daniel had done decent damage control for her in the press, saying that they\u2019d both figured out that they were better friends than lovers. Ha! If the public only knew how true that was. Daniel still didn\u2019t feel comfortable coming out yet, but she hoped after he grew more secure with the show, he\u2019d take that step as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019d like to welcome my best friend to join me, Ms. Evan Kennedy,\u201d Daniel announced, dragging her from her thoughts.</p><p>She took one more deep breath, put on a nervous smile, and walked on stage to publicly break up with the boy she\u2019d plan to marry.</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p><p>Jace cracked open the beers and distributed them around the living room to Andre, Reid, and Grant. Then he handed Brynn a glass of wine. His friends had supposedly come over to celebrate Jace\u2019s birthday, but somehow he\u2019d ended up serving them. Lazy bastards.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t prefer wine, Grant?\u201d Brynn asked. She had her legs draped over Reid\u2019s lap and was looking downright mellow after two glasses of Chardonnay.</p><p>Grant took a pull off the beer and smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t trust these Neanderthals to have anything decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe if you\u2019d bring over some free bottles every once in a while, we would,\u201d Andre said. \u201cYour shit ain\u2019t cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd waste it on your untrained palates?\u201d Grant said, somehow managing smug with that twangy accent of his. He looked to Brynn. \u201cDarlin\u2019, if you\u2019d like some, I\u2019ll package up a case next time you and Reid are at The Ranch and send you home with some.\u201d</p><p>Reid rubbed circles at the base on Brynn\u2019s spine, an unconscious possessive hold on his woman while she was in a room full of dominant men. Jace couldn\u2019t help but feel hollow at the sight. His own hand filled with nothing but a cold beer bottle.</p><p>Two months. Evan had been gone two fucking months. It felt like a century.</p><p>He should\u2019ve never let her walk. His instincts had been wrong. Once again.</p><p>Reid smiled. \u201cSounds good. I plan to take Brynn out there next weekend. She\u2019s got a bit of a voyeuristic streak that we haven\u2019t indulged in a while.\u201d</p><p>Brynn gasped and smacked Reid on the chest. \u201cReid!\u201d</p><p>Reid chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re in a room full of guys, who, except for Andre, have seen you naked and bound for me. You\u2019ve been on your knees for Jace. I think we\u2019re beyond pretending you\u2019re Ms. Innocent.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks stained pink, and she took a dainty sip from her wine. \u201cWell you could\u2019ve at least left Andre with that illusion. Give me some shred of a chance to have someone think I\u2019m a lady.\u201d</p><p>Andre smiled. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019ve been on my knees for Jace, too.\u201d</p><p>She tried to maintain her composure, but an indelicate snort escaped. Her gaze went between the two of them. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Jace grinned, the melancholy mood that seemed to chase him no matter where he was lately easing a bit. At least he had good friends. And Andre. Jace didn\u2019t know how he would\u2019ve made it through the last two months without him. Exploring the new relationship between them had been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise depressing reel of film. Though both he and Andre were all too aware, even in the heated moments, that there was a vital component missing. A sense of incompleteness neither could shake.</p><p>Reid rolled his eyes. \u201cSee. Dirty voyeur. And don\u2019t get any ideas, sugar. I\u2019m not sucking Jace\u2019s dick no matter how much it would turn you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord.\u201d Jace shook his head. He was about as attracted to his childhood friend as he was to a swarm of wasps. And though he\u2019d enjoyed the m\u00e9nage with Brynn, Jace knew it\u2019d been a one-time only deal. Reid and Brynn were kinky as shit, but they were built for one-on-one.</p><p>Grant grabbed one of the remaining slices of pizza sitting in the open box on the coffee table. \u201cSo when are you two going to come back to my place?\u201d</p><p>Jace grabbed a chair from the dining room and straddled it, the little lift in his mood flatlining. The thought of going to The Ranch and dominating any other woman besides Evan made his beer turn bitter in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy with the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen working on a big case,\u201d Andre mumbled at the same time.</p><p>Grant took a bite of pizza, considered them. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well, you know. I\u2019ve seen her.\u201d</p><p>Jace straightened in his chair like he\u2019d been pinched, his possessive gene going on full alert. \u201cShe\u2019s been in L.A. What do you mean you\u2019ve seen her?\u201d</p><p>Grant rarely left his business, so when he\u2019d \u201cseen\u201d someone it usually meant he\u2019d seen them naked.</p><p>\u201cShe came back after she taped that first show. I hired her,\u201d Grant said, his tone as casual as his worn jeans. He tore off another bite of pizza.</p><p>Andre looked horrified. \u201cAs a submissive?\u201d</p><p>Grant smirked. \u201cLook at you two. Like a pack of dogs ready to tear me apart. I\u2019m not that big of an asshole. She needed a place to stay while the media attention died down and while she searched for a new apartment. I gave her a cabin to use in exchange for taking some commercial photos for the winery.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s mouth had gone so dry he was surprised he was able to speak. \u201cShe\u2019s living at the fucking Ranch?\u201d</p><p>The unattached doms would be hunting her like lions stalking a gazelle.</p><p>\u201cShe handles herself just fine,\u201d Grant assured. \u201cColby\u2019s been looking out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just bet he has,\u201d Jace seethed. \u201cI bet he\u2019s been looking quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Reid coughed over what sounded suspiciously like a laugh, drawing Jace\u2019s attention. Brynn seemed to be fighting a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two grinning about?\u201d Jace snapped.</p><p>Reid shrugged. \u201cSomeone I know once busted my ass to stop whining about not having the girl I wanted and to go get her already. What are you two idiots doing sitting around for? You\u2019re both obviously gone on the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s not gone on us,\u201d Andre said, setting his untouched beer on the coffee table. \u201cWe left the door open.\u201d</p><p>Grant groaned and stood, pulling something from his back pocket. \u201cDamn, you two are a pitiful bunch.\u201d He handed Jace a small square envelope. \u201cHappy birthday. She told me not to give you this until we finished your party, but despite reports otherwise, my sadism only goes so far.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s pulse raced. She\u2019d sent them something?</p><p>Andre was across the room and at Jace\u2019s side so quick, Jace was sure he\u2019d teleported. \u201cOpen it, man.\u201d</p><p>Not caring that everyone was there to witness whatever was inside, Jace tore the thing open.</p><p>The simple note card inside was filled with her neat script.</p><p>Where true Love burns Desire is Love\u2019s pure flame;</p><p>It is the reflex of our earthly frame,</p><p>That takes its meaning from the nobler part,</p><p>And translates the language of the heart.</p><p>Andre read it aloud, mostly to himself, but everyone could clearly hear it.</p><p>Warmth tracked from Jace\u2019s chest, radiating outward and enveloping him. The corners of his mouth lifted into a broad smile.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a Coleridge poem?\u201d Brynn asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the quote on the door to Jace\u2019s store. But what the hell\u2019s it supposed to mean?\u201d Andre asked, plucking the card from Jace\u2019s fingers and staring at it. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to be all cryptic. Why would she send us this?\u201d</p><p>Jace looked up at Andre. \u201cIt\u2019s not the exact quote, Dre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He tapped the card, the little blank space in the last line. \u201cIt\u2019s missing the \u2018but.\u2019\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Evan turned up the volume on her car radio and rolled down the windows, enjoying the bite in the late-autumn air. The drive out to The Ranch after working all day in her studio was a bit of a jaunt, but she was starting to enjoy the empty stretch of road and the decompression it provided at the end of the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Soon she\u2019d be back to fighting city traffic daily when she chose between the two apartments she\u2019d found this week. Both options would meet her needs, but she was having trouble deciding, not truly excited about either of them. Probably because each was just empty walls and empty rooms\u2014exciting but terrifying reminders of this new path she\u2019d chosen.</p><p>Secretly, she\u2019d hoped that her note to Jace and Andre would open up the door with them again, at least to talk. But Grant had told her he\u2019d given them the card three days ago and neither of them had reached out to her.</p> <p>She\u2019d been too chicken to go there in person and risk getting shut down. Over the last few months she\u2019d worked hard on getting her shit together. Had gotten herself fully off the antidepressants. She now knew she could survive fine on her own\u2014even if not having Jace and Andre in her life had left this yawning gap inside her like a bad toothache, a dull pain that was never far from her consciousness. But losing them hadn\u2019t sent her into a spiral of depression.</p><p>She would never take a day in this world for granted again. The girl she used to be was buried. Reborn.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to subject herself to them sending her away face-to-face.</p><p>They\u2019d probably moved on. Maybe it had been only a dalliance like she\u2019d told Jace. Maybe once they\u2019d stepped away from the intensity of it all, they\u2019d realized a relationship with her wasn\u2019t what they really wanted. She\u2019d been a mess the last time they\u2019d seen her. How could she blame them for not wanting to get involved with her? They\u2019d known she wasn\u2019t ready to be with them even before she did.</p><p>And really, if they\u2019d moved on. If it had only been a tryst. Then better to know that upfront. She wouldn\u2019t go back and change what had happened between the three of them. It had saved her.</p> <p>The opening bars of one of her favorite love songs drifted from the car\u2019s speakers, and she promptly changed the station to hard rock, kicking up the volume. The guitar-heavy track filled the crammed corners of her mind, shoving away her ruminations. The late-afternoon view along the open highway was too pretty to waste thinking about things she couldn\u2019t change.</p><p>She tapped her steering wheel in time with the music and found her foot pressing on the accelerator a little more aggressively. Her hair whipped behind her as the wind blew through the car. Roads like this made her want a sports car. Like Jace\u2019s Viper.</p><p>She shook the thought from her head and belted out the chorus to the song, her off-key voice thankfully drowned out by the lead singer\u2019s. The last note left her breathless and in the snippet of silence between tracks, a high whining siren pierced her ears.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>She glanced in her rearview mirror and, sure enough, a flashing red light was quickly closing in from behind. She checked her speedometer. Almost eighty. In a sixty-five.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d She eased off the accelerator and made her way to the soft shoulder of the highway. This was going to be an expensive ticket. Just what she needed.</p> <p>She put the car in park and watched in the rearview as the cop pulled behind her in an unmarked car and turned off the siren. The setting sun reflected off the windshield of the police car, not allowing her to see inside. Damn. She hoped it was a male cop. In her experience, she had no shot of getting out of a ticket when a woman stopped her.</p><p>Evan would fight for feminism to the death, but she was not above using a smile and a nice \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, officer\u201d to get out of a ticket. Though, she did draw the line at tears. Callie had used that method once and Evan had almost died from trying not to laugh. Callie had gotten a ticket anyway.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands where I can see them and stay in your car.\u201d</p><p>The loudspeaker voice startled her. Hell, she\u2019d only been speeding. Evan kept her face forward and put her hands on the steering wheel as the cop stepped up beside her car. He put his palms on top of the car and leaned down to her half-open window. \u201cRoll down your window, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The silky authority in the voice had every molecule in her body freezing in suspension. She turned toward the window, coming face-to-face with a pair of aviator sunglasses, dark hair, and a smirk she\u2019d know anywhere.</p><p>Oh my fucking God. She tried to say something but a puff of air was all she could manage.</p><p>Andre straightened, the hard body outfitted in his full uniform coming into view. \u201cGet out of the car, ma\u2019am. Now.\u201d</p><p>Her limbs couldn\u2019t process requests. Her hands stayed cemented around the steering wheel. The moment of hesitation didn\u2019t go over well. Andre yanked her car door open, leaned over her to unhook her seatbelt, then hauled her out of the car with a firm grip on her upper arm. \u201cI said out.\u201d</p> <p>She stumbled, but he held her upright. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What\u2019s . . . What\u2019s going on, Andre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo disrespectful.\u201d He dragged her around the front of the car to the passenger side, blocking them a bit from the view of the road. \u201cYou call me officer or sir, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Heat zapped through her like lightning. Oh.</p><p>He shined a small flashlight in her eyes. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>She winced at the bright light. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just driving like a fucking maniac because you think you\u2019re too good to follow speed limits?\u201d</p><p>His grip on her arm tightened, and he crowded his body against hers, trapping her between him and her car. Her body trembled. She knew what this was. But damn if he wasn\u2019t convincing enough to have a thread of fear lacing through her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, officer. I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know what I think?\u201d he said, his voice low and threatening. \u201cI think that\u2019s exactly your problem. You don\u2019t know how to pay attention. You think a nice expensive speeding ticket is going to fix that?\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips, letting herself slide into her own role. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a ticket, Officer. Please, just let me go. I promise I won\u2019t speed anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you, you can\u2019t even look me in the eye when you promise that. You think I don\u2019t know you\u2019re lying?\u201d The disgust in his voice dripped off the words. He turned his attention toward the rear of the car. \u201cI don\u2019t think a ticket is going to do shit in changing her attitude. What do you think, Austin?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, but Andre clamped her chin in his hand, not allowing her to turn her head and see Jace.</p><p>\u201cKeep your attention on me,\u201d Andre commanded.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we take off, she\u2019ll be driving like an Indy racer. I think this one\u2019s used to talking her way out of stuff with that pretty little mouth of hers,\u201d Jace said. \u201cMaybe we should put those lips to better use. I may be able to be convinced to forget about that ticket.\u201d</p><p>His voice was like sunshine on chilled skin. She closed her eyes, breathed. They were here. Wanting her. Giving her the fantasy she\u2019d only dared speak aloud once. Showing her with action instead of words how they felt. Where true Love burns Desire is Love\u2019s pure flame.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I may be able to be swayed as well.\u201d Andre\u2019s free hand drifted down her body and then cupped the juncture between her thighs, the heat of his palm searing through the thin material of her skirt. \u201cSo, Ms . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKennedy,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cMs. Kennedy, how \u2019bout we work out some other form of payment?\u201d</p><p>Under normal circumstance, she may have thought the moment comical. A silly role-play. But the intensity of his gaze, his tone, his touch had dragged her down from fantasyland and into some elemental place where lines between real and pretend blurred. He wasn\u2019t fucking around. His dominance was as real as the car pressing into her back.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she was going to make it easy on either of them. They\u2019d let her believe for all those days since she\u2019d sent the note that they\u2019d given up on her. Her heart had broken every time she\u2019d looked down at her empty voicemail.</p><p>They wanted her submission again? Well, they\u2019d have to earn it.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she said, trying to wriggle free. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll report you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look how cute, Austin. She thinks she has some say on what fucking happens to her.\u201d His laugh was dark and menacing as he shoved his hand beneath her skirt and into her panties. Without any preamble, his fingers plunged into her pussy, her already wet heat bathing his hand. She let out a whimpering cry and pushed at the solid wall of his chest. He didn\u2019t move back an inch.</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d she bit out, the sharp sound echoing down the empty highway.</p><p>His brown eyes turned savage as he moved his hand out from under her skirt. He grabbed a fistful of her hair and yanked her sideways, splaying her stomach down on the hood of her car. Her cheek pressed hard onto the warm metal, and he kicked her legs wide with his booted foot.</p><p>The rumble of an oncoming vehicle filled her ears and she tried to jerk upward, but Andre planted a palm between her shoulder blades and pushed her back flat. \u201cAdd resisting arrest to your charges, Ms. Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . a car,\u201d she protested. She\u2019d never forgive herself if Andre got himself in trouble over this.</p><p>He grabbed her arms, securing them behind her, and parked himself between her spread legs, his erection hard against her ass. \u201cYou think we fucking care? Or are you embarrassed that anyone who passes by will see how bad you\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>The rumble turned to a roar and an eighteen-wheeler whizzed by them, kicking up some of the dust on the side of the road in its wake. She let go of the breath she\u2019d been holding. \u201cI haven\u2019t been bad.\u201d</p><p>Jace stepped into her peripheral vision, but she was afraid to attempt lifting her head. \u201cNo fucking remorse. Forget bargaining. Just take her in. Maybe a cell block will do her some good.\u201d</p><p>Cuffs snapped around her wrists.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She squirmed, the metal clinking from her struggle. \u201cNo, don\u2019t arrest me.\u201d She softened her tone, attempted to sound placating. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Just tell me what I need to do.\u201d</p><p>Jace grabbed her by the hair, lifting her head at an uncomfortable angle and forcing her to meet his eyes. He was dressed in one of Andre\u2019s black Dallas PD shirts and dark jeans. Tattooed and badass and so fucking sexy it almost wasn\u2019t fair to expect her to resist. No gentleness resided in his face. \u201cYou want to play nice now?\u201d</p><p>She tried to nod. Couldn\u2019t. \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>White teeth glinted in the rays of the setting sun. \u201cI like anything.\u201d He leaned in closer to her, his grip tightening against her scalp. \u201cUntil the sun comes up tomorrow, we own you, Ms. Kennedy. Every inch of this sinful body of yours. You be a good girl for us and maybe we can forget any of this ever happened.\u201d</p><p>Her body melted against the hood like car wax, his heated words and cocky smile enough to have everything going liquid inside her. Owned. By the two men she couldn\u2019t imagine loving more. \u201cI\u2019m all yours, officers. For as long as you want me.\u201d</p><p>Jace closed the distance between them and overtook her mouth in a kiss that told her he\u2019d missed her as much as she\u2019d missed him. His lips and tongue staking claim in a way that words couldn\u2019t. When he pulled back, she was panting. He nipped at her lip. \u201cYou know what you can say if you need to, pet.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a vixen smile. Nothing they could do to her would coax Texas from her lips. For the first time in her life, she needed no training wheels, no safety net, and no fucking safe word. Her trust in these two men had grown to be as natural as breathing. \u201cYou won\u2019t hear it. There will never be any other \u2018buts\u2019 again, sir.\u201d</p><p>The hard glint in his eyes softened for the space between seconds. \u201cGet her in the car, Medina. Time we give that smart mouth of hers something to do.\u201d</p><p>Andre pulled her to her feet, checked her cuffs, and then smacked her ass hard. \u201cMove it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>As she headed toward their vehicle, a black car came into view in the distance, heading in their direction. She picked up her pace. No need for more random strangers looking at her like she was a criminal. Jace opened the back door and Andre put a hand on her head and ducked her into the car. But before she could find a comfortable position with her hands cuffed behind her, Andre leaned inside. \u201cOn your stomach. Knees underneath you. Ass up.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, looked back toward the car that was getting closer. \u201cWhat? Here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, princess. I\u2019m not going to write you an instruction manual.\u201d</p><p>Her already hammering heart kicked up to a deafening rhythm in her ears, but she rolled to her side and positioned herself as best she could. Andre grabbed her hips and helped her get her knees beneath her. He reached beneath her dress and ripped off the panties, the material splitting like it had been made of tissue. The nip of the fall air coasted over her slick skin, inspiring another rush of wet heat.</p><p>God, would the people in the other car be able to see what was going on when they passed?</p><p>The side of her face pressed into the leather of the backseat, her breathing coming out in sharp little pants. The rumble of the oncoming car grew louder and then slowed, the distinct sound of rubber hitting the dirt shoulder nearly sending her into a panic. The car was stopping!</p><p>Crap, crap, crap. She tried to reposition herself, get upright, but the angle and the cuffs had her completely off balance.</p> <p>A heavy door slammed, muffled footsteps, and then voices. Jace and Andre and . . . another voice that had become familiar to her recently. The molasses tone of Grant Waters. Her breath whooshed out of her\u2014a combination of relief and oh, shit twining through her. She was glad it hadn\u2019t been a stranger, but what the hell was Grant doing here? Would the boys try to push her that far? Bring in someone else? Maybe she\u2019d been stupid to think she didn\u2019t need that safe word.</p><p>Grant had been nothing but kind to her the last few weeks, but she sensed under that good ol\u2019 boy politeness and gentlemanly concern was an utter ruthlessness. A depth of dominance that intimidated the bejesus out of her. On some molecular level her body recognized the predator and knew she wasn\u2019t built for whatever Grant served up behind his bedroom door.</p><p>No. She only wanted the sexy dominance of her own men\u2014brash and cocky and laced with a sweetness that made her heart feel too big for her body.</p><p>The voices grew louder and a hand palmed her ass through the thin material of her dress. She jolted and a squeak jumped from her lips.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>Jace. The tension in her shoulders eased.</p> <p>\u201cYou boys need anything else?\u201d Grant asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a fine little prisoner there.\u201d</p><p>Evan held her breath. But instead of her nerves rising, the fear slipped away like the receding tide. Trust. A shining light of warmth deep inside her that was burning bright for the first time in her life. Jace and Andre would only put her through what they knew she could handle. They would push her hard but not shove her over the cliff.</p><p>\u201cNah. She put up a decent fight, but we\u2019ve got her under control. The keys are in her car,\u201d Andre said. \u201cAppreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>Grant was here to pick up her car. That\u2019s all. She smiled and shifted to turn her head the opposite way to try to see the men. The fine sheen of sweat coating her skin had her cheek sticking to the seat. Jace lifted his hand from her ass then replaced the pressure with a swift smack.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She writhed from the surprise and the sharp dart of pain.</p><p>\u201cDid I say you could move?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He spanked her other cheek, eliciting a moan from her. \u201cTrying to see what\u2019s going on, pet? Can\u2019t stand to be left in the dark?\u201d He shoved her dress to her waist, exposing everything. \u201cWell, let me tell you what\u2019s happening then. Our friend Grant here is now looking at the nice red handprints on your pretty ass because someone can\u2019t follow instructions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm, very nice,\u201d Grant said as if he were appraising a show horse.</p><p>Embarrassment burned through her like wildfire, growing in intensity when the telltale rush of arousal chased the humiliation. Fuck, what was wrong with her? She didn\u2019t want Grant to touch her, but knowing someone besides her lovers was seeing her like this made every soft part of her tingle.</p><p>Jace palmed her ass cheeks and spread her. \u201cYou like looking like our whore, Ms. Kennedy? Like being put on display for our pleasure?\u201d</p><p>She managed a firm \u201cno.\u201d But her hips canted toward Jace, betraying how desperate she was for his touch, for some relief for her aching clit.</p><p>The leather seat creaked and then Jace was at her core, his tongue teasing along her spread pussy. She cried out from the wicked snap of pleasure, and he huffed with soft laughter, his breath tickling the neediest parts of her. \u201cBaby, you\u2019re so wet, all three of us could get in line and fuck you twice and you\u2019d still have some to give.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, the aching bad enough to make her consider begging Jace to take her. To do something. Right now.</p><p>\u201cToo bad for you, Grant doesn\u2019t go for brunettes,\u201d Jace said, backing away from her.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d Andre added. \u201cOfficer Austin and I certainly do.\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve been offended by the way they were talking to her. But somehow it only added to her arousal, shoved her deeper into her role in this game.</p><p>Her men exchanged good-byes with Grant, all the while leaving her bared and exposed. Anyone could drive by and get them all in a crapload of trouble. But she had to trust that the boys were watching out for anything that could go awry.</p><p>She adjusted her legs beneath her, trying to squeeze her thighs together and offer some relief to her throbbing clit. But firm hands clamped around her legs, spreading them again. \u201cWe\u2019re not done, pet. Don\u2019t try to sneak anything the minute we turn our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cI need . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know exactly what you need,\u201d Andre said. \u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>Large hands spread her again, but this time something probed at her back entrance. She flinched, the instinct to reject whatever it was impossible to fight.</p><p>\u201cMove again and I might forget to be gentle,\u201d Andre growled.</p><p>She whimpered but focused on stilling her body, relaxing her muscles. She could take it. They\u2019d each taken her there before. The invading object nudged her again. Pressure. Discomfort. Jace touched her clit and stroked with confident ease, sending her nerve endings alight. \u201cLet us in, baby. Show us what a good prisoner you can be.\u201d</p><p>She hummed her gratitude at the stimulation, the pleasure loosening the wound-up ball of tension inside her. The plug slipped past the resistance\u2014cool, smooth, and slick\u2014filling her snug passage and stretching her. Then it started to vibrate.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The unexpected sensation touching off electric sparks inside her. Holy hell.</p><p>Though Jace didn\u2019t change his stroke, the feel of his roughened finger on her sensitive nub intensified tenfold, as if her entire pleasure system had been kicked into a higher gear. She moaned and rode his hand, shameless.</p><p>He laughed, pulled his hand away, and kissed the base of her spine. \u201cNot yet, baby. Save it for when it\u2019s me fucking that gorgeous ass later.\u201d</p><p>The words shuddered through her, making her feel anxious yet desperate for him all at the same time. How was she supposed to hold off coming? Edgy heat curled like smoke low in her belly, rising and infiltrating every inch of her. With the slow vibration of the plug, all she needed was a few more stokes along her clit and she\u2019d go over. \u201cPlease, Jace, sir. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will. Now, up you go,\u201d Andre said. Her skirt slid back down and both men lifted her and settled her into a sitting position, making her acutely aware of the invasion still tucked inside her. They\u2019d turned it to a low setting, a soft humming that was making her pussy ache for its own stimulation. Jace slid out of the backseat, making room. Andre unlatched and repositioned the cuffs in front of her, then pulled the seatbelt across her chest and kissed her mouth. \u201cGod, we missed you, bella.\u201d</p><p>The soft words were like balm for her soul, smoothing away any remaining rough spots. She blinked, a flash of tears lining her lids.</p><p>But he was back in character before she could respond. He hiked her skirt to her thighs and parted her legs, then unbuttoned the top two buttons of her shirt, exposing the curves of her breasts. He tucked a hand inside her bra and gave her nipple a firm pinch, making her arch. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Gives us a nice view in the rearview mirror. Come without permission and that vibrator will be all you get tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are dirty bastards,\u201d she said, trying to sound petulant, but she could hear the grin in her words.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ms. Kennedy, I think you better not throw rocks in that glass house of yours,\u201d he said, his smile sly.</p><p>She stuck out her tongue, earning a deep laugh from him before he climbed out and got into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>The ride to The Ranch was a tortuous test of her will. With her hands cuffed in front of her, she could\u2019ve easily touched herself if she\u2019d tried, provided some relief to the winding rope of desire coiling tighter and tighter inside her. But Andre\u2019s threat kept her in check. A beating she could handle, but going to bed without having these men inside her tonight might kill her.</p><p>Jace and Andre chatted about sports on the way, not inviting her into conversation\u2014as if she wasn\u2019t worth consulting. She was simply the vessel for their use tonight. She recognized the subtle mindfuck, but still found herself growing huffy. \u201cIf you want me to cooperate, you should at least talk to me. Plus that guy is the best first baseman the Rangers have ever had. You two don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Jace peeked back at her with a gaze that promised extensive plundering and pillaging to come. His focus traced up her parted legs, over her belly, lingered on the exposed rise of her breasts, then homed in on her mouth. Fucking her with his eyes. Like he was going through a checklist of every part of her he planned to use and abuse before the night was done. By the time he met her eyes again, she was near irrational with the need for him to touch her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s wise to make demands on me, pet?\u201d His voice was like liquid sin with a splash of menace. \u201cTo push me?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered in instinctual deference. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re undisciplined. I know. We\u2019re going to fix that,\u201d he said, smug male arrogance wafting from him. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t pick you up to hear your misguided opinion on baseball. So keep your comments to yourself. I\u2019d hate to have to gag that pretty mouth.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together and glared, but didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>\u201cGood girl, you\u2019re learning.\u201d He turned back around and resumed his conversation with Andre, leaving her stewing alone in the backseat. Hmph. Thoughts of tying their arrogant asses to the bedposts and torturing them flitted through her head. That might not give her sexual satisfaction but it sure would wipe those overconfident smiles off their faces.</p><p>Andre pulled into the half-full parking lot at The Ranch and found a spot. Evan peeked out the window at the large main building and her heart did a cha-cha behind her ribs. They were really going to do this. Were Jace and Andre going to bring her to the police station room she\u2019d seen on her first tour of The Ranch or were they going to go to their cabin? How would it feel to be handled by these men where everyone could see? The thought sent a blush tracking over her from cheeks to painted toenails\u2014shame edged with some illicit thrill.</p><p>A thrill? Good God, she was careening off the kinky deep end.</p><p>Jace and Andre had figured out the combination to that forbidden lock inside her and once trust had been added to the recipe, her fantasies were spilling out like water from a newfound spring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>The door on her right opened and Jace clamped a hand around her arm. \u201cCome on, pet. Time to pay your debt to society.\u201d</p><p>She scooted out gingerly, the vibrator moving inside her with every jostle, sending a pulse of need straight to her clit each time. When she planted her heels into the gravel, her legs wobbled, but Jace helped her to a stand.</p> <p>Andre unlocked her cuffs and grabbed her shoulders. \u201cTurn and face the vehicle. Palms on the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d She followed his instructions and he nudged her feet wide, leaving her completely vulnerable to them. The vibrator continued its steady humming and her arousal threatened to track down her thighs.</p><p>Hands locked around her ankles, a pair on each. Jace and Andre at her feet. \u201cYou have any weapons on you, Ms. Kennedy?\u201d Andre asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>Their hands traced up her calves, caressing, kneading, then slipped below the hem of her skirt. Hot palms against her already burning inner thighs. Each of them massaged, inching closer and closer to her wet heat. She let her head sag forward between her shoulders as she silently begged them to give her some relief.</p> <p>Roughened fingers slid inside her, deep and without preamble. She bowed up, a cry escaping her lips. \u201cOh, God, please.\u201d</p><p>Another hand found her clit. She couldn\u2019t tell if it was Jace or Andre, but just that one was inside her and one was sliding along her folds. Pleasure, sharp and intense, whipped through her. She rocked against their busy hands. So, so close.</p><p>Then, right when she could feel the first threads of that orgasm waiting in the wings, they backed off. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Jace kissed the curve of her neck and bit. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say no, sweetheart. Strip her, Andre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Here?\u201d She glanced around the parking lot, a shred of panic winding through her. Exhibitionism in her fantasies got her going but suddenly she wasn\u2019t so sure if she had the guts to follow through.</p><p>\u201cYes, here. You have to earn these back. Your behavior so far has proven you don\u2019t deserve modesty.\u201d Andre dragged her skirt down and off then wound his hands around the front of her to unfasten the rest of her buttons and remove her bra.</p> <p>The edge of coolness in the fall air danced over her, tightening her already aching nipples and raising goose bumps on her skin. Instinctively she lowered her arms to cover herself but Jace caught hold of her wrists and guided them behind her back again, refastening the cuffs. The move made her breasts jut out further and graze the chilled metal of the car.</p><p>She wriggled in their grasp. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to walk around like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can and you will,\u201d Jace assured her. \u201cEveryone will see what a pretty prisoner we\u2019ve got. And how wet and pink you get knowing everyone is looking at you.\u201d He positioned himself behind her, the hard ridge of his cock pressing against her ass and the flared base of the plug. \u201cYou don\u2019t fool me, sweet pet. I know you\u2019ll get off on being displayed just as much as we get off by showing you off.\u201d</p><p>He splayed his hand over her mound, giving delicious pressure and drawing a mewl from her.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love knowing how everyone who sees you will want you, but only we get to have you. You\u2019re ours, pet. Always.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, the overwhelming deluge of emotion interweaving with her desperate desire for them. \u201cYes, sir. Always.\u201d</p><p>Another hand brushed her hair away from her face and Andre\u2019s voice tickled her ear. \u201cTrust us to know what you can take.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her fears falling away like dead leaves. She would follow these men into the dark, knowing they would be there to save her if it was too much. \u201cI want to please you. I\u2019ll do whatever you think is best.\u201d</p> <p>Andre\u2019s smile was like a laser of warmth slicing through the cool air. He laced his fingers in the hair at the nape of her neck and leaned in for a kiss. His tongue slid over hers, and Jace joined in, pressing his lips to her shoulders, her spine, the curve of her ear. Tingles having nothing to do with her hyper-aroused state raced through her like fireflies, lighting any remaining dark corners within her and filling them with the shine of love she had for these two men.</p><p>How she had lived so long without this feeling she didn\u2019t know. Her black-and-white life had gone Technicolor in the best possible way. Standing in the middle of a parking lot, cuffed and as naked as the day she was born, she\u2019d never felt safer or more content.</p><p>Andre eased away, leaving her breathless. He smiled. \u201cWe\u2019d better get going before you tempt me off my plan. Despite evidence to the contrary, my patience isn\u2019t limitless.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and Andre pulled something from his pocket. Black material, but not a blindfold. Her lips parted to ask him what it was, but before she could, she had her answer. Andre pulled the tight spandex mask over her head, blocking out the last glimmer of dusk and muffling the sounds around her. Only a space for her mouth remained open to the air.</p><p>What the hell? She sucked in air through her nose, verifying the material was still porous enough to breathe through.</p><p>Jace squeezed her shoulder. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you distracted. All you need to focus on is what we\u2019re making you feel.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the panicky feeling settling down to a fine electric buzz running over her skin. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Hands clamped over her biceps, and the guys made sure she was steady on her feet. They nudged her. \u201cWalk.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled on the first step, but they kept her upright. \u201cShould I take off my heels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk crazy now,\u201d Jace said. She could picture the naughty schoolboy smile he was probably wearing. \u201cWhat kind of guys would we be if we made you walk barefoot on gravel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh-huh. You\u2019re all heart,\u201d she said, letting the sarcasm drip off her tone.</p><p>The boys led her through the parking lot and onto pavement. The disorienting feeling of not knowing what was around her had her focusing on putting one foot in front of the other and on trusting the strong men flanking each side of her.</p><p>The squeak of a heavy door opening filled her ears and warm air cascaded over her, the contrast in temperature making her shiver. They were going inside. The built-in urge to shield her nudity, to feel shame, rose within her. She inhaled deeply, trying to center herself.</p><p>Jace and Andre wanted to show her off, to strip away the remaining bricks and expose the soft vulnerable core of her trust. To push her. If she gave herself over completely to their wishes, she knew the reward would be hers. But that didn\u2019t stop her heart having a grand mal seizure beneath her rib cage.</p><p>Her footsteps softened as she hit thick carpet. No other sounds filled her ears. The rooms in the main house were soundproof, so she assumed they\u2019d gone in the side door and were walking down one of the hallways. At least they hadn\u2019t walked her through the lobby.</p><p>But the quiet solitude was short-lived. They tucked her into the elevator and when the doors dinged and opened again, Evan\u2019s ears perked at the gentle murmur of voices in the distance. Good Lord, how she must look\u2014naked, masked, and in heels. Not to mention escorted by two gorgeous men in cop uniforms.</p><p>\u201cMmm, bella,\u201d Andre breathed against her ear. \u201cWhen you blush it\u2019s not only your cheeks that get pink. So sexy.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed a nipple and the ebb in heat that her rush of anxiety had caused quickly fired up anew. How could she be so turned on yet so fucking terrified at the same time?</p><p>The voices shifted, now both in front and behind, people milling around her in a busy room. Oh, God. Her muscles threatened to lock in place and fasten her to the floor even while the familiar kernel of desire sizzled within her. \u201cWait. I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d</p><p>Evan halted in Jace\u2019s grip, her muscles stiffening beneath his fingertips. He frowned and glanced at Andre, whose expression mirrored his. They\u2019d anticipated this. But after Evan had done such a good job in the scene so far, Jace had thought maybe she\u2019d already arrived at the place they needed her to be\u2014that zone of absolute trust. But obviously they hadn\u2019t won her full heart and submission quite yet. And if the end of the plan was going to come to fruition, then this piece was non-negotiable.</p><p>Jace scanned the large open room that made up the top floor of The Ranch\u2019s main building. The center of the space was filled with couches for lounging and watching the antics, while the perimeter was set up with every kind of BDSM equipment you could imagine. A few scenes were taking place behind the slim red ropes that cordoned off each area, and two people with yellow T-shirts\u2014The Ranch\u2019s safety monitors\u2014were walking the floor.</p><p>Heads had lifted when he, Andre, and Evan had stepped off the elevator. The sight of a beautiful submissive stripped and cuffed between two doms dressed as cops was not something most people saw every day. Even at The Ranch.</p><p>Electricity had wicked through Jace\u2019s veins at the attention. He\u2019d break off someone\u2019s hand if anyone but Andre touched Evan, but he couldn\u2019t deny that exposing her this way didn\u2019t make his cock press even harder against the fly of his pants. He\u2019d never seen a woman look so stunning in her submission. And she was theirs. She loved them back.</p><p>But now she just had to know what it meant to trust them.</p><p>They had only planned to walk her through the main room to give her a sense of exposure before going into a private area, but now she\u2019d earned herself a tougher punishment. Jace tightened his grip on her arm. \u201cStep to the right and get on your knees, sub. You\u2019re blocking the walkway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace, I can\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>Andre smacked her bare ass. \u201cMove it. And it\u2019s \u2018sir.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jace held his breath. Evan\u2019s whole body remained taut and, though he couldn\u2019t see her face, he saw her wet her lips, part them. Fuck, she\u2019s going to safe word. They\u2019d read her signals wrong and pushed her too far too fast.</p><p>But then the stiffness went pliable beneath his fingertips, and she stepped to the side, her head dipping in deference. She lowered to her knees. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>Her voice quavered, but her nipples had gone hard and dusky pink, and the illicit scent of her arousal swirled through his senses. Sweet mother of God he\u2019d missed her. He leaned against the wall behind him, overwhelmed by the sight of her, by her compliance. He ran a hand over her head, the smooth spandex material warm from her body heat, and then yanked off the mask. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful, baby. I want to look at you while you take my cock.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him, adjusting to the light, then tried to look over her shoulder to see where she was. Andre grabbed a handful of her hair from his position behind her and held her in place. \u201cWhere we are or who\u2019s watching is of no concern of yours, bella. All you need to worry about is showing Officer Austin how eager you are to suck him off.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flared. Anger laced with wicked desire.</p><p>Jace unfastened his pants and freed his straining erection, stroking it once in front of her. \u201cYou see what you did to me, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her chin and grazed her lips with the already damp tip of his cock. \u201cTake care of it.\u201d</p><p>Those soft lips of hers closed around him and he damn near lost it at the first graze of her tongue. Ah, fuck. These last few months he\u2019d craved her like a drug. Her sweet femininity, the feisty edge to her submission, those soulful eyes gazing up at him. His dreams had been haunted by her face, the memory of her never leaving his subconscious even when he tried to push her from his mind and shore up his heart again. And now she was here, at his feet, giving him the gift of her body, her trust, her everything.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he deserved such a wondrous gift, but hell if he wasn\u2019t looking forward to spending every day of the rest of his life doing his best to be worthy of her.</p><p>Her mouth slid down his shaft and she took him deep, sending currents of pleasure-laced lightning through his cock and up his spine. His balls tightened, and he sagged against the wall with a moan, letting Andre guide Evan\u2019s head back and forth over him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His gaze tracked up to Andre and Andre smiled, the heat in his eyes enough to scorch the wood floors beneath them. \u201cYou two are a sight to behold.\u201d</p><p>Jace reached out and slid a hand around the back of Andre\u2019s neck, pulling him closer. \u201cNo, the three of us are.\u201d</p> <p>Andre took Jace\u2019s mouth in a hard kiss, one that spoke to how much Andre was fighting to keep his own control. Evan hummed against Jace\u2019s cock, no doubt catching sight of he and Andre kissing above her. A little knot of anxiety ran through Jace. What if Evan didn\u2019t like the change in dynamic that had happened between him and Andre while she\u2019d been away?</p><p>Shit. Evan had just left a relationship where she was the third wheel with two men. How had Jace not thought to warn her before they went into this scene? Stupid. He couldn\u2019t bear to have her think she was anything but the center of their universe.</p><p>Jace pulled away from the kiss. The panic on his face must\u2019ve been evident because Andre\u2019s eyes widened, no doubt having his own doh! moment.</p><p>Jace eased back from Evan, tucked himself back into his pants as best he could, and then knelt to take her face in his hands. He didn\u2019t want to break scene and screw with the fantasy they were trying to give her, but he had to make sure she was okay. \u201cBaby\u2014\u201d</p><p>She smiled, tears glimmering in the low lighting of the room. \u201cYou guys are so goddamned beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and Andre squatted down next to them. \u201cBut you\u2019re our focus, bella. This doesn\u2019t change how we both feel about you.\u201d</p><p>She looked between the two of them. \u201cI don\u2019t always need to be the center. Believe me, I\u2019m not that selfish. I\u2019m just seriously disappointed I haven\u2019t been here to watch y\u2019all figure each other out.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s lips curled. \u201cDirty, dirty girl. We promise you\u2019ll get to see anything you want. And know that we want and need you. Neither of us has felt whole since you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s felt right without you, gorgeous,\u201d Andre said, brushing his knuckles over her cheek.</p><p>She nuzzled against Andre\u2019s hand. \u201cI know the feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you wait so long to come back to us, Ev?\u201d Jace asked, his voice cracking a bit under the memory on those long months without her.</p> <p>She bit her lip, looked up at him with her old soul eyes. \u201cI had to make sure I was strong enough. That I was whole all on my own. To know that I wouldn\u2019t fall apart again if one day you guys decided to leave.\u201d</p><p>Her words tore straight through Jace\u2019s gut and prodded his dominant core with a red-hot poker. He pinched her chin between his fingers, his demeanor shifting from soft to steel in half a second. \u201cSeems we haven\u2019t quite gotten our lesson through that head of yours yet. Andre, get her up.\u201d</p><p>Before they walked off these grounds, Evan was going to understand that they weren\u2019t going anywhere, that she could trust them.</p><p>If he had to turn her hide red and flog his way through that last wall of hers, then so be it.</p><p>THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>Evan yelped as Andre hauled her to her feet then draped her over his shoulder like some caveman claiming his kill for the evening. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what she\u2019d done to piss the two of them off, but she had a feeling they were going to make it abundantly clear before they were done with her.</p><p>Those in the room who weren\u2019t mid-scene turned to stare at the spectacle they were creating. She pressed her face into Andre\u2019s back, her cheeks hot. She couldn\u2019t tell if she was ashamed about being carried naked through a crowded room or the fact that everyone knew she\u2019d somehow displeased her doms. She suspected the latter.</p><p>Jace grabbed her hair and slipped the mask back down over her face, blocking out the onlookers. \u201cYou need to focus, pet, and listen only to us. If I have to repeat myself, I\u2019m going to be very angry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, her voice jumping with Andre\u2019s brisk pace.</p><p>The air shifted and the noises of the room faded behind her. The mask was thin, only softening the sounds around her, but she still found herself straining to hear the smallest of hints as to where they were going. Muffled footsteps. Andre\u2019s heart pounding against her ear. Then a grind and a click. A heavy door being opened.</p><p>Andre pitched his weight forward, and she went careening through the air. Her cry of surprise ripped through the room, then ended in an oof! when her back hit a mattress and knocked the wind from her. The cuffs dug into her skin as she rolled to her side.</p><p>The door slammed shut and the scent of . . . vanilla filled her nostrils. Which room had they taken her to?</p><p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d Andre\u2019s tone was like flint against her nerve endings, sparking both fear of what was to come and the sharp arousal of being handled by her two men.</p><p>She scrambled to follow the instruction, intent on righting whatever she\u2019d said to upset them. After she was in position, one of them unhooked her cuffs and then planted a hand between her shoulder blades, pushing her down. \u201cForehead on the bed, ass in the air, pet.\u201d</p><p>Each took one of her already tender wrists and stretched her arms above her head. Soft leather twined around each one, securing her to the wall or headboard\u2014she couldn\u2019t tell. She instinctively yanked on the bindings, but there was only an inch or so of play. Her pulse drummed like a frenetic marching band in her ears.</p><p>\u201cWider.\u201d Jace tapped her thighs. She carefully spread her knees, making sure to maintain her balance. Leather cuffs wrapped around her ankles and metal jangled. \u201cGood girl. That\u2019s a spreader bar. Now you won\u2019t be able to draw those legs together when we work you over.\u201d</p><p>Work her over? She flexed her ankles and found she couldn\u2019t close her legs or spread them further. She was at their mercy in a way she\u2019d never been before. Bound and trussed and exposed for whatever they wanted to do to her. She probably should be frightened. But those fight-or-flight signals never fired. Instead, need swept through her like a firestorm, igniting every erogenous point in her body. She pressed her forehead against the bed and rocked against the bindings, willing herself not to beg them to touch her.</p><p>Jace chuckled and walked his fingers along her spine, sending shivers over her. \u201cLook at you. You can\u2019t even sit still, can you? What\u2019s wrong, baby? Need something?\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cYou know what I want, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, what you want and what you need may be two different things right now.\u201d His fingers reached the cleft of her ass and teased around the plug, which thankfully they had turned off when they\u2019d taken her to the main room. He wiggled the vibrator and she couldn\u2019t stop a moan from escaping. \u201cI\u2019m not fucking this luscious little ass of yours until I know you\u2019re really mine.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. Did he doubt that? \u201cI am yours, sir. You and Andre\u2019s both. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His warm hand moved away from her. \u201cWe love you, too, Ev. But your trust is sorely lacking.\u201d</p><p>The sound of something slicing through the air filled her ears a millisecond before something smacked against her right ass cheek with a stinging thud. Thin stripes of pain-laced pleasure zipped up her spine. She bowed up against her bindings as a gasp wheezed out of her. Oh, my.</p><p>Whatever Jace was using came down again on the opposite cheek then again and again\u2014providing both sharp and blunt sensation simultaneously. Her breath came out in short puffs as she absorbed each impact and her clit pulsed in time with the blows.</p><p>A hand touched her head. \u201cYou like Jace\u2019s flogger, bella? He took out the braided one just for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she whispered. Jace didn\u2019t pause in his treatment.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why you\u2019re getting punished?\u201d Andre asked.</p><p>Her mind struggled to grab on to her thoughts, the blinding pain and pleasure sensations overloading her neurons. \u201cSomething about trust, sir?\u201d</p><p>Jace smacked the flogger against her exposed pussy, and she bucked against the restraints, nearly careening right into orgasm. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it does to us, pet, to hear you suspect that we might just walk away from you one day?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have to be prepared. I can\u2019t ever be weak like I was before.\u201d Her voice sounded desperate even to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cYou are not weak, Ev. Opening yourself up to us fully won\u2019t make you that way.\u201d The flogger thudded against the back of her thigh. \u201cSubmission with contingency clauses is not acceptable. We want all of you, not just your body. Your heart, Ev. Your trust.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tears building beneath her closed lids. \u201cBut what happens if I do that and you walk away?\u201d If her life had proven anything to her it was that everyone leaves eventually.</p><p>The flogger tumbled against the wood floor. \u201cTake off her mask, Dre.\u201d</p><p>The blackness gave way to the flickering warmth of candlelight when Andre pulled the material off. She turned her head, resting her cheek on the bed, tears leaking down. Both Jace and Andre kneeled next to the bed.</p><p>Andre reached out and swiped the moisture from under her eyes. \u201cSweet, sweet, bella. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d</p><p>More tears escaped. \u201cGet what?\u201d</p><p>Jace sifted his fingers through her hair, the tender look in his eyes undoing her. \u201cListen to me, Evan. If you don\u2019t hear anything else I say to you tonight. Hear this: When we say we want you, that we love you. We don\u2019t mean for this week or this month or until something else comes along.\u201d</p><p>A fist seemed to close around her vocal cords. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo more buts, remember? We\u2019re not going anywhere unless you send us away yourself.\u201d He brushed a thumb over her forehead, smoothing the creases. \u201cI can\u2019t promise that this is going to be easy. But I will promise that I\u2019m not going to give up on you if things get tough. This isn\u2019t foster care, Ev. I love you. We love you. We want to be your forever.\u201d</p><p>The knot in her throat seemed to swell until she thought she may stop breathing. A forever family. That\u2019s what the caseworkers used to call it when kids were adopted. When you were special enough that people wanted you for real, not just for a while. No one had ever wanted that of her.</p><p>And now these two beautiful, kindhearted men were looking at her like no other woman existed on the planet. No fine print or contingency clauses. Just love. Pure unadulterated love.</p><p>She blinked away the tears and took a deep breath, swallowing past the emotion knotting her vocal cords. \u201cI want that, too. So much.\u201d</p><p>Andre smiled, his own eyes glinting with moisture. \u201cCan you take the leap, bella? Have faith in us and give us your whole heart?\u201d</p><p>Leap? She\u2019s already plummeted off the mountain. Her heart was theirs now . . . and always. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ev,\u201d Jace said, his whole demeanor sighing. \u201cNow let\u2019s get you out of these bindings. You\u2019ve had enough punishment. Now I just need to love you.\u201d</p><p>Andre and Jace made quick work of releasing her and both stripped out of their clothes. When they flipped her over onto her back, she was able to take in the whole room. White candles lit every corner of the cozy bedroom and rose petals had been strewn over the floor and bed. She smiled. \u201cRose petals and candles? Who knew you boys were the romantic type?\u201d</p><p>Andre climbed on the bed behind her, and Jace got in front of her wearing a wicked grin. \u201cLie back on Andre, pet. I\u2019ll show you how romantic we can be.\u201d</p><p>Jace positioned himself between her thighs and bent down to taste her with a long, languid glide of his tongue, while Andre kissed along her shoulder. Oh, sweet Lord. She murmured her satisfaction\u2014the unending assault on her senses shutting down her capacity for speech. She\u2019d been revved up and brought down so many times, her body was like a land mine\u2014one perfect move and she\u2019d detonate.</p><p>Jace swirled his tongue around her clit and nipped at the swollen nub. She whimpered and writhed. Andre held her in place. \u201cYour orgasm is ours, bella. No coming until we tell you. Close your eyes and relax.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Relax? That was like telling the ocean to stop moving. She let her eyelids fall shut and clenched her fists, forcing the threatening tsunami back, fighting to keep it in check.</p><p>Jace\u2019s mouth continued its erotic assault, and he slid two fingers inside her. Her cunt clenched around him, begging for more, for all of him to be inside her. He adjusted the pressure along her inner wall, teasing the sensitive spot inside.</p> <p>Her head tilted back as the rush of sensation thundered through her. Fuck. There was no way she was going to be able to hold on and\u2014</p><p>Searing heat spilled across her chest and nipples, cutting off her thoughts and nearly launching her off the bed. What the . . . Ohhhhhh, God! The initial burn of pain morphed into an intense, overwhelming surge of pleasure. The smell of vanilla wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cCandles are for more than romance,\u201d Andre whispered, drizzling more wax down the line of her belly. She cried out and Jace held her fast against his mouth, the strokes increasing in intensity. \u201cCome for us, bella.\u201d</p><p>The fiery wax splashed right along her navel, pooling in her belly button and running lower, and Jace sucked her clit between his teeth. A scream that didn\u2019t even sound like her own tore from her lungs, and she arched toward the ceiling, feeling as if she might levitate right off the goddamned bed.</p><p>Sharp, vibrating bliss fanned out through every cell, launching her up and over any place she\u2019d been before. Her body rocked with the waves of it, the combination of orgasm-soaked sensation wrapping around her and holding her tight in its grasp. She didn\u2019t want it to release her.</p> <p>But before she\u2019d even had a chance to catch her breath, the boys were turning her over, hardened wax tightening her skin and flaking off her at every move. Andre slid beneath her, moving her boneless legs to straddle him, and Jace ran his hands over her quivering shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us has been with anyone else besides you or each other since we\u2019ve last been tested,\u201d Jace said in her ear. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re going to take you barebacked. Both of us. You understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the implication cutting through the afterglow of orgasm and firing up her desire anew. Both of them. They hadn\u2019t tried before to take her simultaneously. Had told her they wouldn\u2019t do that until they decided she was ready. A zip of fear and drenching need went through her.</p><p>Andre smiled up at her, his gaze enough to liquefy the wax still clinging to her nipples. He fisted his beautifully stiff cock and ran a thumb over the dampened tip. \u201cCome \u2019ere, bella. That orgasm was just a warm-up.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cYou two may kill me with the next one then.\u201d</p><p>His large hands palmed her hips, drawing her over his cock. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take good care of you. Promise.\u201d He lowered her down to him, inch by delicious inch, sliding into the hot clasp of her core. Skin to skin. \u201cOh, bella.\u201d</p><p>Ribbons of sweet awareness snaked through her, the snug fit of him inside her stretching her and tightening the plug in her backside. She splayed her hands over Andre\u2019s chest to balance as he guided her up and down. The full feeling pushed all her naughty buttons, but how the hell was she going to handle both of them at once? She hadn\u2019t seen the plug, but she\u2019d guess Jace had to be twice the size.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes on me,\u201d Andre said, slowly rocking into her. \u201cTrust that we\u2019re here to make you feel good, not hurt you. Let go for us.\u201d</p><p>He stroked a thumb over her engorged clit as he pumped into her, dragging her back into her senses and away from any worries. She was theirs. They loved her. They wouldn\u2019t harm her. This was her always.</p><p>She tossed her mental parachute from her back, closed her eyes, and gave into the free fall, knowing the two of them would be there to catch her.</p><p>Heat blanketed her back as Jace pressed his chest against her. He stroked her hair, kissed the rim of her ear, nibbled her neck. \u201cYou look so beautiful right now. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re finally mine.\u201d</p><p>She reached back and circled her arm around the nape of his neck, sliding her nails through his hair, relishing the feel of him, the scent. He\u2019d always had on her on some level. She\u2019d known it since the first time he\u2019d ever touched her. That piece of her heart had never returned. But now she knew what it really felt like to surrender it all. Without fear.</p> <p>\u201cLean forward, pet,\u201d Jace whispered. \u201cI need to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>She followed his directive, bracing her elbows on each side of Andre. Andre stilled his hip motion and lifted his head to catch her lips in a long, sensual kiss. His finger continued to stroke along her slick folds, grazing her clit each time, tightening the coil of need low in her belly again.</p><p>Jace\u2019s palm pressed against the base of her spine and she felt the wiggle of the plug. She sucked in a breath and in one quick second, Jace had slid it out of her. She whimpered into Andre\u2019s kiss, the ripple of pleasure followed by the strange ache of emptiness it left.</p><p>Cool liquid slid along her back opening and Jace dipped his fingers inside her, spreading the lubricant. Andre increased the pace of his stroking, keeping her on the edge of orgasm, but not quite there. Making things that would probably feel uncomfortable under normal circumstances feel unbearably fantastic.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby,\u201d Jace said, his voice as smooth as glass. \u201cJust relax and let me in. Push against me.\u201d</p><p>Andre deepened their kiss, keeping her muscles like putty, and she focused on not tensing. She didn\u2019t want to undo the work the plug had probably done for her. The blunt head of Jace\u2019s cock pressed against her opening, feeling impossibly huge, but she did as she was told and pushed against him.</p><p>Oh! The ring of muscles seemed to fight against the invasion, and pain/pressure mixed in with the pleasure of Andre\u2019s continuous attention between her legs. She blew out a breath and pressed back against Jace again. The head of his cock breached the resistant ring and then slid in, her body giving up and opening to Jace.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t all the way in. Another thrust and her body seemed to stretch to capacity. Their cocks pressed against each other through the thin wall separating the spaces. Filling her. Making her gasp. They were both inside her, taking everything she had to give them.</p><p>Jace groaned, his fingers digging into her hips. \u201cYou feel so goddamned good, baby. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from Andre\u2019s kiss, her senses on overload. She couldn\u2019t move, her body pinned between the two of them. But she also couldn\u2019t stay still. The energy building inside her looking for a way out. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Andre pinched her clit and she cried out. \u201cPlease what, bella? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease move,\u201d she panted. \u201cPlease. Fuck me.\u201d</p><p>One of Jace\u2019s hands tracked up her belly, palmed her breast, caressed it. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to fuck you. Very thoroughly. But why rush?\u201d</p><p>A pitiful, unintelligible plea passed her lips. She wouldn\u2019t survive if they dragged this out. Her blood had already turned molten beneath her skin.</p><p>Andre smiled and drew his hips back, sliding along her sensitive tissues and brushing along the pressure of Jace\u2019s cock. Then, as soon as he plunged back deep, Jace eased back in a perfectly timed alternating motion. Slow and steady, the glide of the two men inside her enough to shove her to the brink of madness.</p><p>Her nails dug into the sheets. She couldn\u2019t help or control the pace no matter how much she attempted to. All she could do was take it how they wanted to give it. If they wanted to drag it out for the next hour, she was at their mercy. But God, if they did that she may never recover.</p><p>Her soft pants became moans. \u201cI can\u2019t. I need. Faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to fuck you hard, pet?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Please. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s grip on her hips turned bruising and Andre\u2019s tucked something between their bodies and against her clit. It buzzed. Holy. Fucking. Shit. Blinding darts of pleasure shot through her and she yelped. Andre\u2019s hands tangled in her hair, and the pace of the two men\u2019s thrusts turned relentless.</p><p>Her body electrified as every molecule pulsed with a sanity-threatening energy. The sounds bursting from her no longer felt as if they were a part of her. The boys pistoned into her, their own male grunts and groans mixing into the soundtrack of skin smacking skin and unadulterated sex.</p><p>Sweat dripped from her as she fought to stave off her orgasm, but it was like trying to fend off a pack of lions with a twig. The sensation of being taken so fully\u2014two cocks, Jace\u2019s and Andre\u2019s hard bodies surrounding her\u2014and the insistent hum of the vibrator against her clit all coalesced into a volcanic mass inside her.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, bella,\u201d Andre said, his own voice strained. \u201cGo over with us.\u201d</p><p>The words blew the top off her mountain. Her back bowed and a guttural scream raked over her throat and exploded out of her. Pleasure, edgy and intense and absolutely maddening, lifted her to some other plane where nothing else existed but the three of them. The screams went on loud and long as she came so hard her bones seemed to rattle with the power of it.</p><p>Andre\u2019s own moan filled her ears, quickly followed by Jace\u2019s as both men chased her orgasm with their own release. They pulsed into her, their sweet fluid heat filling her while she continued to ride a wave of ecstasy that seemed to only increase with each passing second.</p><p>Every system in her body seemed taken hostage as her orgasm refused to relent. Tears sprung forth and though she was anything but sad, she began to cry. Her chest racking with the overwhelming need to literally let everything out.</p><p>Vaguely she registered Jace slipping out of her, and she collapsed against Andre\u2019s chest. Andre wrapped his arms around her and whispered soothing things to her as her body finally began to ease down from its high. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, bella. Breathe. You\u2019re okay. We have you.\u201d</p><p>Jace was back in a matter of moments, and Andre rolled her to his side, sliding out of her while Jace climbed into bed and tucked her against his chest. Andre flanked her back. Hands brushed away her hair, wiped her tears, caressed her face.</p><p>After a few minutes, her sobs quieted and her head stopped spinning. She nuzzled against Jace, sniffling. \u201cWhy is it I can\u2019t help going into the ugly cry when you guys get a hold of me?\u201d</p><p>She could feel Jace smile even though she couldn\u2019t see his face. \u201cYou and I have very different ideas of what\u2019s ugly.\u201d</p><p>Andre ran a hand along her hip. \u201cDid we hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was . . . amazing,\u201d she said, trying to put it into words. \u201cIt was like there was too much energy and my body had to release it however it could, which apparently meant weeping. I\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t mean to ruin the moment or freak you out.\u201d</p><p>Andre\u2019s chest huffed against her back with a soft chuckle. \u201cRuin it? That was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. You were flying, bella. And we were right there with you.\u201d</p><p>A smile lifted her lips as she snuggled against them, arms wrapping around her from both sides. Safe. Content. Loved.</p><p>She\u2019d gone flying.</p><p>And they\u2019d caught her.</p><p>They would always catch her. </p> </body></html>"]
