Maybe it\u2019s snowing, maybe it\u2019s raining, I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s freezing it\u2019s hailing it\u2019s a hurricane slip slipping into a tornado and the earth is quaking apart to make room for our mistakes.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have any idea.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a window anymore. I don\u2019t have a view. It\u2019s a million degrees below zero in my blood and I\u2019m buried 50 feet underground in a training room that\u2019s become my second home lately. Every day I stare at these 4 walls and remind myself I\u2019m not a prisoner I\u2019m not a prisoner I\u2019m not a prisoner but sometimes the old fears streak across my skin and I can\u2019t seem to break free of the claustrophobia clutching at my throat.</p><p>I made so many promises when I arrived here.</p><p>Now I\u2019m not so sure. Now I\u2019m worried. Now my mind is a traitor because my thoughts crawl out of bed every morning with darting eyes and sweating palms and nervous giggles that sit in my chest, build in my chest, threaten to burst through my chest, and the pressure is tightening and tightening and tightening</p> <p>Life around here isn\u2019t what I expected it to be.</p><p>My new world is etched in gunmetal, sealed in silver, drowning in the scents of stone and steel. The air is icy, the mats are orange; the lights and switches beep and flicker, electronic and electric, neon bright. It\u2019s busy here, busy with bodies, busy with halls stuffed full of whispers and shouts, pounding feet and thoughtful footsteps. If I listen closely I can hear the sounds of brains working and foreheads pinching and fingers tap tapping at chins and lips and furrowed brows. Ideas are carried in pockets, thoughts propped up on the tips of every tongue; eyes are narrowed in concentration, in careful planning I should want to know about.</p><p>But nothing is working and all my parts are broken.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to harness my Energy, Castle said. Our gifts are different forms of Energy. Matter is never created or destroyed, he said to me, and as our world changed, so did the Energy within it. Our abilities are taken from the universe, from other matter, from other Energies. We are not anomalies. We are inevitabilities of the perverse manipulations of our Earth. Our Energy came from somewhere, he said. And somewhere is in the chaos all around us.</p><p>It makes sense. I remember what the world looked like when I left it.</p><p>I remember the pissed-off skies and the sequence of sunsets collapsing beneath the moon. I remember the cracked earth and the scratchy bushes and the used-to-be-greens that are now too close to brown. I think about the water we can\u2019t drink and the birds that don\u2019t fly and how human civilization has been reduced to nothing but a series of compounds stretched out over what\u2019s left of our ravaged land.</p> <p>This planet is a broken bone that didn\u2019t set right, a hundred pieces of crystal glued together. We\u2019ve been shattered and reconstructed, told to make an effort every single day to pretend we still function the way we\u2019re supposed to. But it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s all a lie.</p><p>I do not function properly.</p><p>I am nothing more than the consequence of catastrophe.</p><p>2 weeks have collapsed at the side of the road, abandoned, already forgotten. 2 weeks I\u2019ve been here and in 2 weeks I\u2019ve taken up residence on a bed of eggshells, wondering when something is going to break, when I\u2019ll be the first to break it, wondering when everything is going to fall apart. In 2 weeks I should\u2019ve been happier, healthier, sleeping better, more soundly in this safe space. Instead I worry about what will happen when if I can\u2019t get this right, if I don\u2019t figure out how to train properly, if I hurt someone on purpose by accident.</p><p>We\u2019re preparing for a bloody war.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m training. We\u2019re all trying to prepare ourselves to take down Warner and his men. To win one battle at a time. To show the citizens of our world that there is hope yet\u2014that they do not have to acquiesce to the demands of The Reestablishment and become slaves to a regime that wants nothing more than to exploit them for power. And I agreed to fight. To be a warrior. To use my power against my better judgment. But the thought of laying a hand on someone brings back a world of memories, feelings, a flush of power I experience only when I make contact with skin not immune to my own. It\u2019s a rush of invincibility; a tormented kind of euphoria; a wave of intensity flooding every pore in my body. I don\u2019t know what it will do to me. I don\u2019t know if I can trust myself to take pleasure in someone else\u2019s pain.</p><p>All I know is that Warner\u2019s last words are caught in my chest and I can\u2019t cough out the cold or the truth hacking at the back of my throat.</p><p>Adam has no idea that Warner can touch me.</p> <p>No one does.</p><p>Warner was supposed to be dead. Warner was supposed to be dead because I was supposed to have shot him but no one supposed I\u2019d need to know how to fire a gun so now I suppose he\u2019s come to find me.</p><p>He\u2019s come to fight.</p><p>For me.</p><p>TWO</p><p>A sharp knock and the door flies open.</p><p>\u201cAh, Ms. Ferrars. I don\u2019t know what you hope to accomplish by sitting in the corner.\u201d Castle\u2019s easy grin dances into the room before he does.</p><p>I take a tight breath and try to make myself look at Castle but I can\u2019t. Instead I whisper an apology and listen to the sorry sound my words make in this large room. I feel my shaking fingers clench against the thick, padded mats spread out across the floor and think about how I\u2019ve accomplished nothing since I\u2019ve been here. It\u2019s humiliating, so humiliating to disappoint one of the only people who\u2019s ever been kind to me.</p><p>Castle stands directly in front of me, waits until I finally look up. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize,\u201d he says. His sharp, clear brown eyes and friendly smile make it easy to forget he\u2019s the leader of Omega Point. The leader of this entire underground movement dedicated to fighting The Reestablishment. His voice is too gentle, too kind, and it\u2019s almost worse. Sometimes I wish he would just yell at me. \u201cBut,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou do have to learn how to harness your Energy, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>A pace.</p><p>His hands rest on the stack of bricks I was supposed to have destroyed. He pretends not to notice the red rims around my eyes or the metal pipes I threw across the room. His gaze carefully avoids the bloody smears on the wooden planks set off to the side; his questions don\u2019t ask me why my fists are clenched so tight and whether or not I\u2019ve injured myself again. He cocks his head in my direction but he\u2019s staring at a spot directly behind me and his voice is soft when he speaks. \u201cI know this is difficult for you,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you must learn. You have to. Your life will depend upon it.\u201d</p><p>I nod, lean back against the wall, welcome the cold and the pain of the brick digging into my spine. I pull my knees up to my chest and feel my feet press into the protective mats covering the ground. I\u2019m so close to tears I\u2019m afraid I might scream. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how,\u201d I finally say to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know any of this. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m supposed to be doing.\u201d I stare at the ceiling and blink blink blink. My eyes feel shiny, damp. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to think,\u201d Castle says, undeterred. He picks up a discarded metal pipe. Weighs it in his hands. \u201cYou have to find links between the events that transpired. When you broke through the concrete in Warner\u2019s torture chamber\u2014when you punched through the steel door to save Mr. Kent\u2014what happened? Why in those two instances were you able to react in such an extraordinary way?\u201d He sits down some feet away from me. Pushes the pipe in my direction. \u201cI need you to analyze your abilities, Ms. Ferrars. You have to focus.\u201d</p><p>Focus.</p><p>It\u2019s one word but it\u2019s enough, it\u2019s all it takes to make me feel sick. Everyone, it seems, needs me to focus. First Warner needed me to focus, and now Castle needs me to focus.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been able to follow through.</p><p>Castle\u2019s deep, sad sigh brings me back to the present. He gets to his feet. He smooths out the only navy-blue blazer he seems to own and I catch a glimpse of the silver Omega symbol embroidered into the back. An absent hand touches the end of his ponytail; he always ties his dreads in a clean knot at the base of his neck. \u201cYou are resisting yourself,\u201d he says, though he says it gently. \u201cMaybe you should work with someone else for a change. Maybe a partner will help you work things out\u2014to discover the connection between these two events.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders stiffen, surprised. \u201cI thought you said I had to work alone.\u201d</p><p>He squints past me. Scratches a spot beneath his ear, shoves his other hand into a pocket. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually want you to work alone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut no one volunteered for the task.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I suck in my breath, why I\u2019m so surprised. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Not everyone is Adam.</p><p>Not everyone is safe from me the way he is. No one but Adam has ever touched me and enjoyed it. No one except for Warner. But despite Adam\u2019s best intentions, he can\u2019t train with me. He\u2019s busy with other things.</p><p>Things no one wants to tell me about.</p><p>But Castle is staring at me with hopeful eyes, generous eyes, eyes that have no idea that these new words he\u2019s offered me are so much worse. Worse because as much as I know the truth, it still hurts to hear it. It hurts to remember that though I might live in a warm bubble with Adam, the rest of the world still sees me as a threat. A monster. An abomination.</p><p>Warner was right. No matter where I go, I can\u2019t seem to run from this.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d I ask him. \u201cWho\u2019s willing to train me now?\u201d I pause. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Castle smiles.</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of smile that flushes humiliated heat up my neck and spears my pride right through the vertebrae. I have to resist the urge to bolt out the door.</p><p>Please please please do not pity me, is what I want to say.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had the time,\u201d Castle says to me. \u201cBut Kenji is finally free\u2014we were able to reorganize his schedule\u2014and he said he\u2019d be happy to work with you.\u201d A moment of hesitation. \u201cThat is, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>Kenji.</p><p>I want to laugh out loud. Kenji would be the only one willing to risk working with me. I injured him once. By accident. But he and I haven\u2019t spent much time together since he first led our expedition into Omega Point. It was like he was just doing a task, fulfilling a mission; once complete, he went back to his own life. Apparently Kenji is important around here. He has a million things to do. Things to regulate. People seem to like him, respect him, even.</p><p>I wonder if they\u2019ve ever known him as the obnoxious, foul-mouthed Kenji I first met.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I tell Castle, attempting a pleasant expression for the first time since he arrived. \u201cThat sounds great.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Castle stands up. His eyes are bright, eager, easily pleased. \u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll have him meet you at breakfast tomorrow. You can eat together and go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh but I usually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Castle cuts me off. His smile is pressed into a thin line now, his forehead creased with concern. \u201cYou like to eat your meals with Mr. Kent. I know this. But you\u2019ve hardly spent any time with the others, Ms. Ferrars, and if you\u2019re going to be here, you need to start trusting us. The people of Omega Point feel close to Kenji. He can vouch for you. If everyone sees you spending time together, they\u2019ll feel less intimidated by your presence. It will help you adjust.\u201d</p><p>Heat like hot oil spatters across my face; I flinch, feel my fingers twitch, try to find a place to look, try to pretend I can\u2019t feel the pain caught in my chest. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re afraid of me,\u201d I tell him, I whisper, I trail off. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t want to bother anyone. I didn\u2019t want to get in their way....\u201d</p> <p>Castle sighs, long and loud. He looks down and up, scratches the soft spot beneath his chin. \u201cThey\u2019re only afraid,\u201d he says finally, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t know you. If you just tried a little harder\u2014if you made even the smallest effort to get to know anyone\u2014\u201d He stops. Frowns. \u201cMs. Ferrars, you have been here two weeks and you hardly even speak to your roommates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2014I think they\u2019re great\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you ignore them? You spend no time with them? Why?\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019ve never had girl friends before. Because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll do something wrong, say something wrong and they\u2019ll end up hating me like all the other girls I\u2019ve known. And I like them too much, which will make their inevitable rejection so much harder to endure.</p><p>I say nothing.</p> <p>Castle shakes his head. \u201cYou did so well the first day you arrived. You seemed almost friendly with Brendan. I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Castle continues. \u201cI thought you would do well here.\u201d</p><p>Brendan. The thin boy with platinum-blond hair and electric currents running through his veins. I remember him. He was nice to me. \u201cI like Brendan,\u201d I tell Castle, bewildered. \u201cIs he upset with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset?\u201d Castle shakes his head, laughs out loud. He doesn\u2019t answer my question. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, Ms. Ferrars. I\u2019ve tried to be patient with you, I\u2019ve tried to give you time, but I confess I\u2019m quite perplexed. You were so different when you first arrived\u2014you were excited to be here! But it took less than a week for you to withdraw completely. You don\u2019t even look at anyone when you walk through the halls. What happened to conversation? To friendship?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>It took 1 day for me to settle in. 1 day for me to look around. 1 day for me to get excited about a different life and 1 day for everyone to find out who I am and what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>Castle doesn\u2019t say anything about the mothers who see me walking down the hall and yank their children out of my way. He doesn\u2019t mention the hostile stares and the unwelcoming words I\u2019ve endured since I\u2019ve arrived. He doesn\u2019t say anything about the kids who\u2019ve been warned to stay far, far away, and the handful of elderly people who watch me too closely. I can only imagine what they\u2019ve heard, where they got their stories from.</p> <p>Juliette.</p><p>A girl with a lethal touch that saps the strength and energy of human beings until they\u2019re limp, paralyzed carcasses wheezing on the floor. A girl who spent most of her life in hospitals and juvenile detention centers, a girl who was cast off by her own parents, labeled as certifiably insane, and sentenced to isolation in an asylum where even the rats were afraid to live.</p><p>A girl.</p><p>So power hungry that she killed a small child. She tortured a toddler. She brought a grown man gasping to his knees. She doesn\u2019t even have the decency to kill herself.</p><p>None of it is a lie.</p><p>So I look at Castle with spots of color on my cheeks and unspoken letters on my lips and eyes that refuse to reveal their secrets.</p><p>He sighs.</p><p>He almost says something. He tries to speak but his eyes inspect my face and he changes his mind. He only offers me a quick nod, a deep breath, taps his watch, says, \u201cThree hours until lights-out,\u201d and turns to go.</p> <p>Pauses in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars,\u201d he says suddenly, softly, without turning around. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen to stay with us, to fight with us, to become a member of Omega Point.\u201d A pause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need your help. And I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d</p><p>I watch him leave.</p><p>I listen to his departing footsteps and lean my head back against the wall. Close my eyes against the ceiling. Hear his voice, solemn and steady, ringing in my ears.</p><p>We\u2019re running out of time, he said.</p><p>As if time were the kind of thing you could run out of, as if it were measured into bowls that were handed to us at birth and if we ate too much or too fast or right before jumping into the water then our time would be lost, wasted, already spent.</p><p>But time is beyond our finite comprehension. It\u2019s endless, it exists outside of us; we cannot run out of it or lose track of it or find a way to hold on to it. Time goes on even when we do not.</p><p>We have plenty of time, is what Castle should have said. We have all the time in the world, is what he should have said to me. But he didn\u2019t because what he meant tick tock is that our time tick tock is shifting. It\u2019s hurtling forward heading in an entirely new direction slamming face-first into something else and</p><p>tick</p><p>tick</p><p>tick</p><p>tick</p><p>tick</p><p>it\u2019s almost</p><p>time for war.</p><p>THREE</p><p>I could touch him from here.</p><p>His eyes, dark blue. His hair, dark brown. His shirt, too tight in all the right places and his lips, his lips twitch up to flick the switch that lights the fire in my heart and I don\u2019t even have time to blink and exhale before I\u2019m caught in his arms.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d he whispers, right up against my neck.</p><p>I bite back a shiver as the blood rushes up to blush my cheeks and for a moment, just for this moment, I drop my bones and allow him to hold me together. \u201cHey.\u201d I smile, inhaling the scent of him.</p><p>Luxurious, is what this is.</p><p>We rarely ever see each other alone. Adam is staying in Kenji\u2019s room with his little brother, James, and I bunk with the healer twins. We probably have less than 20 minutes before the girls get back to this room, and I intend to make the most of this opportunity.</p><p>My eyes fall shut.</p><p>Adam\u2019s arms wrap around my waist, pulling me closer, and the pleasure is so tremendous I can hardly keep myself from shaking. It\u2019s like my skin and bones have been craving contact, warm affection, human interaction for so many years that I don\u2019t know how to pace myself. I\u2019m a starving child trying to stuff my stomach, gorging my senses on the decadence of these moments as if I\u2019ll wake up in the morning and realize I\u2019m still sweeping cinders for my stepmother.</p><p>But then Adam\u2019s lips press against my head and my worries put on a fancy dress and pretend to be something else for a while.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask, and it\u2019s so embarrassing because my words are already unsteady even though he\u2019s hardly held me but I can\u2019t make myself let go.</p><p>Laughter shakes the shape of his body, soft and rich and indulgent. But he doesn\u2019t respond to my question and I know he won\u2019t.</p><p>We\u2019ve tried so many times to sneak off together, only to be caught and chastised for our negligence. We are not allowed outside of our rooms after lights-out. Once our grace period\u2014a leniency granted on account of our very abrupt arrival\u2014ended, Adam and I had to follow the rules just like everyone else. And there are a lot of rules to follow.</p><p>These security measures\u2014cameras everywhere, around every corner, in every hallway\u2014exist to prepare us in the case of an attack. Guards patrol at night, looking for any suspicious noise, activity, or sign of a breach. Castle and his team are vigilant in protecting Omega Point, and they\u2019re unwilling to take even the slightest risks; if trespassers get too close to this hideout, someone has to do anything and everything necessary to keep them away.</p><p>Castle claims it\u2019s their very vigilance that\u2019s kept them from discovery for so long, and if I\u2019m perfectly honest, I can see his rationale in being so strict about it. But these same strict measures keep me and Adam apart. He and I never see each other except during mealtimes, when we\u2019re always surrounded by other people, and any free time I have is spent locked in a training room where I\u2019m supposed to \u201charness my Energy.\u201d Adam is just as unhappy about it as I am.</p><p>I touch his cheek.</p><p>He takes a tight breath. Turns to me. Tells me too much with his eyes, so much that I have to look away because I feel it all too acutely. My skin is hypersensitive, finally finally finally awake and thrumming with life, humming with feelings so intense it\u2019s almost indecent.</p><p>I can\u2019t even hide it.</p><p>He sees what he does to me, what happens to me when his fingers graze my skin, when his lips get too close to my face, when the heat of his body against mine forces my eyes to close and my limbs to tremble and my knees to buckle under pressure. I see what it does to him, too, to know that he has that effect on me. He tortures me sometimes, smiling as he takes too long to bridge the gap between us, reveling in the sound of my heart slamming against my chest, in the sharp breaths I fight so hard to control, in the way I swallow a hundred times just before he moves to kiss me. I can\u2019t even look at him without reliving every moment we\u2019ve had together, every memory of his lips, his touch, his scent, his skin. It\u2019s too much for me, too much, so much, so new, so many exquisite sensations I\u2019ve never known, never felt, never even had access to before.</p><p>Sometimes I\u2019m afraid it will kill me.</p><p>I break free of his arms; I\u2019m hot and cold and feeling unsteady, hoping I can get myself under control, hoping he\u2019ll forget how easily he affects me, and I know I need a moment to pull myself together. I stumble backward; I cover my face with my hands and try to think of something to say but everything is shaking and I catch him looking at me, looking like he might inhale the length of me in one breath.</p><p>No is the word I think I hear him whisper.</p><p>All I know next are his arms, the desperate edge to his voice when he says my name, and I\u2019m unraveling in his embrace, I\u2019m frayed and falling apart and I\u2019m making no effort to control the tremors in my bones and he\u2019s so hot his skin is so hot and I don\u2019t even know where I am anymore.</p><p>His right hand slides up my spine and tugs on the zipper holding my suit together until it\u2019s halfway down my back and I don\u2019t care. I have 17 years to make up for and I want to feel everything. I\u2019m not interested in waiting around and risking the who-knows and the what-ifs and the huge regrets. I want to feel all of it because what if I wake up to find this phenomenon has passed, that the expiration date has arrived, that my chance came and went and would never return. That these hands will feel this warmth never again.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>I won\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019ve pressed myself into him until I feel every contour of his frame under the thin cotton of his clothes.

He leans in and gravity moves out of his way and my feet leave the floor and I\u2019m floating, I\u2019m flying, I\u2019m anchored by nothing but this hurricane in my lungs and this heart beating a skip a skip a skip too fast.</p><p>Our lips</p><p>touch</p><p>and I know I\u2019m going to split at the seams.

I want to scream, sometimes, I want to collapse, sometimes, I want to die knowing that I\u2019ve known what it was like to live with this kiss, this heart, this soft soft explosion that makes me feel like I\u2019ve taken a sip of the sun, like I\u2019ve eaten clouds 8, 9, and 10.</p> <p>This.</p><p>This makes me ache everywhere.</p><p>He pulls away, he\u2019s breathing hard, his hands slip under the soft material of my suit and he\u2019s so hot his skin is so hot and I think I\u2019ve already said that but I can\u2019t remember and I\u2019m so distracted that when he speaks I don\u2019t quite understand.</p><p>But it\u2019s something.</p><p>Words, deep and husky in my ear but I catch little more than an unintelligible utterance, consonants and vowels and broken syllables all mixed together. His heartbeats crash through his chest and topple into mine. His fingers are tracing secret messages on my body. His hands glide down the smooth, satiny material of this suit, slipping down the insides of my thighs, around the backs of my knees and up and up and up and I wonder if it\u2019s possible to faint and still be conscious at the same time and I\u2019m betting this is what it feels like to hyper, to hyperventilate when he tugs us backward. He slams his back into the wall. Finds a firm grip on my hips. Pulls me hard against his body.</p> <p>I gasp.</p><p>His lips are on my neck. His lashes tickle the skin under my chin and he says something, something that sounds like my name and he kisses up and down my collarbone, kisses along the arc of my shoulder, and his lips, his lips and his hands and his lips are searching the curves and slopes of my body and his chest is heaving when he swears and he stops and he says God you feel so good</p><p>and my heart has flown to the moon without me.</p><p>I love it when he says that to me. I love it when he tells me that he likes the way I feel because it goes against everything I\u2019ve heard my entire life and I wish I could put his words in my pocket just to touch them once in a while and remind myself that they exist.</p><p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d</p><p>I can hardly breathe.</p> <p>I can hardly look up and look straight and see anything but the absolute perfection of this moment but none of that even matters because he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s smiling like someone\u2019s strung the stars across his lips and he\u2019s looking at me, looking at me like I\u2019m everything and I want to weep.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>And I trust him.</p><p>So I do.</p><p>My eyes fall closed and he kisses one, then the other. Then my chin, my nose, my forehead. My cheeks. Both temples.</p><p>Every</p><p>inch</p><p>of my neck</p> <p>he pulls back so quickly he bangs his head against the rough wall. A few choice words slip out before he can stop them. I\u2019m frozen, startled and suddenly scared. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I whisper, and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m whispering. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Adam fights not to grimace but he\u2019s breathing hard and looking around and stammering \u201cS-sorry\u201d as he clutches the back of his head. \u201cThat was\u2014I mean I thought\u2014\u201d He looks away. Clears his throat. \u201cI\u2014I think\u2014I thought I heard something. I thought someone was about to come inside.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Adam is not allowed to be in here.</p><p>The guys and the girls stay in different wings at Omega Point. Castle says it\u2019s mostly to make sure the girls feel safe and comfortable in their living quarters\u2014especially because we have communal bathrooms\u2014so for the most part, I don\u2019t have a problem with it. It\u2019s nice not to have to shower with old men. But it makes it hard for the two of us to find any time together\u2014and during whatever time we do manage to scrounge up, we\u2019re always hyperaware of being discovered.</p><p>Adam leans back against the wall and winces. I reach up to touch his head.</p><p>He flinches.</p><p>I freeze.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI just\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Drops his voice. His eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I brush my fingertips against his stomach. The cotton of his shirt is still warm from his body heat and I have to resist the urge to bury my face in it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou were just being careful.\u201d</p><p>He smiles a strange, sad sort of smile. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about my head.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>He opens his mouth. Closes it. Pries it open again. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I mean, this\u2014\u201d He motions between us.</p><p>He won\u2019t finish. He won\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d he says, but whispers it like he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s even saying it out loud.</p><p>I look at him. I look and blink and trip on words I can\u2019t see and can\u2019t find and can\u2019t speak.</p><p>He\u2019s shaking his head.</p><p>He grips the back of his skull, hard, and he looks embarrassed and I\u2019m struggling to understand why. Adam doesn\u2019t get embarrassed. Adam never gets embarrassed.</p><p>His voice is thick when he finally speaks. \u201cI\u2019ve waited so long to be with you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted this\u2014I\u2019ve wanted you for so long and now, after everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, what are y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t sleep and I think about you all\u2014all the time and I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stops. Presses the heels of his hands to his forehead. Squeezes his eyes shut. Turns toward the wall so I can\u2019t see his face. \u201cYou should know\u2014you have to know,\u201d he says, the words raw, seeming to drain him, \u201cthat I have never wanted anything like I\u2019ve wanted you. Nothing. Because this\u2014this\u2014I mean, God, I want you, Juliette, I want\u2014I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words falter as he turns to me, eyes too bright, emotion flushing up the planes of his face. His gaze lingers along the lines of my body, long enough to strike a match to the lighter fluid flowing in my veins.</p><p>I ignite.</p><p>I want to say something, something right and steady and reassuring. I want to tell him that I understand, that I want the same thing, that I want him, too, but the moment feels so charged and urgent that I\u2019m half convinced I\u2019m dreaming. It\u2019s like I\u2019m down to my last letters and all I have are Qs and Zs and I\u2019ve only just remembered that someone invented a dictionary when he finally rips his eyes away from me.</p><p>He swallows, hard, his eyes down. Looks away again. One of his hands is caught in his hair, the other is curled into a fist against the wall. \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he says, his voice ragged, \u201cwhat you do to me. What you make me feel. When you touch me\u2014\u201d He runs a shaky hand across his face. He almost laughs, but his breathing is heavy and uneven; he won\u2019t meet my eyes. He steps back, swears under his breath. Pumps his fist against his forehead. \u201cJesus. What the hell am I saying. Shit. Shit. I\u2019m sorry\u2014forget that\u2014forget I said anything\u2014I should go\u2014\u201d</p><p>I try to stop him, try to find my voice, try to say, It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s okay, but I\u2019m nervous now, so nervous, so confused, because none of this makes any sense. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening or why he seems so uncertain about me and us and him and me and he and I and all of those pronouns put together. I\u2019m not rejecting him. I\u2019ve never rejected him. My feelings for him have always been so clear\u2014he has no reason to feel unsure about me or around me and I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s looking at me like something is wrong\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m\u2014shit. I shouldn\u2019t have come. I should go\u2014I have to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Adam, what happened? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was a bad idea,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have even been here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not stupid\u2014it\u2019s okay\u2014everything is okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughs, loud, hollow. The echo of an uncomfortable smile lingers on his face as he stops, stares at a point directly behind my head. He says nothing for a long time, until finally he does. \u201cWell,\u201d he says. He tries to sound upbeat. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Castle thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathe, caught off guard. I know we\u2019re not talking about our relationship anymore.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His hands are in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Adam nods. Shrugs. Looks at me and looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the testing\u2014it\u2019s\u2014I mean\u201d\u2014I can\u2019t stop shaking my head\u2014\u201chas he found something?\u201d</p><p>Adam won\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I say, and I whisper it like if I whisper, it\u2019ll somehow make this easier. \u201cSo it\u2019s true? Castle\u2019s right?\u201d My voice is inching higher and my muscles are beginning to tighten and I don\u2019t know why this feels like fear, this feeling slithering up my back. I shouldn\u2019t be afraid if Adam has a gift like I do; I should\u2019ve known it couldn\u2019t have been that easy, that it couldn\u2019t have been so simple. This was Castle\u2019s theory all along\u2014that Adam can touch me because he too has some kind of Energy that allows it. Castle never thought Adam\u2019s immunity from my ability was a happy coincidence. He thought it had to be bigger than that, more scientific than that, more specific than that. I always wanted to believe I just got lucky.</p><p>And Adam wanted to know. He was excited about finding out, actually.</p><p>But once he started testing with Castle, Adam stopped wanting to talk about it. He\u2019s never given me more than the barest status updates. The excitement of the experience faded far too fast for him.</p><p>Something is wrong.</p><p>Something is wrong.</p><p>Of course it is.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything conclusive,\u201d Adam tells me, but I can see he\u2019s holding back. \u201cI have to do a couple more sessions\u2014Castle says there are a few more things he needs to ... examine.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t miss the mechanical way Adam is delivering this information. Something isn\u2019t right and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t notice the signs until just now. I haven\u2019t wanted to, I realize. I haven\u2019t wanted to admit to myself that Adam looks more exhausted, more strained, more tightly wound than I\u2019ve ever seen him. Anxiety has built a home on his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d His words aren\u2019t harsh, but there\u2019s an undercurrent of urgency in his tone I can\u2019t ignore, and he pulls me into his arms before I find a chance to speak. His fingers work to zip up my suit. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says. \u201cReally. I just want to know you\u2019re okay. If you\u2019re all right here, then I am too. Everything is fine.\u201d His breath catches. \u201cOkay? Everything is going to be fine.\u201d The shaky smile on his face is making my pulse forget it has a job to do.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It takes me a moment to find my voice. \u201cOkay sure but\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opens and Sonya and Sara are halfway into the room before they freeze, eyes fixed on our bodies wound together.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Sara says.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d Sonya looks down.</p><p>Adam swears under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWe can come back later\u2014,\u201d the twins say together.</p><p>They\u2019re headed out the door when I stop them. I won\u2019t kick them out of their own room.</p> <p>I ask them not to leave.</p><p>They ask me if I\u2019m sure.</p><p>I take one look at Adam\u2019s face and know I\u2019m going to regret forfeiting even a minute of our time together, but I also know I can\u2019t take advantage of my roommates. This is their personal space, and it\u2019s almost time for lights-out. They can\u2019t be wandering the corridors.</p><p>Adam isn\u2019t looking at me anymore, but he\u2019s not letting go, either. I lean forward and leave a light kiss on his heart. He finally meets my eyes. Offers me a small, pained smile.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I tell him, quietly, so only he can hear me.</p><p>He exhales a short, uneven breath. Whispers, \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d and pulls himself away. Pivots on one heel. Heads out the door.</p> <p>My heart is beating in my throat.</p><p>The girls are staring at me. Concerned.</p><p>Sonya is about to speak, but then</p><p>a switch</p><p>a click</p><p>a flicker</p><p>and the lights are out.</p><p>FOUR</p> <p>The dreams are back.</p><p>They\u2019d left me for a while, shortly after I\u2019d been freshly imprisoned on base with Warner. I thought I\u2019d lost the bird, the white bird, the bird with streaks of gold like a crown atop its head. It used to meet me in my dreams, flying strong and smooth, sailing over the world like it knew better, like it had secrets we\u2019d never suspect, like it was leading me somewhere safe. It was my one piece of hope in the bitter darkness of the asylum, just until I met its twin tattooed on Adam\u2019s chest.</p><p>It was like it flew right out of my dreams only to rest atop his heart. I thought it was a signal, a message telling me I was finally safe. That I\u2019d flown away and finally found peace, sanctuary.</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect to see the bird again.</p><p>But now it\u2019s back and looks exactly the same. It\u2019s the same white bird in the same blue sky with the same yellow crown. Only this time, it\u2019s frozen. Flapping its wings in place like it\u2019s been caught in an invisible cage, like it\u2019s destined to repeat the same motion forever. The bird seems to be flying: it\u2019s in the air; its wings work. It looks as if it\u2019s free to soar through the skies. But it\u2019s stuck.</p><p>Unable to fly upward.</p><p>Unable to fall.</p><p>I\u2019ve had the same dream every night for the past week, and all 7 mornings I\u2019ve woken up shaking, shuddering into the earthy, icy air, struggling to steady the bleating in my chest.</p><p>Struggling to understand what this means.</p><p>I crawl out of bed and slip into the same suit I wear every day; the only article of clothing I own anymore. It\u2019s the richest shade of purple, so plum it\u2019s almost black. It has a slight sheen, a bit of a shimmer in the light. It\u2019s one piece from neck to wrists to ankles and it\u2019s skintight without being tight at all.</p><p>I move like a gymnast in this outfit.</p><p>I have springy leather ankle boots that mold to the shape of my feet and render me soundless as I pad across the floor. I have black leather gloves that prevent me from touching something I\u2019m not supposed to. Sonya and Sara lent me one of their hair ties and for the first time in years I\u2019ve been able to pull my hair out of my face. I wear it in a high ponytail and I\u2019ve learned to zip myself up without help from anyone. This suit makes me feel extraordinary. It makes me feel invincible.</p><p>It was a gift from Castle.</p><p>He had it custom-made for me before I arrived at Omega Point. He thought I might like to finally have an outfit that would protect me from myself and others while simultaneously offering me the option of hurting others. If I wanted to. Or needed to. The suit is made of some kind of special material that\u2019s supposed to keep me cool in the heat and keep me warm in the cold. So far it\u2019s been perfect.</p><p>So far so far so far</p><p>I head to breakfast by myself.</p><p>Sonya and Sara are always gone by the time I\u2019m awake. Their work in the medical wing is never-ending\u2014not only are they able to heal the wounded but they also spend their days trying to create antidotes and ointments. The one time we ever had a conversation, Sonya explained to me how some Energies can be depleted if we exert ourselves too much\u2014how we can exhaust our bodies enough that they\u2019ll just break down. The girls say that they want to be able to create medicines to use in the case of multiple injuries they can\u2019t heal all at once. They are, after all, only 2 people. And war seems imminent.</p><p>Heads still spin in my direction when I walk into the dining hall.</p><p>I am a spectacle, an anomaly even among the anomalies. I should be used to it by now, after all these years. I should be tougher, jaded, indifferent to the opinions of others.</p><p>I should be a lot of things.</p><p>I clear my eyes and keep my hands to my sides and pretend I\u2019m unable to make eye contact with anything but that spot, that little mark on the wall 50 feet from where I\u2019m standing.</p><p>I pretend I\u2019m just a number.</p><p>No emotions on my face. Lips perfectly still. Back straight, hands unclenched. I am a robot, a ghost slipping through the crowds.</p><p>6 steps forward. 15 tables to pass. 42 43 44 seconds and counting.</p><p>I am scared</p><p>I am scared</p><p>I am scared</p><p>I am strong.</p><p>Food is served at only 3 times throughout the day: breakfast from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m., lunch from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., and dinner from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. Dinner is an hour longer because it\u2019s at the end of the day; it\u2019s like our reward for working hard. But mealtimes aren\u2019t a fancy, luxurious event\u2014the experience is very different from dining with Warner. Here we just stand in a long line, pick up our prefilled bowls, and head toward the eating area\u2014which is nothing more than a series of rectangular tables arranged in parallel lines across the room. Nothing superfluous so nothing is wasted.</p><p>I spot Adam standing in line and head in his direction.</p><p>68 69 70 seconds and counting.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous.\u201d Something lumpy hits me in the back. Falls to the floor. I turn around, my face flexing the 43 muscles required to frown before I see him.</p><p>Kenji.</p><p>Big, easy smile. Eyes the color of onyx. Hair even darker, sharper, stick-straight and slipping into his eyes. His jaw is twitching and his lips are twitching and the impressive lines of his cheekbones are appled up into a smile struggling to stay suppressed. He\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019ve been walking around with toilet paper in my hair and I can\u2019t help but wonder why I haven\u2019t spent time with him since we got here. He did, on a purely technical level, save my life. And Adam\u2019s life. James\u2019, too.</p><p>Kenji bends down to pick up what looks like a wadded ball of socks. He weighs them in his hand like he\u2019s considering throwing them at me again. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he says. \u201cI thought you were supposed to meet me here? Castle said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring a pair of socks in here?\u201d I cut him off. \u201cPeople are trying to eat.\u201d</p><p>He freezes for only a split second before he rolls his eyes. Pulls up beside me. Tugs on my ponytail. \u201cI was running late to meet you, your highness. I didn\u2019t have time to put my socks on.\u201d He gestures to the socks in his hand and the boots on his feet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you have a really strange way of telling me you\u2019re attracted to me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, try to bite back my amusement. Kenji is a walking paradox of Unflinchingly Serious Person and 12-Year-Old Boy Going Through Puberty all rolled into one. But I\u2019d forgotten how much easier it is to breathe around him; it seems natural to laugh when he\u2019s near. So I keep walking and I\u2019m careful not to say a word, but a smile is still tugging at my lips as I grab a tray and head into the heart of the kitchen.</p><p>Kenji is half a step behind me. \u201cSo. We\u2019re working together today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2014you just walk right past me? Don\u2019t even say hello?\u201d He clutches the socks to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m crushed. I saved us a table and everything.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him. Keep walking.</p><p>He catches up. \u201cI\u2019m serious. Do you have any idea how awkward it is to wave at someone and have them ignore you? And then you\u2019re just looking around like a jackass, trying to be all, \u2018No, really, I swear, I know that girl\u2019 and no one believes y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I stop in the middle of the kitchen. Spin around. My face is pulled together in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to me maybe once in the two weeks I\u2019ve been here. I hardly even notice you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, hold up,\u201d he says, turning to block my path. \u201cWe both know there\u2019s no way you haven\u2019t noticed all of this\u201d\u2014he gestures to himself\u2014\u201cso if you\u2019re trying to play games with me, I should let you know up front that it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frown. \u201cWhat are you talking abou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t play hard to get, kid.\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cI can\u2019t even touch you. Takes \u2018hard to get\u2019 to a whole new level, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I mouth, eyes closed, shaking my head. \u201cYou are insane.\u201d</p><p>He falls to his knees. \u201cInsane for your sweet, sweet love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji!\u201d I can\u2019t lift my eyes because I\u2019m afraid to look around, but I\u2019m desperate for him to stop talking. To put an entire room between us at all times. I know he\u2019s joking, but I might be the only one.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, his voice booming around the room. \u201cDoes my love embarrass you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014please get up\u2014and lower your voice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I\u2019m pleading now.</p><p>\u201cBecause if I lower my voice, I won\u2019t be able to hear myself speak. And that,\u201d he says, \u201cis my favorite part.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even look at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t deny me, Juliette. I\u2019m a lonely man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking my heart.\u201d His voice is even louder now, his arms making sad, sweeping gestures that almost hit me as I back away, panicked. But then I realize everyone is watching him.</p><p>Entertained.</p><p>I manage an awkward smile as I glance around the room and I\u2019m surprised to find that no one is looking at me now. They\u2019re all grinning, clearly accustomed to Kenji\u2019s antics, staring at him with a mixture of adoration and something else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam is staring, too. He\u2019s standing with his tray in his hands, his head cocked and his eyes confused. He smiles a tentative sort of smile when our gazes meet.</p><p>I head toward him.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014wait up, kid.\u201d Kenji jumps up to grab my arm. \u201cYou know I was just messing with\u2014\u201d He follows my eyes to where Adam is standing. Slaps a palm to his forehead. \u201cOf course! How could I forget? You\u2019re in love with my roommate.\u201d</p><p>I turn to face him. \u201cListen, I\u2019m grateful you\u2019re going to help me train now\u2014really, I am. Thank you for that. But you can\u2019t go around proclaiming your fake love to me\u2014especially not in front of Adam\u2014and you have to let me cross this room before the breakfast hour is over, okay? I hardly ever get to see him.\u201d</p> <p>Kenji nods very slowly, looks a little solemn. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam is jealous of our love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go get your food!\u201d I push him, hard, fighting back an exasperated laugh.</p><p>Kenji is one of the only people here\u2014with the exception of Adam, of course\u2014who isn\u2019t afraid to touch me. In truth, no one really has anything to fear when I\u2019m wearing this suit, but I usually take my gloves off when I eat and my reputation is always walking 5 feet ahead of me. People keep their distance. And even though I accidentally attacked Kenji once, he\u2019s not afraid. I think it would take an astronomical amount of something horrible to get him down.</p> <p>I admire that about him.</p><p>Adam doesn\u2019t say much when we meet. He doesn\u2019t have to say more than \u201cHey,\u201d because his lips quirk up on one side and I can already see him standing a little taller, a little tighter, a little tenser. And I don\u2019t know much about anything in this world but I do know how to read the book written in his eyes.</p><p>The way he looks at me.</p><p>His eyes are heavy now in a way that worries me, but his gaze is still so tender, so focused and full of feeling that I can hardly keep myself out of his arms when I\u2019m around him. I find myself watching him do the simplest things\u2014shifting his weight, grabbing a tray, nodding good morning to someone\u2014just to track the movement of his body. My moments with him are so few that my chest is always too tight, my heart too spastic. He makes me want to be impractical all the time.</p><p>He never lets go of my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask him, still feeling a little apprehensive about the night before.</p> <p>He nods. Tries to smile. \u201cYeah. I, uh ...\u201d Clears his throat. Takes a deep breath. Looks away. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry about last night. I kind of ... I freaked out a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, though?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking over my shoulder. Frowning.</p><p>\u201cAdam ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you freaked out?\u201d</p><p>His eyes meet mine again. Wide. Round. \u201cWhat? Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understa\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy the hell are you guys taking so long?\u201d</p><p>I spin around. Kenji is standing just behind me, so much food piled on his tray I\u2019m surprised no one said anything. He must\u2019ve convinced the cooks to give him extra.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Kenji is staring, unblinking, waiting for us to respond. He finally cocks his head backward, in a motion that says follow me, before walking away.</p><p>Adam blows out his breath and looks so distracted that I decide to drop the subject of last night. Soon. We\u2019ll talk soon. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing at all.</p><p>We\u2019ll talk soon and everything is going to be fine.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Kenji is waiting for us at an empty table.</p><p>James used to join us at mealtimes, but now he\u2019s friends with the handful of younger kids at Omega Point, and prefers sitting with them. He seems the happiest of all of us to be here\u2014and I\u2019m happy he\u2019s happy\u2014but I have to admit I miss his company. I\u2019m afraid to mention it though; sometimes I\u2019m not sure if I want to know why he doesn\u2019t spend time with Adam when I\u2019m around. I don\u2019t think I want to know if the other kids managed to convince him that I\u2019m dangerous. I mean, I am dangerous, but I just</p><p>Adam sits down on the bench seat and I slide in next to him. Kenji sits across from us. Adam and I hide our linked hands under the table and I allow myself to enjoy the simple luxury of his proximity. I\u2019m still wearing my gloves but just being this close to him is enough; flowers are blooming in my stomach, the soft petals tickling every inch of my nervous system. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been granted 3 wishes: to touch, to taste, to feel. It\u2019s the strangest phenomenon. A crazy happy impossibility wrapped in tissue paper, tied with a bow, tucked away in my heart.</p><p>It often feels like a privilege I don\u2019t deserve.</p><p>Adam shifts so the length of his leg is pressed against mine.</p><p>I look up to find him smiling at me, a secret, tiny sort of smile that says so many things, the kinds of things no one should be saying at a breakfast table. I force myself to breathe as I suppress a grin. I turn to focus on my food. Hope I\u2019m not blushing.</p><p>Adam leans into my ear. I feel the soft whispers of his breath just before he begins to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are disgusting, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I look up, startled, and find Kenji frozen midmovement, his spoon halfway to his mouth, his head cocked in our direction. He gestures with his spoon at our faces. \u201cWhat the hell is this? You guys playing footsie under the table or someshit?\u201d</p><p>Adam moves away from me, just an inch or 2, and exhales a deep, irritated sigh. \u201cYou know, if you don\u2019t like it, you can leave.\u201d He nods at the tables around us. \u201cNo one asked you to sit here.\u201d</p><p>This is Adam making a concerted effort to be nice to Kenji. The 2 of them were friends back on base, but somehow Kenji knows exactly how to provoke Adam. I almost forget for a moment that they\u2019re roommates.</p><p>I wonder what it must be like for them to live together.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cI told you this morning that I had to sit with you guys. Castle wants me to help the two of you adjust.\u201d He snorts. Nods in my direction. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t have a clue what you see in this guy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you should try living with him. The man is moody as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not moody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, bro.\u201d Kenji puts his utensils down. \u201cYou are moody. It\u2019s always \u2018Shut up, Kenji.\u2019 \u2018Go to sleep, Kenji.\u2019 \u2018No one wants to see you naked, Kenji.\u2019 When I know for a fact that there are thousands of people who would love to see me naked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you have to sit here?\u201d Adam looks away, rubs his eyes with his free hand.</p><p>Kenji sits up straighter. Picks up his spoon only to stab it through the air again. \u201cYou should consider yourself lucky that I\u2019m sitting at your table. I\u2019m making you cool by association.\u201d</p><p>I feel Adam tense beside me and decide to intervene. \u201cHey, can we talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>Kenji grunts. Rolls his eyes. Shovels another spoonful of breakfast into his mouth.</p><p>I\u2019m worried.</p><p>Now that I\u2019m paying closer attention, I can see the weariness in Adam\u2019s eyes, the heaviness in his brow, the stiff set of his shoulders. I can\u2019t help but wonder what he\u2019s going through. What he\u2019s not telling me. I tug on Adam\u2019s hand a little and he turns to me.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d I whisper. I feel like I keep asking him the same question over and over and over</p><p>His eyes immediately soften, looking tired but slightly amused. His hand releases mine under the table just to rest on my lap, just to slip down my thigh, and I almost lose control of my vocabulary before he leaves a light kiss in my hair. I swallow too hard, almost drop my fork on the floor. It takes me a moment to remember that he hasn\u2019t actually answered my question. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s looked away, staring at his food, when he finally nods, says, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d But I\u2019m not breathing and his hand is still tracing patterns on my leg.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars? Mr. Kent?\u201d</p><p>I sit up so fast I slam my knuckles under the table at the sound of Castle\u2019s voice. There\u2019s something about his presence that makes me feel like he\u2019s my teacher, like I\u2019ve been caught misbehaving in class. Adam, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t seem remotely startled.</p><p>I cling to Adam\u2019s fingers as I lift my head.</p><p>Castle is standing over our table and Kenji is leaving to deposit his bowl in the kitchen. He claps Castle on the back like they\u2019re old friends and Castle flashes Kenji a warm smile as he passes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Kenji shouts over his shoulder, twisting to flash us an overly enthusiastic thumbs-up. \u201cTry not to get naked in front of everyone, okay? There are kids in here.\u201d</p><p>I cringe and glance at Adam but he seems oddly focused on his food. He hasn\u2019t said a word since Castle arrived.</p><p>I decide to answer for the both of us. Paste on a bright smile. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Castle nods, touches the lapel of his blazer; his stature is strong and poised. He beams at me. \u201cI just came to say hello and to check in. I\u2019m so happy to see that you\u2019re expanding your circle of friends, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you. But I can\u2019t take credit for the idea,\u201d I point out. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to sit with Kenji.\u201d</p><p>Castle\u2019s smile is a little too tight. \u201cYes. Well,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m happy to see that you took my advice.\u201d</p><p>I nod at my food. Rub absently at my forehead. Adam looks like he\u2019s not even breathing. I\u2019m about to say something when Castle cuts me off. \u201cSo, Mr. Kent,\u201d he says. \u201cDid Ms. Ferrars tell you she\u2019ll be training with Kenji now? I\u2019m hoping it will help her progress.\u201d</p><p>Adam doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Castle soldiers on. \u201cI actually thought it might be interesting for her to work with you, too. As long as I\u2019m there to supervise.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes snap up to attention. Alarmed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Castle pauses. I watch his gaze shift between the two of us. \u201cI thought it would be interesting to run some tests on you and her. Together.\u201d</p><p>Adam stands up so quickly he almost bangs his knee into the table. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Kent\u2014,\u201d Castle starts.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no chance in hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her choice to make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss this here\u2014\u201d</p><p>I jump to my feet. Adam looks ready to set something on fire. His fists are clenched at his sides, his eyes narrowed into a tight glare; his forehead is taut, his entire frame shaking with energy and anxiety.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d I demand.</p><p>Castle shakes his head. He\u2019s not addressing me when he speaks. \u201cI only want to see what happens when she touches you. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is for her,\u201d Castle continues, his voice careful, extra calm. \u201cIt has nothing to do with your progress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat progress?\u201d I cut in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to help her figure out how to affect nonliving organisms,\u201d Castle is saying. \u201cAnimals and humans we\u2019ve figured out\u2014we know one touch is sufficient. Plants don\u2019t seem to factor into her abilities at all. But everything else? It\u2019s ... different. She doesn\u2019t know how to handle that part yet, and I want to help her. That\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cHelping Ms. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>Adam takes a step closer to me. \u201cIf you\u2019re helping her figure out how to destroy nonliving things, why do you need me?\u201d</p><p>For a second Castle actually looks defeated. \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d he says. \u201cThe unique nature of your relationship\u2014it\u2019s quite fascinating. Especially with everything we\u2019ve learned so far, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you learned?\u201d I jump in again.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014entirely possible,\u201d Castle is still saying, \u201cthat everything is connected in a way we don\u2019t yet understand.\u201d</p><p>Adam looks unconvinced. His lips are pressed into a thin line. He doesn\u2019t look like he wants to answer.</p><p>Castle turns to me. Tries to sound excited. \u201cWhat do you think? Are you interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterested?\u201d I look at Castle. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. And I want to know why no one is answering my questions. What have you discovered about Adam?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is something wrong?\u201d Adam is breathing extra hard and trying not to show it; his hands keep clenching and unclenching. \u201cSomeone, please, tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Castle frowns.</p> <p>He\u2019s studying me, confused, his eyebrows pulled together. \u201cMr. Kent,\u201d he says, still looking at me. \u201cAm I to understand that you have not yet shared our discoveries with Ms. Ferrars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat discoveries?\u201d My heart is racing hard now, so hard it\u2019s beginning to hurt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Adam snaps.</p><p>\u201cShe should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything yet!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe know enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. We\u2019re not done yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing left is to test the two of you together\u2014\u201d</p><p>Adam steps directly in front of Castle, grabbing his breakfast tray with a little too much strength. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he says very, very carefully, \u201csome other time.\u201d</p><p>He turns to leave.</p><p>I touch his arm.</p><p>He stops. Drops his tray, pivots in my direction. There\u2019s less than half an inch between us and I almost forget we\u2019re standing in a crowded room. His breath is hot and his breathing shallow and the heat from his body is melting my blood only to splash it across my cheeks.</p><p>Panic is doing backflips in my bones.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything is going to be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he says again, grabbing my hand. \u201cI swear. I\u2019m going to fix this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFix this?\u201d I think I\u2019m dreaming. I think I\u2019m dying. \u201cFix what?\u201d Something is breaking in my brain and something is happening without my permission and I\u2019m lost, I\u2019m so lost, I\u2019m so much everything confused and I\u2019m drowning in confusion. \u201cAdam, I don\u2019t underst\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, really though?\u201d Kenji is making his way back to our group. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do that here? In front of everyone? Because these tables aren\u2019t as comfortable as they look\u2014\u201d</p><p>Adam pulls back and slams into Kenji\u2019s shoulder on his way out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Is all I hear him say before he disappears.</p><p>SIX</p><p>Kenji lets out a low whistle.</p><p>Castle is calling Adam\u2019s name, asking him to slow down, to speak to him, to discuss things in a rational manner. Adam never looks back.</p><p>\u201cI told you he was moody,\u201d Kenji mutters.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not moody,\u201d I hear myself say, but the words feel distant, disconnected from my lips. I feel numb, like my arms have been hollowed out.</p><p>Where did I leave my voice I can\u2019t find my voice I can\u2019t find my</p><p>\u201cSo! You and me, huh?\u201d Kenji claps his hands together. \u201cReady to get your ass kicked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me to wherever they went.\u201d</p><p>Kenji is looking at me like I\u2019ve just asked him to kick himself in the face. \u201cUh, yeah\u2014how about a warm hell no to that request? Does that work for you? Because it works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d I turn to him, desperate, feeling stupid. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you? You know what\u2019s wrong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know.\u201d He crosses his arms. Levels a look at me. \u201cI live with that poor bastard and I practically run this place. I know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why won\u2019t you tell me? Kenji, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, I\u2019m going to pass on that, but you know what I will do? I will help you to remove yourself the hell out of this dining hall where everyone is listening to everything we say.\u201d This last bit he says extra loudly, looking around at the room, shaking his head. \u201cGet back to your breakfasts, people. Nothing to see here.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only then that I realize what a spectacle we\u2019ve made. Every eye in the room is blinking at me. I attempt a weak smile and a twitchy wave before allowing Kenji to shuffle me out of the room.</p><p>\u201cNo need to wave at the people, princess. It\u2019s not a coronation ceremony.\u201d He pulls me into one of the many long, dimly lit corridors.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s happening.\u201d I have to blink several times before my eyes adjust to the lighting. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair\u2014everyone knows what\u2019s going on except for me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, leans one shoulder against the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell. I mean, I like to mess with the guy, but I\u2019m not an asshole. He asked me not to say anything. So I\u2019m not going to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I mean\u2014is he okay? Can you at least tell me if he\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Kenji runs a hand over his eyes; exhales, annoyed. Shoots me a look. Says, \u201cAll right, like, have you ever seen a train wreck?\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for me to answer. \u201cI saw one when I was a kid. It was one of those big, crazy trains with a billion cars all hitched up together, totally derailed, half exploded. Shit was on fire and everyone was screaming and you just know people are either dead or they\u2019re about to die and you really don\u2019t want to watch but you just can\u2019t look away, you know?\u201d He nods. Bites the inside of his cheek. \u201cThis is kind of like that. Your boy is a freaking train wreck.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t feel my legs.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Kenji goes on. \u201cPersonally? I think he\u2019s overreacting. Worse things have happened, right? Hell, aren\u2019t we up to our earlobes in crazier shit? But no, Mr. Adam Kent doesn\u2019t seem to know that. I don\u2019t even think he sleeps anymore. And you know what,\u201d he adds, leaning in, \u201cI think he\u2019s starting to freak James out a little, and to be honest it\u2019s starting to piss me off because that kid is way too nice and way too cool to have to deal with Adam\u2019s drama\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m not listening anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m envisioning the worst possible scenarios, the worst possible outcomes. Horrible, terrifying things that all end with Adam dying in some miserable way. He must be sick, or he must have some kind of terrible affliction, or something that causes him to do things he can\u2019t control or oh, God, no</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t recognize my own voice. Kenji is looking at me, shocked, wide-eyed, genuine fear written across his features and it\u2019s only then that I realize I\u2019ve pinned him against the wall. My 10 fingers are curled into his shirt, fistfuls of fabric clenched in each hand, and I can only imagine what I must look like to him right now.</p><p>The scariest part is that I don\u2019t even care.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me something, Kenji. You have to. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, uh\u201d\u2014he licks his lips, looks around, laughs a nervous laugh\u2014\u201cyou want to let go of me, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help me?\u201d</p><p>He scratches behind his hear. Cringes a little. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>I slam him harder into the wall, recognize a rush of some wild kind of adrenaline burning in my veins. It\u2019s strange, but I feel as though I could rip through the ground with my bare hands.</p><p>It seems like it would be easy. So easy.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014all right\u2014goddamn.\u201d Kenji is holding his arms up, breathing a little fast. \u201cJust\u2014how about you let me go, and I\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll take you to the research labs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe research labs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where they do the testing. It\u2019s where we do all of our testing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise you\u2019ll take me if I let go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to bash my brain into the wall if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cThen yeah. I\u2019ll take you. Damn.\u201d</p><p>I drop him and stumble backward; make an effort to pull myself together. I feel a little embarrassed now that I\u2019ve let go of him. Some part of me feels like I must\u2019ve overreacted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut thank you. I appreciate your help.\u201d I try to lift my chin with some dignity.</p><p>Kenji snorts. He\u2019s looking at me like he has no idea who I am, like he\u2019s not sure if he should laugh or applaud or run like hell in the opposite direction. He rubs the back of his neck, eyes intent on my face. He won\u2019t stop staring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you weigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Is that how you talk to every girl you meet? That explains so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about one hundred seventy-five pounds,\u201d he says. \u201cOf muscle.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cWould you like an award?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he says, cocking his head, the barest hint of a smile flickering across his face. \u201cLook who\u2019s the smart-ass now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re rubbing off on me,\u201d I say.</p><p>But he\u2019s not smiling anymore.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to flatter myself by pointing this out, but I could toss you across the room with my pinkie finger. You weigh, like, less than nothing. I\u2019m almost twice your body mass.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSo how the hell did you pin me against the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frown. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about you\u201d\u2014he points at me\u2014\u201cpinning me\u201d\u2014he points at himself\u2014\u201cagainst the wall.\u201d He points at the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you actually couldn\u2019t move?\u201d I blink. \u201cI thought you were just afraid of touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI legit could not move. I could hardly breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done that before?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m shaking my head. \u201cI mean I don\u2019t think I ...\u201d I gasp, as the memory of Warner and his torture chamber rushes to the forefront of my mind; I have to close my eyes against the influx of images. The barest recollection of that event is enough to make me feel unbearably nauseous; I can already feel my skin break into a cold sweat. Warner was testing me, trying to put me in a position where I\u2019d be forced to use my power on a toddler. I was so horrified, so enraged that I crashed through the concrete barrier to get to Warner, who was waiting on the other side. I\u2019d pinned him against the wall, too. Only I didn\u2019t realize he was cowed by my strength. I thought he was afraid to move because I\u2019d gotten too close to touching him.</p><p>I guess I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kenji says, nodding at something he must see on my face. \u201cWell. That\u2019s what I thought. We\u2019ll have to remember this juicy tidbit when we get around to our real training sessions.\u201d He throws me a loaded look. \u201cWhenever that actually happens.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding, not really paying attention. \u201cSure. Fine. But first, take me to the research rooms.\u201d</p> <p>Kenji sighs. Waves his hand with a bow and a flourish. \u201cAfter you, princess.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>We\u2019re trailing down a series of corridors I\u2019ve never seen before.</p><p>We\u2019re passing all of the regular halls and wings, past the training room I normally occupy, and for the first time since I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019m really paying attention to my surroundings. All of a sudden my senses feel sharper, clearer; my entire being feels like it\u2019s humming with a renewed kind of energy.</p><p>I am electric.</p> <p>This entire hideout has been dug out of the ground\u2014it\u2019s nothing but cavernous tunnels and interconnected passageways, all powered by supplies and electricity stolen from secret storage units belonging to The Reestablishment. This space is invaluable. Castle told us once that it took him at least a decade to design it, and a decade more to get the work done. By then he\u2019d also managed to recruit all of the other members of this underground world. I can understand why he\u2019s so relentless about security down here, why he\u2019s not willing to let anything happen to it. I don\u2019t think I would either.</p><p>Kenji stops.</p><p>We reach what looks like a dead end\u2014what could be the very end of Omega Point.</p><p>Kenji pulls out a key card I didn\u2019t know he was hiding, and his hand fumbles for a panel buried in the stone. He slides the panel open. Does something I can\u2019t see. Swipes the key card. Hits a switch.</p><p>The entire wall rumbles to life.</p><p>The pieces are coming apart, shifting out of place until they reveal a hole big enough for our bodies to clamber through. Kenji motions for me to follow his lead and I scramble through the entryway, glancing back to watch the wall close up behind me.</p> <p>My feet hit the ground on the other side.</p><p>It\u2019s like a cave. Massive, wide, separated into 3 longitudinal sections. The middle section is the most narrow and serves as a walkway; square glass rooms fit with slim glass doors make up the left and right sections. Each clear wall acts as a partition to rooms on either side\u2014everything is see-through. There\u2019s an electric aura engulfing the entire space; each cube is bright with white light and blinking machinery; sharp and dull hums of energy pulse through the vast dimensions.</p><p>There are at least 20 rooms down here.</p><p>10 on either side, all of them unobstructed from view. I recognize a number of faces from the dining hall down here, some of them strapped to machines, needles stuck in their bodies, monitors beeping about some kind of information I can\u2019t understand. Doors slide open and closed open and closed open and closed; words and whispers and footsteps, hand gestures and half-formed thoughts collect in the air.</p><p>This.</p><p>This is where everything happens.</p><p>Castle told me 2 weeks ago\u2014the day after I arrived\u2014that he had a pretty good idea why we are the way we are. He said that they\u2019d been doing research for years.</p><p>Research.</p> <p>I see figures running, gasping on what resemble inordinately fast treadmills. I see a woman reloading a gun in a room bursting with weapons and I see a man holding something that emits a bright blue flame. I see a person standing in a chamber full of nothing but water and there are ropes stacked high and strung across the ceiling and all kinds of liquids, chemicals, contraptions I can\u2019t name and my brain won\u2019t stop screaming and my lungs keep catching fire and it\u2019s too much too much too much too much</p><p>Too many machines, too many lights, too many people in too many rooms taking notes, talking amongst themselves, glancing at the clocks every few seconds and I\u2019m stumbling forward, looking too closely and not closely enough and then I hear it. I try so hard not to but it\u2019s barely contained behind these thick glass walls and there it is again.</p><p>The low, guttural sound of human agony.</p><p>It hits me right in the face. Punches me right in the stomach. Realization jumps on my back and explodes in my skin and rakes its fingernails down my neck and I\u2019m choking on impossibility.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>I see him. He\u2019s already here, in one of the glass rooms. Shirtless. Strapped down to a gurney, arms and legs clamped in place, wires from a nearby machine taped to his temples, his forehead, just below his collarbone. His eyes are pressed shut, his fists are clenched, his jaw is tight, his face too taut from the effort not to scream.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re doing to him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s happening or why he needs a machine or why it keeps blinking or beeping and I can\u2019t seem to move or breathe and I\u2019m trying to remember my voice, my hands, my head, and my feet and then he</p><p>jerks.</p><p>He convulses against the stays, strains against the pain until his fists are pounding the padding of the gurney and I hear him cry out in anguish and for a moment the world stops, everything slows down, sounds are strangled, colors look smeared and the floor seems set on its side and I think wow, I think I\u2019m actually going to die. I\u2019m going to drop dead or</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill the person responsible for this.</p><p>It\u2019s one or the other.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see Castle. Castle, standing in the corner of Adam\u2019s room, watching in silence as this 18-year-old boy rages in agony while he does nothing. Nothing except watch, except to take notes in his little book, to purse his lips as he tilts his head to the side. To glance at the monitor on the beeping machine.</p><p>And the thought is so simple when it slips into my head. So calm. So easy.</p><p>So, so easy.</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cJuliette\u2014no\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kenji grabs me by the waist, arms like bands of iron around me and I think I\u2019m screaming, I think I\u2019m saying things I\u2019ve never heard myself say before and Kenji is telling me to calm down, he\u2019s saying, \u201cThis is exactly why I didn\u2019t want to bring you in here\u2014you don\u2019t understand\u2014it\u2019s not what it looks like\u2014\u201d</p><p>And I decide I should probably kill Kenji, too. Just for being an idiot.</p><p>\u201cLET GO OF ME\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop kicking me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to murder him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should really stop saying that out loud, okay? You\u2019re not doing yourself any favors\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLET GO OF ME, KENJI, I SWEAR TO GOD\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars!\u201d</p><p>Castle is standing at the end of the walkway, a few feet from Adam\u2019s glass room. The door is open. Adam isn\u2019t jerking anymore, but he doesn\u2019t appear to be conscious, either.</p><p>White, hot rage.</p><p>It\u2019s all I know right now. The world looks so black-and-white from here, so easy to demolish and conquer. This is anger like nothing I\u2019ve known before. It\u2019s an anger so raw, so potent it\u2019s actually calming, like a feeling that\u2019s finally found its place, a feeling that finally sits comfortably as it settles into my bones.</p><p>I\u2019ve become a mold for liquid metal; thick, searing heat distributes itself throughout my body and the excess coats my hands, forging my fists with a strength so breathtaking, an energy so intense I think it might engulf me. I\u2019m light-headed from the rush of it.</p><p>I could do anything.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>Kenji\u2019s arms drop away from me. I don\u2019t have to look at him to know that he\u2019s stumbling back. Afraid. Confused. Probably disturbed.</p><p>I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSo this is where you\u2019ve been,\u201d I say to Castle, and I\u2019m surprised by the cool, fluid tone of my voice. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>Castle steps closer and appears to regret it. He looks startled, surprised by something he sees on my face. He tries to speak and I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d I demand. \u201cWhat have you been doing to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not your experiment!\u201d I explode, and the composure is gone, the steadiness in my voice is gone and I\u2019m suddenly so unstable again I can hardly keep my hands from shaking. \u201cYou think you can just use him for your research\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars, please, you must calm yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down!\u201d I can\u2019t imagine what they must have done to him down here, testing him, treating him like some kind of specimen.</p><p>They\u2019re torturing him.</p><p>\u201cI would not have expected you to have such an adverse reaction to this room,\u201d Castle says. He\u2019s trying to be conversational. Reasonable. Charismatic, even. It makes me wonder what I must look like right now. I wonder if he\u2019s afraid of me. \u201cI thought you understood the importance of the research we do at Omega Point,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout it, how could we possibly hope to understand our origins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting him\u2014you\u2019re killing him! What have you done\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing he hasn\u2019t asked to be a part of.\u201d Castle\u2019s voice is tight and his lips are tight and I can see his patience is starting to wear thin. \u201cMs. Ferrars, if you are insinuating that I\u2019ve used him for my own personal experimentation, I would recommend you take a closer look at the situation.\u201d He says the last few syllables with a little too much emphasis, a little too much fire, and I realize I\u2019ve never seen him angry before.</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019ve been struggling here,\u201d Castle continues. \u201cI know you are unaccustomed to seeing yourself as part of a group, and I\u2019ve made an effort to understand where you might be coming from\u2014I\u2019ve tried to help you adjust. But you must look around!\u201d He gestures toward the glass walls and the people behind them. \u201cWe are all the same. We are working on the same team! I have subjected Adam to nothing I have not undergone myself. We are simply running tests to see where his supernatural abilities lie. We cannot know for certain what he is capable of if we do not test him first.\u201d His voice drops an octave or 2. \u201cAnd we do not have the luxury of waiting several years until he accidentally discovers something that might be useful to our cause right now.\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s strange.</p><p>Because it\u2019s like a real thing, this anger.</p><p>I feel it wrapping itself around my fingers like I could fling it at his face. I feel it coiling itself around my spine, planting itself in my stomach and shooting branches down my legs, up my arms, through my neck. It\u2019s choking me. Choking me because it needs release, needs relief. Needs it now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d I tell him, and I can hardly spit the words out. \u201cYou think you\u2019re any better than The Reestablishment if you\u2019re just using us\u2014experimenting on us to further your cause\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMS. FERRARS!\u201d Castle bellows. His eyes are flashing bright, too bright, and I realize everyone in this underground tunnel is now staring at us. His fingers are in fists at his sides and his jaw is unmistakably set and I feel Kenji\u2019s hand on my back before I realize the earth is vibrating under my feet. The glass walls are beginning to tremble and Castle is planted right in the middle of everything, rigid, raw with anger and indignation and I remember that he has an impossibly advanced level of psychokinesis.</p><p>I remember that he can move things with his mind.</p><p>He lifts his right hand, palm splayed outward, and the glass panel not a few feet away begins to shake, shudder, and I realize I\u2019m not even breathing.</p> <p>\u201cYou do not want to upset me.\u201d Castle\u2019s voice is far too calm for his eyes. \u201cIf you have a problem with my methods, I would gladly invite you to state your claims in a rational manner. I will not tolerate you speaking to me in such a fashion. My concerns for the future of our world may be more than you can fathom, but you should not fault me for your own ignorance!\u201d He drops his right hand and the glass buckles back just in time.</p><p>\u201cMy ignorance?\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard again. \u201cYou think because I don\u2019t understand why you would subject anyone to\u2014to this\u2014\u201d I wave a hand around the room. \u201cYou think that means I\u2019m ignorant\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Juliette, it\u2019s okay\u2014,\u201d Kenji starts.</p><p>\u201cTake her away,\u201d Castle says. \u201cTake her back to her training quarters.\u201d He shoots an unhappy look at Kenji. \u201cAnd you and I\u2014we will discuss this later. What were you thinking, bringing her here? She\u2019s not ready to see this\u2014she can hardly even handle herself right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right.</p> <p>I can\u2019t handle this. I can\u2019t hear anything but the sounds of machines beeping, screeching in my head, can\u2019t see anything but Adam\u2019s limp form lying on a thin mattress. I can\u2019t stop imagining what he must\u2019ve been going through, what he had to endure just to understand what he might be and I realize it\u2019s all my fault.</p><p>It\u2019s my fault he\u2019s here, it\u2019s my fault he\u2019s in danger, it\u2019s my fault Warner wants to kill him and Castle wants to test him and if it weren\u2019t for me he\u2019d still be living with James in a home that hasn\u2019t been destroyed; he\u2019d be safe and comfortable and free from the chaos I\u2019ve introduced to his life.</p><p>I brought him here. If he\u2019d never touched me none of this would\u2019ve happened. He\u2019d be healthy and strong and he wouldn\u2019t be suffering, wouldn\u2019t be hiding, wouldn\u2019t be trapped 50 feet underground. He wouldn\u2019t be spending his days strapped to a gurney.</p><p>It\u2019s my fault it\u2019s my fault it\u2019s my fault it\u2019s all my fault it\u2019s all my fault</p><p>I snap.</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been stuffed full of twigs and all I have to do is bend and my entire body will break. All the guilt, the anger, the frustration, the pent-up aggression inside of me has found an outlet and now it can\u2019t be controlled. Energy is coursing through me with a vigor I\u2019ve never felt before and I\u2019m not even thinking but I have to do something I have to touch something and I\u2019m curling my fingers and bending my knees and pulling back my arm and</p> <p>punching</p><p>my</p><p>fist</p><p>right</p><p>through</p><p>the</p><p>floor.</p><p>The earth fissures under my fingers and the reverberations surge through my being, ricocheting through my bones until my skull is spinning and my heart is a pendulum slamming into my rib cage. My eyesight fades in and out of focus and I have to blink a hundred times to clear it only to see a crack creaking under my feet, a thin line splintering the ground. Everything around me is suddenly off-balance. The stone is groaning under our weight and the glass walls are rattling and the machines are shifting out of place and the water is sloshing against its container and the people\u2014</p> <p>The people.</p><p>The people are frozen in terror and horror and the fear in their expressions rips me apart.</p><p>I fall backward, cradling my right fist to my chest and try to remind myself I am not a monster, I do not have to be a monster, I do not want to hurt people I do not want to hurt people I do not want to hurt people</p><p>and it\u2019s not working.</p><p>Because it\u2019s all a lie.</p><p>Because this was me, trying to help.</p><p>I look around.</p><p>At the ground.</p><p>At what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>And I understand, for the first time, that I have the power to destroy everything.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Castle is limp.</p><p>His jaw is unhinged. His arms are slack at his sides, his eyes wide with worry and wonder and a sliver of intimidation and though he moves his lips he can\u2019t seem to make a sound.</p><p>I feel like now might be a good time to jump off a cliff.</p><p>Kenji touches my arm and I turn to face him only to realize I\u2019m petrified. I\u2019m always waiting for him and Adam and Castle to realize that being kind to me is a mistake, that it\u2019ll end badly, that I\u2019m not worth it, that I\u2019m nothing more than a tool, a weapon, a closet murderer.</p><p>But he takes my right fist in his hand so gently. Takes care not to touch my skin as he slips off the now-tattered leather glove and sucks in his breath at the sight of my knuckles. The skin is torn and blood is everywhere and I can\u2019t move my fingers.</p><p>I realize I am in agony.</p><p>I blink and stars explode and a new torture rages through my limbs in such a hurry I can no longer speak.</p><p>I gasp</p><p>the</p><p>world</p><p>d i s a p p e a r s</p><p>NINE</p><p>My mouth tastes like death.</p><p>I manage to pry my eyes open and immediately feel the wrath of hell ripping through my right arm. My hand has been bandaged in so many layers of gauze it\u2019s rendered my 5 fingers immobile and I find I\u2019m grateful for it. I\u2019m so exhausted I don\u2019t have the energy to cry.</p><p>I blink.</p><p>Try to look around but my neck is too stiff.</p><p>Fingers brush my shoulder and I discover myself wanting to exhale. I blink again. Once more. A girl\u2019s face blurs in and out of focus. I turn my head to get a better view and blink blink blink some more.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say to the blur, but I think I\u2019m lying. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she says. Even without seeing her clearly I can hear the kindness in her voice. \u201cSonya.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Sara is probably here, too. I must be in the medical wing.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer and I wonder if she didn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>\u201cSonya?\u201d I try to meet her eyes. \u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been really sick,\u201d she says. \u201cYour body needed time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d My voice drops to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d</p><p>I sit straight up and know I\u2019m going to be sick.</p><p>Luckily, Sonya\u2019s had the foresight to anticipate my needs. A bucket appears just in time for me to empty the meager contents of my stomach into it and then I\u2019m dry-heaving into what is not my suit but some kind of hospital gown and someone is wiping a hot, damp cloth across my face.</p><p>Sonya and Sara are hovering over me, the hot cloths in their hands, wiping down my bare limbs, making soothing sounds and telling me I\u2019m going to be fine, I just need to rest, I\u2019m finally awake long enough to eat something, I shouldn\u2019t be worried because there\u2019s nothing to worry about and they\u2019re going to take care of me.</p><p>But then I look more closely.</p><p>I notice their hands, so carefully sheathed in latex gloves; I notice the IV stuck in my arm; I notice the urgent but cautious way they approach me and then I realize the problem.</p><p>The healers can\u2019t touch me.</p><p>TEN</p><p>They\u2019ve never had to deal with a problem like me before.</p><p>Injuries are always treated by the healers. They can set broken bones and repair bullet wounds and revive collapsed lungs and mend even the worst kinds of cuts\u2014I know this because Adam had to be carried into Omega Point on a stretcher when we arrived. He\u2019d suffered at the hands of Warner and his men after we escaped the military base and I thought his body would be scarred forever. But he\u2019s perfect. Brand-new. It took all of 1 day to put him back together; it was like magic.</p><p>But there are no magic medicines for me.</p><p>No miracles.</p><p>Sonya and Sara explain that I must\u2019ve suffered some kind of immense shock. They say my body overloaded on its own abilities and it\u2019s a miracle I even managed to survive. They also think my body has been passed out long enough to have repaired most of the psychological damage, though I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s true. I think it\u2019d take quite a lot to fix that sort of thing. I\u2019ve been psychologically damaged for a very long time. But at least the physical pain has settled. It\u2019s little more than a steady throbbing that I\u2019m able to ignore for short periods of time.</p><p>I remember something.</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d I tell them. \u201cIn Warner\u2019s torture rooms, and then with Adam and the steel door\u2014I never\u2014this never happened\u2014I never injured myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastle told us about that,\u201d Sonya tells me. \u201cBut breaking through one door or one wall is very different from trying to split the earth in two.\u201d She attempts a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure this can\u2019t even compare to what you did before. This was a lot stronger\u2014we all felt it when it happened. We actually thought explosives had gone off. The tunnels,\u201d she says. \u201cThey almost collapsed in on themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My stomach turns to stone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sara tries to reassure me. \u201cYou pulled back just in time.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known\u2014,\u201d Sonya starts.</p><p>\u201cI almost killed\u2014I almost killed all of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sonya shakes her head. \u201cYou have an amazing amount of power. It\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t know what you were capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve killed you. I could\u2019ve killed Adam\u2014I could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d My head whips around. \u201cIs he here? Is Adam here?\u201d</p><p>The girls stare at me. Stare at each other.</p><p>I hear a throat clear and I jerk toward the sound.</p><p>Kenji steps out of the corner. He waves a half wave, offers me a crooked smile that doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says to me, \u201cbut we had to keep him out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask, but I\u2019m afraid to know the answer.</p><p>Kenji pushes his hair out of his eyes. Considers my question. \u201cWell. Where should I begin?\u201d He counts off on his fingers. \u201cAfter he found out what happened, he tried to kill me, he went ballistic on Castle, he refused to leave the medical wing, and then he wou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I stop him. I squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cNever mind. Don\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I open my eyes. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>Kenji rubs the back of his neck.

Says, \u201cHey, can we get a second alone?\u201d and the 2 of them are suddenly in a hurry to go.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sara says.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Sonya says.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d they say at the same time.</p><p>And they leave.</p><p>Kenji grabs 1 of the chairs pushed up against the wall and carries it over to my bed. Sits down. Props the ankle of 1 foot on the knee of the other and leans back. Links his hands behind his head. Looks at me.</p> <p>I shift on the mattress so I\u2019m better seated to see him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Kent need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nods. Looks away. Taps his foot too fast against the floor.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask after a moment. \u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d</p><p>His foot stops tapping but he doesn\u2019t meet my eyes. He covers his mouth with his left hand. Drops it. \u201cThat was some crazy shit you pulled back there.\u201d</p><p>All at once I feel humiliated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kenji. I\u2019m so sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t think\u2014I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turns to face me and the look in his eyes stops me in place. He\u2019s trying to read me. Trying to figure me out. Trying, I realize, to decide whether or not he can trust me. Whether or not the rumors about the monster in me are true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done that before,\u201d I hear myself whisper. \u201cI swear\u2014I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a question, Juliette. It\u2019s a legitimate question.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen him so serious. \u201cI brought you here because Castle wanted you here. Because he thought we could help you\u2014he thought we could provide you with a safe place to live. To get you away from the assholes trying to use you for their own benefit. But you come here and you don\u2019t even seem to want to be a part of anything. You don\u2019t talk to people. You don\u2019t make any progress with your training. You do nothing, basically.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I believe Castle when he says he\u2019s worried about you. He tells me you\u2019re not adjusting, that you\u2019re having a hard time fitting in. That people heard negative things about you and they\u2019re not being as welcoming as they should be. And I should kick my own ass for it, but I feel sorry for you. So I tell him I\u2019ll help. I rearrange my entire goddamn schedule just to help you deal with your issues. Because I think you\u2019re a nice girl who\u2019s just a little misunderstood. Because Castle is the most decent guy I\u2019ve ever known and I want to help him out.\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding so hard I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s not bleeding.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m wondering,\u201d he says to me. He drops the foot he was resting on his knee. Leans forward. Props his elbows on his thighs. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible that all of this is just coincidence. I mean, was it just some crazy coincidence that I ended up working with you? Me? One of the very few people here who have access to that room? Or was it coincidence that you managed to threaten me into taking you down to the research labs? That you then, somehow, accidentally, coincidentally, unknowingly punched a fist into the ground that shook this place so hard we all thought the walls were caving in?\u201d He stares at me, hard. \u201cWas it a coincidence,\u201d he says, \u201cthat if you\u2019d held on for just a few more seconds, this entire place would\u2019ve collapsed in on itself?\u201d</p><p>My eyes are wide, horrified, caught.</p><p>He leans back. Looks down. Presses 2 fingers to his lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you actually want to be here?\u201d he asks. \u201cOr are you just trying to bring us down from the inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gasp. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you either know exactly what you\u2019re doing\u2014and you\u2019re a hell of a lot sneakier than you pretend to be\u2014or you really have no clue what you\u2019re doing and you just have really shitty luck. I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji, I swear, I never\u2014I n-never\u2014\u201d I have to bite back the words to blink back the tears. It\u2019s crippling, this feeling, this not knowing how to prove your own innocence. It\u2019s my entire life replayed over and over and over again, trying to convince people that I\u2019m not dangerous, that I never meant to hurt anyone, that I didn\u2019t intend for things to turn out this way. That I\u2019m not a bad person.</p><p>But it never seems to work out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I choke, the tears flowing fast now. I\u2019m so disgusted with myself. I tried so hard to be different, to be better, to be good, and I just went and ruined everything and lost everything all over again and I don\u2019t even know how to tell him he\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Because he might be right.</p><p>I knew I was angry. I knew I wanted to hurt Castle and I didn\u2019t care. In that moment, I meant it. In the anger of that moment, I really, truly meant it. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if Kenji hadn\u2019t been there to hold me back. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I don\u2019t even understand what I\u2019m capable of.</p><p>How many times, I hear a voice whisper in my head, how many times will you apologize for who you are?</p><p>I hear Kenji sigh. Shift in his seat. I don\u2019t dare lift my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI had to ask, Juliette.\u201d Kenji sounds uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re crying but I\u2019m not sorry I asked. It\u2019s my job to constantly be thinking of our safety\u2014and that means I have to look at every possible angle. No one knows what you can do yet. Not even you. But you keep trying to act like what you\u2019re capable of isn\u2019t a big deal, and it\u2019s not helping anything. You need to stop trying to pretend you\u2019re not dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I look up too fast. \u201cBut I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m n-not trying to hurt anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says, standing up. \u201cGood intentions are great, but they don\u2019t change the facts. You are dangerous. Shit, you\u2019re scary dangerous. More dangerous than me and everyone else in here. So don\u2019t ask me to act like that knowledge, in and of itself, isn\u2019t a threat to us. If you\u2019re going to stay here,\u201d he says to me, \u201cyou have to learn how to control what you do\u2014how to contain it. You have to deal with who you are and you have to figure out how to live with it. Just like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>3 knocks at the door.</p><p>Kenji is still staring at me. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnd you and Kent need to sort out your drama ASAP,\u201d he adds, just as Sonya and Sara walk back into the room. \u201cI don\u2019t have the time, the energy, or the interest to deal with your problems. I like to mess with you from time to time because, well, let\u2019s face it\u201d\u2014he shrugs\u2014\u201cthe world is going to hell out there and I suppose if I\u2019m going to be shot dead before I\u2019m twenty-five, I\u2019d at least like to remember what it\u2019s like to laugh before I do. But that does not make me your clown or your babysitter. At the end of the day I do not give two shits about whether or not you and Kent are going steady. We have a million things to take care of down here, and less than none of them involve your love life.\u201d A pause. \u201cIs that clear?\u201d</p><p>I nod, not trusting myself to speak.</p><p>\u201cSo are you in?\u201d he says.</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you say it. If you\u2019re in, you\u2019re all in. No more feeling sorry for yourself. No more sitting in the training room all day, crying because you can\u2019t break a metal pipe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you kn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m in. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath. Runs a hand through his hair. \u201cGood. Meet me outside of the dining hall tomorrow morning at six a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waves my words away. \u201cYour hand, nothing. You\u2019ll be fine. You didn\u2019t even break anything. You messed up your knuckles and your brain freaked out a little and basically you just fell asleep for three days. I don\u2019t call that an injury,\u201d he says. \u201cI call that a goddamn vacation.\u201d He stops to consider something. \u201cDo you have any idea how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve gone on vacation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t we training?\u201d I interrupt him. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything if my hand is wrapped up, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. This ... is going to be a little different.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. Wait.</p><p>\u201cYou can consider it your official welcome to Omega Point,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Six a.m.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to ask another question but he presses a finger to his lips, offers me a 2-finger salute, and walks backward toward the exit just as Sonya and Sara head over to my bed.</p><p>I watch as he nods good-bye to both of them, pivots on 1 foot, and strides out the door.</p><p>6:00 a.m.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>I catch a glimpse of the clock on the wall and realize it\u2019s only 2:00 in the afternoon.</p><p>Which means 6:00 a.m. is 16 hours from now.</p><p>Which means I have a lot of hours to fill.</p><p>Which means I have to get dressed.</p><p>Because I need to get out of here.</p><p>And I really need to talk to Adam.</p><p>\u201cJuliette?\u201d</p><p>I jolt out of my own head and back to the present moment to find Sonya and Sara staring at me. \u201cCan we get you anything?\u201d they ask. \u201cAre you feeling well enough to get out of bed?\u201d</p><p>But I look from one set of eyes to another and back again, and instead of answering their questions, I feel a crippling sense of shame dig into my soul and I can\u2019t help but revert back to another version of myself. A scared little girl who wants to keep folding herself in half until she can\u2019t be found anymore.</p><p>I keep saying, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sorry about everything, for all of this, for all the trouble, for all the damage, really, I\u2019m so, so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hear myself go on and on and on and I can\u2019t get myself to stop.</p><p>It\u2019s like a button in my brain is broken, like I\u2019ve developed a disease that forces me to apologize for everything, for existing, for wanting more than what I\u2019ve been given, and I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>It\u2019s what I do.</p><p>I\u2019m always apologizing. Forever apologizing. For who I am and what I never meant to be and for this body I was born into, this DNA I never asked for, this person I can\u2019t unbecome. 17 years I\u2019ve spent trying to be different. Every single day. Trying to be someone else for someone else.</p><p>And it never seems to matter.</p><p>But then I realize they\u2019re talking to me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologize for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s all right\u2014\u201d</p><p>Both of them are trying to speak to me, but Sara is closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dare to meet her eyes and I\u2019m surprised to see how soft they are. Gentle and green and squinty from smiling. She sits down on the right side of my bed. Pats my bare arm with her latex glove, unafraid. Unflinching. Sonya stands just next to her, looking at me like she\u2019s worried, like she\u2019s sad for me, and I don\u2019t have long to dwell on it because I\u2019m distracted. I smell the scent of jasmine filling the room, just as it did the very first time I stepped in here. When we first arrived at Omega Point. When Adam was injured. Dying.</p><p>He was dying and they saved his life. These 2 girls in front of me. They saved his life and I\u2019ve been living with them for 2 weeks and I realize, right then, exactly how selfish I\u2019ve been.</p><p>So I decide to try a new set of words.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>I feel myself begin to blush and I wonder at my inability to be so free with words and feelings. I wonder at my incapacity for easy banter, smooth conversation, empty words to fill awkward moments. I don\u2019t have a closet filled with umms and ellipses ready to insert at the beginnings and ends of sentences. I don\u2019t know how to be a verb, an adverb, any kind of modifier. I\u2019m a noun through and through.</p><p>Stuffed so full of people places things and ideas that I don\u2019t know how to break out of my own brain. How to start a conversation.</p><p>I want to trust but it scares the skin off my bones.</p><p>But then I remember my promise to Castle and my promise to Kenji and my worries over Adam and I think maybe I should take a risk. Maybe I should try to find a new friend or 2. And I think of how wonderful it would be to be friends with a girl. A girl, just like me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had one of those before.</p> <p>So when Sonya and Sara smile and tell me they\u2019re \u201chappy to help\u201d and they\u2019re here \u201canytime\u201d and that they\u2019re always around if I \u201cneed someone to talk to,\u201d I tell them I\u2019d love that.</p><p>I tell them I\u2019d really appreciate that.</p><p>I tell them I\u2019d love to have a friend to talk to.</p><p>Maybe sometime.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you back into your suit,\u201d Sara says to me.</p> <p>The air down here is cool and cold and often damp, the winter winds relentless as they whip the world above our heads into submission. Even in my suit I feel the chill, especially early in the morning, especially right now. Sonya and Sara are helping me out of this hospital dress and back into my normal uniform and I\u2019m shaking in my skin. Only once they\u2019ve zipped me up does the material begin to react to my body temperature, but I\u2019m still so weak from being in bed for so long that I\u2019m struggling to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t need a wheelchair,\u201d I tell Sara for the third time. \u201cThank you\u2014really\u2014I-I appreciate it,\u201d I stammer, \u201cbut I need to get the blood flowing in my legs. I have to be strong on my feet.\u201d I have to be strong, period.</p><p>Castle and Adam are waiting for me in my room.</p><p>Sonya told me that while I was talking to Kenji, she and Sara went to notify Castle that I was awake. So. Now they\u2019re there. Waiting for me. In the room I share with Sonya and Sara. And I\u2019m so afraid of what is about to happen that I\u2019m worried I might conveniently forget how to get to my own room. Because I\u2019m fairly certain that whatever I\u2019m about to hear isn\u2019t going to be good.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t walk back to the room by yourself,\u201d Sara is saying. \u201cYou can hardly stand on your own\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I insist. I try to smile. \u201cReally, I should be able to manage as long as I can stay close to the wall. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back to normal just as soon as I start moving.\u201d</p><p>Sonya and Sara glance at each other before scrutinizing my face. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d they ask at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell them, this time more earnestly. \u201cIt feels a lot better. Really. Thank you so much.\u201d</p> <p>The cuts are practically healed and I can actually move my fingers now. I inspect the brand-new, thinner bandage they\u2019ve wrapped across my knuckles. The girls explained to me that most of the damage was internal; it seems I traumatized whatever invisible bone in my body is responsible for my curse \u201cgift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Sara says, shaking her head. \u201cWe\u2019re walking you back to the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014please\u2014it\u2019s okay\u2014\u201d I try to protest but they\u2019re already grabbing my arms and I\u2019m too feeble to fight back. \u201cThis is unnecessary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d they chorus.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to go through the trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d they chorus again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m really not\u2014\u201d But they\u2019re already leading me out of the room and down the hall and I\u2019m hobbling along between them. \u201cI promise I\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell them. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Sonya and Sara share a loaded look before they smile at me, not unkindly, but there\u2019s an awkward silence between us as we move through the halls. I spot people walking past us and immediately duck my head. I don\u2019t want to make eye contact with anyone right now. I can\u2019t even imagine what they must\u2019ve heard about the damage I\u2019ve caused. I know I\u2019ve managed to confirm all of their worst fears about me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re only afraid of you because they don\u2019t know you,\u201d Sara says quietly.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Sonya adds. \u201cWe barely know you and we think you\u2019re great.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m blushing fiercely, wondering why embarrassment always feels like ice water in my veins. It\u2019s like all of my insides are freezing even though my skin is burning hot too hot.</p><p>I hate this.</p><p>I hate this feeling.</p><p>Sonya and Sara stop abruptly. \u201cHere we are,\u201d they say together.</p><p>We\u2019re in front of our bedroom door. I try to unlatch myself from their arms but they stop me. Insist on staying with me until they\u2019re sure I\u2019ve gotten inside okay.</p><p>So I stay with them.</p><p>And I knock on my own door, because I\u2019m not sure what else to do.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting just a few seconds, just a few moments for fate to answer when I realize the full impact of Sonya\u2019s and Sara\u2019s presence beside me. They\u2019re offering me smiles that are supposed to be encouraging, bracing, reinforcing. They\u2019re trying to lend me their strength because they know I\u2019m about to face something that isn\u2019t going to make me happy.</p><p>And this thought makes me happy.</p><p>If only for a fleeting moment.</p><p>Because I think wow, I imagine this is what it\u2019s like to have friends.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>Castle opens the door just enough for me to see his face. He nods at me. Glances down at my injured hand. Back up at my face. \u201cVery good,\u201d he says, mostly to himself. \u201cGood, good. I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re doing better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I manage to say. \u201cI\u2014th-thank you, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d he says to Sonya and Sara. He offers them a bright, genuine smile. \u201cThank you for all you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d</p><p>They nod. Squeeze my arms once before letting go and I sway for just a second before I find my footing. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I tell them as they try to reach for me. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>They nod again. Wave, just a little, as they back away.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Castle says to me.</p><p>I follow him in.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>1 bunk bed on one side of the wall.</p><p>1 single bed on the other side.</p><p>That\u2019s all this room consists of.</p><p>That, and Adam, who is sitting on my single bed, elbows propped up on his knees, face in his hands. Castle shuts the door behind us, and Adam startles. Jumps up.</p><p>\u201cJuliette,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s not looking at me; he\u2019s looking at all of me. His eyes are searching my body as if to ensure I\u2019m still intact, arms and legs and everything in between. It\u2019s only when he finds my face that he meets my gaze; I step into the sea of blue in his eyes, dive right in and drown. I feel like someone\u2019s punched a fist into my lungs and snatched up all my oxygen.</p><p>\u201cPlease, have a seat, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d Castle gestures to Sonya\u2019s bottom bunk, the bed right across from where Adam is sitting. I make my way over slowly, trying not to betray the dizziness, the nausea I\u2019m feeling. My chest is rising and falling too quickly.</p><p>I drop my hands into my lap.</p><p>I feel Adam\u2019s presence in this room like a real weight against my chest but I choose to study the careful wrapping of my new bandage\u2014the gauze stretched tight across the knuckles of my right hand\u2014because I\u2019m too much of a coward to look up. I want nothing more than to go to him, to have him hold me, to transport me back to the few moments of bliss I\u2019ve ever known in my life but there\u2019s something gnawing at my core, scraping at my insides, telling me that something is wrong and it\u2019s probably best if I stay exactly where I am.</p><p>Castle is standing in the space between the beds, between me and Adam. He\u2019s staring at the wall, hands clasped behind his back. His voice is quiet when he says, \u201cI am very, very disappointed in your behavior, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>Hot, terrible shame creeps up my neck and forces my head down again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Castle takes a deep breath. Exhales very slowly. \u201cI have to be frank with you,\u201d he says, \u201cand admit that I\u2019m not ready to discuss what happened just yet. I am still too upset to be able to speak about the matter calmly. Your actions,\u201d he says, \u201cwere childish. Selfish. Thoughtless! The damage you caused\u2014the years of work that went into building and planning that room, I can\u2019t even begin to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He catches himself, swallows hard.</p><p>\u201cThat will be a subject,\u201d he says steadily, \u201cfor another time. Perhaps just between the two of us. But I am here today because Mr. Kent asked me to be here.\u201d</p><p>I look up. Look at Castle. Look at Adam.</p><p>Adam looks like he wants to run.</p><p>I decide I can\u2019t wait any longer. \u201cYou\u2019ve learned something about him,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s less of a question than it is a fact. It\u2019s so obvious. There\u2019s no other reason why Adam would bring Castle here to talk to me.</p><p>Something terrible has already happened. Something terrible is about to happen.</p><p>I can feel it.</p><p>Adam is staring at me now, unblinking, his hands in fists pressed into his thighs. He looks nervous; scared. I don\u2019t know what to do except to stare back at him. I don\u2019t know how to offer him comfort. I don\u2019t even know how to smile right now. I feel like I\u2019m trapped in someone else\u2019s story.</p><p>Castle nods, once, slowly.</p><p>Says, \u201cYes. Yes, we\u2019ve discovered the very intriguing nature of Mr. Kent\u2019s ability.\u201d He walks toward the wall and leans against it, allowing me a clearer view of Adam. \u201cWe believe we now understand why he\u2019s able to touch you, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>Adam turns away, presses one of his fists to his mouth. His hand looks like it might be shaking but he, at least, seems to be doing better than I am. Because my insides are screaming and my head is on fire and panic is stepping on my throat, suffocating me to death. Bad news offers no returns once received. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I fix my eyes on the floor and count stones and sounds and cracks and nothing.</p><p>1</p><p>2, 3, 4</p><p>1</p> <p>2, 3, 4</p><p>1</p><p>2, 3, 4</p><p>\u201cHe ... can disable things,\u201d Castle says to me.</p><p>5, 6, 7, 8 million times I blink, confused. All my numbers crash to the floor, adding and subtracting and multiplying and dividing. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>This news is wrong. This news doesn\u2019t sound horrible at all.</p><p>\u201cThe discovery was quite accidental, actually,\u201d Castle explains. \u201cWe weren\u2019t having much luck with any of the tests we\u2019d been running. But then one day I was in the middle of a training exercise, and Mr. Kent was trying to get my attention. He touched my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>Wait for it.</p><p>\u201cAnd ... suddenly,\u201d Castle says, pulling in a breath, \u201cI couldn\u2019t perform. It was as if\u2014as if a wire inside of my body had been cut. I felt it right away. He wanted my attention and he inadvertently shut me off in an attempt to redirect my focus. It was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve now been working with him to see if he can control his ability at will. And,\u201d Castle adds, excited, \u201cwe want to see if he can project.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Mr. Kent does not need to make contact with the skin\u2014I was wearing my blazer when he touched my arm. So this means he\u2019s already projecting, if only just a little bit. And I believe, with some work, he\u2019ll be able to extend his gift to a greater surface area.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what that means.</p> <p>I try to meet Adam\u2019s eyes; I want him to tell me these things himself but he won\u2019t look up. He won\u2019t speak and I don\u2019t understand. This doesn\u2019t seem like bad news. In fact, it sounds quite good, which can\u2019t be right. I turn to Castle. \u201cSo Adam can just make someone else\u2019s power\u2014their gift\u2014whatever it is\u2014he can just make it stop? He can turn it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appears that way, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tested this on anyone else?\u201d</p><p>Castle looks offended. \u201cOf course we have. We\u2019ve tried it on every gifted member at Omega Point.\u201d</p><p>But something isn\u2019t making sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat about when he arrived?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd he was injured? And the girls were able to heal him? Why didn\u2019t he cut off their abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Castle nods. Clears his throat. \u201cYes. Very astute, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d He paces the length of the room. \u201cThis ... is where the explanation gets a little tricky. After much study, we\u2019ve been able to conclude that his ability is a kind of ... defense mechanism. One that he does not yet know how to control. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been working on autopilot his entire life, even though it only works to disable other preternatural abilities. If there was ever a risk, if Mr. Kent was ever in any state of danger, in any situation where his body was on high alert, feeling threatened or at risk of injury, his ability automatically set in.\u201d</p><p>He stops. Looks at me. Really looks at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you first met, for example, Mr. Kent was working as a soldier, on guard, always aware of the risks in his surroundings. He was in a constant state of electricum\u2014a term we use to define when our Energy is \u2018on,\u2019 so to speak\u2014because he was always in a state of danger.\u201d Castle tucks his hands into his blazer pockets. \u201cA series of tests have further shown that his body temperature rises when he is in a state of electricum\u2014just a couple of degrees higher than normal. His elevated body temperature indicates that he is exerting more energy than usual to sustain this. And, in short,\u201d Castle says, \u201cthis constant exertion has been exhausting him. Weakening his defenses, his immune system, his self-control.\u201d</p><p>His elevated body temperature.</p><p>That\u2019s why Adam\u2019s skin was always so hot when we were together. Why it was always so intense when he was with me. His ability was working to fight mine. His energy was working to defuse mine.</p><p>It was exhausting him. Weakening his defenses.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>God.</p><p>\u201cYour physical relationship with Mr. Kent,\u201d Castle says, \u201cis, in truth, none of my business. But because of the very unique nature of your gifts, it\u2019s been of great interest to me on a purely scientific level. But you must know, Ms. Ferrars, that though these new developments no doubt fascinate me, I take absolutely no pleasure in them. You\u2019ve made it clear that you do not think much of my character, but you must believe that I would never find joy in your troubles.\u201d</p><p>My troubles.</p><p>My troubles have arrived fashionably late to this conversation, inconsiderate beasts that they are.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease just tell me what the problem is. There\u2019s a problem, isn\u2019t there? Something is wrong.\u201d I look at Adam but he\u2019s still staring away, at the wall, at everything but at my face, and I feel myself rising to my feet, trying to get his attention. \u201cAdam? Do you know? Do you know what he\u2019s talking about? Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars,\u201d Castle says quickly. \u201cI beg you to sit down. I know this must be difficult for you, but you must let me finish. I\u2019ve asked Mr. Kent not to speak until I\u2019m done explaining everything. Someone needs to deliver this information in a clear, rational manner, and I\u2019m afraid he is in no position to do so.\u201d</p><p>I fall back onto the bed.</p><p>Castle lets out a breath. \u201cYou brought up an excellent point earlier\u2014about why Mr. Kent was able to interact with our healer twins when he first arrived. But it was different with them,\u201d Castle says. \u201cHe was weak; he knew he needed help. His body would not\u2014and, more importantly, could not\u2014refuse that kind of medical attention. He was vulnerable and therefore unable to defend himself even if he wanted to. The last of his Energy was depleted when he arrived. He felt safe and he was seeking aid; his body was out of immediate danger and therefore unafraid, not primed for a defensive strategy.\u201d</p><p>Castle looks up. Looks me in the eye.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kent has begun having a similar problem with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he doesn\u2019t know how to control his abilities yet. It\u2019s something we\u2019re hoping we can work on, but it will take a lot of time\u2014a lot of energy and focus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d I hear myself ask, my words heavy with panic, \u201cthat he has already begun having a similar problem with me?\u201d</p><p>Castle takes a small breath. \u201cIt\u2014it seems that he is weakest when he is with you. The more time he spends in your company, the less threatened he feels. And the more ... intimate you become,\u201d Castle says, looking distinctly uncomfortable, \u201cthe less control he has over his body.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe is too open, too vulnerable with you. And in the few moments his defenses have slipped thus far, he\u2019s already felt the very distinct pain associated with your touch.\u201d</p><p>There it is.</p><p>There\u2019s my head, lying on the floor, cracked right open, my brain spilling out in every direction and I can\u2019t I don\u2019t I can\u2019t even I\u2019m sitting here, struck, numb, slightly dizzy.</p><p>Horrified.</p><p>Adam is not immune to me.</p><p>Adam has to work to defend himself against me and I\u2019m exhausting him. I\u2019m making him sick and I\u2019m weakening his body and if he ever slips again. If he ever forgets. If he ever makes a mistake or loses focus or becomes too aware of the fact that he\u2019s using his gift to control what I might do\u2014</p><p>I could hurt him.</p><p>I could kill him.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Castle is staring at me.</p><p>Waiting for my reaction.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to spit the chalk out of my mouth long enough to string a sentence together.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars,\u201d he says, rushing to speak now, \u201cwe are working with Mr. Kent to help him control his abilities. He\u2019s going to train\u2014just as you are\u2014to learn how to exercise this particular element of who he is. It will take some time until we can be certain he\u2019ll be safe with you, but it will be all right, I assure you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m standing up. \u201cNo no no no no.\u201d I\u2019m tripping sideways. \u201cNO.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at my feet and at my hands and at these walls and I want to scream. I want to run. I want to fall to my knees. I want to curse the world for cursing me, for torturing me, for taking away the only good thing I\u2019ve ever known and I\u2019m stumbling toward the door, searching for an outlet, for escape from this nightmare that is my life and</p><p>\u201cJuliette\u2014please\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of Adam\u2019s voice stops my heart. I force myself to turn around. To face him.</p><p>But the moment he meets my eyes his mouth falls closed. His arm is outstretched toward me, trying to stop me from 10 feet away and I want to sob and laugh at the same time, at the terrible hilarity of it all.</p><p>He will not touch me.</p><p>I will not allow him to touch me.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars,\u201d Castle says gently. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to stomach right now, but I\u2019ve already told you this isn\u2019t permanent. With enough training\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you touch me,\u201d I ask Adam, my voice breaking, \u201cis it an effort for you? Does it exhaust you? Does it drain you to have to constantly be fighting me and what I am?\u201d</p><p>Adam tries to answer. He tries to say something but instead he says nothing and his unspoken words are so much worse.</p><p>I spin in Castle\u2019s direction. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d My voice is even shakier now, too close to tears. \u201cThat he\u2019s using his Energy to extinguish mine, and that if he ever forgets\u2014if he ever gets c-carried away or t-too vulnerable\u2014that I could hurt him\u2014that I\u2019ve already h-hurt him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yes,\u201d he says, \u201cfor now, at least, that\u2019s all we know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I\u2019m tripping to reach the door again but my legs are still weak, my head is still spinning, my eyes are blurring and the world is being washed of all its color when I feel familiar arms wrap around my waist, tugging me backward.</p><p>\u201cJuliette,\u201d he says, so urgently, \u201cplease, we have to talk about this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d My voice is barely a breath. \u201cAdam, please\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastle.\u201d Adam cuts me off. \u201cDo you think you can give us some time alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He startles. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, just a beat too late. \u201cSure, yes, yes, of course.\u201d He walks to the door. Hesitates. \u201cI will\u2014well, right. Yes. You know where to find me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d He nods at both of us, offers me a strained sort of smile, and leaves the room. The door clicks shut behind him.</p><p>Silence pours into the space between us.</p><p>\u201cAdam, please,\u201d I finally say, and hate myself for saying it. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I feel his breath on the back of my neck and it\u2019s killing me to be so close to him. It\u2019s killing me to know that I have to rebuild the walls I\u2019d so carelessly demolished the moment he came back into my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.

You were torturing yourself down there just to figure out what was happening to you. You\u2019re torturing yourself right now just trying to find a way to fix this.\u201d</p><p>He looks relieved.</p><p>Relieved and confused and afraid to be happy all at the same time. \u201cBut something\u2019s wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re crying. Why are you crying if you\u2019re not upset?\u201d</p><p>I actually laugh this time. Out loud. Laugh and hiccup and want to die, so desperately. \u201cBecause I was an idiot for thinking things could be different,\u201d I tell him. \u201cFor thinking you were a fluke. For thinking my life could ever be better than it was, that I could ever be better than I was.\u201d I try to speak again but instead clamp a hand over my mouth like I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m about to say. I force myself to swallow the stone in my throat. I drop my hand. \u201cAdam.\u201d My voice is raw, aching. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019s frozen in place, his eyes too wide, his chest rising and falling too fast. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t touch me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me and I\u2019ve already hurt you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo\u2014Juliette\u2014\u201d Adam is up, he\u2019s cleared the room, he\u2019s on his knees next to me and he reaches for my hands but I have to snatch them back because my gloves were ruined, ruined in the research lab and now my fingers are bare.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>Adam stares at the hands I\u2019ve hidden behind my back like I\u2019ve slapped him across the face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks, but he\u2019s not looking at me. He\u2019s still staring at my hands. Barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this to you.\u201d I shake my head too hard. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the reason why you\u2019re hurting yourself or weakening yourself and I don\u2019t want you to always have to worry that I might accidentally kill you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Juliette, listen to me.\u201d He\u2019s desperate now, his eyes up, searching my face. \u201cI was worried too, okay? I was worried too. Really worried. I thought\u2014I thought that maybe\u2014I don\u2019t know, I thought maybe it would be bad or that maybe we wouldn\u2019t be able to work through it but I talked to Castle. I talked to him and explained everything and he said that I just have to learn to control it. I\u2019ll learn how to turn it on and off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when you\u2019re with me? Except when we\u2019re together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014what? No, especially when we\u2019re together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching me\u2014being with me\u2014it takes a physical toll on you! You run a fever when we\u2019re together, Adam, did you realize that? You\u2019d get sick just trying to fight me off\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hearing me\u2014please\u2014I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ll learn to control all of that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I ask, and I can actually feel my bones breaking, 1 by 1.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean? I\u2019ll learn now\u2014I\u2019m learning now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s it going? Is it easy?\u201d</p><p>His mouth falls closed but he\u2019s looking at me, struggling with some kind of emotion, struggling to find composure. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d he finally asks. \u201cAre you\u201d\u2014he\u2019s breathing hard\u2014\u201care you\u2014I mean\u2014you don\u2019t want to make this work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Juliette?\u201d He\u2019s up now, a shaky hand caught in his hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t want to be with me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m on my feet, blinking back the tears burning my eyes, desperate to run to him but unable to move. My voice breaks when I speak. \u201cOf course I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>He drops his hand from his hair. Looks at me with eyes so open and vulnerable but his jaw is tight, his muscles are tense, his upper body is heaving from the effort to inhale, exhale. \u201cThen what\u2019s happening right now? Because something is happening right now and it doesn\u2019t feel okay,\u201d he says, his voice catching. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel okay, Juliette, it feels like the opposite of whatever the hell okay is and I really just want to hold you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to h-hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt me,\u201d he says, and then he\u2019s in front of me, looking at me, pleading with me. \u201cI swear. It\u2019ll be fine\u2014we\u2019ll be fine\u2014and I\u2019m better now. I\u2019ve been working on it and I\u2019m stronger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, Adam, please.\u201d I\u2019m begging him, backing away, wiping furiously at the tears escaping down my face. \u201cIt\u2019s better for you this way. It\u2019s better for you to just stay away from me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what I want\u2014you\u2019re not asking me what I want\u2014,\u201d he says, following me as I dodge his advances. \u201cI want to be with you and I don\u2019t give a damn if it\u2019s hard. I still want it. I still want you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trapped.</p><p>I\u2019m caught between him and the wall and I have nowhere to go and I wouldn\u2019t want to go even if I could. I don\u2019t want to have to fight this even though there\u2019s something inside of me screaming that it\u2019s wrong to be so selfish, to allow him to be with me if it\u2019ll only end up hurting him. But he\u2019s looking at me, looking at me like I\u2019m killing him and I realize I\u2019m hurting him more by trying to stay away.</p><p>I\u2019m shaking. Wanting him so desperately and knowing now, more than ever, that what I want will have to wait. And I hate that it has to be this way. I hate it so much I could scream.</p><p>But maybe we can try.</p><p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d Adam\u2019s voice is hoarse, broken with feeling. His hands are at my waist, trembling just a little, waiting for my permission. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t protest.</p><p>He\u2019s breathing harder now, leaning into me, resting his forehead against my shoulder. He places his hands flat against the center of my stomach, only to inch them down my body, slowly, so slowly and I gasp.</p><p>There\u2019s an earthquake happening in my bones, tectonic plates shifting from panic to pleasure as his fingers take their time moving around my thighs, up my back, over my shoulders and down my arms. He hesitates at my wrists. This is where the fabric ends, where my skin begins.</p><p>But he takes a breath.</p><p>And he takes my hands.</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m paralyzed, searching his face for any sign of pain or danger but then we both exhale and I see him attempt a smile with new hope, a new optimism that maybe everything is going to work out.</p><p>But then he blinks and his eyes change.</p><p>His eyes are deeper now. Desperate. Hungry. He\u2019s searching me like he\u2019s trying to read the words etched inside of me and I can already feel the heat of his body, the power in his limbs, the strength in his chest and I don\u2019t have time to stop him before he\u2019s kissing me.</p><p>His left hand is cupping the back of my head, his right tightening around my waist, pressing me hard against him and destroying every rational thought I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s deep. So strong. It\u2019s an introduction to a side of him I\u2019ve never known before and I\u2019m gasping gasping gasping for air.</p><p>It\u2019s hot rain and humid days and broken thermostats. It\u2019s screaming teakettles and raging steam engines and wanting to take your clothes off just to feel a breeze.</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of kiss that makes you realize oxygen is overrated.</p><p>And I know I shouldn\u2019t be doing this. I know it\u2019s probably stupid and irresponsible after everything we\u2019ve just learned but someone would have to shoot me to make me want to stop.</p><p>I\u2019m pulling at his shirt, desperate for a raft or a life preserver or something, anything to anchor me to reality but he breaks away to catch his breath and rips off his shirt, tosses it to the floor, pulls me into his arms and we both fall onto my bed.</p><p>Somehow I end up on top of him.</p><p>He reaches up only to pull me down and he\u2019s kissing me, my throat, my cheeks, and my hands are searching his body, exploring the lines, the planes, the muscle and he pulls back, his forehead is pressed against my own and his eyes are squeezed shut when he says, \u201cHow is it possible,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I\u2019m this close to you and it\u2019s killing me that you\u2019re still so far away?\u201d</p><p>And I remember I promised him, 2 weeks ago, that once he got better, once he\u2019d healed, I would memorize every inch of his body with my lips.</p><p>I figure now is probably a good time to fulfill that promise.</p><p>I start at his mouth, move to his cheek, under his jawline, down his neck to his shoulders and his arms, which are wrapped around me. His hands are skimming my suit and he\u2019s so hot, so tense from the effort to remain still but I can hear his heart beating hard, too fast against his chest.</p><p>Against mine.</p><p>I trace the white bird soaring across his skin, a tattoo of the one impossible thing I hope to see in my life. A bird. White with streaks of gold like a crown atop its head.</p><p>It will fly.</p><p>Birds don\u2019t fly, is what the scientists say, but history says they used to. And one day I want to see it. I want to touch it. I want to watch it fly like it should, like it hasn\u2019t been able to in my dreams.</p><p>I dip down to kiss the yellow crown of its head, tattooed deep into Adam\u2019s chest. I hear the spike in his breathing.</p><p>\u201cI love this tattoo,\u201d I tell him, looking up to meet his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it since we got here. I haven\u2019t seen you without a shirt on since we got here,\u201d I whisper. \u201cDo you still sleep without your shirt on?\u201d</p><p>But Adam answers with a strange smile, like he\u2019s laughing at his own private joke.</p><p>He takes my hand from his chest and tugs me down so we\u2019re facing each other, and it\u2019s strange, because I haven\u2019t felt a breeze since we got here, but it\u2019s like the wind has found a home in my body and it\u2019s funneling through my lungs, blowing through my blood, mingling with my breath and making it hard for me to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep at all,\u201d he says to me, his voice so low I have to strain to hear it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be without you every night.\u201d His left hand is threaded in my hair, his right wrapped around me. \u201cGod I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he says, his words a husky whisper in my ear. \u201cJuliette.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I am</p><p>lit</p><p>on fire.</p><p>It\u2019s like swimming in molasses, this kiss, it\u2019s like being dipped in gold, this kiss, it\u2019s like I\u2019m diving into an ocean of emotion and I\u2019m too swept up in the current to realize I\u2019m drowning and nothing even matters anymore. Not my hand which no longer seems to hurt, not this room that isn\u2019t entirely mine, not this war we\u2019re supposed to be fighting, not my worries about who or what I am and what I might become.</p> <p>This is the only thing that matters.</p><p>This.</p><p>This moment. These lips. This strong body pressed against me and these firm hands finding a way to bring me closer and I know I want so much more of him, I want all of him, I want to feel the beauty of this love with the tips of my fingers and the palms of my hands and every fiber and bone in my being.</p><p>I want all of it.</p><p>My hands are in his hair and I\u2019m reeling him in until he\u2019s practically on top of me and he breaks for air but I pull him back, kissing his neck, his shoulders, his chest, running my hands down his back and the sides of his torso and it\u2019s incredible, the energy, the unbelievable power I feel in just being with him, touching him, holding him like this. I\u2019m alive with a rush of adrenaline so potent, so euphoric that I feel rejuvenated, indestructible\u2014</p> <p>I jerk back.</p><p>Push away so quickly that I\u2019m scrambling and I fall off the bed only to slam my head into the stone floor and I\u2019m swaying as I attempt to stand, struggling to hear the sound of his voice but all I hear are wheezing, paralyzed breaths and I can\u2019t think straight, I can\u2019t see anything and everything is blurry and I can\u2019t, I refuse to believe this is actually happening\u2014</p><p>\u201cJ-Jul\u2014\u201d He tries to speak. \u201cI-I c-ca\u2014\u201d</p><p>And I fall to my knees.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Screaming like I\u2019ve never screamed in my entire life.</p> <p>FIFTEEN</p><p>I count everything.</p><p>Even numbers, odd numbers, multiples of 10. I count the ticks of the clock I count the tocks of the clock I count the lines between the lines on a sheet of paper. I count the broken beats of my heart I count my pulse and my blinks and the number of tries it takes to inhale enough oxygen for my lungs. I stay like this I stand like this I count like this until the feeling stops. Until the tears stop spilling, until my fists stop shaking, until my heart stops aching.</p><p>There are never enough numbers.</p><p>Adam is in the medical wing.</p><p>He is in the medical wing and I have been asked not to visit him. I have been asked to give him space, to give him time to heal, to leave him the hell alone. He is going to be okay, is what Sonya and Sara told me. They told me not to worry, that everything would be fine, but their smiles were a little less exuberant than they usually are and I\u2019m beginning to wonder if they, too, are finally beginning to see me for what I truly am.</p><p>A horrible, selfish, pathetic monster.</p><p>I took what I wanted. I knew better and I took it anyway. Adam couldn\u2019t have known, he could never have known what it would be like to really suffer at my hands. He was innocent of the depth of it, of the cruel reality of it. He\u2019d only felt bursts of my power, according to Castle. He\u2019d only felt small stabs of it and was able and aware enough to let go without feeling the full effects.</p> <p>But I knew better.</p><p>I knew what I was capable of. I knew what the risks were and I did it anyway. I allowed myself to forget, to be reckless, to be greedy and stupid because I wanted what I couldn\u2019t have. I wanted to believe in fairy tales and happy endings and pure possibility. I wanted to pretend that I was a better person than I actually am but instead I managed to out myself as the terror I\u2019ve always been accused of being.</p><p>My parents were right to get rid of me.</p><p>Castle isn\u2019t even speaking to me.</p><p>Kenji, however, still expects me to show up at 6:00 a.m. for whatever it is we\u2019re supposed to be doing tomorrow, and I find I\u2019m actually kind of grateful for the distraction. I only wish it would come sooner. Life will be solitary for me from now on, just as it always has been, and it\u2019s best if I find a way to fill my time.</p><p>To forget.</p><p>It keeps hitting me, over and over and over again, this complete and utter loneliness. This absence of him in my life, this realization that I will never know the warmth of his body, the tenderness of his touch ever again. This reminder of who I am and what I\u2019ve done and where I belong.</p><p>But I\u2019ve accepted the terms and conditions of my new reality.</p><p>I cannot be with him. I will not be with him. I won\u2019t risk hurting him again, won\u2019t risk becoming the creature he\u2019s always afraid of, too scared to touch, to kiss, to hold. I don\u2019t want to keep him from having a normal life with someone who isn\u2019t going to accidentally kill him all the time.</p><p>So I have to cut myself out of his world. Cut him out of mine.</p><p>It\u2019s much harder now. So much harder to resign myself to an existence of ice and emptiness now that I\u2019ve known heat, urgency, tenderness, and passion; the extraordinary comfort of being able to touch another being.</p><p>It\u2019s humiliating.</p><p>That I thought I could slip into the role of a regular girl with a regular boyfriend; that I thought I could live out the stories I\u2019d read in so many books as a child.</p><p>Me.</p><p>Juliette with a dream.</p><p>Just the thought of it is enough to fill me with mortification. How embarrassing for me, that I thought I could change what I\u2019d been dealt. That I looked in the mirror and actually liked the pale face staring back at me.</p><p>How sad.</p><p>I always dared to identify with the princess, the one who runs away and finds a fairy godmother to transform her into a beautiful girl with a bright future. I clung to something like hope, to a thread of maybes and possiblys and perhapses. But I should\u2019ve listened when my parents told me that things like me aren\u2019t allowed to have dreams. Things like me are better off destroyed, is what my mother said to me.</p><p>And I\u2019m beginning to think they were right. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if I should just bury myself in the ground before I remember that technically, I already am. I never even needed a shovel.</p><p>It\u2019s strange.</p><p>How hollow I feel.</p><p>Like there might be echoes inside of me. Like I\u2019m one of those chocolate rabbits they used to sell around Easter, the ones that were nothing more than a sweet shell encapsulating a world of nothing. I\u2019m like that.</p><p>I encapsulate a world of nothing.</p><p>Everyone here hates me. The tenuous bonds of friendship I\u2019d begun to form have now been destroyed. Kenji is tired of me. Castle is disgusted, disappointed, angry, even. I\u2019ve caused nothing but trouble since I arrived and the 1 person who\u2019s ever tried to see good in me is now paying for it with his life.</p><p>The 1 person who\u2019s ever dared to touch me.</p><p>Well. 1 of 2.</p><p>I find myself thinking about Warner too much.</p><p>I remember his eyes and his odd kindness and his cruel, calculating demeanor. I remember the way he looked at me when I first jumped out the window to escape and I remember the horror on his face when I pointed his own gun at his heart and then I wonder at my preoccupation with this person who is nothing like me and still so similar.</p><p>I wonder if I will have to face him again, sometime soon, and I wonder how he will greet me. I have no idea if he wants to keep me alive anymore, especially not after I tried to kill him, and I have no idea what could propel a 19-year-old man boy person into such a miserable, murderous lifestyle and then I realize I\u2019m lying to myself. Because I do know. Because I might be the only person who could ever understand him.</p><p>And this is what I\u2019ve learned:</p><p>I know that he is a tortured soul who, like me, never grew up with the warmth of friendship or love or peaceful coexistence. I know that his father is the leader of The Reestablishment and applauds his son\u2019s murders instead of condemning them and I know that Warner has no idea what it\u2019s like to be normal.</p><p>Neither do I.</p><p>He\u2019s spent his life fighting to fulfill his father\u2019s expectations of global domination without questioning why, without considering the repercussions, without stopping long enough to weigh the worth of a human life. He has a power, a strength, a position in society that enables him to do too much damage and he owns it with pride. He kills without remorse or regret and he wants me to join him. He sees me for what I am and expects me to live up to that potential.</p><p>Scary, monstrous girl with a lethal touch. Sad, pathetic girl with nothing else to contribute to this world. Good for nothing but a weapon, a tool for torture and taking control. That\u2019s what he wants from me.</p><p>And lately I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s wrong. Lately, I\u2019m not sure of anything. Lately, I don\u2019t know anything about anything I\u2019ve ever believed in, not anymore, and I know the least about who I am. Warner\u2019s whispers pace the space in my head, telling me I could be more, I could be stronger, I could be everything; I could be so much more than a scared little girl.</p><p>He says I could be power.</p><p>But still, I hesitate.</p><p>Still, I see no appeal in the life he\u2019s offered. I see no future in it. I take no pleasure in it. Still, I tell myself, despite everything, I know that I do not want to hurt people. It\u2019s not something I crave. And even if the world hates me, even if they never stop hating me, I will never avenge myself on an innocent person. If I die, if I am killed, if I am murdered in my sleep, I will at least die with a shred of dignity. A piece of humanity that is still entirely mine, entirely under my control. And I will not allow anyone to take that from me.</p><p>So I have to keep remembering that Warner and I are 2 different words.</p><p>We are synonyms but not the same.</p><p>Synonyms know each other like old colleagues, like a set of friends who\u2019ve seen the world together. They swap stories, reminisce about their origins and forget that though they are similar, they are entirely different, and though they share a certain set of attributes, one can never be the other. Because a quiet night is not the same as a silent one, a firm man is not the same as a steady one, and a bright light is not the same as a brilliant one because the way they wedge themselves into a sentence changes everything.</p><p>They are not the same.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent my entire life fighting to be better. Fighting to be stronger. Because unlike Warner I don\u2019t want to be a terror on this Earth. I don\u2019t want to hurt people.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to use my power to cripple anyone.</p><p>But then I look at my own 2 hands and I remember exactly what I\u2019m capable of. I remember exactly what I\u2019ve done and I\u2019m too aware of what I might do. Because it\u2019s so difficult to fight what you cannot control and right now I can\u2019t even control my own imagination as it grips my hair and drags me into the dark.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Loneliness is a strange sort of thing.</p><p>It creeps up on you, quiet and still, sits by your side in the dark, strokes your hair as you sleep. It wraps itself around your bones, squeezing so tight you almost can\u2019t breathe. It leaves lies in your heart, lies next to you at night, leaches the light out from every corner. It\u2019s a constant companion, clasping your hand only to yank you down when you\u2019re struggling to stand up.</p><p>You wake up in the morning and wonder who you are. You fail to fall asleep at night and tremble in your skin. You doubt you doubt you doubt</p><p>do I </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>don\u2019t I</p><p>should I</p><p>why won\u2019t I</p><p>And even when you\u2019re ready to let go.

I haven\u2019t received any replacements, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d Kenji says to me, cocking his head, watching me with eyes both surprised and curious.</p><p>I shrug and try to hide my face, unwilling to admit that I hardly slept through the night. I\u2019ve been awake since 3:00 a.m., fully dressed and ready to go by 4:00. I\u2019ve been dying for an excuse to fill my mind with things that have nothing to do with my own thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d I lie. \u201cWhat are we doing today?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head a bit. Squints at something over my shoulder as he speaks to me. \u201cYou, um\u201d\u2014he clears his throat\u2014\u201cyou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cJust, you know.\u201d A haphazard gesture toward my face. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good, princess. You look kind of like you did that first day you showed up with Warner back on base. All scared and dead-looking and, no offense, but you look like you could use a shower.\u201d</p><p>I smile and pretend I can\u2019t feel my face shaking from the effort. I try to relax my shoulders, try to look normal, calm, when I say, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d I drop my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014it\u2019s a little cold down here, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m not used to being without my gloves.\u201d</p><p>Kenji is nodding, still not looking at me. \u201cRight. Well. He\u2019s going to be okay, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Breathing. I\u2019m so bad at breathing.</p><p>\u201cKent.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cYour boyfriend. Adam. He\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>1 word, 1 simple, stupid reminder of him startles the butterflies sleeping in my stomach before I remember that Adam is not my boyfriend anymore. He\u2019s not my anything anymore. He can\u2019t be.</p><p>And the butterflies drop dead.</p> <p>This.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say too brightly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we get going? We should get going, right?\u201d</p><p>Kenji shoots me an odd look but doesn\u2019t comment. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, sure. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Kenji leads me to a door I\u2019ve never seen before. A door belonging to a room I\u2019ve never been in before.</p><p>I hear voices inside.</p><p>Kenji knocks twice before turning the handle and all at once the cacophony overwhelms me. We\u2019re walking into a room bursting with people, faces I\u2019ve only ever seen from far away, people sharing smiles and laughter I\u2019ve never been welcome to. There are individual desks with individual chairs set up in the vast space so that it resembles a classroom. There\u2019s a whiteboard built into the wall next to a monitor blinking with information. I spot Castle. Standing in the corner, looking over a clipboard with such focus that he doesn\u2019t even notice our entry until Kenji shouts a greeting.</p><p>Castle\u2019s entire face lights up.</p><p>I\u2019d noticed it before, the connection between them, but it\u2019s now becoming increasingly apparent to me that Castle harbors a special kind of affection for Kenji. A sweet, proud sort of affection that\u2019s usually reserved for parents. It makes me wonder about the nature of their relationship. Where it began, how it began, what must\u2019ve happened to bring them together. It makes me wonder at how little I know about the people of Omega Point.</p><p>I look around at their eager faces, men and women, youthful and middle-aged, all different ethnicities, shapes, and sizes. They\u2019re interacting with one another like they\u2019re part of a family and I feel a strange sort of pain stabbing at my side, poking holes in me until I deflate.</p><p>It\u2019s like my face is pressed up against the glass, watching a scene from far, far away, wishing and wanting to be a part of something I know I\u2019ll never really be a part of. I forget, sometimes, that there are people out there who still manage to smile every day, despite everything.</p><p>They haven\u2019t lost hope yet.</p><p>Suddenly I feel sheepish, ashamed, even. Daylight makes my thoughts look dark and sad and I want to pretend I\u2019m still optimistic, I want to believe that I\u2019ll find a way to live. That maybe, somehow, there\u2019s still a chance for me somewhere.</p><p>Someone whistles.</p><p>\u201cAll right, everyone,\u201d Kenji calls out, hands cupped around his mouth. \u201cEveryone take a seat, okay? We\u2019re doing another orientation for those of you who\u2019ve never done this before, and I need all of you to get settled for a bit.\u201d He scans the crowd. \u201cRight. Yeah. Everyone just take a seat. Wherever is fine. Lily\u2014you don\u2019t have to\u2014okay, fine, that\u2019s fine. Just settle down. We\u2019re going to get started in five minutes, okay?\u201d He holds up an open palm, fingers splayed. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>I slip into the closest empty seat without looking around. I keep my head down, my eyes focused on the individual grains of wood on the desk as everyone collapses into chairs around me. Finally, I dare to glance to my right. Bright white hair and snow-white skin and clear blue eyes blink back at me.</p><p>Brendan. The electricity boy.</p><p>He smiles. Offers me a 2-finger wave.</p><p>I duck my head.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014hey,\u201d I hear someone say. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I jerk toward my left to find sandy-blond hair and black plastic glasses sitting on a crooked nose. An ironic smile twisted onto a pale face. Winston. I remember him. He interviewed me when I first arrived at Omega Point. Said he was some kind of psychologist. But he also happens to be the one who designed the suit I\u2019m wearing. The gloves I destroyed.</p><p>I think he\u2019s some kind of genius. I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Right now, he\u2019s chewing on the cap of his pen, staring at me. He uses an index finger to push his glasses up the bridge of his nose. I remember he\u2019s asked me a question and I make an effort to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not actually sure,\u201d I tell him. \u201cKenji brought me here but didn\u2019t tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Winston doesn\u2019t seem surprised. He rolls his eyes. \u201cHim with the freaking mysteries all the time. I don\u2019t know why he thinks it\u2019s such a good idea to keep people in suspense. It\u2019s like the guy thinks his life is a movie or something. Always so dramatic about everything. It\u2019s irritating as hell.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m supposed to say to that. I can\u2019t help thinking that Adam would agree with him and then I can\u2019t help thinking about Adam and then I</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d An English accent steps into the conversation. I turn around to see Brendan still smiling at me. \u201cWinston\u2019s always a bit beastly this early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. How early is it?\u201d Winston asks. \u201cI would kick a soldier in the crotch for a cup of coffee right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your own fault you never sleep, mate,\u201d Brendan counters. \u201cYou think you can survive on three hours a night? You\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>Winston drops his chewed-up pen on the desk. Runs a tired hand through his hair. Tugs his glasses off and rubs at his face. \u201cIt\u2019s the freaking patrols. Every goddamn night. Something is going on and it\u2019s getting intense out there. So many soldiers just walking around? What the hell are they doing? I have to actually be awake the whole time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask before I can stop myself. My ears are perked and my interest is piqued. News from the outside is something I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to hear before. Castle was so intent on me focusing all my energy on training that I never heard much more than his constant reminders that we\u2019re running out of time and that I need to learn before it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if things are worse than I thought.</p><p>\u201cThe patrols?\u201d Brendan asks. He waves a knowing hand. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just, we work in shifts, right? In pairs\u2014take turns keeping watch at night,\u201d he explains. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s no problem, just routine, nothing too serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s been weird lately,\u201d Winston cuts in. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re really searching for us now. Like it\u2019s not just some crazy theory anymore. They know we\u2019re a real threat and it\u2019s like they actually have a clue where we are.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever it is, it\u2019s starting to freak me out,\u201d Winston says. \u201cThere are soldiers all over the place, way too close to where we are. We see them on camera,\u201d he says to me, noticing my confusion. \u201cAnd the weirdest part,\u201d he adds, leaning in, lowering his voice, \u201cis that Warner is always with them. Every single night. Walking around, issuing orders I can\u2019t hear. And his arm is still injured. He walks around with it in a sling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner?\u201d My eyes go wide. \u201cHe\u2019s with them? Is that\u2014is that ... unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite odd,\u201d Brendan says. \u201cHe\u2019s CCR\u2014chief commander and regent\u2014of Sector 45. In normal circumstances he would delegate this task to a colonel, a lieutenant, even. His priorities should be on base, overseeing his soldiers.\u201d Brendan shakes his head. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit daft, I think, taking a risk like that. Spending time away from his own camp. Seems strange that he\u2019d be able to get away so many nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Winston says, nodding his head. \u201cExactly.\u201d He points at the 2 of us, stabbing at the air. \u201cAnd it makes you wonder who he\u2019s leaving in charge. The guy doesn\u2019t trust anyone\u2014he\u2019s not known for his delegation skills to begin with\u2014so for him to leave the base behind every night?\u201d A pause. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t add up. Something is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think,\u201d I ask, feeling scared and feeling brave, \u201cthat maybe he\u2019s looking for someone something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Winston exhales. Scratches the side of his nose. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I think. And I\u2019d love to know what the hell he\u2019s looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs, obviously,\u201d Brendan says. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for us.\u201d</p><p>Winston seems unconvinced. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is different. They\u2019ve been searching for us for years, but they\u2019ve never done anything like this. Never spent so much manpower on this kind of a mission. And they\u2019ve never gotten this close.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d I whisper, not trusting myself to posit any of my own theories. Not wanting to think too hard about who what it is, exactly, Warner is searching for. And all the time wondering why these 2 guys are speaking to me so freely, as if I\u2019m trustworthy, as if I\u2019m one of their own.</p><p>I don\u2019t dare mention it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Winston says, picking up his chewed-up pen again. \u201cCrazy. Anyway, if we don\u2019t get a fresh batch of coffee today, I am seriously going to lose my shit.\u201d</p><p>I look around the room. I don\u2019t see coffee anywhere. No food, either. I wonder what that means for Winston. \u201cAre we going to have breakfast before we start?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cToday we get to eat on a different schedule. Besides, we\u2019ll have plenty to choose from when we get back. We get first picks. It\u2019s the only perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back from where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d Brendan says, leaning back in his chair. He points up at the ceiling. \u201cWe\u2019re going up and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gasp, feeling true excitement for the first time. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Winston puts his glasses back on. \u201cAnd it looks like you\u2019re about to get your first introduction to what it is we do here.\u201d He nods at the front of the room, and I see Kenji hauling a huge trunk onto a table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know.\u201d Winston shrugs. Clasps his hands behind his head. \u201cGrand larceny. Armed robbery. That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>I begin to laugh when Brendan stops me. He actually puts his hand on my shoulder and for a moment I\u2019m mildly terrified. Wondering if he\u2019s lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not joking,\u201d Brendan says to me. \u201cAnd I hope you know how to use a gun.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>We look homeless.</p> <p>Which means we look like civilians.</p><p>We\u2019ve moved out of the classroom and into the hallway, and we\u2019re all wearing a similar sort of ensemble, tattered and grayish and frayed. Everyone is adjusting their outfits as we go; Winston slips off his glasses and shoves them into his jacket only to zip up his coat. The collar comes up to his chin and he huddles into it. Lily, one of the other girls among us, wraps a thick scarf around her mouth and pulls the hood of her coat over her head. I see Kenji pull on a pair of gloves and readjust his cargo pants to better hide the gun tucked inside.</p><p>Brendan shifts beside me.</p><p>He pulls a skullcap out of his pocket and tugs it on over his head, zipping his coat up to his neck. It\u2019s startling the way the blackness of the beanie offsets the blue in his eyes to make them even brighter, sharper than they looked before. He flashes me a smile when he catches me watching. Then he tosses me a pair of old gloves 2 sizes too big before bending down to tighten the laces on his boots.</p><p>I take a small breath.</p><p>I try to focus all my energy on where I am, on what I\u2019m doing and what I\u2019m about to do. I tell myself not to think of Adam, not to think about what he\u2019s doing or how he\u2019s healing or what he must be feeling right now. I beg myself not to dwell on my last moments with him, the way he touched me, how he held me, his lips and his hands and his breaths coming in too fast\u2014</p><p>I fail.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but think about how he always tried to protect me, how he nearly lost his life in the process. He was always defending me, always watching out for me, never realizing that it was me, it was always me who was the biggest threat. The most dangerous. He thinks too highly of me, places me on a pedestal I\u2019ve never deserved.</p> <p>I definitely don\u2019t need protection.</p><p>I don\u2019t need anyone to worry for me or wonder about me or risk falling in love with me. I am unstable. I need to be avoided. It\u2019s right that people fear me.</p><p>They should.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Kenji stops beside me, grabs my elbow. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>I nod. Offer him a small smile.</p><p>The clothes I\u2019m wearing are borrowed. The card hanging from my neck, hidden under my suit, is brand-new. Today I was given a fake RR card\u2014a Reestablishment Registration card. It\u2019s proof that I work and live on the compounds; proof that I\u2019m registered as a citizen in regulated territory. Every legal citizen has one. I never did, because I was tossed into an asylum; it was never necessary for someone like me. In fact, I\u2019m fairly certain they just expected me to die in there. Identification was not necessary.</p><p>But this RR card is special.</p><p>Not everyone at Omega Point receives a counterfeit card. Apparently they\u2019re extremely difficult to replicate. They\u2019re thin rectangles made out of a very rare type of titanium, laser-etched with a bar code as well as the owner\u2019s biographical data, and contain a tracking device that monitors the whereabouts of the citizen.</p><p>\u201cRR cards track everything,\u201d Castle explained. \u201cThey\u2019re necessary for entering and exiting compounds, necessary for entering and exiting a person\u2019s place of work. Citizens are paid in REST dollars\u2014wages based on a complicated algorithm that calculates the difficulty of their profession, as well as the number of hours they spend working, in order to determine how much their efforts are worth. This electronic currency is dispensed in weekly installments and automatically uploaded to a chip built into their RR cards. REST dollars can then be exchanged at Supply Centers for food and basic necessities. Losing an RR card,\u201d he said, \u201cmeans losing your livelihood, your earnings, your legal status as a registered citizen.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by a soldier and asked for proof of identification,\u201d Castle continued, \u201cyou must present your RR card. Failure to present your card,\u201d he said, \u201cwill result in ... very unhappy consequences. Citizens who walk around without their cards are considered a threat to The Reestablishment. They are seen as purposely defying the law, as characters worthy of suspicion. Being uncooperative in any way\u2014even if that means you simply do not want your every movement to be tracked and monitored\u2014makes you seem sympathetic to rebel parties. And that makes you a threat. A threat,\u201d he said, \u201cthat The Reestablishment has no qualms about removing.</p><p>\u201cTherefore,\u201d he said, taking a deep breath, \u201cyou cannot, and you will not, lose your RR card. Our counterfeit cards do not have the tracking device nor the chip necessary for monitoring REST dollars, because we don\u2019t have the need for either. But! That does not mean they are not just as valuable as decoys,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while for citizens on regulated territory, RR cards are part of a life sentence, at Omega Point, they are considered a privilege. And you will treat them as such.\u201d</p><p>A privilege.</p><p>Among the many things I learned in our meeting this morning, I discovered that these cards are only granted to those who go on missions outside of Omega Point. All of the people in that room today were hand-selected as being the best, the strongest, the most trustworthy. Inviting me to be in that room was a bold move on Kenji\u2019s part. I realize now that it was his way of telling me he trusts me. Despite everything, he\u2019s telling me\u2014and everyone else\u2014that I\u2019m welcome here. Which explains why Winston and Brendan felt so comfortable opening up to me. Because they trust the system at Omega Point. And they trust Kenji if he says he trusts me.</p><p>So now I am one of them.</p><p>And as my first official act as a member?</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be a thief.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>We\u2019re heading up.</p><p>Castle should be joining us any moment now to lead our group out of this underground city and into the real world. It will be my first opportunity to see what\u2019s happened to our society in almost 3 years.</p><p>I was 14 when I was dragged away from home for killing an innocent child. I spent 2 years bouncing from hospital to law office to detention center to psych ward until they finally decided to put me away for good. Sticking me in the asylum was worse than sending me to prison; smarter, according to my parents. If I\u2019d been sent to prison, the guards would\u2019ve had to treat me like a human being; instead, I spent the past year of my life treated like a rabid animal, trapped in a dark hole with no link to the outside world. Most everything I\u2019ve witnessed of our planet thus far has been out of a window or while running for my life. And now I\u2019m not sure what to expect.</p><p>But I want to see it.</p><p>I need to see it.</p><p>I\u2019m tired of being blind and I\u2019m tired of relying on my memories of the past and the bits and pieces I\u2019ve managed to scrape together of our present.</p><p>All I really know is that The Reestablishment has been a household name for 10 years.</p><p>I know this because they began campaigning when I was 7 years old. I\u2019ll never forget the beginning of our falling apart. I remember the days when things were still fairly normal, when people were only sort-of dying all the time, when there was enough food for those with enough money to pay for it. This was before cancer became a common illness and the weather became a turbulent, angry creature. I remember how excited everyone was about The Reestablishment. I remember the hope in my teachers\u2019 faces and the announcements we were forced to watch in the middle of the school day. I remember those things.</p><p>And just 4 months before my 14-year-old self committed an unforgivable crime, The Reestablishment was elected by the people of our world to lead us into a better future.</p><p>Hope. They had so much hope. My parents, my neighbors, my teachers and classmates. Everyone was hoping for the best when they cheered for The Reestablishment and promised their unflagging support.</p><p>Hope can make people do terrible things.</p><p>I remember seeing the protests just before I was taken away. I remember seeing the streets flooded with angry mobs who wanted a refund on their purchase. I remember how The Reestablishment painted the protesters red from head to toe and told them they should\u2019ve read the fine print before they left their houses that morning.</p><p>All sales are final.</p><p>Castle and Kenji are allowing me on this expedition because they\u2019re trying to welcome me into the heart of Omega Point. They want me to join them, to really accept them, to understand why their mission is so important. Castle wants me to fight against The Reestablishment and what they have planned for the world. The books, the artifacts, the language and history they plan on destroying; the simple, empty, monochromatic life they want to force upon the upcoming generations. He wants me to see that our Earth is still not so damaged as to be irreparable; he wants to prove that our future is salvageable, that things can get better as long as power is put in the right hands.</p><p>He wants me to trust.</p><p>I want to trust.</p><p>But I get scared, sometimes. In my very limited experience I\u2019ve already found that people seeking power are not to be trusted. People with lofty goals and fancy speeches and easy smiles have done nothing to calm my heart. Men with guns have never put me at ease no matter how many times they promised they were killing for good reason.</p><p>It has not gone past my notice that the people of Omega Point are very excellently armed.</p><p>But I\u2019m curious. I\u2019m so desperately curious.</p><p>So I\u2019m camouflaged in old, ragged clothes and a thick woolen hat that nearly covers my eyes. I wear a heavy jacket that must\u2019ve belonged to a man and my leather boots are almost hidden by the too-large pants puddling around my ankles. I look like a civilian. A poor, tortured civilian struggling to find food for her family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A door clicks shut and we all turn at once. Castle beams. Looks around at the group of us.</p><p>Me. Winston. Kenji. Brendan. The girl named Lily. 10 other people I still don\u2019t really know. We\u2019re 16 altogether, including Castle. A perfectly even number.</p><p>\u201cAll right, everyone,\u201d Castle says, clapping his hands together. I notice he\u2019s wearing gloves, too. Everyone is. Today, I\u2019m just a girl in a group wearing normal clothes and normal gloves. Today, I\u2019m just a number. No one of significance. Just an ordinary person. Just for today.</p><p>It\u2019s so absurd I feel like smiling.</p> <p>And then I remember how I nearly killed Adam yesterday and suddenly I\u2019m not sure how to move my lips.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Castle looks around. \u201cDon\u2019t forget what we discussed,\u201d he says. A pause. A careful glance. Eye contact with each one of us. Eyes on me for a moment too long. \u201cOkay then. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>No one really speaks as we follow Castle down these corridors, and I\u2019m left to wonder how easy it would be to just disappear in this inconspicuous outfit. I could run away, blend into the background and never be found again.</p><p>Like a coward.</p><p>I search for something to say to shake the silence. \u201cSo how are we getting there?\u201d I ask anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe walk,\u201d Winston says.</p><p>Our feet pound the floors in response.</p><p>\u201cMost civilians don\u2019t have cars,\u201d Kenji explains. \u201cAnd we sure as hell can\u2019t be caught in a tank. If we want to blend in, we have to do as the people do. And walk.\u201d</p><p>I lose track of which tunnels break off in which directions as Castle leads us toward the exit. I\u2019m increasingly aware of how little I understand about this place, how little I\u2019ve seen of it. Although if I\u2019m perfectly honest, I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t made much of an effort to explore anything.</p><p>I need to do something about that.</p><p>It\u2019s only when the terrain under my feet changes that I realize how close we are to getting outside. We\u2019re walking uphill, up a series of stone stairs stacked into the ground. I can see what looks like a small square of a metal door from here. It has a latch.</p> <p>I realize I\u2019m a little nervous.</p><p>Anxious.</p><p>Eager and afraid.</p><p>Today I will see the world as a civilian, really see things up close for the very first time. I will see what the people of this new society must endure now.</p><p>See what my parents must be experiencing wherever they are.</p><p>Castle pauses at the door, which looks small enough to be a window. Turns to face us. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he demands.</p><p>No one answers.</p><p>Castle draws himself up to his full height. Crosses his arms. \u201cLily,\u201d he says. \u201cName. ID. Age. Sector and occupation. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Lily tugs the scarf away from her mouth. She sounds slightly robotic when she says, \u201cMy name is Erica Fontaine, 1117-52QZ. I\u2019m twenty-six years old. I live in Sector 45.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccupation,\u201d Castle says again, a hint of impatience creeping into his voice.</p><p>\u201cTextile. Factory 19A-XC2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinston,\u201d Castle orders.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Keith Hunter, 4556-65DS,\u201d Winston says. \u201cThirty-four years old. Sector 45. I work in Metal. Factory 15B-XC2.\u201d</p><p>Kenji doesn\u2019t wait for a prompt when he says, \u201cHiro Yamasaki, 8891-11DX. Age twenty. Sector 45. Artillery. 13A-XC2.\u201d</p><p>Castle nods as everyone takes turns regurgitating the information etched into their fake RR cards. He smiles, satisfied. Then he focuses his eyes on me until everyone is staring, watching, waiting to see if I screw it up.</p><p>\u201cDelia Dupont,\u201d I say, the words slipping from my lips more easily than I expected.</p><p>We\u2019re not planning on being stopped, but this is an extra precaution in the event that we\u2019re asked to identify ourselves; we have to know the information on our RR cards as if it were our own. Kenji also said that even though the soldiers overseeing the compounds are from Sector 45, they\u2019re always different from the guards back on base. He doesn\u2019t think we\u2019ll run into anyone who will recognize us.</p><p>But.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cID number 1223-99SX. Seventeen years old. Sector 45. I work in Metal. Factory 15A-XC2.\u201d</p><p>Castle stares at me for just a second too long.</p><p>Finally, he nods. Looks around at all of us. \u201cAnd what,\u201d he says, his voice deep and clear and booming, \u201care the three things you will ask yourself before you speak?\u201d</p><p>Again, no one answers. Though it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t know the answer.</p><p>Castle counts off on his fingers. \u201cFirst! Does this need to be said? Second! Does this need to be said by me? And third! Does this need to be said by me right now?\u201d</p><p>Still, no one says a word.</p><p>\u201cWe do not speak unless absolutely necessary,\u201d Castle says. \u201cWe do not laugh, we do not smile. We do not make eye contact with one another if we can help it. We will not act as if we know each other. We are to do nothing at all to encourage extra glances in our direction. We do not draw attention to ourselves.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou understand this, yes? This is clear?\u201d</p><p>We nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd if something goes wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe scatter.\u201d Kenji clears his throat. \u201cWe run. We hide. We think of only ourselves. And we never, ever betray the location of Omega Point.\u201d</p><p>Everyone takes a deep breath at the same time.</p><p>Castle pushes the small door open. Peeks outside before motioning for us to follow him, and we do. We scramble through, one by one, silent as the words we don\u2019t speak.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been aboveground in almost 3 weeks. It feels like it\u2019s been 3 months.</p><p>The moment my face hits the air, I feel the wind snap against my skin in a way that\u2019s familiar, admonishing. It\u2019s as if the wind is scolding me for being away for so long.</p><p>We\u2019re in the middle of a frozen wasteland. The air is icy and sharp, dead leaves dancing around us. The few trees still standing are waving in the wind, their broken, lonely branches begging for companionship. I look left. I look right. I look straight ahead.</p><p>There is nothing.</p><p>Castle told us this area used to be covered in lush, dense vegetation. He said when he first sought out a hiding place for Omega Point, this particular stretch of ground was ideal. But that was so long ago\u2014decades ago\u2014that now everything has changed. Nature itself has changed. And it\u2019s too late to move this hideout.</p><p>So we do what we can.</p><p>This part, he said, is the hardest. Out here, we\u2019re vulnerable. Easy to spot even as civilians because we\u2019re out of place. Civilians have no business being anywhere outside of the compounds; they do not leave the regulated grounds deemed safe by The Reestablishment. Being caught anywhere on unregulated turf is considered a breach of the laws set in place by our new pseudogovernment, and the consequences are severe.</p><p>So we have to get ourselves to the compounds as quickly as possible.</p><p>The plan is for Kenji\u2014whose gift enables him to blend into any background\u2014to travel ahead of the pack, making himself invisible as he checks to make sure our paths are clear. The rest of us hang back, careful, completely silent. We keep a few feet of distance between ourselves, ready to run, to save ourselves if necessary. It\u2019s strange, considering the tight-knit nature of the community at Omega Point, that Castle wouldn\u2019t encourage us to stay together. But this, he explained, is for the good of the majority. It\u2019s a sacrifice. One of us has to be willing to get caught in order for the others to escape.</p><p>Take one for the team.</p><p>Our path is clear.</p><p>We\u2019ve been walking for at least half an hour and no one seems to be guarding this deserted piece of land. Soon, the compounds come into view. Blocks and blocks and blocks of metal boxes, cubes clustered in heaps across the ancient, wheezing ground. I clutch my coat closer to my body as the wind flips on its side just to fillet our human flesh.</p><p>It\u2019s too cold to be alive today.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing my suit\u2014which regulates my body heat\u2014under this outfit and I\u2019m still freezing. I can\u2019t imagine what everyone else must be going through right now. I glance at Brendan only to find him already doing the same. Our eyes meet for less than a second but I could swear he smiled at me, his cheeks slapped into pinks and reds by a wind jealous of his wandering eyes.</p><p>Blue. So blue.</p><p>Such a different, lighter, almost transparent shade of blue but still, so very, very blue. Blue eyes will always remind me of Adam, I think. And it hits me again. Hits me so hard, right in the core of my very being.</p><p>The ache.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d Kenji\u2019s voice reaches us through the wind, but his body is nowhere in sight. We\u2019re not 5 feet from setting foot in the first cluster of compounds, but I\u2019m somehow frozen in place, blood and ice and broken forks running down my back.</p><p>\u201cMOVE!\u201d Kenji\u2019s voice booms again. \u201cGet close to the compounds and keep your faces covered! Soldiers at three o\u2019clock!\u201d</p><p>We all jump up at once, rushing forward while trying to remain inconspicuous and soon we\u2019ve ducked behind the side of a metal housing unit; we get low, each pretending to be one of the many people picking scraps of steel and iron out from the heaps of trash stacked in piles all over the ground.</p><p>The compounds are set in one big field of waste. Garbage and plastic and mangled bits of metal sprinkled like craft confetti all over a child\u2019s floor. There\u2019s a fine layer of snow powdered over everything, as if the Earth was making a weak attempt to cover up its ugly bits just before we arrived.</p><p>I look up.</p><p>Look over my shoulder.</p><p>Look around in ways I\u2019m not supposed to but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m supposed to keep my eyes on the ground like I live here, like there\u2019s nothing new to see, like I can\u2019t stand to lift my face only to have it stung by the cold. I should be huddled into myself like all the other strangers trying to stay warm. But there\u2019s so much to see. So much to observe. So much I\u2019ve never been exposed to before.</p><p>So I dare to lift my head.</p><p>And the wind grabs me by the throat.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>Warner is standing not 20 feet away from me.</p><p>His suit is tailor-made and closely fitted to his form in a shade of black so rich it\u2019s almost blinding. His shoulders are draped in an open peacoat the color of mossy trunks 5 shades darker than his green, green eyes; the bright gold buttons are the perfect complement to his golden hair. He\u2019s wearing a black tie. Black leather gloves. Shiny black boots.</p><p>He looks immaculate.</p><p>Flawless, especially as he stands here among the dirt and destruction, surrounded by the bleakest colors this landscape has to offer. He\u2019s a vision of emerald and onyx, silhouetted in the sunlight in the most deceiving way. He could be glowing. That could be a halo around his head. This could be the world\u2019s way of making an example out of irony. Because Warner is beautiful in ways even Adam isn\u2019t.</p><p>Because Warner is not human.</p><p>Nothing about him is normal.</p><p>He\u2019s looking around, eyes squinting against the morning light, and the wind blows open his unbuttoned coat long enough for me to catch a glimpse of his arm underneath. Bandaged. Bound in a sling.</p><p>So close.</p><p>I was so close.</p><p>The soldiers hovering around him are waiting for orders, waiting for something, and I can\u2019t tear my eyes away. I can\u2019t help but experience a strange thrill in being so close to him, and yet so far away. It feels almost like an advantage\u2014being able to study him without his knowledge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He is a strange, strange, twisted boy.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I can forget what he did to me. What he made me do. How I came so close to killing all over again. I will hate him forever for it even though I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have to face him again.</p><p>One day.</p><p>I never thought I\u2019d see Warner on the compounds. I had no idea he even visited the civilians\u2014though, in truth, I never knew much about how he spent his days unless he spent them with me. I have no idea what he\u2019s doing here.</p> <p>He finally says something to the soldiers and they nod, once, quickly. Then disappear.</p><p>I pretend to be focused on something just to the right of him, careful to keep my head down and cocked slightly to the side so he can\u2019t catch a glimpse of my face even if he does look in my direction. My left hand reaches up to tug my hat down over my ears, and my right hand pretends to sort trash, pretends to pick out pieces of scraps to salvage for the day.</p><p>This is how some people make their living. Another miserable occupation.</p><p>Warner runs his good hand over his face, covering his eyes for just a moment before his hand rests on his mouth, pressing against his lips as though he has something he can\u2019t bear to say.</p><p>His eyes look almost ... worried. Though I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just reading him wrong.</p> <p>I watch him as he watches the people around him. I watch him closely enough to be able to notice that his gaze lingers on the small children, the way they run after each other with an innocence that says they have no idea what kind of world they\u2019ve lost. This bleak, dark place is the only thing they\u2019ve ever known.</p><p>I try to read Warner\u2019s expression as he studies them, but he\u2019s careful to keep himself completely neutral. He doesn\u2019t do more than blink as he stands perfectly still, a statue in the wind.</p><p>A stray dog is heading straight toward him.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly petrified. I\u2019m worried for this scrappy creature, this weak, frozen little animal probably seeking out small bits of food, something to keep it from starving for the next few hours. My heart starts racing in my chest, the blood pumping too fast and too hard and</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I feel like something terrible is about to happen.</p><p>The dog bolts right into the backs of Warner\u2019s legs, as if it\u2019s half blind and can\u2019t see where it\u2019s going. It\u2019s panting hard, tongue lolling to the side like it doesn\u2019t know how to get it back in. It whines and whimpers a little, slobbering all over Warner\u2019s very exquisite pants and I\u2019m holding my breath as the golden boy turns around. I half expect him to take out his gun and shoot the dog right in the head.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already seen him do it to a human being.</p><p>But Warner\u2019s face breaks apart at the sight of the small dog, cracks forming in the perfect cast of his features, surprise lifting his eyebrows and widening his gaze for just a moment. Long enough for me to notice.</p><p>He looks around, his eyes swift as they survey his surroundings before he scoops the animal into his arms and disappears around a low fence\u2014one of the short, squat fences that are used to section off squares of land for each compound. I\u2019m suddenly desperate to see what he\u2019s going to do and I\u2019m feeling anxious, so anxious, still unable to breathe.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen what Warner can do to a person. I\u2019ve seen his callous heart and his unfeeling eyes and his complete indifference, his cool, collected demeanor unshaken after killing a man in cold blood. I can only imagine what he has planned for an innocent dog.</p><p>I have to see it for myself.</p><p>I have to get his face out of my head and this is exactly what I need. It\u2019s proof that he\u2019s sick, twisted, that he\u2019s wrong, and will always be wrong.</p><p>If only I could stand up, I could see him. I could see what he\u2019s doing to that poor animal and maybe I could find a way to stop him before it\u2019s too late but I hear Castle\u2019s voice, a loud whisper calling us. Telling us the coast is clear to move forward now that Warner is out of sight. \u201cWe all move, and we move separately,\u201d he says. \u201cStick to the plan! No one trails anyone else. We all meet at the drop-off. If you don\u2019t make it, we will leave you behind. You have thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Kenji is tugging on my arm, telling me to get to my feet, to focus, to look in the right direction. I look up long enough to see that the rest of the group has already dispersed; Kenji, however, refuses to budge. He curses under his breath until finally I stand up. I nod. I tell him I understand the plan and motion for him to move on without me. I remind him that we can\u2019t be seen together. That we cannot walk in groups or pairs. We cannot be conspicuous.</p> <p>Finally, finally, he turns to go.</p><p>I watch Kenji leave. Then I take a few steps forward only to spin around and dart back to the corner of the compound, sliding my back up against the wall, hidden from view.</p><p>My eyes scan the area until I spot the fence where I last saw Warner; I tip up on my toes to peer over.</p><p>I have to cover my mouth to keep from gasping out loud.</p><p>Warner is crouched on the ground, feeding something to the dog with his good hand. The animal\u2019s quivering, bony body is huddled inside of Warner\u2019s open coat, shivering as its stubby limbs try to find warmth after being frozen for so long. The dog wags its tail hard, pulling back to look Warner in the eye only to plow into the warmth of his jacket again. I hear Warner laugh.</p><p>I see him smile.</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of smile that transforms him into someone else entirely, the kind of smile that puts stars in his eyes and a dazzle on his lips and I realize I\u2019ve never seen him like this before. I\u2019ve never even seen his teeth\u2014so straight, so white, nothing less than perfect. A flawless, flawless exterior for a boy with a black, black heart. It\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s blood on the hands of the person I\u2019m staring at. He looks soft and vulnerable\u2014so human. His eyes are squinting from all his grinning and his cheeks are pink from the cold.</p><p>He has dimples.</p><p>He\u2019s easily the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>And I wish I\u2019d never seen it.</p><p>Because something inside of my heart is ripping apart and it feels like fear, it tastes like panic and anxiety and desperation and I don\u2019t know how to understand the image in front of me. I don\u2019t want to see Warner like this. I don\u2019t want to think of him as anything other than a monster.</p><p>This isn\u2019t right.</p><p>I shift too fast and too far in the wrong direction, suddenly too stupid to find my footing and hating myself for wasting time I could\u2019ve used to escape. I know Castle and Kenji would be ready to kill me for taking such a risk but they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like in my head right now, they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he barks. \u201cYou there\u2014\u201d</p><p>I look up without intending to, without realizing that I\u2019ve responded to Warner\u2019s voice until it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s up, frozen in place, staring straight into my eyes, his good hand paused midmovement until it falls limp at his side, his jaw slack; stunned, temporarily stupefied.</p><p>I watch as the words die in his throat.</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed, caught in his gaze as he stands there, his chest heaving so hard and his lips ready to form the words that will surely sentence me to my death, all because of my stupid, senseless, idiotic\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t scream.\u201d</p><p>Someone closes a hand over my mouth.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>I don\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let go of you, okay? I want you to take my hand.\u201d</p><p>I reach out without looking down and feel our gloved hands fit together. Kenji lets go of my face.</p><p>\u201cYou are such an idiot,\u201d he says to me, but I\u2019m still staring at Warner. Warner who\u2019s now looking around like he\u2019s just seen a ghost, blinking and rubbing his eyes like he\u2019s confused, glancing at the dog like maybe the little animal managed to bewitch him. He grabs a tight hold of his blond hair, mussing it out of its perfect state, and stalks off so fast my eyes don\u2019t know how to follow him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Kenji is saying to me. \u201cAre you even listening to me? Are you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do? Why didn\u2019t he\u2014oh my God,\u201d I gasp, sparing a look at my own body.</p><p>I\u2019m completely invisible.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Kenji snaps, dragging me away from the compound. \u201cAnd keep your voice down. Being invisible doesn\u2019t mean the world can\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d I try to find his face but I might as well be speaking to the air.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014it\u2019s called projecting, remember? Didn\u2019t Castle explain this to you already?\u201d he asks, eager to rush through the explanation so he can get back to yelling at me. \u201cNot everyone can do it\u2014not all abilities are the same\u2014but maybe if you manage to stop being a dumbass long enough not to die, I might be able to teach you one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came back for me,\u201d I say to him, struggling to keep up with his brisk pace and not at all offended by his anger. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come back for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a dumbass,\u201d he says again.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m so sorry. I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, help it,\u201d he says, his voice gruff as he yanks me by the arm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to run to recover all the time you just wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you come back, Kenji?\u201d I ask again, undeterred. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I was still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watch you,\u201d he says, his words rushing out again, impatient. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what I do. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since day one. I enlisted in Warner\u2019s army for you and only you. It\u2019s what Castle sent me for. You were my job.\u201d His voice is clipped, fast, unfeeling. \u201cI already told you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you mean, you watch me?\u201d I hesitate, tugging on his invisible arm to slow him down a little. \u201cYou follow me around everywhere? Even now? Even at Omega Point?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away. When he does, his words are reluctant. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? I\u2019m here. Your job is done, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already had this conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember? Castle wanted me to make sure you were okay. He told me to keep an eye on you\u2014nothing serious\u2014just, you know, make sure you weren\u2019t having any psychotic breakdowns or anything.\u201d I hear him sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. He\u2019s a little worried about you. Especially now\u2014after what just happened? You don\u2019t look okay. You look like you want to throw yourself in front of a tank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do something like that,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cFine. Whatever. I\u2019m just pointing out the obvious. You only function on two settings: you\u2019re either moping or you\u2019re making out with Adam\u2014and I have to say, I kind of prefer the moping\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji!\u201d I nearly yank my hand out of his. His grip tightens around my fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d he snaps at me again. \u201cYou can\u2019t let go or it breaks the connection.\u201d Kenji is dragging me through the middle of a clearing. We\u2019re far enough from the compounds now that we won\u2019t be overheard, but we\u2019re still too far from the drop-off to be considered safe just yet.

Adam was already all up in my face about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I feel the pieces of this puzzle finally beginning to fit together. \u201cIs that why he was being mean to you at breakfast last week?\u201d</p><p>Kenji slows our pace a little. He takes a deep, long breath. \u201cHe thought I was, like, taking advantage of the situation.\u201d He says advantage like it\u2019s a strange, dirty word. \u201cHe thinks I get invisible just to see you naked or something. Listen\u2014I don\u2019t even know, okay? He was being an idiot about it. I\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014you\u2019re not, right? You\u2019re not trying to see me naked or anything?\u201d</p><p>Kenji snorts, chokes on his laughter. \u201cListen, Juliette,\u201d he says through another laugh, \u201cI\u2019m not blind, okay? On a purely physical level? Yeah, you\u2019re pretty sexy\u2014and that suit you have to wear all the time doesn\u2019t hurt. But even if you didn\u2019t have that whole \u2018I kill you if I touch you\u2019 thing going on, you are definitely not my type. And more importantly, I\u2019m not some perverted asshole,\u201d he says. \u201cI take my job seriously. I get real shit done in this world, and I like to think people respect me for it. But your boy Adam is a little too blinded by his pants to think straight. Maybe you should do something about that.\u201d</p><p>I drop my eyes. Say nothing for a moment. Then: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to worry about that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit.\u201d Kenji sighs, like he can\u2019t believe he got stuck listening to problems about my love life. \u201cI just walked right into that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go, Kenji. We don\u2019t have to talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>An irritated breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about what you\u2019re going through,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I want to see you all depressed or whatever. It\u2019s just that this life is messed up enough as it is,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sick of you being so caught up in your own little world all the time. You act like this whole thing\u2014everything we do\u2014is a joke. You don\u2019t take any of it seriously\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2014I do take this seriously\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He laughs a short, sharp, angry laugh. \u201cAll you do is sit around and think about your feelings. You\u2019ve got problems. Boo-freaking-hoo,\u201d he says. \u201cYour parents hate you and it\u2019s so hard but you have to wear gloves for the rest of your life because you kill people when you touch them. Who gives a shit?\u201d He\u2019s breathing hard enough for me to hear him. \u201cAs far as I can tell, you\u2019ve got food in your mouth and clothes on your back and a place to pee in peace whenever you feel like it. Those aren\u2019t problems. That\u2019s called living like a king. And I\u2019d really appreciate it if you\u2019d grow the hell up and stop walking around like the world crapped on your only roll of toilet paper. Because it\u2019s stupid,\u201d he says, barely reining in his temper. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, and it\u2019s ungrateful. You don\u2019t have a clue what everyone else in the world is going through right now. You don\u2019t have a clue, Juliette. And you don\u2019t seem to give a damn, either.\u201d</p><p>I swallow, so hard.</p><p>\u201cNow I am trying,\u201d he says, \u201cto give you a chance to fix things. I keep giving you opportunities to do things differently. To see past the sad little girl you used to be\u2014the sad little girl you keep clinging to\u2014and stand up for yourself. Stop crying. Stop sitting in the dark counting out all your individual feelings about how sad and lonely you are. Wake up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only person in this world who doesn\u2019t want to get out of bed in the morning. You\u2019re not the only one with daddy issues and severely screwed-up DNA. You can be whoever the hell you want to be now. You\u2019re not with your shitty parents anymore. You\u2019re not in that shitty asylum, and you\u2019re no longer stuck being Warner\u2019s shitty little experiment. So make a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cMake a choice and stop wasting everyone\u2019s time. Stop wasting your own time. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Shame is pooling in every inch of my body.</p> <p>Heat has flamed its way up my core, singeing me from the inside out. I\u2019m so horrified, so terrified to hear the truth in his words.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says, but his voice is just a tiny bit gentler. \u201cWe have to run.\u201d</p><p>And I nod even though he can\u2019t see me.</p><p>I nod and nod and nod and I\u2019m so happy no one can see my face right now.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cStop throwing boxes at me, jackass. That\u2019s my job.\u201d Winston laughs and grabs a package heavily bandaged in cellophane only to chuck it at another guy\u2019s head. The guy standing right next to me.</p><p>I duck.</p><p>The other guy grunts as he catches the package, and then grins as he offers Winston an excellent view of his middle finger.</p> <p>\u201cKeep it classy, Sanchez,\u201d Winston says as he tosses him another package.</p><p>Sanchez. His name is Ian Sanchez. I just learned this a few minutes ago when he and I and a few others were grouped together to form an assembly line.</p><p>We are currently standing in one of the official storage compounds of The Reestablishment.</p><p>Kenji and I managed to catch up to everyone else just in time. We all congregated at the drop-off (which turned out to be little more than a glorified ditch), and then Kenji gave me a sharp look, pointed at me, grinned, and left me with the rest of the group while he and Castle communicated about the next part of our mission.</p><p>Which was getting into the storage compound.</p><p>The irony, however, is that we traveled aboveground for supplies only to have to go back underground to get them. The storage compounds are, for all intents and purposes, invisible.</p><p>They\u2019re underground cellars filled with just about everything imaginable: food, medicine, weapons. All the things needed to survive. Castle explained everything in our orientation this morning. He said that while having supplies buried underground is a clever method of concealment against the civilians, it actually worked out in his favor. Castle said he can sense\u2014and move\u2014objects from a great distance, even if that distance is 25 feet belowground. He said that when he approaches one of the storage facilities he can feel the difference immediately, because he can recognize the energy in each object. This, he explained, is what allows him to move things with his mind: he\u2019s able to touch the inherent energy in everything. Castle and Kenji have managed to track down 5 compounds within 20 miles of Omega Point just by walking around; Castle sensing, Kenji projecting to keep them invisible. They\u2019ve located 5 more within 50 miles.</p><p>The storage compounds they access are on a rotation. They never take the same things and never in the same quantity, and they take from as many different facilities as possible. The farther the compound, the more intricate the mission becomes. This particular compound is closest, and therefore the mission is, relatively speaking, the easiest. That explains why I was allowed to come along.</p><p>All the legwork has already been done.</p><p>Brendan already knows how to confuse the electrical system in order to deactivate all the sensors and security cameras; Kenji acquired the pass code simply by shadowing a soldier who punched in the right numbers. All of this gives us a 30-minute window of time to work as quickly as possible to get everything we need into the drop-off, where we\u2019ll spend most of the day waiting to load our stolen supplies into vehicles that will carry the items away.</p><p>The system they use is fascinating.</p><p>There are 6 vans altogether, each slightly different in appearance, and all scheduled to arrive at different times. This way there are fewer chances of everyone being caught, and there\u2019s a higher probability that at least 1 of the vans will get back to Omega Point without a problem. Castle outlined what seemed like 100 different contingency plans in case of danger.</p><p>I\u2019m the only one here, however, who appears even remotely nervous about what we\u2019re doing. In fact, with the exception of me and 3 others, everyone here has visited this particular compound several times, so they\u2019re walking around like it\u2019s familiar territory. Everyone is careful and efficient, but they feel comfortable enough to laugh and joke around, too. They know exactly what they\u2019re doing. The moment we got inside, they split themselves into 2 groups: 1 team formed the assembly line, and the other collected the things we need.</p><p>Others have more important tasks.</p><p>Lily has a photographic memory that puts photographs to shame. She walked in before the rest of us and immediately scanned the room, collecting and cataloging every minute detail. She\u2019s the one who will make sure that we leave nothing behind when we exit, and that, aside from the things we take, nothing else is missing or out of place. Brendan is our backup generator. He\u2019s managed to shut off power to the security system while still lighting the dark dimensions of this room. Winston is overseeing our 2 groups, mediating between the givers and the takers, making sure we\u2019re securing the right items and the right quantities. His arms and legs have the elastic ability to stretch at will, which enables him to reach both sides of the room quickly and easily.</p><p>Castle is the one who moves our supplies outside. He stands at the very end of the assembly line, in constant radio contact with Kenji. And as long as the area is clear, Castle needs to use only one hand to direct the hundreds of pounds of supplies we\u2019ve hoarded into the drop-off.</p><p>Kenji, of course, is standing as lookout.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for Kenji, the rest of this wouldn\u2019t even be possible. He\u2019s our invisible eyes and ears. Without him, we\u2019d have no way of being so secure, so sure that we\u2019ll be safe on such a dangerous mission.</p><p>Not for the first time today, I\u2019m beginning to realize why he\u2019s so important.</p><p>\u201cHey, Winston, can you get someone to check if they have any chocolate in here?\u201d Emory\u2014another guy on my assembly team\u2014is smiling at Winston like he\u2019s hoping for good news. But then, Emory is always smiling. I\u2019ve only known him for a few hours, but he\u2019s been smiling since 6:00 a.m., when we all met in the orientation room this morning. He\u2019s super tall, super bulky, and he has a super-huge afro that somehow manages to fall into his eyes a lot. He\u2019s moving boxes down the line like they\u2019re full of cotton.</p><p>Winston is shaking his head, trying not to laugh as he passes the question along. \u201cSeriously?\u201d He shoots a look at Emory, nudging his plastic glasses up his nose at the same time. \u201cOf all the things in here, you want chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Emory\u2019s smile vanishes. \u201cShut up, man, you know my mom loves that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s true every time.\u201d</p><p>Winston says something to someone about grabbing another box of soap before turning back to Emory. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen your mom eat a piece of chocolate before.\u201d</p><p>Emory tells Winston to do something very inappropriate with his preternaturally flexible limbs, and I glance down at the box Ian has just handed to me, pausing to study the packaging carefully before passing it on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, do you know why these are all stamped with the letters R N W?\u201d</p><p>Ian turns around. Stunned. Looks at me like I\u2019ve just asked him to take his clothes off. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned,\u201d he says. \u201cShe speaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I speak,\u201d I say, no longer interested in speaking at all.</p><p>Ian passes me another box. Shrugs. \u201cWell, now I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mystery has been solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t think I could speak?\u201d I ask after a moment. \u201cLike, you thought I was mute?\u201d I wonder what other things people are saying about me around here.</p><p>Ian looks over his shoulder at me, smiles like he\u2019s trying not to laugh. Shakes his head and doesn\u2019t answer me. \u201cThe stamp,\u201d he says, \u201cis just regulation. They stamp everything RNW so they can track it. It\u2019s nothing fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what does RNW mean? Who\u2019s stamping it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRNW,\u201d he says, repeating the 3 letters like I\u2019m supposed to recognize them. \u201cReestablished Nations of the World. Everything\u2019s gone global, you know. They all trade commodities. And that,\u201d he says, \u201cis something no one really knows. It\u2019s another reason why the whole Reestablishment thing is a pile of crap. They\u2019ve monopolized the resources of the entire planet and they\u2019re just keeping it all for themselves.\u201d</p><p>I remember some of this. I remember talking to Adam about this when he and I were locked in the asylum together. Back before I knew what it was like to touch him. To be with him. To hurt him. The Reestablishment has always been a global movement. I just didn\u2019t realize it had a name.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say to Ian, suddenly distracted. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Ian pauses as he hands me another package. \u201cSo is it true?\u201d he asks, studying my face. \u201cThat you really have no clue what\u2019s happened to everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know some things.\u201d I bristle. \u201cI\u2019m just not clear on all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ian says, \u201cif you still remember how to speak when we get back to Point, maybe you should join us at lunch sometime. We can fill you in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I turn to face him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid.\u201d He laughs, tosses me another box. \u201cReally. We don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Sometimes I wonder about glue.</p><p>No one ever stops to ask glue how it\u2019s holding up. If it\u2019s tired of sticking things together or worried about falling apart or wondering how it will pay its bills next week.</p><p>Kenji is kind of like that.</p><p>He\u2019s like glue. He works behind the scenes to keep things together and I\u2019ve never stopped to think about what his story might be. Why he hides behind the jokes and the snark and the snide remarks.</p><p>But he was right. Everything he said to me was right.</p> <p>Yesterday was a good idea. I needed to get away, to get out, to be productive. And now I need to take Kenji\u2019s advice and get over myself. I need to get my head straight. I need to focus on my priorities. I need to figure out what I\u2019m doing here and how I can help. And if I care at all about Adam, I\u2019ll try to stay out of his life.</p><p>Part of me wishes I could see him; I want to make sure he\u2019s really going to be okay, that he\u2019s recovering well and eating enough and getting sleep at night. But another part of me is afraid to see him now. Because seeing Adam means saying good-bye. It means really recognizing that I can\u2019t be with him anymore and knowing that I have to find a new life for myself. Alone.</p><p>But at least at Omega Point I\u2019ll have options. And maybe if I can find a way to stop being scared, I\u2019ll actually figure out how to make friends. To be strong. To stop wallowing in my own problems.</p><p>Things have to be different now.</p><p>I grab my food and manage to lift my head; I nod hello to the faces I recognize from yesterday. Not everyone knows about my being on the trip\u2014the invitations to go on missions outside of Omega Point are exclusive\u2014but people, in general, seem to be a little less tense around me. I think.</p><p>I might be imagining it.</p><p>I try to find a place to sit down but then I see Kenji waving me over. Brendan and Winston and Emory are sitting at his table. I feel a smile tug at my lips as I approach them.</p><p>Brendan scoots over on the bench seat to make room for me. Winston and Emory nod hello as they shovel food into their mouths. Kenji shoots me a half smile, his eyes laughing at my surprise to be welcomed at his table.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling okay. Like maybe things are going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cJuliette?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly I\u2019m going to tip over.</p><p>I turn very, very slowly, half convinced that the voice I\u2019m hearing belongs to a ghost, because there\u2019s no way Adam could\u2019ve been released from the medical wing so soon. I wasn\u2019t expecting to have to face him so soon. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to have this talk so soon. Not here. Not in the middle of the dining hall.</p><p>I\u2019m not prepared. I\u2019m not prepared.</p><p>Adam looks terrible. He\u2019s pale. Unsteady. His hands are stuffed in his pockets and his lips are pressed together and his eyes are weary, tortured, deep and bottomless wells. His hair is messy. His T-shirt is straining across his chest, his tattooed forearms more pronounced than ever.</p><p>I want nothing more than to dive into his arms.</p><p>Instead, I\u2019m sitting here, reminding myself to breathe.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d he says, looking like he\u2019s half afraid to hear my answer. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>I nod, still unable to speak. Abandon my food without looking back at Kenji or Winston or Brendan or Emory so I have no idea what they must be thinking right now. I don\u2019t even care.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>Adam is here and he\u2019s in front of me and he wants to talk to me and I have to tell him things that will surely be the death of me.</p><p>But I follow him out the door anyway. Into the hall. Down a dark corridor.</p><p>Finally we stop.</p><p>Adam looks at me like he knows what I\u2019m going to say so I don\u2019t bother saying it. I don\u2019t want to say anything unless it becomes absolutely necessary. I\u2019d rather just stand here and stare at him, shamelessly drink in the sight of him one last time without having to speak a word. Without having to say anything at all.</p><p>He swallows, hard. Looks up. Looks away. Blows out a breath and rubs the back of his neck, clasps both hands behind his head and turns around so I can\u2019t see his face. But the effort causes his shirt to ride up his torso and I have to actually clench my fingers to keep from touching the sliver of skin exposed low on his abdomen, his lower back.</p><p>He\u2019s still looking away from me when he says, \u201cI really\u2014I really need you to say something.\u201d And the sound of his voice\u2014so wretched, so agonized\u2014makes me want to fall to my knees.</p><p>Still, I do not speak.</p><p>And he turns.</p><p>Faces me.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something,\u201d he says, his hands in his hair now, gripping his skull. \u201cSome kind of compromise\u2014something I can say to convince you to make this work. Tell me there\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m so scared. So scared I\u2019m going to start sobbing in front of him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he says, and he looks like he\u2019s about to crack, like he\u2019s done, like this is it he\u2019s about to fall apart and he says, \u201csay something, I\u2019m begging you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I bite my trembling lip.</p><p>He freezes in place, watching me, waiting.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I breathe, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cI will always, a-always love you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, don\u2019t say that\u2014don\u2019t say that\u2014\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m shaking my head, shaking it fast and hard, so hard it\u2019s making me dizzy but I can\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t say another word unless I want to start screaming and I can\u2019t look at his face, I can\u2019t bear to see what I\u2019m doing to him\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, Juliette\u2014Juliette\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m backing away, stumbling, tripping over my own feet as I reach blindly for the wall when I feel his arms around me. I try to pull away but he\u2019s too strong, he\u2019s holding me too tight and his voice is choked when he says, \u201cIt was my fault\u2014this is my fault\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have kissed you\u2014you tried to tell me but I didn\u2019t listen and I\u2019m so\u2014I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says, gasping the words. \u201cI should\u2019ve listened to you. I wasn\u2019t strong enough. But it\u2019ll be different this time, I swear,\u201d he says, burying his face in my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive myself for this. You were willing to give it a shot and I screwed everything up and I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>I have officially, absolutely collapsed inside.</p><p>I hate myself for what happened, hate myself for what I have to do, hate that I can\u2019t take his pain away, that I can\u2019t tell him we can try, that it\u2019ll be hard but we\u2019ll make it work anyway. Because this isn\u2019t a normal relationship. Because our problems aren\u2019t fixable.</p><p>Because my skin will never change.</p><p>All the training in the world won\u2019t remove the very real possibility that I could hurt him. Kill him, if we ever got carried away. I will always be a threat to him. Especially during the most tender moments, the most important, vulnerable moments. The moments I want most. Those are the things I can never have with him, and he deserves so much more than me, than this tortured person with so little to offer.</p><p>But I\u2019d rather stand here and feel his arms around me than say a single thing. Because I\u2019m weak, I\u2019m so weak and I want him so much it\u2019s killing me. I can\u2019t stop shaking, I can\u2019t see straight, I can\u2019t see through the curtain of tears obscuring my vision.</p><p>And he won\u2019t let go of me.</p><p>He keeps whispering \u201cPlease\u201d and I want to die.</p><p>But I think if I stay here any longer I will actually go insane.</p><p>So I raise a trembling hand to his chest and feel him stiffen, pull back, and I don\u2019t dare look at his eyes, I can\u2019t stand to see him looking hopeful, even if it\u2019s for only a second.</p><p>I take advantage of his momentary surprise and slackened arms to slip away, out of the shelter of his warmth, away from his beating heart. And I hold out my hand to stop him from reaching for me again.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I can\u2019t\u2014I c-can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been anyone else,\u201d he says, not bothering to keep his voice down anymore, not caring that his words are echoing through these tunnels. His hand is shaking as he covers his mouth, as he drags it across his face, through his hair. \u201cThere\u2019s never going to be anyone else\u2014I\u2019m never going to want anyone else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it\u2014you have to stop\u2014\u201d I can\u2019t breathe I can\u2019t breathe I can\u2019t breathe \u201cYou don\u2019t want this\u2014you don\u2019t want to be with someone like me\u2014someone who will only end up h-hurting you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Juliette\u201d\u2014he turns to slam his palms against the wall, his chest heaving, his head down, his voice broken, catching on every other syllable\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re hurting me now,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t walk away,\u201d he says, his voice tight, his eyes squeezed shut like he already knows I\u2019m going to. Like he can\u2019t bear to see it happen. \u201cPlease,\u201d he whispers, tormented. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I wish,\u201d I tell him, shaking violently now, \u201cI wish I d-didn\u2019t have to. I wish I could love you less.\u201d</p><p>And I hear him call after me as I bolt down the corridor. I hear him shouting my name but I\u2019m running, running away, running past the huge crowd gathered outside the dining hall, watching, listening to everything. I\u2019m running to hide even though I know it will be impossible.</p> <p>I will have to see him every single day.</p><p>Wanting him from a million miles away.</p><p>And I remember Kenji\u2019s words, his demands for me to wake up and stop crying and make a change, and I realize fulfilling my new promises might take a little longer than I expected.</p><p>Because I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather do right now than find a dark corner and cry.</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p> <p>Kenji finds me first.</p><p>He\u2019s standing in the middle of my training room. Looking around like he\u2019s never seen the place before, even though I\u2019m sure that can\u2019t be true. I still don\u2019t know exactly what he does, but it\u2019s at least become clear to me that Kenji is one of the most important people at Omega Point. He\u2019s always on the move. Always busy. No one\u2014except for me, and only lately\u2014really sees him for more than a few moments at a time.</p><p>It\u2019s almost as if he spends the majority of his days ... invisible.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, nodding his head slowly, taking his time walking around the room with his hands clasped behind his back. \u201cThat was one hell of a show back there. That\u2019s the kind of entertainment we never really get underground.\u201d</p><p>Mortification.</p><p>I\u2019m draped in it. Painted in it. Buried in it.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I just have to say\u2014that last line? \u2018I wish I could love you less\u2019? That was genius. Really, really nice. I think Winston actually shed a tear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSHUT UP, KENJI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d he says to me, offended. \u201cThat was, I don\u2019t know. It was kind of beautiful. I had no idea you guys were so intense.\u201d</p><p>I pull my knees up to my chest, burrow deeper into the corner of this room, bury my face in my arms. \u201cNo offense, but I really don\u2019t want to t-talk to you right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not okay,\u201d he says. \u201cYou and me, we have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cGet. Up.\u201d He grabs my elbow, tugging me to my feet as I try to take a swipe at him.</p><p>I wipe angrily at my cheeks, scrub at the stains my tears left behind. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for your jokes, Kenji. Please just go away. Leave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one,\u201d he says, \u201cis joking.\u201d Kenji picks up one of the bricks stacked against the wall. \u201cAnd the world isn\u2019t going to stop waging war against itself just because you broke up with your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, fists shaking, wanting to scream.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cSo what do you do in here?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou just sit around trying to ... what?\u201d He weighs the brick in his hand. \u201cBreak this stuff?\u201d</p><p>I give up, defeated. Fold myself onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell him. I sniff away the last of my tears. Try to wipe my nose. \u201cCastle kept telling me to \u2018focus\u2019 and \u2018harness my Energy.\u2019\u201d I use air quotes to illustrate my point. \u201cBut all I know about myself is that I can break things\u2014I don\u2019t know why it happens. So I don\u2019t know how he expects me to replicate what I\u2019ve already done. I had no idea what I was doing then, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing now, either. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d Kenji says, dropping the brick back onto the stack before falling on the mats across from me. He splays out on the ground, body stretched out, arms folded behind his head as he stares up at the ceiling. \u201cWhat are we talking about again? What events are you supposed to be replicating?\u201d</p><p>I lie back against the mats, too; mimic Kenji\u2019s position. Our heads are only a few inches apart. \u201cRemember? The concrete I broke back in Warner\u2019s psycho room. The metal door I attacked when I was looking for A-Adam.\u201d My voice catches and I have to squeeze my eyes shut to quell the pain.</p><p>I can\u2019t even say his name right now.</p><p>Kenji grunts. I feel him nodding his head on the mats. \u201cAll right. Well, what Castle told me is that he thinks there\u2019s more to you than just the touching thing. That maybe you also have this weird superhuman strength or something.\u201d A pause. \u201cThat sound about right to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d he asks, tilting his head back to get a good look at me. \u201cWhen you went all psycho-monster on everything? Do you remember if there was a trigger?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. When it happens, it\u2019s like\u2014it\u2019s like I really am completely out of my mind,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSomething changes in my head and it makes me ... it makes me crazy. Like, really, legitimately insane.\u201d I glance over at him but his face betrays no emotion. He just blinks, waiting for me to finish. So I take a deep breath and continue. \u201cIt\u2019s like I can\u2019t think straight. I\u2019m just so paralyzed by the adrenaline and I can\u2019t stop it; I can\u2019t control it. Once that crazy feeling takes over, it needs an outlet. I have to touch something. I have to release it.\u201d</p><p>Kenji props himself up on one elbow. Looks at me. \u201cSo what gets you all crazy, though?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat were you feeling? Does it only happen when you\u2019re really pissed off?\u201d</p><p>I take a second to think about it before I say, \u201cNo. Not always.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cThe first time,\u201d I tell him, my voice a little unsteady, \u201cI wanted to kill Warner because of what he made me do to that little kid. I was so devastated. I was angry\u2014I was really angry\u2014but I was also ... so sad.\u201d I trail off. \u201cAnd then when I was looking for Adam?\u201d Deep breaths. \u201cI was desperate. Really desperate. I had to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about when you went all Superman on me? Slamming me into the wall like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then? In the research labs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry,\u201d I whisper, my eyes unfocused as I stare up at the ceiling, remembering the rage of that day. \u201cI was angrier than I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. I never even knew I could feel that way. To be so mad. And I felt guilty,\u201d I add, so quietly. \u201cGuilty for being the reason why Adam was in there at all.\u201d</p><p>Kenji takes a deep, long breath. Pulls himself up into a sitting position and leans against the wall. He says nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking ...?\u201d I ask, shifting to sit up and join him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kenji finally says. \u201cBut it\u2019s obvious that all of these incidents were the result of really intense emotions. Makes me think the whole system must be pretty straightforward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike there has to be some kind of trigger involved,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, when you lose control, your body goes into automatic self-protect mode, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Kenji turns so he\u2019s facing me. Crosses his legs underneath him. Leans back on his hands. \u201cLike, listen. When I first found out I could do this invisible thing? I mean, it was an accident. I was nine years old. Scared out of my mind. Fast-forward through all the shitty details and my point is this: I needed a place to hide and couldn\u2019t find one. But I was so freaked out that my body, like, automatically did it for me. I just disappeared into the wall. Blended or whatever.\u201d He laughs. \u201cTripped me the hell out, because I didn\u2019t realize what\u2019d happened for a good ten minutes. And then I didn\u2019t know how to turn myself back to normal. It was crazy. I actually thought I was dead for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... so, what? You think my body taps into its defense mode when I freak out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I think. \u201cWell, how am I supposed to tap into my defense mode? How did you figure yours out?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cOnce I realized I wasn\u2019t some kind of ghost and I wasn\u2019t hallucinating, it actually became kind of cool. I was a kid, you know? I was excited, like I could tie on a cape and kill bad guys or something. I liked it. And it became this part of me that I could access whenever I wanted. But,\u201d he adds, \u201cit wasn\u2019t until I really started training that I learned how to control and maintain it for long periods of time. That took a lot of work. A lot of focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I mean, all of this takes a lot of work to figure out. But once I accepted it as a part of me, it became easier to manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, leaning back again, blowing out an exasperated breath, \u201cI\u2019ve already accepted it. But it definitely hasn\u2019t made things easier.\u201d</p><p>Kenji laughs out loud. \u201cMy ass you\u2019ve accepted it. You haven\u2019t accepted anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been like this my entire life, Kenji\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve accepted it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cuts me off. \u201cHell no. You hate being in your own skin. You can\u2019t stand it. That\u2019s not called acceptance. That\u2019s called\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014the opposite of acceptance. You,\u201d he says, pointing a finger at me, \u201cyou are the opposite of acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d I shoot back. \u201cThat I have to like being this way?\u201d I don\u2019t give him a chance to respond before I say, \u201cYou have no idea what it\u2019s like to be stuck in my skin\u2014to be trapped in my body, afraid to breathe too close to anything with a beating heart. If you did, you\u2019d never ask me to be happy to live like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Juliette\u2014I\u2019m just saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let me make this clear for you, Kenji. I kill people. I kill them. That\u2019s what my \u2018special\u2019 power is. I don\u2019t blend into backgrounds or move things with my mind or have really stretchy arms. You touch me for too long and you die. Try living like that for seventeen years and then tell me how easy it is to accept myself.\u201d</p><p>I taste too much bitterness on my tongue.</p><p>It\u2019s new for me.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he says, his voice noticeably softer. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to judge, okay? I\u2019m just trying to point out that because you don\u2019t want it, you might subconsciously be sabotaging your efforts to figure it out.\u201d He puts his hands up in mock defeat. \u201cJust my two cents. I mean, obviously you\u2019ve got some crazy powers going on. You touch people and bam, done. But then you can crush through walls and shit, too? I mean, hell, I\u2019d want to learn how to do that, are you kidding me? That would be insane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, slumping against the wall. \u201cI guess that part wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d Kenji perks up. \u201cThat would be awesome. And then\u2014you know, if you leave your gloves on\u2014you could just crush random stuff without actually killing anyone. Then you wouldn\u2019t feel so bad, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. Great. You just need to relax.\u201d He gets to his feet. Grabs the brick he was toying with earlier. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cGet up. Come over here.\u201d</p> <p>I walk over to his side of the room and stare at the brick he\u2019s holding. He gives it to me like he\u2019s handing over some kind of family heirloom. \u201cNow,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to let yourself get comfortable, okay? Allow your body to touch base with its core. Stop blocking your own Energy. You\u2019ve probably got a million mental blocks in your head. You can\u2019t hold back anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have mental blocks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you do.\u201d He snorts. \u201cYou definitely do. You have severe mental constipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMental what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus your anger on the brick. On the brick,\u201d he says to me. \u201cRemember. Open mind. You want to crush the brick. Remind yourself that this is what you want. It\u2019s your choice. You\u2019re not doing this for Castle, you\u2019re not doing it for me, you\u2019re not doing it to fight anyone. This is just something you feel like doing. For fun. Because you feel like it. Let your mind and body take over. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>I take a deep breath. Nod a few times. \u201cOkay. I think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He lets out a low whistle.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I spin around. \u201cWhat happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you not just feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook in your hand!\u201d</p> <p>I gasp. Stumble backward. My hand is full of what looks like red sand and brown clay pulverized into tiny particles. The bigger chunks of brick crumble to the floor and I let the debris slip through the cracks between my fingers only to lift the guilty hand to my face.</p><p>I look up.</p><p>Kenji is shaking his head, shaking with laughter. \u201cI am so jealous right now you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I KNOW. So badass. Now think about it: if you can do that to a brick, imagine what you could do to the human body\u2014\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the right thing to say.</p><p>Not now. Not after Adam. Not after trying to pick up the pieces of my hopes and dreams and fumbling to glue them back together. Because now there\u2019s nothing left. Because now I realize that somewhere, deep down, I was harboring a small hope that Adam and I would find a way to work things out.</p><p>Somewhere, deep down, I was still clinging to possibility.</p> <p>And now that\u2019s gone.</p><p>Because now it\u2019s not just my skin Adam has to be afraid of. It\u2019s not just my touch but my grip, my hugs, my hands, a kiss\u2014anything I do could injure him. I\u2019d have to be careful just holding his hand. And this new knowledge, this new information about just exactly how deadly I am\u2014</p><p>It leaves me with no alternative.</p><p>I will forever and ever and ever be alone because no one is safe from me.</p><p>I fall to the floor, my mind whirring, my own brain no longer a safe space to inhabit because I can\u2019t stop thinking, I can\u2019t stop wondering, I can\u2019t stop anything and it\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in what could be a head-on collision and I\u2019m not the innocent bystander.</p><p>I\u2019m the train.</p><p>I\u2019m the one careening out of control.</p><p>Because sometimes you see yourself\u2014you see yourself the way you could be\u2014the way you might be if things were different. And if you look too closely, what you see will scare you, it\u2019ll make you wonder what you might do if given the opportunity. You know there\u2019s a different side of yourself you don\u2019t want to recognize, a side you don\u2019t want to see in the daylight. You spend your whole life doing everything to push it down and away, out of sight, out of mind. You pretend that a piece of yourself doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>You live like that for a long time.</p><p>For a long time, you\u2019re safe.</p><p>And then you\u2019re not.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Another morning.</p><p>Another meal.</p><p>I\u2019m headed to breakfast to meet Kenji before our next training session.</p><p>He came to a conclusion about my abilities yesterday: he thinks that the inhuman power in my touch is just an evolved form of my Energy. That skin-to-skin contact is simply the rawest form of my ability\u2014that my true gift is actually a kind of all-consuming strength that manifests itself in every part of my body.</p><p>My bones, my blood, my skin.</p><p>I told him it was an interesting theory. I told him I\u2019d always seen myself as some sick version of a Venus flytrap and he said, \u201cOH MY GOD. Yes. YES. You are exactly like that. Holy shit, yes.\u201d</p><p>Beautiful enough to lure in your prey, he said.</p><p>Strong enough to clamp down and destroy, he said.</p><p>Poisonous enough to digest your victims when the flesh makes contact.</p><p>\u201cYou digest your prey,\u201d he said to me, laughing as though it was amusing, as though it was funny, as if it was perfectly acceptable to compare a girl to a carnivorous plant. Flattering, even. \u201cRight? You said that when you touch people, it\u2019s, like, you\u2019re taking their energy, right? It makes you feel stronger?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re exactly like a Venus flytrap. You reel \u2019em in. Clamp \u2019em down. Eat \u2019em up.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cMmmmmmm,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re like a sexy, super-scary plant.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. Covered my mouth in horror.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that so wrong?\u201d he said. Bent down to meet my gaze. Tugged on a lock of my hair to get me to look up. \u201cWhy does this have to be so horrible? Why can\u2019t you see how awesome this is?\u201d He shook his head at me. \u201cYou are seriously missing out, you know that? This could be so cool if you would just own it.\u201d</p><p>Own it.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>How easy it would be to just clamp down on the world around me. Suck up its life force and leave it dead in the street just because someone tells me I should. Because someone points a finger and says \u201cThose are the bad guys. Those men over there.\u201d Kill, they say. Kill because you trust us. Kill because you\u2019re fighting for the right team. Kill because they\u2019re bad, and we\u2019re good. Kill because we tell you to. Because some people are so stupid that they actually think there are thick neon lines separating good and evil. That it\u2019s easy to make that kind of distinction and go to sleep at night with a clear conscience. Because it\u2019s okay.</p><p>It\u2019s okay to kill a man if someone else deems him unfit to live.</p><p>What I really want to say is who the hell are you and who are you to decide who gets to die. Who are you to decide who should be killed. Who are you to tell me which father I should destroy and which child I should orphan and which mother should be left without her son, which brother should be left without a sister, which grandmother should spend the rest of her life crying in the early hours of the morning because the body of her grandchild was buried in the ground before her own.</p><p>What I really want to say is who the hell do you think you are to tell me that it\u2019s awesome to be able to kill a living thing, that it\u2019s interesting to be able to ensnare another soul, that it\u2019s fair to choose a victim simply because I\u2019m capable of killing without a gun. I want to say mean things and angry things and hurtful things and I want to throw expletives in the air and run far, far away; I want to disappear into the horizon and I want to dump myself on the side of the road if only it will bring me toward some semblance of freedom but I don\u2019t know where to go. I have nowhere else to go.</p><p>And I feel responsible.</p><p>Because there are times when the anger bleeds away until it\u2019s nothing but a raw ache in the pit of my stomach and I see the world and wonder about its people and what it\u2019s become and I think about hope and maybe and possibly and possibility and potential. I think about glasses half full and glasses to see the world clearly. I think about sacrifice. And compromise. I think about what will happen if no one fights back. I think about a world where no one stands up to injustice.</p><p>And I wonder if maybe everyone here is right.</p><p>If maybe it\u2019s time to fight.</p><p>I wonder if it\u2019s ever actually possible to justify killing as a means to an end and then I think of Kenji. I think of what he said. And I wonder if he would still call it awesome if I decided to make him my prey.</p><p>I\u2019m guessing not.</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>Kenji is already waiting for me.</p><p>He and Winston and Brendan are sitting at the same table again, and I slide into my seat with a distracted nod and eyes that refuse to focus in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d Kenji says, shoving a spoonful of breakfast into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oh how fascinating look at this fork and this spoon and this table. \u201cWhat do y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d he says, his mouth still half full of food.</p><p>Winston clears his throat, scratches the back of his head. Brendan shifts in his seat beside me.</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2014I, um\u2014\u201d Heat flushes up my neck as I look around at the 3 guys sitting at this table. I want to ask Kenji where Adam is, why he isn\u2019t here, how he\u2019s doing, if he\u2019s okay, if he\u2019s been eating regularly. I want to ask a million questions I shouldn\u2019t be asking but it\u2019s blatantly clear that none of them want to talk about the awkward details of my personal life. And I don\u2019t want to be that sad, pathetic girl. I don\u2019t want pity. I don\u2019t want to see the uncomfortable sympathy in their eyes.</p><p>So I sit up. Clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the patrols?\u201d I ask Winston. \u201cIs it getting any worse?\u201d</p><p>Winston looks up midchew, surprised. He swallows down the food too quickly and coughs once, twice. Takes a sip of his coffee\u2014tar black\u2014and leans forward, looking eager. \u201cIt\u2019s getting weirder,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so, remember how I told you guys that Warner was showing up every night?\u201d</p><p>Warner. I can\u2019t get the image of his smiling, laughing face out of my head.</p><p>We nod.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He leans back in his chair. Holds up his hands. \u201cLast night? Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Brendan\u2019s eyebrows are high on his forehead. \u201cWhat do you mean, nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean no one was there.\u201d He shrugs. Picks up his fork. Stabs at a piece of food. \u201cNot Warner, not a single soldier. Night before last?\u201d He looks around at us. \u201cFifty, maybe seventy-five soldiers. Last night, zero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Castle about this?\u201d Kenji isn\u2019t eating anymore. He\u2019s staring at Winston with a focused, too-serious look on his face. It\u2019s worrying me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Winston nods as he takes another sip of his coffee. \u201cI turned in my report about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t gone to sleep yet?\u201d I ask, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI slept yesterday,\u201d he says, waving a haphazard hand at me. \u201cOr the day before yesterday. I can\u2019t remember. God, this coffee is disgusting,\u201d he says, gulping it down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight. Maybe you should lay off the coffee, yeah?\u201d Brendan tries to grab Winston\u2019s cup.</p><p>Winston slaps at his hand, shoots him a dark look. \u201cNot all of us have electricity running through our veins,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not a freaking powerhouse of energy like you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only did that once\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice!\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014and it was an emergency,\u201d he says, looking a little sheepish.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThis guy\u201d\u2014Kenji jerks a thumb at Brendan\u2014\u201ccan, like, literally recharge his own body. He doesn\u2019t need to sleep. It\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Winston mutters, ripping a piece of bread in half.</p><p>I turn to Brendan, jaw unhinged. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>He nods. Shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve only done it once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice!\u201d Winston says again. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a freaking fetus,\u201d he says to me. \u201cHe\u2019s already got way too much energy as it is\u2014shit, all of you kids do\u2014and yet he\u2019s the one who comes with a rechargeable battery life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a fetus,\u201d Brendan says, spluttering, glancing at me as heat colors his cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not\u2014you\u2019re mad,\u201d he says, glaring at Winston.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Winston says, nodding, his mouth full of food again. \u201cI am mad. I\u2019m pissed off.\u201d He swallows. \u201cAnd I\u2019m cranky as hell because I\u2019m tired. And I\u2019m hungry. And I need more coffee.\u201d He shoves away from the table. Stands up. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get more coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it was disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He levels a look at me. \u201cYes, but I am a sad, sad man with very low standards.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Brendan says.</p><p>\u201cShut up, fetus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only allowed one cup,\u201d Kenji points out, looking up to meet Winston\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I always tell them I\u2019m taking yours,\u201d he says, and stalks off.</p><p>Kenji is laughing, shoulders shaking.</p><p>Brendan is mumbling \u201cI am not a fetus\u201d under his breath, stabbing at his food with renewed vigor.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I ask, curious. He\u2019s so white-blond and pale-blue-eyed that he doesn\u2019t seem real. He looks like the kind of person who could never age, who would remain forever preserved in this ethereal form.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four,\u201d he says, looking grateful for a chance at validation. \u201cJust turned twenty-four, actually. Had my birthday last week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d I\u2019m surprised. He doesn\u2019t look much older than 18. I wonder what it must be like to celebrate a birthday at Omega Point. \u201cWell, happy birthday,\u201d I say, smiling at him. \u201cI hope\u2014I hope you have a very good year. And\u201d\u2014I try to think of something nice to say\u2014\u201cand a lot of happy days.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring back at me now, amused, looking straight into my eyes. Grinning. He says, \u201cThanks.\u201d Smiles a bit wider. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t look away.</p><p>My face is hot.</p><p>I\u2019m struggling to understand why he\u2019s still smiling at me, why he doesn\u2019t stop smiling even when he finally looks away, why Kenji keeps glancing at me like he\u2019s trying to hold in a laugh and I\u2019m flustered, feeling oddly embarrassed and searching for something to say.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do today?\u201d I ask Kenji, hoping my voice sounds neutral, normal.</p><p>Kenji drains his water cup. Wipes his mouth. \u201cToday,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how to shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d He grabs his tray. Grabs mine, too. \u201cWait here, I\u2019m gonna drop these off.\u201d He moves to go before he stops, turns back, glances at Brendan and says, \u201cPut it out of your head, bro.\u201d</p><p>Brendan looks up, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kenji stares at him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Brendan\u2019s mouth falls closed. His cheeks are pink again. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Kenji shakes his head, and walks away.</p><p>Brendan is suddenly in a hurry to go about his day.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>\u201cJuliette? Juliette!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease wake up\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gasp as I sit straight up in bed, heart pounding, eyes blinking too fast as they try to focus. I blink blink blink. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji is outside,\u201d Sonya says.</p><p>\u201cHe says he needs you,\u201d Sara adds, \u201cthat something happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tripping out of bed so fast I pull the covers down with me. I\u2019m groping around in the dark, trying to find my suit\u2014I sleep in a pajama set I borrowed from Sara\u2014and making an effort not to panic. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask. \u201cDo you know\u2014did he tell you anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sonya is shoving my suit into my arms, saying, \u201cNo, he just said that it was urgent, that something happened, that we should wake you up right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I tell them, though I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m saying it, or how I could possibly be of any reassurance to them. I wish I could turn on a light but all the lights are controlled by the same switch. It\u2019s one of the ways they conserve power\u2014and one of the ways they manage to maintain the semblance of night and day down here\u2014by only using it during specific hours.</p><p>I finally manage to slip into my suit and I\u2019m zipping it up, heading for the door when I hear Sara call my name. She\u2019s holding my boots.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u2014thank you both,\u201d I say.</p><p>They nod several times.</p><p>And I\u2019m tugging on my boots and running out the door.</p><p>I slam face-first into something solid.</p><p>Something human. Male.</p><p>I hear his sharp intake of breath, feel his hands steady my frame, feel the blood in my body run right out from under me. \u201cAdam,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t let go of me. I can hear his heart beating fast and hard and loud in the silence between us and he feels too still, too tense, like he\u2019s trying to maintain some kind of control over his body.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he whispers, but it sounds like he can\u2019t really breathe.</p><p>My heart is failing.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let go,\u201d he says, and I feel his hands shake, just a little, as if the effort to keep them in one place is too much for him. \u201cI can\u2019t let go of you. I\u2019m trying, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m here then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kenji yanks me out of Adam\u2019s arms and takes a deep, uneven breath. \u201cJesus. Are you guys done here? We have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what\u2019s going on?\u201d I stammer, trying to cover up my embarrassment. I really wish Kenji weren\u2019t always catching me in the middle of such vulnerable moments. I wish he could see me being strong and confident. And then I wonder when I began caring about Kenji\u2019s opinion of me. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Kenji says as he strides down the dark halls. He must have these tunnels memorized, I think, because I can\u2019t see a thing. I have to practically run to keep up with him. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m assuming some kind of shit has officially hit the fan. Castle sent me a message about fifteen minutes ago\u2014said to get me and you and Kent up to his office ASAP. So,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014now? In the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit hitting the fan doesn\u2019t work around your schedule, princess.\u201d</p><p>I decide to stop talking.</p><p>We follow Kenji to a single solitary door at the end of a narrow tunnel.</p><p>He knocks twice, pauses. Knocks 3 times, pauses. Knocks once.</p><p>I wonder if I need to remember that.</p><p>The door creaks open on its own and Castle waves us in.</p><p>\u201cClose the door, please,\u201d he says from behind his desk. I have to blink several times to readjust to the light in here. There\u2019s a traditional reading lamp on Castle\u2019s desk with just enough wattage to illuminate this small space. I use the moment to look around.</p><p>Castle\u2019s office is nothing more than a room with a few bookcases and a simple table that doubles as a workstation. Everything is made of recycled metal. His desk looks like it used to be a pickup truck.</p><p>There are heaps of books and papers stacked all over the floor; diagrams, machinery, and computer parts shoved onto the bookcases, thousands of wires and electrical units peeking out of their metal bodies; they must either be damaged or broken or perhaps part of a project Castle is working on.</p><p>In other words: his office is a mess.</p><p>Not something I was expecting from someone so incredibly put-together.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he says to us. I look around for chairs but only find two upside-down garbage cans and a stool. \u201cI\u2019ll be right with you. Give me one moment.\u201d</p><p>We nod. We sit. We wait. We look around.</p><p>Only then do I realize why Castle doesn\u2019t care about the disorganized nature of his office.</p><p>He seems to be in the middle of something, but I can\u2019t see what it is, and it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m too focused on watching him work. His hands shift up and down, flick from side to side, and everything he needs or wants simply gravitates toward him. A particular piece of paper? A notepad? The clock buried under the pile of books farthest from his desk? He looks for a pencil and lifts his hand to catch it. He\u2019s searching for his notes and lifts his fingers to find them.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to be organized. He has a system of his own.</p><p>Incredible.</p><p>He finally looks up. Puts his pencil down. Nods. Nods again. \u201cGood. Good; you\u2019re all here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cYou said you needed to speak with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I do.\u201d Castle folds his hands over his desk. \u201cIndeed I do.\u201d Takes a careful breath. \u201cThe supreme commander,\u201d he says, \u201chas arrived at the headquarters of Sector 45.\u201d</p><p>Kenji swears.</p><p>Adam is frozen.</p><p>I\u2019m confused. \u201cWho\u2019s the supreme commander?\u201d</p><p>Castle\u2019s gaze rests on me. \u201cWarner\u2019s father.\u201d His eyes narrow, scrutinizing me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that Warner\u2019s father is the supreme commander of The Reestablishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I gasp, unable to imagine the monster that must be Warner\u2019s father. \u201cI\u2014yes\u2014I knew that,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what his title was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Castle says. \u201cThere are six supreme commanders around the world, one for each of the six divisions: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Each section is divided into 555 sectors for a total of 3,330 sectors around the globe. Warner\u2019s father is not only in charge of this continent, he is also one of the founders of The Reestablishment, and currently our biggest threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought there were 3,333 sectors,\u201d I tell Castle, \u201cnot 3,330. Am I remembering that wrong?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe other three are capitals,\u201d Kenji says to me. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure that one of them is somewhere in North America, but no one knows for certain where any of them are located. So yeah,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou\u2019re remembering right. The Reestablishment has some crazy fascination with exact numbers. 3,333 sectors altogether and 555 sectors each. Everyone gets the same thing, regardless of size. They think it shows how equally they\u2019ve divided everything, but it\u2019s just a bunch of bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Every single day I\u2019m floored by how much I still need to learn. I look at Castle. \u201cSo is this the emergency? That Warner\u2019s dad is here and not at one of the capitals?\u201d</p><p>Castle nods. \u201cYes, he ...\u201d He hesitates. Clears his throat. \u201cWell. Let me start from the beginning. It is imperative that you be aware of all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re listening,\u201d Kenji says, back straight, eyes alert, muscles tensed for action. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Castle says, \u201che\u2019s been in town for some time now\u2014he arrived very quietly, very discreetly, a couple of weeks ago. It seems he heard what his son has been up to lately, and he wasn\u2019t thrilled about it. He ...\u201d Castle takes a deep, steady breath. \u201cHe is ... particularly angry about what happened with you, Ms. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Heart pounding. Heart pounding. Heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Castle says. \u201cOur sources say that he\u2019s angry Warner allowed you to escape. And, of course, that he lost two of his soldiers in the process.\u201d He nods in Adam and Kenji\u2019s direction. \u201cWorse still, rumors are now circulating among the citizens about this defecting girl and her strange ability and they\u2019re starting to put the pieces together; they\u2019re starting to realize there\u2019s another movement\u2014our movement\u2014preparing to fight back. It\u2019s creating unrest and resistance among the civilians, who are all too eager to get involved.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Castle clasps his hands. \u201cWarner\u2019s father has undoubtedly arrived to spearhead this war and remove all doubt of The Reestablishment\u2019s power.\u201d He pauses to look at each of us. \u201cIn other words, he\u2019s arrived to punish us and his son at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change our plans, does it?\u201d Kenji asks.</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly. We\u2019ve always known that a fight would be inevitable, but this ... changes things. Now that Warner\u2019s father is in town, this war is going to happen a lot sooner than we hoped,\u201d Castle says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be a lot bigger than we anticipated.\u201d He levels his gaze at me, looking grave. \u201cMs. Ferrars, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to need your help.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at him, struck. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t\u2014aren\u2019t you still angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a child, Ms. Ferrars. I would not fault you for an overreaction. Kenji says he believes that your behavior lately has been the result of ignorance and not malicious intent, and I trust his judgment. I trust his word. But I do want you to understand that we are a team,\u201d he says, \u201cand we need your strength. What you can do\u2014your power\u2014it is unparalleled. Especially now that you\u2019ve been working with Kenji and have at least some knowledge of what you\u2019re capable of, we\u2019re going to need you. We\u2019ll do whatever we can to support you\u2014we\u2019ll reinforce your suit, provide you with weapons and armor. And Winston\u2014\u201d He stops. His breath catches. \u201cWinston,\u201d he says, quieter now, \u201cjust finished making you a new pair of gloves.\u201d He looks into my face. \u201cWe want you on our team,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you cooperate with me, I promise you will see results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I whisper. I match his steady, solemn gaze. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Castle says. \u201cThat is very good.\u201d He looks distracted as he leans back in his chair, runs a tired hand across his face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Kenji says, \u201cI hate to be so blunt, but would you please tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Castle nods. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, yes, of course. I\u2014forgive me. It\u2019s been a difficult night.\u201d</p><p>Kenji\u2019s voice is tight. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ... has sent word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner\u2019s father?\u201d I ask. \u201cWarner\u2019s father sent word? To us?\u201d I glance around at Adam and Kenji. Adam is blinking fast, lips just barely parted in shock. Kenji looks like he\u2019s about to be sick.</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to panic.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Castle says to me. \u201cWarner\u2019s father. He wants to meet. He wants ... to talk.\u201d</p> <p>Kenji jumps to his feet. His entire face is leached of color. \u201cNo\u2014sir\u2014this is a setup\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to talk, you must know he\u2019s lying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken four of our men hostage, Kenji. I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have another choice.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kenji has gone limp. His voice is a horrified rasp. \u201cWho? How\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinston and Brendan were patrolling topside tonight.\u201d Castle shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. They must\u2019ve been ambushed. They were too far out of range and the security footage only shows us that Emory and Ian noticed a disturbance and tried to investigate. We don\u2019t see anything in the tapes after that. Emory and Ian,\u201d he says, \u201cnever came back either.\u201d</p><p>Kenji is back in his chair again, his face in his hands. He looks up with a sudden burst of hope. \u201cBut Winston and Brendan\u2014maybe they can find a way out, right? They could do something\u2014they have enough power between the two of them to figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Castle offers Kenji a sympathetic smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s taken them or how they\u2019re being treated. If he\u2019s beaten them, or if he\u2019s already\u201d\u2014he hesitates\u2014\u201cif he\u2019s already tortured them, shot them\u2014if they\u2019re bleeding to death\u2014they certainly won\u2019t be able to fight back. And even if the two of them could save themselves,\u201d he says after a moment, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t leave the others behind.\u201d</p><p>Kenji presses his fists into his thighs.</p><p>\u201cSo. He wants to talk.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Adam has said a word.</p><p>Castle nods. \u201cLily found this package where they\u2019d disappeared.\u201d He tosses us a small knapsack and we take turns rummaging through it. It contains only Winston\u2019s broken glasses and Brendan\u2019s radio. Smeared in blood.</p><p>I have to grip my hands to keep them from shaking.</p><p>I was just getting to know these guys. I\u2019d only just met Emory and Ian. I was just learning to build new friendships, to feel comfortable with the people of Omega Point. I just had breakfast with Brendan and Winston. I glance at the clock on Castle\u2019s wall; it\u2019s 3:31 a.m. I last saw them about 20 hours ago.</p><p>Brendan\u2019s birthday was last week.</p><p>\u201cWinston knew,\u201d I hear myself say out loud. \u201cHe knew something was wrong. He knew there was something weird about all those soldiers everywhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Castle says, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading and rereading all of his reports.\u201d He pinches the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger. Closes his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d only just begun to piece it all together. But it was too late. I was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think they were planning?\u201d Kenji asks. \u201cDo you have a theory?\u201d</p><p>Castle sighs. Drops his hand from his face. \u201cWell, now we know why Warner was out with his soldiers every night\u2014how he was able to leave the base for as long as he did for so many days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father,\u201d Kenji says.</p><p>Castle nods. \u201cYes. It\u2019s my opinion that the supreme sent Warner out himself. That he wanted Warner to begin hunting us more aggressively. He\u2019s always known about us,\u201d Castle says to me. \u201cHe\u2019s never been a stupid man, the supreme. He\u2019s always believed the rumors about us, always known that we were out here. But we\u2019ve never been a threat to him before. Not until now,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause now that the civilians are talking about us, it\u2019s upsetting the balance of power. The people are reenergized\u2014looking for hope in our resistance. And that\u2019s not something The Reestablishment can afford right now.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he goes on, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that they couldn\u2019t find the entrance to Omega Point, and settled for taking hostages, hoping to provoke us to come out on our own.\u201d Castle retrieves a piece of paper from his pile. Holds it up. It\u2019s a note. \u201cBut there are conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe supreme has given us very specific directions on how next to proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Kenji is rigid with intensity.</p><p>\u201cThe three of you will go. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adam gapes at Castle, astonished. \u201cWhy us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t asked to see me,\u201d Castle says. \u201cI\u2019m not the one he\u2019s interested in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just going to agree to that?\u201d Adam asks. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to throw us at him?\u201d</p><p>Castle leans forward. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a plan?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe supreme wants to meet with you at exactly twelve p.m. tomorrow\u2014well, today, technically\u2014at a specific location on unregulated turf. The details are in the note.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cAnd, even though I know this is exactly what he wants, I think we should all be ready to go. We should move together. This is, after all, what we\u2019ve been training for. I\u2019ve no doubt he has bad intentions, and I highly doubt he\u2019s inviting you to chat over a cup of tea. So I think we should be ready to defend against an offensive attack. I imagine his own men will be armed and ready to fight, and I\u2019m fully prepared to lead mine into battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re the bait?\u201d Kenji asks, his eyebrows pulled together. \u201cWe don\u2019t even get to fight\u2014we\u2019re just the distraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Adam says, and I\u2019m surprised to see such emotion from him. \u201cThere has to be another way. We shouldn\u2019t be playing by his rules. We should be using this opportunity to ambush them or\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014create a diversion or a distraction so we can attack offensively! I mean, hell, doesn\u2019t anyone burst into flames or something? Don\u2019t we have anyone who can do something crazy enough to throw everything off? To give us an advantage?\u201d</p><p>Castle turns to stare at me.</p><p>Adam looks like he might punch Castle in the face. \u201cYou are out of your mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have anyone else that can do something so ... earth-shattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny?\u201d Adam snaps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not trying to be funny, Mr. Kent. And your anger is not helping our situation. You may opt out if you like, but I will\u2014respectfully\u2014request Ms. Ferrars\u2019 assistance in this matter. She is the only one the supreme actually wants to see. Sending the two of you with her was my idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>All 3 of us are stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really wish I could tell you,\u201d Castle says to me. \u201cI wish I knew more. As of right now, I can only do my best to extrapolate from the information I have, and all I\u2019ve concluded thus far is that Warner has made a glaring error that needs to be set right. Somehow you managed to get caught in the middle.\u201d A pause. \u201cWarner\u2019s father,\u201d he says, \u201chas asked very specifically for you in exchange for the hostages. He says if you do not arrive at the appointed time, he will kill our men. And I have no reason to doubt his word. Murdering the innocent is something that comes very naturally to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you were just going to let her walk into that!\u201d Adam knocks over his garbage can as he jumps to his feet. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even going to say anything? You were going to let us assume that she wasn\u2019t a target? Are you insane?\u201d</p><p>Castle rubs his forehead. Takes a few calming breaths. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, his voice carefully measured. \u201cI was not going to let her walk right into anything. What I\u2019m saying is that we will all fight together, but you two will go with Ms. Ferrars. The three of you have worked together before, and both you and Kenji have military training. You\u2019re more familiar with the rules, the techniques, the strategy they might employ. You would help keep her safe and embody the element of surprise\u2014your presence could be what gives us an advantage in this situation. If he wants her badly enough, he\u2019ll have to find a way to juggle the three of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\u2014you know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Kenji says, affecting nonchalance, \u201cmaybe he\u2019ll just shoot us both in the face and drag Juliette away while we\u2019re too busy being dead to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adam is looking at me, panic forcing his eyes wide. \u201cJuliette\u2014no\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you might want to think about this for a second,\u201d Kenji cuts in, sounding a little nervous.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I tell them. \u201cBut I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Castle smiles, relief written across his features.</p><p>\u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for, right?\u201d I look around. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to fight back. This is our chance.\u201d</p><p>Castle is beaming, his eyes bright with something that might be pride. \u201cWe will be with you every step of the way, Ms. Ferrars. You can count on it.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p> <p>And I realize this is probably what I\u2019m meant to do. Maybe this is exactly why I\u2019m here.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m just supposed to die.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>The morning is a blur.</p><p>There\u2019s so much to do, so much to prepare for, and there are so many people getting ready. But I know that ultimately this is my battle; I have unfinished business to deal with. I know this meeting has nothing to do with the supreme commander. He has no reason to care so much about me. I\u2019ve never even met the man; I should be nothing more than expendable to him.</p><p>This is Warner\u2019s move.</p><p>It has to be Warner who asked for me. This has something and everything to do with him; it\u2019s a smoke signal telling me he still wants me and he\u2019s not yet given up. And I have to face him.</p><p>I only wonder how he managed to get his father to pull these strings for him.</p> <p>I guess I\u2019ll find out soon enough.</p><p>Someone is calling my name.</p><p>I stop in place.</p><p>Spin around.</p><p>James.</p><p>He runs up to me just outside the dining hall. His hair, so blond; his eyes, so blue, just like his older brother\u2019s. But I\u2019ve missed his face in a way that has nothing to do with how much he reminds me of Adam.</p><p>James is a special kid. A sharp kid. The kind of 10-year-old who is always underestimated. And he\u2019s asking me if we can talk. He points to one of the many corridors.</p><p>I nod. Follow him into an empty tunnel.</p><p>He stops walking and turns away for a moment. Stands there looking uncomfortable. I\u2019m stunned he even wants to talk to me; I haven\u2019t spoken a single word to him in 3 weeks. He started spending time with the other kids at Omega Point shortly after we arrived, and then things somehow got awkward between us. He stopped smiling when he\u2019d see me, stopped waving hello from across the dining hall. I always imagined he\u2019d heard rumors about me from the other kids and decided he was better off staying away. And now, after everything that\u2019s happened with Adam\u2014after our very public display in the tunnel\u2014I\u2019m shocked he wants to say anything to me.</p><p>His head is still down when he whispers, \u201cI was really, really mad at you.\u201d</p><p>And the stitches in my heart begin to pop. One by one.</p><p>He looks up. Looks at me like he\u2019s trying to gauge whether or not his opening words have upset me, whether or not I\u2019m going to yell at him for being honest with me. And I don\u2019t know what he sees in my face but it seems to disarm him. He shoves his hands into his pockets. Rubs his sneaker in circles on the floor. Says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you killed someone before.\u201d</p><p>I take an unsteady breath and wonder if there will ever be a proper way to respond to a statement like that. I wonder if anyone other than James will ever even say something like that to me. I think not. So I just nod. And say, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I should\u2019ve told y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you?\u201d he shouts, shocking me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? Why did everyone else know except for me?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m floored for a moment, floored by the hurt in his voice, the anger in his eyes. I never knew he considered me a friend, and I realize I should have. James hasn\u2019t known many people in his life; Adam is his entire world. Kenji and I were 2 of the only people he\u2019d ever really met before we got to Omega Point. And for an orphaned child in his circumstances, it must\u2019ve meant a lot to have new friends. But I\u2019ve been so concerned with my own issues that it never occurred to me that James would care so much. I never realized my omission would\u2019ve seemed like a betrayal to him. That the rumors he heard from the other children must\u2019ve hurt him just as much as they hurt me.</p><p>So I decide to sit down, right there in the tunnel. I make room for him to sit down beside me. And I tell him the truth. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to hate me.\u201d</p><p>He glares at the floor. Says, \u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He picks at his shoelaces. Sighs. Shakes his head. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t like what they were saying about you,\u201d he says, quieter now. \u201cThe other kids. They said you were mean and nasty and I told them you weren\u2019t. I told them you were quiet and nice. And that you have nice hair. And they told me I was lying.\u201d</p><p>I swallow, hard, punched in the heart. \u201cYou think I have nice hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d James asks me, eyes so open, so ready to be understanding. \u201cWas he trying to hurt you? Were you scared?\u201d</p><p>I take a few breaths before I answer.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember,\u201d I say to him, feeling unsteady now, \u201cwhat Adam told you about me? About how I can\u2019t touch anyone without hurting them?\u201d</p><p>James nods.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what happened,\u201d I say. \u201cI touched him and he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy\u2019d you touch him? Because you wanted him to die?\u201d</p><p>My face feels like cracked china. \u201cNo,\u201d I tell him, shaking my head. \u201cI was young\u2014only a couple of years older than you, actually. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know that I could kill people by touching them. He\u2019d fallen down at the grocery store and I was just trying to help him get to his feet.\u201d A long pause. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>James is silent for a while.</p><p>He takes turns looking at me, looking at his shoes, at the knees he\u2019s tucked up against his chest. He\u2019s staring at the ground when he finally whispers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you the truth,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>He nods. Scratches a spot on his nose. Looks at me. \u201cSo can we be friends again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be friends with me?\u201d I blink hard against the stinging in my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be mean to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would I be afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>And I laugh, mostly because I don\u2019t want to cry. I nod too many times. \u201cYes,\u201d I say to him. \u201cLet\u2019s be friends again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, and gets to his feet. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to eat lunch with those other kids anymore.\u201d</p><p>I stand up. Dust off the back of my suit. \u201cEat with us,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou can always sit at our table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nods. Looks away again. Tugs on his ear a little. \u201cSo did you know Adam is really sad all the time?\u201d He turns his blue eyes on me.</p><p>I can\u2019t speak. Can\u2019t speak at all.</p><p>\u201cAdam says he\u2019s sad because of you.\u201d James looks at me like he\u2019s waiting for me to deny it. \u201cDid you hurt him by accident too? He was in the medical wing, did you know that? He was sick.\u201d</p><p>And I think I\u2019m going to fall apart, right there, but somehow I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t lie to him. \u201cYes,\u201d I tell James. \u201cI hurt him by accident, but now\u2014n-now I stay away from him. So I can\u2019t hurt him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019s he still so sad? If you\u2019re not hurting him anymore?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head, pressing my lips together because I don\u2019t want to cry and I don\u2019t know what to say. And James seems to understand.</p><p>He throws his arms around me.</p><p>Right around my waist. Hugs me and tells me not to cry because he believes me. He believes I only hurt Adam by accident. And the little boy, too. And then he says, \u201cBut be careful today, okay? And kick some ass, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so stunned that it takes me a moment to realize that not only did he use a bad word, he just touched me for the very first time. I try to hold on for as long as I can without making things awkward between us, but I think my heart is still in a puddle somewhere on the floor.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I realize: everyone knows.</p><p>James and I walk into the dining hall together and I can already tell that the stares are different now. Their faces are full of pride, strength, and acknowledgment when they look at me. No fear. No suspicion. I\u2019ve officially become one of them. I will fight with them, for them, against the same enemy.</p><p>I can see what\u2019s in their eyes because I\u2019m beginning to remember what it feels like.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>It\u2019s like a drop of honey, a field of tulips blooming in the springtime. It\u2019s fresh rain, a whispered promise, a cloudless sky, the perfect punctuation mark at the end of a sentence.</p><p>And it\u2019s the only thing in the world keeping me afloat.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t how we wanted it to happen,\u201d Castle says to me, \u201cbut these things never usually go according to plan.\u201d Adam and Kenji and I are being fitted for battle. We\u2019re camped out in one of the larger training rooms with 5 others I\u2019ve never met before. They\u2019re in charge of weapons and armor. It\u2019s incredible how every single person at Omega Point has a job. Everyone contributes. Everyone has a task. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They all work together.</p><p>\u201cNow, we still don\u2019t know yet exactly why or how you can do what you do, Ms. Ferrars, but I\u2019m hoping that when the time comes, your Energy will present itself. These kinds of high-stress situations are perfect for provoking our abilities\u2014in fact, seventy-eight percent of Point members reported initial discovery of their ability while in critical, high-risk circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Yup, I don\u2019t say to him. That sounds about right.</p><p>Castle takes something from one of the women in the room\u2014Alia, I think is her name. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t worry about a thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there in case something should happen.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t point out that I never once said I was worried. Not out loud, anyway.</p><p>\u201cThese are your new gloves,\u201d Castle says, handing them to me. \u201cTry them on.\u201d</p><p>These new gloves are shorter, softer: they stop precisely at my wrist and fasten with a snap-button. They feel thicker, a little heavier, but they fit my fingers perfectly. I curl my hand into a fist. Smile a little. \u201cThese are incredible,\u201d I tell him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say Winston designed them?\u201d</p><p>Castle\u2019s face falls. \u201cYes,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cHe finished them just yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Winston.</p> <p>His was the very first face I saw when I woke up at Omega Point. His crooked nose, his plastic glasses, his sandy-blond hair and his background in psychology. His need for disgusting coffee.</p><p>I remember the broken glasses we found in the knapsack.</p><p>I have no idea what\u2019s happened to him.</p><p>Alia returns with a leather contraption in her hands. It looks like a harness. She asks me to lift my arms and helps me slip into the piece, and I recognize it as a holster. There are thick leather shoulder straps that intersect in the center of my back, and 50 different straps of very thin black leather overlapping around the highest part of my waist\u2014just underneath my chest\u2014like some kind of incomplete bustier. It\u2019s like a bra with no cups. Alia has to buckle everything together for me and I still don\u2019t really understand what I\u2019m wearing. I\u2019m waiting for some kind of explanation.</p><p>Then I see the guns.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing in the note about arriving unarmed,\u201d Castle says as Alia passes him two automatic handguns in a shape and size I\u2019ve come to recognize. I practiced shooting with these just yesterday.</p> <p>I was terrible at it.</p><p>\u201cAnd I see no reason for you to be without a weapon,\u201d Castle is saying. He shows me where the holsters are on either side of my rib cage. Teaches me how the guns fit, how to snap the holder into place, where the extra cartridges go.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother to mention that I have no idea how to reload a weapon. Kenji and I never got to that part in our lesson. He was too busy trying to remind me not to use a gun to gesticulate while asking questions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping the firearms will be a last resort,\u201d Castle says to me. \u201cYou have enough weapons in your personal arsenal\u2014you shouldn\u2019t need to shoot anyone. And, just in case you find yourself using your gift to destroy something, I suggest you wear these.\u201d He holds up a set of what look like elaborate variations on brass knuckles. \u201cAlia designed these for you.\u201d</p><p>I look from her to Castle to the foreign objects in his hand. He\u2019s beaming. I thank Alia for taking the time to create something for me and she stammers out an incoherent response, blushing like she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking to her.</p><p>I\u2019m baffled.</p><p>I take the pieces from Castle and inspect them. The underside is made up of 4 concentric circles welded together, big enough in diameter to fit like a set of rings, snug over my gloves. I slip my fingers through the holes and turn my hand over to inspect the upper part. It\u2019s like a mini shield, a million pieces of gunmetal that cover my knuckles, my fingers, the entire back of my hand. I can curl my fist and the metal moves with the motion of my joints. It\u2019s not nearly as heavy as it looks.</p><p>I slip the other piece on. Curl my fingers. Reach for the guns now strapped to my body.</p> <p>Easy.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Castle asks. I\u2019ve never seen him smile so wide before.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I tell him. \u201cEverything is perfect. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. I\u2019m so pleased. Now,\u201d he says, \u201cif you\u2019ll excuse me, I must attend to a few other details before we leave. I will return shortly.\u201d He offers me a curt nod before heading out the door. Everyone but me, Kenji, and Adam leaves the room.</p><p>I turn to see how the guys are doing.</p><p>Kenji is wearing a suit.</p><p>Some kind of bodysuit. He\u2019s black from head to toe, his jet-black hair and eyes a perfect match for the outfit molded to every contour of his body. The suit seems to have a synthetic feel to it, almost like plastic; it gleams in the fluorescent lighting of the room and looks like it\u2019d be too stiff to move around in. But then I see him stretching his arms and rolling back and forth on the balls of his feet and the suit suddenly looks fluid, like it moves with him. He\u2019s wearing boots but no gloves, and a harness, just like me. But his is different: it has simple holsters that sling over his arms like the straps of a backpack.</p><p>And Adam.</p><p>Adam is gorgeous wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt, dark blue and dangerously tight across his chest. I can\u2019t help but linger over the details of his outfit, can\u2019t help but remember what it was like to be held against him, in his arms. He\u2019s standing right in front of me and I miss him like I haven\u2019t seen him in years. His black cargo pants are tucked into the same pair of black boots he was wearing when I first met him in the asylum, shin-high and sleek, created from smooth leather that fits him so perfectly it\u2019s a surprise they weren\u2019t made for his body. But there are no weapons on his person.</p><p>And I\u2019m curious enough to ask.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head to look up and freezes. Blinks, eyebrows up, lips parted. His eyes travel down every inch of my body, pausing to study the harness framing my chest, the guns slung close to my waist.</p><p>He says nothing. He runs a hand through his hair, presses the heel of his palm to his forehead and says something about being right back. He leaves the room.</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>Kenji clears his throat, loud. Shakes his head. Says, \u201cWow. I mean, really, are you trying to kill the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kenji is looking at me like I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go around all \u2018Oh, Adam, look at me, look at how sexy I am in my new outfit\u2019 and bat your eyelashes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBat my eyelashes?\u201d I balk at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m not batting my eyelashes at him! And this is the same outfit I\u2019ve worn every day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kenji grunts. Shrugs and says, \u201cYeah, well, it looks different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am just saying,\u201d he says, hands up in mock surrender, \u201cthat if I were him? And you were my girl? And you were walking around looking like that, and I couldn\u2019t touch you?\u201d He looks away. Shrugs again. \u201cI am just saying I do not envy the poor bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell. Forget I said anything,\u201d he says, waving his hands around. \u201cSeriously. It is none of my business.\u201d He shoots me a look. \u201cAnd do not consider this an invitation for you to start telling me all of your secret feelings now.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you anything about my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had a girlfriend, Kenji?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks mortally offended. \u201cDo I look like the kind of guy who\u2019s never had a girlfriend? Have you even met me?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cForget I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s always going on about not wanting to talk about your feelings,\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI said I don\u2019t want to talk about your feelings.\u201d He points at me. \u201cI have zero problem talking about my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to talk about your feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I look away. Pull at the straps tugging at my back. \u201cSo what\u2019s up with your suit?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what\u2019s up with it?\u201d He frowns. He runs his hands down his outfit. \u201cThis suit is badass.\u201d</p><p>I bite back a smile. \u201cI just meant, why are you wearing a suit? Why do you get one and Adam doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cAdam doesn\u2019t need one. Few people do\u2014it all depends on what kind of gift we have. For me, this suit makes my life a hell of a lot easier. I don\u2019t always use it, but when I need to get serious about a mission, it really helps. Like, when I need to blend into a background,\u201d he explains, \u201cit\u2019s less complicated if I\u2019m shifting one solid color\u2014hence, the black. And if I have too many layers and too many extra pieces floating around my body, I have to focus that much more on making sure I blend all the details. If I\u2019m one solid piece and one solid color, I\u2019m a much better chameleon. Besides,\u201d he adds, stretching out the muscles in his arms, \u201cI look sexy as hell in this outfit.\u201d</p><p>It takes all the self-control I have not to burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cSo, but what about Adam?\u201d I ask him. \u201cAdam doesn\u2019t need a suit or guns? That doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have guns,\u201d Adam says as he walks back into the room. His eyes are focused on the fists he\u2019s clenching and unclenching in front of him. \u201cYou just can\u2019t see them.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop looking at him, can\u2019t stop staring.</p><p>\u201cInvisible guns, huh?\u201d Kenji smirks. \u201cThat\u2019s cute. I don\u2019t think I ever went through that phase.\u201d</p><p>Adam glares at Kenji. \u201cI have nine different weapons concealed on my body right now. Would you like to choose the one I use to shoot you in the face? Or should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke, Kent. Damn. I was joking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, everyone.\u201d</p><p>We all spin around at the sound of Castle\u2019s voice.</p><p>He examines the 3 of us. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I say, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Adam nods.</p><p>Kenji says, \u201cLet\u2019s do this shit.\u201d</p><p>Castle says, \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>It\u2019s 10:32 a.m.</p><p>We have exactly 1 hour and 28 minutes before we\u2019re supposed to meet the supreme commander.</p><p>This is the plan:</p><p>Castle and every able body from Omega Point are already in position. They left half an hour ago. They\u2019re hiding in the abandoned buildings skirting the circumference of the meeting point indicated in the note. They will be ready to engage in an offensive strike just as soon as Castle gives the signal\u2014and Castle will only give that signal if he senses we\u2019re in danger.</p><p>Adam and Kenji and I are going to travel by foot.</p><p>Kenji and Adam are familiar with unregulated turf because as soldiers, they were required to know which sections of land were strictly off-limits. No one is allowed to trespass on the grounds of our past world. The strange alleyways, side streets, old restaurants and office buildings are forbidden territory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kenji says our meeting point is in one of the few suburban areas still standing; he says he knows it well. Apparently as a soldier he was sent on several errands in this area, each time required to drop off unmarked packages in an abandoned mailbox. The packages were never explained, and he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to ask.</p><p>He says it\u2019s odd that any of these old houses are even functional, especially considering how strict The Reestablishment is about making sure the civilians never try to go back. In fact, most of the residential neighborhoods were torn down immediately after the initial takeover. So it\u2019s very, very rare to find sections left untouched. But there it is, written on the note in too-tight capital letters:</p><p>1542 SYCAMORE</p><p>We\u2019re meeting the supreme commander inside of what used to be someone\u2019s home.</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you think we should do? Just ring the doorbell?\u201d Kenji is leading us toward the exit of Omega Point. I\u2019m staring straight ahead in the dim light of this tunnel, trying not to focus on the woodpeckers in my stomach. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Kenji asks again. \u201cWould that be too much? Maybe we should just knock?\u201d</p><p>I try to laugh, but the effort is halfhearted at best.</p><p>Adam doesn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Kenji says, all seriousness now. \u201cOnce we get out there, you know the drill. We link hands. I project to blend the three of us. One of you on either side of me. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding, trying not to look at Adam as I do.</p> <p>This is going to be one of the first tests for him and his ability; he\u2019ll have to be able to turn off his Energy just as long as he\u2019s linked to Kenji. If he can\u2019t manage it, Kenji\u2019s projection won\u2019t work on Adam, and Adam will be exposed. In danger.</p><p>\u201cKent,\u201d Kenji says, \u201cyou understand the risks, right? If you can\u2019t pull this off?\u201d</p><p>Adam nods. His face is unflinching. He says he\u2019s been training every day, working with Castle to get himself under control. He says he\u2019s going to be fine.</p><p>He looks at me as he says it.</p><p>My emotions jump out of a plane.</p><p>I hardly even notice we\u2019re nearing the surface when Kenji motions for us to follow him up a ladder. I climb and try to think at the same time, going over and over the plan we spent the early hours of the morning strategizing.</p> <p>Getting there is the easy part.</p><p>Getting inside is where things get tricky.</p><p>We\u2019re supposed to pretend we\u2019re doing a swap\u2014our hostages are supposed to be with the supreme commander, and I\u2019m supposed to oversee their release. It\u2019s supposed to be an exchange.</p><p>Me for them.</p><p>But the truth is that we have no idea what will actually happen. We don\u2019t know, for example, who will answer the door. We don\u2019t know if anyone will answer the door. We don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re actually meeting inside the house or if we\u2019re simply meeting outside of it. We also don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react to seeing Adam and Kenji and the makeshift armory we have strapped to our bodies.</p><p>We don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll start shooting right away.</p><p>This is the part that scares me. I\u2019m not worried for myself as much as I am for Adam and Kenji. They are the twist in this plan. They are the element of surprise. They\u2019re either the unexpected pieces that give us the only advantage we can afford right now, or they\u2019re the unexpected pieces that end up dead the minute they\u2019re spotted. And I\u2019m starting to think this was a very bad idea.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to wonder if I was wrong. If maybe I can\u2019t handle this.</p> <p>But it\u2019s too late to turn back now.</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>Kenji tells us to lie low as he pops his head out of the exit. He\u2019s already disappeared from sight, his figure blending into the background. He\u2019s going to let us know if we\u2019re clear to surface.</p><p>I\u2019m too nervous to speak.</p><p>Too nervous to think.</p><p>I can do this we can do this we have no choice but to do this, is all I keep saying to myself.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I hear Kenji\u2019s voice from above our heads. Adam and I follow him up the last stretch of the ladder. We\u2019re taking one of the alternate exit routes out of Omega Point\u2014one that only 7 people know about, according to Castle. We\u2019re taking as many precautions as necessary.</p><p>Adam and I manage to haul our bodies aboveground and I immediately feel the cold and Kenji\u2019s hand slip around my waist. Cold cold cold. It cuts through the air like little knives slicing across our skin. I look down at my feet and see nothing but a barely perceptible shimmer where my boots are supposed to be. I wiggle my fingers in front of my face.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I look around.</p><p>No Adam and no Kenji except for Kenji\u2019s invisible hand, now resting at the small of my back.</p><p>It worked. Adam made it work. I\u2019m so relieved I want to sing.</p><p>\u201cCan you guys hear me?\u201d I whisper, happy no one can see me smiling.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m right here,\u201d Adam says.</p><p>\u201cNice work, Kent,\u201d Kenji says to him. \u201cI know this can\u2019t be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Adam says. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re like a human chain.</p><p>Kenji is between me and Adam and we\u2019re linked, holding hands as Kenji guides us through this deserted area. I have no idea where we are, and I\u2019m starting to realize that I seldom do. This world is still so foreign to me, still so new. Spending so much time in isolation while the planet crumbled to pieces didn\u2019t do me any favors.</p><p>The farther we go, the closer we get to the main road and the closer we get to the compounds that are settled not a mile from here. I can see the boxy shape of their steel structures from where we\u2019re standing.</p><p>Kenji jerks to a halt.</p><p>Says nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we moving?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Kenji shushes me. \u201cCan you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Adam pulls in a breath. \u201cShit. Someone\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tank,\u201d Kenji clarifies.</p><p>\u201cMore than one,\u201d Adam adds.</p><p>\u201cSo why are we still standing here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Juliette, hold on a second\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then I see it. A parade of tanks coming down the main road. I count 6 of them altogether.</p><p>Kenji unleashes a series of expletives under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one reason Warner ever ordered us to take more than two tanks out at a time, on the same route,\u201d Adam says to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re preparing for a fight.\u201d</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cDammit! Of course he knows. Castle was right. He knows we\u2019re bringing backup. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it, Kenji?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have about forty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s move,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to worry about what\u2019s going to happen afterward. Castle is prepared\u2014he\u2019s anticipating something like this. We\u2019ll be okay. But if we don\u2019t get to that house on time, Winston and Brendan and everyone else might die today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might die today,\u201d he points out.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re moving through the streets quickly now. Swiftly. Darting through the clearing toward some semblance of civilization and that\u2019s when I see it: the remnants of an achingly familiar universe. Little square houses with little square yards that are now nothing more than wild weeds decaying in the wind. The dead grass crunches under our feet, icy and uninviting. We count down the houses.</p><p>1542 Sycamore.</p><p>It must be this one. It\u2019s impossible to miss.</p><p>It\u2019s the only house on this entire street that looks fully functional. The paint is fresh, clean, a beautiful shade of robin\u2019s-egg blue. A small set of stairs leads up to the front porch, where I notice 2 white wicker rocking chairs and a huge planter full of bright blue flowers I\u2019ve never seen before. I see a welcome mat made of rubber, wind chimes hanging from a wooden beam, clay pots and a small shovel tucked into a corner. It\u2019s everything we can never have anymore.</p><p>Someone lives here.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible that this exists.</p><p>I\u2019m pulling Kenji and Adam toward the home, overcome with emotion, almost forgetting that we\u2019re no longer allowed to live in this old, beautiful world.</p><p>Someone is yanking me backward.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t it,\u201d Kenji says to me. \u201cThis is the wrong street. Shit. This is the wrong street\u2014we\u2019re supposed to be two streets down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this house\u2014it\u2019s\u2014I mean, Kenji, someone lives here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one lives here,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone probably set this up to throw us off\u2014in fact, I bet that house is lined with C4. It\u2019s probably a trap designed to catch people wandering unregulated turf. Now come on\u201d\u2014he yanks at my hand again\u2014\u201cwe have to hurry. We have seven minutes!\u201d</p><p>And even though we\u2019re running forward, I keep looking back, waiting to see some sign of life, waiting to see someone step outside to check the mail, waiting to see a bird fly by.</p><p>And maybe I\u2019m imagining it.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m insane.</p><p>But I could\u2019ve sworn I just saw a curtain flutter in an upstairs window.</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>90 seconds.</p><p>The real 1542 Sycamore is just as dilapidated as I\u2019d originally imagined it would be. It\u2019s a crumbling mess, its roof groaning under the weight of too many years\u2019 negligence. Adam and Kenji and I are standing just around the corner, out of sight even though we\u2019re technically still invisible. There is not a single person anywhere, and the entire house looks abandoned. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if this was all just an elaborate joke.</p><p>75 seconds.</p><p>\u201cYou guys stay hidden,\u201d I tell Kenji and Adam, struck by sudden inspiration. \u201cI want him to think I\u2019m alone. If anything goes wrong, you guys can jump in, okay? There\u2019s too much of a risk that your presence will throw things off too quickly.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re both quiet a moment.</p><p>\u201cDamn. That\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cI should\u2019ve thought of that.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but grin, just a little. \u201cI\u2019m going to let go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014good luck,\u201d Kenji says, his voice unexpectedly soft. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliette\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hesitate at the sound of Adam\u2019s voice.</p><p>He almost says something but seems to change his mind. He clears his throat. Whispers, \u201cPromise you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d I say into the wind, fighting back emotion. Not now. I can\u2019t deal with this right now.

It\u2019s always so frustrating when people waste my time.\u201d</p><p>My head is full of missing buttons and shards of glass and broken pencil tips. I\u2019m nodding too slowly, blinking like an idiot, unable to find the words in my mouth either because they\u2019re lost or because they never existed or simply because I have no idea what to say.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I was expecting.</p> <p>Maybe I thought he\u2019d be old and slumped and slightly blind. Maybe he\u2019d be wearing a patch on one eye and have to walk with a cane. Maybe he\u2019d have rotting teeth and ragged skin and coarse, balding hair and maybe he\u2019d be a centaur, a unicorn, an old witch with a pointy hat anything anything anything but this. Because this isn\u2019t possible. This is so hard for me to understand and whatever I was expecting was wrong so utterly, incredibly, horribly wrong.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at a man who is absolutely, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>And he is a man.</p><p>He has to be at least 45 years old, tall and strong and silhouetted in a suit that fits him so perfectly it\u2019s almost unfair. His hair is thick, smooth like hazelnut spread; his jawline is sharp, the lines of his face perfectly symmetrical, his cheekbones hardened by life and age. But it\u2019s his eyes that make all the difference. His eyes are the most spectacular things I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>They\u2019re almost aquamarine.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he says, flashing me an incredible smile. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>And it hits me then, right in that moment, because everything suddenly makes sense. His look; his stature; his smooth, classy demeanor; the ease with which I nearly forgot he was a villain\u2014this man.</p><p>This is Warner\u2019s father.</p> <p>I step into what looks like a small living room. There are old, lumpy couches settled around a tiny coffee table. The wallpaper is yellowed and peeling from age. The house is heavy with a strange, moldy smell that indicates the cracked glass windows haven\u2019t been opened in years, and the carpet is forest green under my feet, the walls embellished with fake wood panels that don\u2019t make sense to me at all. This house is, in a word, ugly. It seems ridiculous for a man so striking to be found inside of a house so horribly inferior.</p><p>\u201cOh wait,\u201d he says, \u201cjust one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s pinned me against the wall by the throat, his hands carefully sheathed in a pair of leather gloves, already prepared to touch my skin to cut off my oxygen, choke me to death and I\u2019m so sure I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m so sure that this is what it feels like to die, to be utterly immobilized, limp from the neck down. I try to claw at him, kicking at his body with the last of my energy until I\u2019m giving up, forfeiting to my own stupidity, my last thoughts condemning me for being such an idiot, for thinking I could actually come in here and accomplish anything until I realize he\u2019s undone my holsters, stolen my guns, put them in his pockets.</p><p>He lets me go.</p><p>I drop to the floor.</p><p>He tells me to have a seat.</p><p>I shake my head, coughing against the torture in my lungs, wheezing into the dirty, musty air, heaving in strange, horrible gasps, my whole body in spasms against the pain. I\u2019ve been inside for less than 2 minutes and he\u2019s already overpowered me. I have to figure out how to do something, how to get through this alive. Now\u2019s not the time to hold back.</p><p>I press my eyes shut for a moment. Try to clear my airways, try to find my head. When I finally look up I see he\u2019s already seated himself on one of the chairs, staring at me as though thoroughly entertained.</p><p>I can hardly speak. \u201cWhere are the hostages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d This man whose name I do not know waves an indifferent hand in the air. \u201cThey\u2019ll be just fine. Are you sure you won\u2019t sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I try to clear my throat and regret it immediately, forcing myself to blink back the traitorous tears burning my eyes. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>He leans forward in his seat. Clasps his hands. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not entirely sure anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve certainly figured out that all of this\u201d\u2014he nods at me, around the room\u2014\u201cis just a distraction, right?\u201d He smiles that same incredible smile. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve realized that my ultimate goal was to lure your people out into my territory? My men are waiting for just one word. One word from me and they will seek out and destroy all of your little friends waiting so patiently within this half-mile radius.\u201d</p><p>Terror waves hello to me.</p><p>He laughs a little. \u201cIf you think I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on in my own land, young lady, you are quite mistaken.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve let these freaks live too freely among us, and it was my mistake. They\u2019re causing me too much trouble, and now it\u2019s time to take them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am one of those freaks,\u201d I tell him, trying to control the tremble in my voice. \u201cWhy did you bring me here if all you want is to kill us? Why me? You didn\u2019t have to single me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He nods. Stands up. Shoves his hands into his pockets. \u201cI came here with a purpose: to clean up the mess my son made, and to finally put an end to the naive efforts of a group of idiotic aberrations. To erase the lot of you from this sorry world. But then,\u201d he says, laughing a little, \u201cjust as I began drafting my plans, my son came to me and begged me not to kill you. Just you.\u201d He stops. Looks up. \u201cHe actually begged me not to kill you.\u201d Laughs again. \u201cIt was just as pathetic as it was surprising.</p><p>\u201cOf course then I knew I had to meet you,\u201d he says, smiling, staring at me like he might be enchanted. \u201c\u2018I must meet the girl who\u2019s managed to bewitch my boy!\u2019 I said to myself. This girl who\u2019s managed to make him lose sight of his pride\u2014his dignity\u2014long enough to beg me for a favor.\u201d A pause. \u201cDo you know,\u201d he says to me, \u201cwhen my son has ever asked me for a favor?\u201d He cocks his head. Waits for me to answer.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cNever. Not once in nineteen years has he ever asked me for anything. Hard to believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His smile is wider, brilliant. \u201cI take full credit, of course. I raised him well. Taught him to be entirely self-reliant, self-possessed, unencumbered by the needs and wants that break most other men. So to hear these disgraceful, pleading words come out of his mouth?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWell. Naturally, I was intrigued. I had to see you for myself. I needed to understand what he\u2019d seen, what was so special about you that it could\u2019ve caused such a colossal lapse in judgment. Though, to be perfectly honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI really didn\u2019t think you\u2019d show up.\u201d He takes one hand out of his pocket, gestures with it as he speaks. \u201cI mean I certainly hoped you would. But I thought if you did, you\u2019d at least come with support\u2014some form of backup. But here you are, wearing this spandex monstrosity\u201d\u2014he laughs out loud\u2014\u201cand you\u2019re all alone.\u201d He studies me. \u201cVery stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cBut brave. I like that. I can admire bravery.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow, I brought you here to teach my son a lesson. I had every intention of killing you,\u201d he says, assuming a slow, steady walk around the room. \u201cAnd I preferred to do it where he would be sure to see it. War is messy,\u201d he adds, waving his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose track of who\u2019s been killed and how they died and who killed whom, et cetera, et cetera. I wanted this particular death to be as clean and simple as the message it would convey. It\u2019s not good for him to form these kinds of attachments, after all. It\u2019s my duty as his father to put an end to that kind of nonsense.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick, so sick, so tremendously sick to my stomach. This man is far worse than I ever could have imagined.</p><p>My voice is one hard breath, one loud whisper when I speak. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you just kill me?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. Says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I had no idea you were going to be quite so lovely. I\u2019m afraid my son never mentioned how beautiful you are. And it\u2019s always so difficult to kill a beautiful thing,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBesides, you surprised me. You arrived on time. Alone. You were actually willing to sacrifice yourself to save the worthless creatures stupid enough to get themselves caught.\u201d</p><p>He takes a sharp breath. \u201cMaybe we could keep you. If you don\u2019t prove useful, you might prove entertaining, at the very least.\u201d He tilts his head, thoughtful. \u201cThough if we did keep you, I suppose you\u2019d have to come back to the capital with me, because I can\u2019t trust my son to do anything right anymore. I\u2019ve given him far too many chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I\u2019d really rather jump off a cliff.\u201d</p><p>His laughter is like a hundred little bells, happy and wholesome and contagious. \u201cOh my.\u201d He smiles, bright and warm and devastatingly sincere. He shakes his head. Calls over his shoulder toward what looks like it might be another room\u2014maybe the kitchen, I can\u2019t be sure\u2014and says, \u201cSon, would you come in here, please?\u201d</p><p>And all I can think is that sometimes you\u2019re dying, sometimes you\u2019re about to explode, sometimes you\u2019re 6 feet under and you\u2019re searching for a window when someone pours lighter fluid in your hair and lights a match on your face.</p><p>I feel my bones ignite.</p><p>Warner is here.</p><p>THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>He appears in a doorway directly across from where I\u2019m now standing and he looks exactly as I remember him. Golden hair and perfect skin and eyes too bright for their faded shade of emerald. His is an exquisitely handsome face, one I now realize he\u2019s inherited from his father. It\u2019s the kind of face no one believes in anymore; lines and angles and easy symmetry that\u2019s almost offensive in its perfection. No one should ever want a face like that. It\u2019s a face destined for trouble, for danger, for an outlet to overcompensate for the excess it stole from an unsuspecting innocent.</p><p>It\u2019s overdone.</p><p>It\u2019s too much.</p><p>It frightens me.</p><p>Black and green and gold seem to be his colors. His pitch-black suit is tailored to his frame, lean but muscular, offset by the crisp white of his shirt underneath and complemented by the simple black tie knotted at his throat. He stands straight, tall, unflinching. To anyone else he would look imposing, even with his right arm still in a sling. He\u2019s the kind of boy who was only ever taught to be a man, who was told to erase the concept of childhood from his life\u2019s expectations. His lips do not dare to smile, his forehead does not crease in distress. He has been taught to disguise his emotions, to hide his thoughts from the world and to trust no one and nothing. To take what he wants by whatever means necessary. I can see all of this so clearly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he looks different to me.</p><p>His gaze is too heavy, his eyes, too deep. His expression is too full of something I don\u2019t want to recognize. He\u2019s looking at me like I succeeded, like I shot him in the heart and shattered him, like I left him to die after he told me he loved me and I refused to think it was even possible.</p><p>And I see the difference in him now. I see what\u2019s changed.</p><p>He\u2019s making no effort to hide his emotions from me.</p> <p>My lungs are liars, pretending they can\u2019t expand just to have a laugh at my expense and my fingers are fluttering, struggling to escape the prison of my bones as if they\u2019ve waited 17 years to fly away.</p><p>Escape, is what my fingers say to me.</p><p>Breathe, is what I keep saying to myself.</p><p>Warner as a child. Warner as a son. Warner as a boy who has only a limited grasp of his own life. Warner with a father who would teach him a lesson by killing the one thing he\u2019d ever be willing to beg for.</p><p>Warner as a human being terrifies me more than anything else.</p> <p>The supreme commander is impatient. \u201cSit down,\u201d he says to his son, motioning to the couch he was just sitting on.</p><p>Warner doesn\u2019t say a word to me.</p><p>His eyes are glued to my face, my body, to the harness strapped to my chest; his gaze lingers on my neck, on the marks his father likely left behind and I see the motion in his throat, I see the difficulty he has swallowing down the sight in front of him before he finally rips himself away and walks into the living room. He\u2019s so like his father, I\u2019m beginning to realize. The way he walks, the way he looks in a suit, the way he\u2019s so meticulous about his hygiene. And yet there is no doubt in my mind that he detests the man he fails so miserably not to emulate.</p><p>\u201cSo I would like to know,\u201d the supreme says, \u201chow, exactly, you managed to get away.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cI\u2019m suddenly curious, and my son has made it very difficult to extract these details.\u201d</p><p>I blink at him.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he says. \u201cHow did you escape?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m confused. \u201cThe first or the second time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice! You managed to escape twice!\u201d He\u2019s laughing heartily now; he slaps his knee. \u201cIncredible. Both times, then. How did you get away both times?\u201d</p><p>I wonder why he\u2019s stalling for time. I don\u2019t understand why he wants to talk when so many people are waiting for a war and I can\u2019t help but hope that Adam and Kenji and Castle and everyone else haven\u2019t frozen to death outside. And while I don\u2019t have a plan, I do have a hunch. I have a feeling our hostages might be hidden in the kitchen. So I figure I\u2019ll humor him for a little while.</p><p>I tell him I jumped out the window the first time. Shot Warner the second time.</p><p>The supreme is no longer smiling. \u201cYou shot him?\u201d</p><p>I spare a glance at Warner to see his eyes are still fixed firmly on my face, his mouth still in no danger of moving. I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking and I\u2019m suddenly so curious I want to provoke him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, meeting Warner\u2019s gaze. \u201cI shot him. With his own gun.\u201d And the sudden tension in his jaw, the eyes that drop down to the hands he\u2019s gripping too tightly in his lap\u2014he looks as if he\u2019s wrenched the bullet out of his body with his own 5 fingers.</p><p>The supreme runs a hand through his hair, rubs his chin. I notice he seems unsettled for the first time since I\u2019ve arrived and I wonder how it\u2019s possible he had no idea how I escaped.</p> <p>I wonder what Warner must have said about the bullet wound in his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask before I can stop myself, catching the words just a moment too late. I shouldn\u2019t be asking stupid questions but I hate that I keep referring to him as \u201cthe supreme,\u201d as if he\u2019s some kind of untouchable entity.</p><p>Warner\u2019s father looks at me. \u201cMy name?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou may call me Supreme Commander Anderson,\u201d he says, still confused. \u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnderson? But I thought your last name was Warner.\u201d I thought he had a first name I could use to distinguish between him and the Warner I\u2019ve grown to know too well.</p><p>Anderson takes a hard breath, spares a disgusted glance at his son. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he says to me. \u201cMy son thought it would be a good idea to take his mother\u2019s last name, because that\u2019s exactly the kind of stupid thing he\u2019d do. The mistake,\u201d he says, almost announcing it now, \u201cthat he always makes, time and time again\u2014allowing his emotions to get in the way of his duty\u2014it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d he says, spitting in Warner\u2019s direction. \u201cWhich is why as much as I\u2019d like to let you live, my dear, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re too much of a distraction in his life. I cannot allow him to protect a person who has attempted to kill him.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I even have to have this conversation. What an embarrassment he\u2019s proven to be.\u201d</p><p>Anderson reaches into his pocket, pulls out a gun, aims it at my forehead.</p><p>Changes his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of always cleaning up after you,\u201d he barks at Warner, grabbing his arm, pulling him up from the couch. He pushes his son directly across from me, presses the gun into his good hand.</p><p>\u201cShoot her,\u201d he says. \u201cShoot her right now.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-SIX</p><p>Warner\u2019s gaze is locked onto mine.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me, eyes raw with emotion and I\u2019m not sure I even know him anymore. I\u2019m not sure I understand him, I\u2019m not sure I know what he\u2019s going to do when he lifts the gun with a strong, steady hand and points it directly at my face.</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cThe sooner you do this, the sooner you can move on. Now get this over with\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Warner cocks his head. Turns around.</p><p>Points the gun at his father.</p><p>I actually gasp.</p><p>Anderson looks bored, irritated, annoyed. He runs an impatient hand across his face before he pulls out another gun\u2014my other gun\u2014from his pocket. It\u2019s unbelievable.</p><p>Father and son, both threatening to kill each other.</p><p>\u201cPoint the gun in the right direction, Aaron. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Aaron.</p><p>I almost laugh in the middle of this insanity.</p><p>Warner\u2019s first name is Aaron.</p><p>\u201cI have no interest in killing her,\u201d Warner Aaron he says to his father.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Anderson points the gun at my head again. \u201cI\u2019ll do it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot her,\u201d Warner says, \u201cand I will put a bullet through your skull.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a triangle of death. Warner pointing a gun at his father, his father pointing a gun at me. I\u2019m the only one without a weapon and I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>If I move, I\u2019m going to die. If I don\u2019t move, I\u2019m going to die.</p><p>Anderson is smiling.</p><p>\u201cHow charming,\u201d he says. He\u2019s wearing an easy, lazy grin, his grip on the gun in his hand so deceptively casual. \u201cWhat is it? Does she make you feel brave, boy?\u201d A pause. \u201cDoes she make you feel strong?\u201d</p><p>Warner says nothing.</p><p>\u201cDoes she make you wish you could be a better man?\u201d A little chuckle. \u201cHas she filled your head with dreams about your future?\u201d A harder laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou have lost your mind,\u201d he says, \u201cover a stupid child who\u2019s too much of a coward to defend herself even with the barrel of a gun pointed straight at her face. This,\u201d he says, pointing the gun harder in my direction, \u201cis the silly little girl you\u2019ve fallen in love with.\u201d He exhales a short, hard breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>A new tightness in his breathing. A new tightness in his grip around the gun in his hand. These are the only signs that Warner is even remotely affected by his father\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cHow many times,\u201d Anderson asks, \u201chave you threatened to kill me? How many times have I woken up in the middle of the night to find you, even as a little boy, trying to shoot me in my sleep?\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cTen times? Maybe fifteen? I have to admit I\u2019ve lost count.\u201d He stares at Warner. Smiles again. \u201cAnd how many times,\u201d he says, his voice so much louder now, \u201cwere you able to go through with it? How many times did you succeed? How many times,\u201d he says, \u201cdid you burst into tears, apologizing, clinging to me like some demented\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth,\u201d Warner says, his voice so low, so even, his frame so still it\u2019s terrifying.</p><p>\u201cYou are weak,\u201d Anderson spits, disgusted. \u201cToo pathetically sentimental. Don\u2019t want to kill your own father? Too afraid it\u2019ll break your miserable heart?\u201d</p><p>Warner\u2019s jaw tenses.</p><p>\u201cShoot me,\u201d Anderson says, his eyes dancing, bright with amusement. \u201cI said shoot me!\u201d he shouts, this time reaching for Warner\u2019s injured arm, grabbing him until his fingers are clenched tight around the wound, twisting his arm back until Warner actually gasps from the pain, blinking too fast, trying desperately to suppress the scream building inside of him. His grip on the gun in his good hand wavers, just a little.</p><p>Anderson releases his son. Pushes him so hard that Warner stumbles as he tries to maintain his balance. His face is chalk-white. The sling wrapped around his arm is seeping with blood.</p><p>\u201cSo much talk,\u201d Anderson says, shaking his head. \u201cSo much talk and never enough follow-through. You embarrass me,\u201d he says to Warner, face twisted in repulsion. \u201cYou make me sick.\u201d</p><p>A sharp crack.</p><p>Anderson backhands Warner in the face so hard Warner actually sways for a moment, already unsteady from all the blood he\u2019s losing. But he doesn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>He stands there, bearing the pain, blinking fast, jaw so tight, staring at his father with absolutely no emotion on his face; there\u2019s no indication he\u2019s just been slapped but the bright red mark across his cheek, his temple, and part of his forehead. But his arm sling is more blood than cotton now, and he looks far too ill to be on his feet.</p><p>Still, he says nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to threaten me again?\u201d Anderson is breathing hard as he speaks. \u201cDo you still think you can defend your little girlfriend? You think I\u2019m going to allow your stupid infatuation to get in the way of everything I\u2019ve built? Everything I\u2019ve worked toward?\u201d Anderson\u2019s gun is no longer pointed at me. He forgets me long enough to press the barrel of his gun into Warner\u2019s forehead, twisting it, jabbing it against his skin as he speaks. \u201cHave I taught you nothing?\u201d he shouts. \u201cHave you learned nothing from me\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to explain what happens next.</p><p>All I know is that my hand is around Anderson\u2019s throat and I\u2019ve pinned him to the wall, so overcome by a blind, burning, all-consuming rage that I think my brain has already caught on fire and dissolved into ash.</p><p>I squeeze a little harder.</p><p>He\u2019s sputtering. He\u2019s gasping. He\u2019s trying to get at my arms, clawing limp hands at my body and he\u2019s turning red and blue and purple and I\u2019m enjoying it. I\u2019m enjoying it so, so much.</p><p>I think I\u2019m smiling.</p><p>I bring my face less than an inch away from his ear and whisper, \u201cDrop the gun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He does.</p><p>I drop him and grab the gun at the same time.</p><p>Anderson is wheezing, coughing on the floor, trying to breathe, trying to speak, trying to reach for something to defend himself with and I\u2019m amused by his pain. I\u2019m floating in a cloud of absolute, undiluted hatred for this man and all that he\u2019s done and I want to sit and laugh until the tears choke me into a contented sort of silence. I understand so much now. So much.</p><p>\u201cJuliette\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWarner,\u201d I say, so softly, still staring at Anderson\u2019s body slumped on the floor in front of me, \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to leave me alone right now.\u201d</p><p>I weigh the gun in my hands. Test my finger on the trigger. Try to remember what Kenji taught me about taking aim. About keeping my hands and arms steady. Preparing for the kickback\u2014the recoil\u2014of the shot.</p><p>I tilt my head. Take inventory of his body parts.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Anderson finally manages to gasp, \u201cyou\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shoot him in the leg.</p> <p>He\u2019s screaming. I think he\u2019s screaming. I can\u2019t really hear anything anymore. My ears feel stuffed full of cotton, like someone might be trying to speak to me or maybe someone is shouting at me but everything is muffled and I have too much to focus on right now to pay attention to whatever annoying things are happening in the background. All I know is the reverberation of this weapon in my hand. All I hear is the gunshot echoing through my head. And I decide I\u2019d like to do it again.</p><p>I shoot him in the other leg.</p><p>There\u2019s so much screaming.</p><p>I\u2019m entertained by the horror in his eyes. The blood ruining the expensive fabric of his clothes. I want to tell him he doesn\u2019t look very attractive with his mouth open like that but then I think he probably wouldn\u2019t care about my opinion anyway. I\u2019m just a silly girl to him. Just a silly little girl, a stupid child with a pretty face who\u2019s too much of a coward, he said, too much of a coward to defend herself. And oh, wouldn\u2019t he like to keep me. Wouldn\u2019t he like to keep me as his little pet. And I realize no. I shouldn\u2019t bother sharing my thoughts with him. There\u2019s no point wasting words on someone who\u2019s about to die.</p><p>I take aim at his chest. Try to remember where the heart is.</p><p>Not quite to the left. Not quite in the center.</p> <p>Just\u2014there.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>I am a thief.</p><p>I stole this notebook and this pen from one of the doctors, from one of his lab coats when he wasn\u2019t looking, and I shoved them both down my pants. This was just before he ordered those men to come and get me. The ones in the strange suits with the thick gloves and the gas masks with the foggy plastic windows hiding their eyes. They were aliens, I remember thinking. I remember thinking they must\u2019ve been aliens because they couldn\u2019t have been human, the ones who handcuffed my hands behind my back, the ones who strapped me to my seat. They stuck Tasers to my skin over and over for no reason other than to hear me scream but I wouldn\u2019t. I whimpered but I never said a word. I felt the tears streak down my cheeks but I wasn\u2019t crying.</p><p>I think it made them angry.</p><p>They slapped me awake even though my eyes were open when we arrived. Someone unstrapped me without removing my handcuffs and kicked me in both kneecaps before ordering me to rise. And I tried. I tried but I couldn\u2019t and finally 6 hands shoved me out the door and my face was bleeding on the concrete for a while. I can\u2019t really remember the part where they dragged me inside.</p><p>I feel cold all the time.</p> <p>I feel empty, like there is nothing inside of me but this broken heart, the only organ left in this shell. I feel the bleats echo within me, I feel the thumping reverberate around my skeleton. I have a heart, says science, but I am a monster, says society. And I know it, of course I know it. I know what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m not asking for sympathy.</p><p>But sometimes I think\u2014sometimes I wonder\u2014if I were a monster, surely, I would feel it by now?</p><p>I would feel angry and vicious and vengeful. I\u2019d know blind rage and bloodlust and a need for vindication.</p><p>Instead I feel an abyss within me that\u2019s so deep, so dark I can\u2019t see within it; I can\u2019t see what it holds. I do not know what I am or what might happen to me.</p><p>I do not know what I might do again.</p><p>THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>An explosion.</p><p>The sound of glass shattering.</p><p>Someone yanks me back just as I pull the trigger and the bullet hits the window behind Anderson\u2019s head.</p><p>I\u2019m spun around.</p><p>Kenji is shaking me, shaking me so hard I feel my head jerk back and forth and he\u2019s screaming at me, telling me we have to go, that I need to drop the gun, he\u2019s breathing hard and he\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to walk away, okay? Juliette? Can you understand me? I need you to back off right now. You\u2019re going to be okay\u2014you\u2019re going to be all right\u2014you\u2019re going to be fine, you just have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kenji\u2014\u201d I\u2019m trying to stop him from pulling me away, trying to keep my feet planted where they are because he doesn\u2019t understand. He needs to understand. \u201cI have to kill him. I have to make sure he dies,\u201d I\u2019m telling him. \u201cI just need you to give me another second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cnot yet, not right now,\u201d and he\u2019s looking at me like he\u2019s about to break, like he\u2019s seen something in my face that he wishes he\u2019d never seen, and he says, \u201cWe can\u2019t. We can\u2019t kill him yet. It\u2019s too soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s not okay and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening but Kenji is reaching for my hand, he\u2019s prying the gun out of the fingers I didn\u2019t realize were wrapped so tightly around the handle. And I\u2019m blinking. I feel confused and disappointed. I look down at my hands. At my suit. And I can\u2019t understand for a moment where all the blood came from.</p><p>I glance at Anderson.</p><p>His eyes are rolled back in his head. Kenji is checking his pulse. Looks at me, says, \u201cI think he fainted.\u201d And my body has begun to shake so violently I can hardly stand.</p><p>What have I done.</p><p>I back away, needing to find a wall to cling to, something solid to hold on to and Kenji catches me, he\u2019s holding me so tightly with one arm and cradling my head with his other hand and I feel like I might want to cry but for some reason I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do anything but endure these tremors rocking the length of my entire frame.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Kenji says to me, stroking my hair in a show of tenderness I know is rare for him. I close my eyes against his shoulder, wanting to draw strength from his warmth. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d he asks me. \u201cI need you to walk with me, all right? We\u2019ll have to run, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner,\u201d I gasp, ripping out of Kenji\u2019s embrace, eyes wild. \u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s unconscious.</p><p>A heap on the floor. Arms bound behind his back, an empty syringe tossed on the carpet beside him.</p><p>\u201cI took care of Warner,\u201d Kenji says.</p><p>Suddenly everything is slamming into me all at the same time. All the reasons why we were supposed to be here, what we were trying to accomplish in the first place, the reality of what I\u2019ve done and what I was about to do. \u201cKenji,\u201d I\u2019m gasping, \u201cKenji, where\u2019s Adam? What happened? Where are the hostages? Is everyone okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam is fine,\u201d he reassures me. \u201cWe slipped in the back door and found Ian and Emory.\u201d He looks toward the kitchen area. \u201cThey\u2019re in pretty bad shape, but Adam\u2019s hauling them out, trying to get them to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others? Brendan? A-and Winston?\u201d</p><p>Kenji shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea. But I have a feeling we\u2019ll be able to get them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Kenji nods at Warner. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this kid hostage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our best bet,\u201d he says to me. \u201cAnother trade. A real one, this time. Besides, it\u2019ll be fine. You take away his guns, and this golden boy is harmless.\u201d He walks toward Warner\u2019s unmoving figure. Nudges him with the toe of his boot before hauling him up, flipping Warner\u2019s body over his shoulder. I can\u2019t help but notice that Warner\u2019s injured arm is now completely soaked through with blood.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Kenji says to me, not unkindly, eyes assessing my frame like he\u2019s not sure if I\u2019m stable yet. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here\u2014it\u2019s insanity out there and we don\u2019t have much time before they move into this street\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m blinking too fast. \u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kenji looks at me, disbelief written across his features. \u201cThe war, princess. They\u2019re all fighting to the death out there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Anderson never made the call\u2014he said they were waiting for a word from him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cAnderson didn\u2019t make the call. Castle did.\u201d</p><p>Oh</p><p>God.</p><p>\u201cJuliette!\u201d</p><p>Adam is rushing into the house, whipping around to find my face until I run forward and he catches me in his arms without thinking, without remembering that we don\u2019t do this anymore, that we\u2019re not together anymore, that he shouldn\u2019t be touching me at all. \u201cYou\u2019re okay\u2014you\u2019re okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLET\u2019S GO,\u201d Kenji barks for the final time. \u201cI know this is an emotional moment or whatever, but we have to get our asses the hell out of here. I swear, Kent\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Kenji stops.</p><p>His eyes drop.</p><p>Adam is on his knees, a look of fear and pain and horror and anger and terror etched into every line on his face and I\u2019m trying to shake him, I\u2019m trying to get him to tell me what\u2019s wrong and he can\u2019t move, he\u2019s frozen on the ground, his eyes glued to Anderson\u2019s body, his hands reaching out to touch the hair that was so perfectly set almost a moment ago and I\u2019m begging him to speak to me, begging him to tell me what happened and it\u2019s like the world shifts in his eyes, like nothing will ever be right in this world and nothing can ever be good again and he parts his lips.</p><p>He tries to speak.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d he says. \u201cThis man is my father.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-NINE</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Kenji presses his eyes shut like he can\u2019t believe this is happening. \u201cShit shit shit.\u201d He shifts Warner against his shoulders, wavers between being sensitive and being a soldier and says, \u201cAdam, man, I\u2019m sorry, but we really have to get out of here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Adam gets up, blinking back what I can only imagine are a thousand thoughts, memories, worries, hypotheses, and I call his name but it\u2019s like he can\u2019t even hear it. He\u2019s confused, disoriented, and I\u2019m wondering how this man could possibly be his father when Adam told me his dad was dead.</p><p>Now is not the time for these conversations.</p><p>Something explodes in the distance and the impact rattles the ground, the windows, the doors of this house, and Adam seems to snap back to reality. He jumps forward, grabs my arm, and we\u2019re bolting out the door.</p><p>Kenji is in the lead, somehow managing to run despite the weight of Warner\u2019s body, limp, hanging over his shoulder, and he\u2019s shouting at us to stay close behind. I\u2019m spinning, analyzing the chaos around us. The sounds of gunshots are too close too close too close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are Ian and Emory?\u201d I ask Adam. \u201cDid you get them out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of our guys were fighting not too far from here and managed to commandeer one of the tanks\u2014I got them to carry those two back to Point,\u201d he tells me, shouting so I can hear him. \u201cIt was the safest transport possible.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding, gasping for air as we fly through the streets and I\u2019m trying to focus on the sounds around us, trying to figure out who\u2019s winning, trying to figure out if our numbers have been decimated. We round the corner.</p><p>You\u2019d think it\u2019d be a massacre.</p> <p>50 of our people are fighting against 500 of Anderson\u2019s soldiers, who are unloading round after round, shooting at anything that could possibly be a target. Castle and the others are holding their ground, bloody and wounded but fighting back as best they can. Our men and women are armed and storming forward to match the shots of the opposition; others are fighting the only way they know how: one man has his hands to the ground, freezing the earth beneath the soldiers\u2019 feet, causing them to lose balance; another man is darting through the soldiers with such speed he\u2019s nothing but a blur, confusing the men and knocking them down and stealing their guns. I look up and see a woman hiding in a tree, throwing what must be knives or arrows in such rapid succession that the soldiers don\u2019t have a moment to react before they\u2019re hit from above.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Castle in the middle of it all, his hands outstretched over his head, collecting a whirlwind of particles, debris, scattered strips of steel and broken branches with nothing more than the coercion of his fingertips. The others have formed a human wall around him, protecting him as he forms a cyclone of such magnitude that even I can see he\u2019s straining to maintain control of it.</p><p>Then</p><p>he lets go.</p><p>The soldiers are shouting, screaming, running back and ducking for cover but most are too slow to escape the reach of so much destruction and they\u2019re down, impaled by shards of glass and stone and wood and broken metal but I know this defense won\u2019t last for long.</p> <p>Someone has to tell Castle.</p><p>Someone has to tell him to go, to get out of here, that Anderson is down and that we have 2 of our hostages and Warner in tow. He has to get our men and women back to Omega Point before the soldiers get smart and someone throws a bomb big enough to destroy everything. Our numbers won\u2019t hold up for much longer and this is the perfect opportunity for them to get safe.</p><p>I tell Adam and Kenji what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d Kenji shouts above the chaos. \u201cHow can we get to him? If we run through there we\u2019re dead! We need some kind of distraction\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I yell back.</p><p>\u201cA distraction!\u201d he shouts. \u201cWe need something to throw off the soldiers long enough for one of us to grab Castle and give him the green light\u2014we don\u2019t have much time\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Adam is already trying to grab me, he\u2019s already trying to stop me, he\u2019s already begging me not to do what he thinks I\u2019m going to do and I tell him it\u2019s okay. I tell him not to worry. I tell him to get the others to safety and promise him I\u2019m going to be just fine but he reaches for me, he\u2019s pleading with his eyes and I\u2019m so tempted to stay here, right next to him, but I break away. I finally know what I need to do; I\u2019m finally ready to help; I\u2019m finally kind of a little bit sure that maybe this time I might be able to control it and I have to try.</p><p>So I stumble back.</p><p>I close my eyes.</p><p>I let go.</p><p>I fall to my knees and press my palm to the ground and feel the power coursing through me, feel it curdling in my blood and mixing with the anger, the passion, the fire inside of me and I think of every time my parents called me a monster, a horrible terrifying mistake and I think of all the nights I sobbed myself to sleep and see all the faces that wanted me dead and then it\u2019s like a slide show of images reeling through my mind, men and women and children, innocent protesters run over in the streets; I see guns and bombs, fire and devastation, so much suffering suffering suffering and I steel myself. I flex my fist. I pull back my arm and</p><p>I</p><p>s h a t t e r</p><p>what\u2019s left of this earth.</p> <p>FORTY</p><p>I\u2019m still here.</p><p>I open my eyes and I\u2019m momentarily astonished, confused, half expecting to find myself dead or brain-damaged or at the very least mangled on the ground, but this reality refuses to vanish.</p><p>The world under my feet is rumbling, rattling, shaking and thundering to life and my fist is still pressed into the ground and I\u2019m afraid to let go. I\u2019m on my knees, looking up at both sides of this battle and I see the soldiers slowing down. I see their eyes dart around. I see their feet slipping failing to stay standing and the snaps, the groans, the unmistakable cracks that are now creaking through the middle of the pavement cannot be ignored and it\u2019s like the jaws of life are stretching their joints, grinding their teeth, yawning themselves awake to witness our disgrace.</p><p>The ground looks around, its mouth gaping open at the injustice, the violence, the calculated ploys for power that stop for no one and nothing and are sated only by the blood of the weak, the screams of the unwilling. It\u2019s as if the earth thought to take a peek at what we\u2019ve been doing all this time and it\u2019s terrifying just how disappointed it sounds.</p><p>Adam is running.</p><p>He\u2019s dashing through a crowd still gasping for air and an explanation for the earthquake under their feet and he tackles Castle, he pins him down, he\u2019s shouting to the men and the women and he ducks, he dodges a stray bullet, he pulls Castle to his feet and our people have begun to run.</p><p>The soldiers on the opposite side are stumbling over each other and tripping into a tangle of limbs as they try to outrun one another and I\u2019m wondering how much longer I have to hold on, how much longer this must go on before it\u2019s sufficient, and Kenji shouts, \u201cJuliette!\u201d</p><p>And I spin around just in time to hear him tell me to let go.</p><p>So I do.</p><p>The wind the trees the fallen leaves all slip and slide back into place with one giant inhalation and everything stops and for a moment I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to live in a world that isn\u2019t falling apart.</p><p>Kenji yanks me up by the arm and we\u2019re running, we\u2019re the last of our group to leave and he\u2019s asking me if I\u2019m okay and I\u2019m wondering how he\u2019s still carrying Warner, I\u2019m thinking Kenji must be a hell of a lot stronger than he looks, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m too hard on him sometimes, I\u2019m thinking I don\u2019t give him enough credit. I\u2019m just beginning to realize that he\u2019s one of my favorite people on this planet and I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s okay.</p><p>I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s my friend.</p><p>I cling to his hand and let him lead me toward a tank abandoned on our side of the divide and suddenly I realize I can\u2019t see Adam, that I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m frantic, I\u2019m screaming his name until I feel his arms around my waist, his words in my ear, and we\u2019re still diving for cover as the final shots sound in the distance.</p><p>We clamber into the tank.</p><p>We close the doors.</p><p>We disappear.</p><p>FORTY-ONE</p><p>Warner\u2019s head is on my lap.</p><p>His face is smooth and calm and peaceful in a way I\u2019ve never seen it and I almost reach out to stroke his hair before I remember exactly how awkward this actually is.</p><p>Murderer on my lap</p><p>Murderer on my lap</p><p>Murderer on my lap</p><p>I look to my right.</p><p>Warner\u2019s legs are resting on Adam\u2019s knees and he looks just as uncomfortable as I am.</p><p>\u201cHang tight, guys,\u201d Kenji says, still driving the tank toward Omega Point. \u201cI know this is about a million different kinds of weird, but I didn\u2019t exactly have enough time to think of a better plan.\u201d</p><p>He glances at the 2 3 of us but no one says a word until</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you guys are okay.\u201d I say it like those 9 syllables have been sitting inside of me for too long, like they\u2019ve been kicked out, evicted from my mouth, and only then do I realize exactly how worried I was that the 3 of us wouldn\u2019t make it back alive. \u201cI\u2019m so, so happy you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Deep, solemn, steady breathing all around.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Adam asks me. \u201cYour arm\u2014you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I flex my wrist and try not to wince. \u201cI\u2019m okay. These gloves and this metal thing actually helped, I think.\u201d I wiggle my fingers. Examine my gloves. \u201cNothing is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty badass,\u201d Kenji says to me. \u201cYou really saved us back there.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cKenji\u2014about what happened\u2014in the house\u2014I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, how about let\u2019s not talk about that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Adam asks, alert. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Kenji says quickly.</p><p>Adam ignores him. Looks at me. \u201cWhat happened? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014I j-just\u2014\u201d I struggle to speak. \u201cWhat happened\u2014with Warner\u2019s da\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kenji swears very loudly.</p><p>My mouth freezes midmovement.</p><p>My cheeks burn as I realize what I\u2019ve said. As I remember what Adam said just before we ran from that house. He\u2019s suddenly pale, pressing his lips together and looking away, out the tiny window of this tank.</p><p>\u201cListen ...\u201d Kenji clears his throat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about that, okay? In fact, I think I might rather not talk about that? Because that shit is just too weird for me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s even possible,\u201d Adam whispers. He\u2019s blinking, staring straight ahead now, blinking and blinking and blinking and \u201cI keep thinking I must be dreaming,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I\u2019m just hallucinating this whole thing. But then\u201d\u2014he drops his head in his hands, laughs a harsh laugh\u2014\u201cthat is one face I will never forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t you ever meet the supreme commander?\u201d I dare to ask. \u201cOr even see a picture of him ...? Isn\u2019t that something you\u2019d see in the army?\u201d</p><p>Adam shakes his head.</p><p>Kenji speaks. \u201cHis whole kick was always being, like, invisible. He got some sick thrill out of being this unseen power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear of the unknown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah. I heard he didn\u2019t want his pictures anywhere\u2014didn\u2019t make any public speeches, either\u2014because he thought if people could put a face on him, it would make him vulnerable. Human. And he always got his thrills from scaring the shit out of everyone. Being the ultimate power. The ultimate threat. Like\u2014how can you fight something if you can\u2019t even see it? Can\u2019t even find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it was such a big deal for him to be here,\u201d I realize out loud.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you thought your dad was dead,\u201d I say to Adam. \u201cI thought you said he was dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you guys know,\u201d Kenji interjects, \u201cI\u2019m still voting for the we don\u2019t have to talk about this option. You know. Just so you know. Just putting that out there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought he was,\u201d Adam says, still not looking at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what they told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d Kenji asks. Catches himself. Winces. \u201cShit. Fine. Fine. I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s all starting to come together now. All the things I didn\u2019t understand. How messed up my life was with James. After my mom died, my dad was never around unless he wanted to get drunk and beat the crap out of someone. I guess he was living a completely different life somewhere else. That\u2019s why he used to leave me and James alone all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cI mean, not the parts about your dad being a dick, but just, like, the whole scope of it. Because if you and Warner are brothers, and you\u2019re eighteen, and Warner is nineteen, and Anderson has always been married to Warner\u2019s mom\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy parents were never married,\u201d Adam says, eyes widening as he speaks the last word.</p><p>\u201cYou were the love child?\u201d Kenji says, disgusted. \u201cI mean\u2014you know, no offense to you\u2014it\u2019s just, I do not want to think about Anderson having some kind of passionate love affair. That is just sick.\u201d</p><p>Adam looks like he\u2019s been frozen solid. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cBut I mean, why even have a love affair?\u201d Kenji asks. \u201cI never understood that kind of crap. If you\u2019re not happy, just leave. Don\u2019t cheat. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure that shit out. I mean\u201d\u2014he hesitates\u2014\u201cI\u2019m assuming it was a love affair,\u201d Kenji says, still driving and unable to see the look on Adam\u2019s face. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t a love affair. Maybe it was just another dude-being-a-jackass kind of th\u2014\u201d He catches himself, cringes. \u201cShit. See, this is why I do not talk to people about their personal problems\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Adam says, barely breathing now. \u201cI have no idea why he never married her, but I know he loved my mom. He never gave a damn about the rest of us,\u201d he says. \u201cJust her. It was always about her. Everything was about her. The few times a month he was ever at home, I was always supposed to stay in my room. I was supposed to be very quiet. I had to knock on my own door and get permission before I could come out, even just to use the bathroom. And he used to get pissed whenever my mom would let me out. He didn\u2019t want to see me unless he had to. My mom had to sneak me my dinner just so he wouldn\u2019t go nuts about how she was feeding me too much and not saving anything for herself,\u201d he says. He shakes his head. \u201cAnd he was even worse when James was born.\u201d</p> <p>Adam blinks like he\u2019s going blind.</p><p>\u201cAnd then when she died,\u201d he says, taking a deep breath, \u201cwhen she died all he ever did was blame me for her death. He always told me it was my fault she got sick, and it was my fault she died. That I needed too much, that she didn\u2019t eat enough, that she got weak because she was too busy taking care of us, giving food to us, giving ... everything to us. To me and James.\u201d His eyebrows pull together. \u201cAnd I believed him for so long. I figured that was why he left all the time. I thought it was some kind of punishment. I thought I deserved it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m too horrified to speak.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he just ... I mean he was never around when I was growing up,\u201d Adam says, \u201cand he was always an asshole. But after she died he just ... lost his mind. He used to come by just to get piss-drunk. He used to force me to stand in front of him so he could throw his empty bottles at me. And if I flinched\u2014if I flinched\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swallows, hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all he ever did,\u201d Adam says, his voice quieter now. \u201cHe would come over. Get drunk. Beat the shit out of me. I was fourteen when he stopped coming back.\u201d Adam stares at his hands, palms up. \u201cHe sent some money every month for us to survive on and then\u2014\u201d A pause. \u201cTwo years later I got a letter from our brand-new government telling me my father was dead. I figured he probably got wasted again and did something stupid. Got hit by a car. Fell into the ocean. Whatever. It didn\u2019t matter. I was happy he was dead, but I had to drop out of school. I enlisted because the money was gone and I had to take care of James and I knew I wouldn\u2019t find another job.\u201d</p> <p>Adam shakes his head. \u201cHe left us with nothing, not a single penny, not even a piece of meat to live off of, and now I\u2019m sitting here, in this tank, running from a global war my own father has helped orchestrate\u201d\u2014he laughs a hard, hollow laugh\u2014\u201cand the one other worthless person on this planet is lying unconscious in my lap.\u201d Adam is actually laughing now, laughing hard, disbelieving, his hand caught in his hair, tugging at the roots, gripping his skull. \u201cAnd he\u2019s my brother. My own flesh and blood.</p><p>\u201cMy father had an entirely separate life I didn\u2019t know about and instead of being dead like he should be, he gave me a brother who almost tortured me to death in a slaughterhouse\u2014\u201d He runs an unsteady hand over the length of his face, suddenly cracking, suddenly slipping, suddenly losing control and his hands are shaking and he has to curl them into fists and he presses them against his forehead and says, \u201cHe has to die.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m not breathing, not even a little bit, not even at all, when he says,</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d he says, \u201cI have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-TWO</p><p>I\u2019m going to tell you a secret.</p><p>I don\u2019t regret what I did. I\u2019m not sorry at all.</p><p>In fact, if I had a chance to do it again I know this time I\u2019d do it right. I\u2019d shoot Anderson right through the heart.</p> <p>And I would enjoy it.</p><p>FORTY-THREE</p><p>I don\u2019t even know where to begin.</p><p>Adam\u2019s pain is like a handful of straw shoved down my throat. He has no parents but a father who beat him, abused him, abandoned him only to ruin the rest of the world and left him a brand-new brother who is exactly his opposite in every possible way.</p><p>Warner whose first name is no longer a mystery, Adam whose last name isn\u2019t actually Kent.</p><p>Kent is his middle name, Adam said to me. He said he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with his father and never told people his real last name. He has that much, at least, in common with his brother.</p><p>That, and the fact that both of them have some kind of immunity to my touch.</p><p>Adam and Aaron Anderson.</p><p>Brothers.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in my room, sitting in the dark, struggling to reconcile Adam with his new sibling who is really nothing more than a boy, a child who hates his father and as a result, a child who made a series of very unfortunate decisions in life. 2 brothers. 2 very different sets of choices.</p><p>2 very different lives.</p><p>Castle came to me this morning\u2014now that all the injured have been set up in the medical wing and the insanity has subsided\u2014he came to me and he said, \u201cMs. Ferrars, you were very brave yesterday. I wanted to extend my gratitude to you, and thank you for what you did\u2014for showing your support. I don\u2019t know that we would\u2019ve made it out of there without you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, struggled to swallow the compliment and assumed he was finished but then he said, \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m so impressed that I\u2019d like to offer you your first official assignment at Omega Point.\u201d</p><p>My first official assignment.</p><p>\u201cAre you interested?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I said yes yes yes of course I was interested, I was definitely interested, I was so very, very interested to finally have something to do\u2014something to accomplish\u2014and he smiled and he said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to hear it. Because I can\u2019t think of anyone better suited to this particular position than you.\u201d</p><p>I beamed.</p><p>The sun and the moon and the stars called and said, \u201cTurn down the beaming, please, because you\u2019re making it hard for us to see,\u201d and I didn\u2019t listen, I just kept on beaming. And then I asked Castle for the details of my official assignment. The one perfectly suited to me.</p><p>And he said</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to be in charge of maintaining and interrogating our new visitor.\u201d</p><p>And I stopped beaming.</p><p>I stared at Castle.</p><p>\u201cI will, of course, be overseeing the entire process,\u201d Castle continued, \u201cso feel free to come to me with questions and concerns. But we\u2019ll need to take advantage of his presence here, and that means trying to get him to speak.\u201d Castle was quiet a moment. \u201cHe ... seems to have an odd sort of attachment to you, Ms. Ferrars, and\u2014forgive me\u2014but I think it would behoove us to exploit it. I don\u2019t think we can afford the luxury of ignoring any possible advantages available to us. Anything he can tell us about his father\u2019s plans, or where our hostages might be, will be invaluable to our efforts. And we don\u2019t have much time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll need you to get started right away.\u201d</p><p>And I asked the world to open up, I said, world, please open up, because I\u2019d love to fall into a river of magma and die, just a little bit, but the world couldn\u2019t hear me because Castle was still talking and he said, \u201cPerhaps you can talk some sense into him? Tell him we\u2019re not interested in hurting him? Convince him to help us get our remaining hostages back?\u201d</p><p>I said, \u201cOh,\u201d I said surely, \u201che\u2019s in some kind of holding cell? Behind bars or something?\u201d</p><p>But Castle laughed, amused by my sudden, unexpected hilarity and said don\u2019t be silly, Ms. Ferrars, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that here. I never thought we\u2019d need to keep anyone captive at Omega Point. But yes, he\u2019s in his own room, and yes, the door is locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to go inside of his room?\u201d I asked. \u201cWith him? Alone?\u201d</p><p>Calm! Of course I was calm. I was definitely absolutely everything that is the opposite of calm.</p><p>But then Castle\u2019s forehead tightened, concerned. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d he asked me. \u201cI thought\u2014because he can\u2019t touch you\u2014I actually thought you might not feel as threatened by him as the others do. He\u2019s aware of your abilities, is he not? I imagine he would be wise to stay away from you for his own benefit.\u201d</p><p>And it was funny, because there it was: a vat of ice, all over my head, dripping leaking seeping into my bones, and actually no, it wasn\u2019t funny at all, because I had to say, \u201cYes. Right. Yes, of course. I almost forgot. Of course he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch me,\u201d you\u2019re quite right, Mr. Castle, sir, what on earth was I thinking.</p><p>Castle was relieved, so relieved, as if he\u2019d taken a dip in a warm pool he was sure would be frozen.</p><p>And now I\u2019m here, sitting in exactly the same position I was in 2 hours ago and I\u2019m beginning to wonder</p><p>how much longer</p><p>I can keep this secret to myself.</p><p>FORTY-FOUR</p><p>This is the door.</p><p>This one, right in front of me, this is where Warner is staying. There are no windows and there is no way to see inside of his room and I\u2019m starting to think that this situation is the exact antonym of excellent.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I am going to walk into his room, completely unarmed, because the guns are buried deep down in the armory and because I\u2019m lethal, so why would I need a gun? No one in their right mind would lay a hand on me, no one but Warner, of course, whose half-crazed attempt at stopping me from escaping out of my window resulted in this discovery, his discovery that he can touch me without harming himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I\u2019ve said a word of this to exactly no one.</p><p>I really thought that perhaps I\u2019d imagined it, just until Warner kissed me and told me he loved me and then, that\u2019s when I knew I could no longer pretend this wasn\u2019t happening. But it\u2019s only been about 4 weeks since that day, and I didn\u2019t know how to bring it up. I thought maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to bring it up. I really, quite desperately didn\u2019t want to bring it up.</p><p>And now, the thought of telling anyone, of making it known to Adam, of all people, that the one person he hates most in this world\u2014second only to his own father\u2014is the one other person who can touch me? That Warner has already touched me, that his hands have known the shape of my body and his lips have known the taste of my mouth\u2014never mind that it wasn\u2019t something I actually wanted\u2014I just can\u2019t do it.</p><p>Not now. Not after everything.</p> <p>So this situation is entirely my own fault. And I have to deal with it.</p><p>I steel myself and step forward.</p><p>There are 2 men I\u2019ve never met before standing guard outside Warner\u2019s door. This doesn\u2019t mean much, but it gives me a modicum of calm. I nod hello in the guards\u2019 direction and they greet me with such enthusiasm I actually wonder whether they\u2019ve confused me with someone else.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for coming,\u201d one of them says to me, his long, shaggy blond hair slipping into his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s been completely insane since he woke up\u2014throwing things around and trying to destroy the walls\u2014he\u2019s been threatening to kill all of us. He says you\u2019re the only one he wants to talk to, and he\u2019s only just calmed down because we told him you were on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to take out all the furniture,\u201d the other guard adds, his brown eyes wide, incredulous. \u201cHe was breaking everything. He wouldn\u2019t even eat the food we gave him.\u201d</p> <p>The antonym of excellent.</p><p>The antonym of excellent.</p><p>The antonym of excellent.</p><p>I manage a feeble smile and tell them I\u2019ll see what I can do to sedate him. They nod, eager to believe I\u2019m capable of something I know I\u2019m not and they unlock the door. \u201cJust knock to let us know when you\u2019re ready to leave,\u201d they tell me. \u201cCall for us and we\u2019ll open the door.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding yes and sure and of course and trying to ignore the fact that I\u2019m more nervous right now than I was meeting his father. To be alone in a room with Warner\u2014to be alone with him and to not know what he might do or what he\u2019s capable of and I\u2019m so confused, because I don\u2019t even know who he is anymore.</p><p>He\u2019s 100 different people.</p> <p>He\u2019s the person who forced me to torture a toddler against my will. He\u2019s the child so terrorized, so psychologically tormented that he\u2019d try to kill his own father in his sleep. He\u2019s the boy who shot a defecting soldier in the forehead; the boy who was trained to be a cold, heartless murderer by a man he thought he could trust. I see Warner as a child desperately seeking his dad\u2019s approval. I see him as the leader of an entire sector, eager to conquer me, to use me. I see him feeding a stray dog. I see him torturing Adam almost to death. And then I hear him telling me he loves me, feel him kissing me with such unexpected passion and desperation that I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m walking into.</p><p>I don\u2019t know who he\u2019ll be this time. Which side of himself he\u2019ll show me today.</p><p>But then I think this must be different. Because he\u2019s in my territory now, and I can always call for help if something goes wrong.</p><p>He\u2019s not going to hurt me.</p><p>I hope.</p><p>FORTY-FIVE</p><p>I step inside.</p><p>The door slams shut behind me but the Warner I find inside this room is not one I recognize at all. He\u2019s sitting on the floor, back against the wall, legs outstretched in front of him, feet crossed at the ankles. He\u2019s wearing nothing but socks, a simple white T-shirt, and a pair of black slacks. His coat, his shoes, and his fancy shirt are all discarded on the ground. His body is toned and muscular and hardly contained by his undershirt; his hair is a blond mess, disheveled for what\u2019s probably the first time in his life.</p> <p>But he\u2019s not looking at me. He doesn\u2019t even look up as I take a step closer. He doesn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>I\u2019ve forgotten how to breathe again.</p><p>Then</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea,\u201d he says, so quietly, \u201chow many times I\u2019ve read this?\u201d He lifts his hand but not his head and holds up a small, faded rectangle between 2 fingers.</p><p>And I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s possible to be punched in the gut by so many fists at the same time.</p><p>My notebook.</p><p>He\u2019s holding my notebook.</p><p>Of course he is.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d forgotten. He was the last person to touch my notebook; the last person to see it. He took it from me when he found that I\u2019d hidden it in the pocket of my dress back on base. This was just before I escaped, just before Adam and I jumped out the window and ran away. Just before Warner realized he could touch me.</p><p>And now, to know that he\u2019s read my most painful thoughts, my most anguished confessions\u2014the things I wrote while in complete and utter isolation, certain that I would die in that very cell, so certain no one would ever read the things I wrote down\u2014to know that he\u2019s read these desperate whispers of my private mind.</p><p>I feel absolutely, unbearably naked.</p><p>Petrified.</p><p>So vulnerable.</p><p>He flips the notebook open at random. Scans the page until he stops. He finally looks up, his eyes sharper, brighter, a more beautiful shade of green than they\u2019ve ever been and my heart is beating so fast I can\u2019t even feel it anymore.</p><p>And he begins to read.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014,\u201d I gasp, but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cI sit here every day,\u201d he says. \u201c175 days I\u2019ve sat here so far. Some days I stand up and stretch and feel these stiff bones, these creaky joints, this trampled spirit cramped inside my being. I roll my shoulders, I blink my eyes, I count the seconds creeping up the walls, the minutes shivering under my skin, the breaths I have to remember to take. Sometimes I allow my mouth to drop open, just a little bit; I touch my tongue to the backs of my teeth and the seam of my lips and I walk around this small space, I trail my fingers along the cracks in the concrete and wonder, I wonder what it would be like to speak out loud and be heard. I hold my breath, listen closely for anything, any sound of life and wonder at the beauty, the impossibility of possibly hearing another person breathing beside me.\u201d</p><p>He presses the back of his fist to his mouth for just a moment before continuing.</p><p>\u201cI stop. I stand still. I close my eyes and try to remember a world beyond these walls. I wonder what it would be like to know that I\u2019m not dreaming, that this isolated existence is not caged within my own mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do,\u201d he says, reciting the words from memory now, his head resting back against the wall, eyes pressed shut as he whispers, \u201cI do wonder, I think about it all the time. What it would be like to kill myself. Because I never really know, I still can\u2019t tell the difference, I\u2019m never quite certain whether or not I\u2019m actually alive. So I sit here. I sit here every single day.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rooted to the ground, frozen in my own skin, unable to move forward or backward for fear of waking up and realizing that this is actually happening. I feel like I might die of embarrassment, of this invasion of privacy, and I want to run and run and run and run and run</p><p>\u201cRun, I said to myself.\u201d Warner has picked up my notebook again.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I\u2019m begging him. \u201cPlease s-stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looks up, looks at me like he can really see me, see into me, like he wants me to see into him and then he drops his eyes, he clears his throat, he starts over, he reads from my journal.</p><p>\u201cRun, I said to myself. Run until your lungs collapse, until the wind whips and snaps at your tattered clothes, until you\u2019re a blur that blends into the background.</p><p>\u201cRun, Juliette, run faster, run until your bones break and your shins split and your muscles atrophy and your heart dies because it was always too big for your chest and it beat too fast for too long and run.</p><p>\u201cRun run run until you can\u2019t hear their feet behind you. Run until they drop their fists and their shouts dissolve in the air. Run with your eyes open and your mouth shut and dam the river rushing up behind your eyes. Run, Juliette.</p><p>\u201cRun until you drop dead.</p><p>\u201cMake sure your heart stops before they ever reach you. Before they ever touch you.</p><p>\u201cRun, I said.\u201d</p><p>I have to clench my fists until I feel pain, anything to push these memories away. I don\u2019t want to remember. I don\u2019t want to think about these things anymore. I don\u2019t want to think about what else I wrote on those pages, what else Warner knows about me now, what he must think of me. I can only imagine how pathetic and lonely and desperate I must appear to him. I don\u2019t know why I care.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he says, closing the cover of the journal only to lay his hand on top of it. Protecting it. Staring at it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep for days after I read that entry. I kept wanting to know which people were chasing you down the street, who it was you were running from. I wanted to find them,\u201d he says, so softly, \u201cand I wanted to rip their limbs off, one by one. I wanted to murder them in ways that would horrify you to hear.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking now, whispering, \u201cPlease, please give that back to me.\u201d</p><p>He touches the tips of his fingers to his lips. Tilts his head back, just a little. Smiles a strange, unhappy smile. Says, \u201cYou must know how sorry I am. That I\u201d\u2014he swallows\u2014\u201cthat I kissed you like that. I confess I had no idea you would shoot me for it.\u201d</p><p>And I realize something. \u201cYour arm,\u201d I breathe, astonished. He wears no sling. He moves with no difficulty. There\u2019s no bruising or swelling or scars I can see.</p><p>His smile is brittle. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was healed when I woke up to find myself in this room.\u201d</p><p>Sonya and Sara. They helped him. I wonder why anyone here would do him such a kindness. I force myself to take a step back. \u201cPlease,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMy notebook, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d he says, \u201cI never would\u2019ve kissed you if I didn\u2019t think you wanted me to.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m so shocked that for a moment I forget all about my notebook. I meet his heavy gaze. Manage to steady my voice. \u201cI told you I hated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. He nods. \u201cWell. You\u2019d be surprised how many people say that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I would.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitch. \u201cYou tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat amuses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d he says, his grin growing. \u201cI find it fascinating.\u201d A pause. \u201cWould you like to know why?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause all you ever said to me,\u201d he explains, \u201cwas that you didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone. You didn\u2019t want to murder people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m all out of letters. Fresh out of words. Someone has robbed me of my entire vocabulary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat decision was so easy for you to make,\u201d he says. \u201cSo simple. You had a gun. You wanted to run away. You pulled the trigger. That was it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right.</p><p>I keep telling myself I have no interest in killing people but somehow I find a way to justify it, to rationalize it when I want to.</p><p>Warner. Castle. Anderson.</p> <p>I wanted to kill every single one of them. And I would have.</p><p>What is happening to me.</p><p>I\u2019ve made a huge mistake coming here. Accepting this assignment. Because I can\u2019t be alone with Warner. Not like this. Being alone with him is making my insides hurt in ways I don\u2019t want to understand.</p><p>I have to leave.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he whispers, eyes on my notebook again. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says. \u201cSit with me. Stay with me. I just want to see you. You don\u2019t even have to say anything.\u201d</p> <p>Some crazed, confused part of my brain actually wants to sit down next to him, actually wants to hear what he has to say before I remember Adam and what he would think if he knew, what he would say if he were here and could see I was interested in spending my time with the same person who shot him in the leg, broke his ribs, and hung him on a conveyor belt in an abandoned slaughterhouse, leaving him to bleed to death one minute at a time.</p><p>I must be insane.</p><p>Still, I don\u2019t move.</p><p>Warner relaxes against the wall. \u201cWould you like me to read to you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head over and over and over again, whispering, \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d</p><p>And he looks like he\u2019s about to respond before he changes his mind. Looks away. Lifts his eyes to the ceiling and smiles, just a tiny bit. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI could tell, the very first day I met you. There was something about you that felt different to me. Something in your eyes that was so tender. Raw. Like you hadn\u2019t yet learned how to hide your heart from the world.\u201d He\u2019s nodding now, nodding to himself about something and I can\u2019t imagine what it is. \u201cFinding this,\u201d he says, his voice soft as he pats the cover of my notebook, \u201cwas so\u201d\u2014his eyebrows pull together\u2014\u201cit was so extraordinarily painful.\u201d He finally looks at me and he looks like a completely different person. Like he\u2019s trying to solve a tremendously difficult equation. \u201cIt was like meeting a friend for the very first time.\u201d</p> <p>Why are my hands trembling.</p><p>He takes a deep breath. Looks down. Whispers, \u201cI am so tired, love. I\u2019m so very, very tired.\u201d</p><p>Why won\u2019t my heart stop racing.</p><p>\u201cHow much time,\u201d he says after a moment, \u201cdo I have before they kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill you?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me.</p><p>I\u2019m startled into speaking. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to kill you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWe have no intention of hurting you. We just want to use you to get back our men. We\u2019re holding you hostage.\u201d</p><p>Warner\u2019s eyes go wide, his shoulders stiffen. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have no reason to kill you,\u201d I explain. \u201cWe only need to barter with your life\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warner laughs a loud, full-bodied laugh. Shakes his head. Smiles at me in that way I\u2019ve only ever seen once before, looking at me like I\u2019m the sweetest thing he\u2019s ever decided to eat.</p><p>Those dimples.</p><p>\u201cDear, sweet, beautiful girl,\u201d he says. \u201cYour team here has greatly overestimated my father\u2019s affection for me. I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this, but keeping me here is not going to give you the advantage you were hoping for. I doubt my father has even noticed I\u2019m gone. So I would like to request that you please either kill me, or let me go. But I beg you not to waste my time by confining me here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m checking my pockets for spare words and sentences but I\u2019m finding none, not an adverb, not a preposition or even a dangling participle because there doesn\u2019t exist a single response to such an outlandish request.</p><p>Warner is still smiling at me, shoulders shaking in silent amusement.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not even a viable argument,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNo one likes to be held hostage\u2014\u201d</p><p>He takes a tight breath. Runs a hand through his hair. Shrugs. \u201cYour men are wasting their time,\u201d he says. \u201cKidnapping me will never work to your advantage. This much,\u201d he says, \u201cI can guarantee.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-SIX</p><p>Time for lunch.</p><p>Kenji and I are sitting on one side of the table, Adam and James on the other.</p><p>We\u2019ve been sitting here for half an hour now, deliberating over my conversation with Warner. I conveniently left out the parts about my journal, though I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should\u2019ve mentioned it. I\u2019m also starting to wonder if I should just come clean about Warner being able to touch me. But every time I look at Adam I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I don\u2019t even know why Warner can touch me. Maybe Warner is the fluke I thought Adam was. Maybe all of this is some kind of cosmic joke told at my expense.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do yet.</p><p>But somehow the extra details of my conversation with Warner seem too personal, too embarrassing to share. I don\u2019t want anyone to know, for example, that Warner told me he loves me. I don\u2019t want anyone to know that he has my journal, or that he\u2019s read it. Adam is the only other person who even knows it exists, and he, at least, was kind enough to respect my privacy. He\u2019s the one who saved my journal from the asylum, the one who brought it back to me in the first place. But he said he never read the things I wrote. He said he knew they must\u2019ve been very private thoughts and that he didn\u2019t want to intrude.</p><p>Warner, on the other hand, has ransacked my mind.</p><p>I feel so much more apprehensive around him now. Just thinking about being near him makes me feel anxious, nervous, so vulnerable. I hate that he knows my secrets. My secret thoughts.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be him who knows anything about me at all.</p><p>It should be him. The one sitting right across from me. The one with the dark-blue eyes and the dark-brown hair and the hands that have touched my heart, my body.</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t seem okay right now.</p><p>Adam\u2019s head is down, his eyebrows drawn, his hands clenched together on the table. He hasn\u2019t touched his food and he hasn\u2019t said a word since I summarized my meeting with Warner. Kenji has been just as quiet. Everyone\u2019s been a bit more solemn since our recent battle; we lost several people from Omega Point.</p><p>I take a deep breath and try again.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d I ask them. \u201cAbout what he said about Anderson?\u201d I\u2019m careful not to use the word dad or father anymore, especially around James. I don\u2019t know what, if anything, Adam has said to James about the issue, and it\u2019s not my business to pry. Worse still, Adam hasn\u2019t said a word about it since we got back, and it\u2019s already been 2 days. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s right that Anderson won\u2019t care if he\u2019s been taken hostage?\u201d</p><p>James squirms around in his seat, eyes narrowed as he chews the food in his mouth, looking at the group of us like he\u2019s waiting to memorize everything we say.</p><p>Adam rubs his forehead. \u201cThat,\u201d he finally says, \u201cmight actually have some merit.\u201d</p><p>Kenji frowns, folds his arms, leans forward. \u201cYeah. It is kind of weird. We haven\u2019t heard a single thing from their side, and it\u2019s been over forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Castle think?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Kenji shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s stressed out. Ian and Emory were really messed up when we found them. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re conscious yet, even though Sonya and Sara have been working around the clock to help them. I think he\u2019s worried we won\u2019t get Winston and Brendan back at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Adam says, \u201ctheir silence has to do with the fact that you shot Anderson in both his legs. Maybe he\u2019s just recovering.\u201d</p><p>I almost choke on the water I was attempting to drink. I chance a look at Kenji to see if he\u2019s going to correct Adam\u2019s assumption, but he doesn\u2019t even flinch. So I say nothing.</p><p>Kenji is nodding. Says, \u201cRight. Yeah. I almost forgot about that.\u201d A pause. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shot him in the legs?\u201d James asks, eyes wide in Kenji\u2019s direction.</p><p>Kenji clears his throat but is careful not to look at me. I wonder why he\u2019s protecting me from this. Why he thinks it\u2019s better not to tell the truth about what really happened. \u201cYup,\u201d he says, and takes a bite of his food.</p><p>Adam exhales. Pushes up his shirtsleeves, studies the series of concentric circles inked onto his forearms, military mementos of a past life.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d James asks Kenji.</p><p>\u201cWhy what, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill him? Why just shoot him in the legs? Didn\u2019t you say he\u2019s the worst? The reason why we have all the problems we have now?\u201d</p><p>Kenji is quiet for a moment. He\u2019s gripping his spoon, poking at his food. Finally he puts the spoon down. Motions for James to join him on our side of the table. I slide down to make room. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says to James, pulling him tight against the right side of his body. James wraps his arms around Kenji\u2019s waist and Kenji drops his hand on James\u2019 head, mussing his hair.</p><p>I had no idea they were so close.</p><p>I keep forgetting that the 3 of them are roommates.</p><p>\u201cSo, okay. You ready for a little lesson?\u201d he says to James.</p><p>James nods.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this: Castle always teaches us that we can\u2019t just cut off the head, you know?\u201d He hesitates; collects his thoughts. \u201cLike, if we just kill the enemy leader, then what? What would happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorld peace,\u201d James says.</p><p>\u201cWrong. It would be mass chaos.\u201d Kenji shakes his head. Rubs the tip of his nose. \u201cAnd chaos is a hell of a lot harder to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cWell that\u2019s the thing. We can only take out the leader of the opposition when we\u2019re ready to take over\u2014only when there\u2019s a new leader ready to take the place of the old one. People need someone to rally around, right? And we\u2019re not ready yet.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThis was supposed to be a fight against Warner\u2014taking him out wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. But to take out Anderson would be asking for absolute anarchy, all over the country. And anarchy means there\u2019s a chance someone else\u2014someone even worse, possibly\u2014could take control before we do.\u201d</p><p>James says something in response but I don\u2019t hear it.</p><p>Adam is staring at me.</p><p>He\u2019s staring at me and he\u2019s not pretending not to. He\u2019s not looking away. He\u2019s not saying a word. His gaze moves from my eyes to my mouth, focusing on my lips for a moment too long. Finally he turns away, just for a brief second before his eyes are fixed on mine again. Deeper. Hungrier.</p><p>My heart is starting to hurt.</p><p>I watch the hard movement in his throat. The rise and fall of his chest. The tense line of his jaw and the way he\u2019s sitting so perfectly still. He doesn\u2019t say anything, anything at all.</p><p>I want so desperately to touch him.</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d Kenji is chuckling, shaking his head as he reacts to something James just said. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant. Anyway,\u201d he sighs, \u201cwe\u2019re not ready to deal with that kind of insanity just yet. We take out Anderson when we\u2019re ready to take over. That\u2019s the only way to do this right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam stands up abruptly. He pushes away his untouched bowl of food and clears his throat. Looks at Kenji. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t kill him when he was right in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Kenji scratches the back of his head, uncomfortable. \u201cListen man, if I had any idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Adam cuts him off. \u201cYou did me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kenji asks. \u201cHey man\u2014where\u2019re you going\u2014\u201d</p> <p>But Adam is already walking away.</p><p>FORTY-SEVEN</p><p>I go after him.</p><p>I\u2019m following Adam down an empty corridor as he exits the dining hall even though I know I shouldn\u2019t. I know I shouldn\u2019t be talking to him like this, shouldn\u2019t be encouraging the feelings I have for him but I\u2019m worried. I can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s disappearing into himself, withdrawing into a world I can\u2019t penetrate and I can\u2019t even blame him for it. I can only imagine what he must be experiencing right now. These recent revelations would be enough to drive a weaker person absolutely insane. And even though we\u2019ve managed to work together lately, it\u2019s always been during such high-stress situations that there\u2019s hardly been any time for us to dwell on our personal issues.</p><p>And I need to know that he\u2019s all right.</p> <p>I can\u2019t just stop caring about him.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>He stops at the sound of my voice. His spine goes rigid with surprise. He turns around and I see his expression shift from hope to confusion to worry in a matter of seconds. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he\u2019s in front of me, all 6 feet of him, and I\u2019m drowning in memories and feelings I\u2019ve made no effort to forget. I\u2019m trying to remember why I wanted to talk to him. Why I ever told him we couldn\u2019t be together. Why I would ever keep myself from a chance at even 5 seconds in his arms and he\u2019s saying my name, saying, \u201cJuliette\u2014what\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>I want so desperately to say yes, yes, horrible things have happened, and I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m so sick and tired and I really just want to collapse in your arms and forget the rest of the world. Instead I manage to look up, manage to meet his eyes. They\u2019re such a dark, haunting shade of blue. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>And his eyes are immediately different, uncomfortable, closed off. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about me.\u201d He blows out a hard breath. Runs a hand through his hair.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he says. \u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s pounding a closed fist against his lips. Looking up. Looking like he\u2019s not sure what to say and then he speaks, his voice strained and hurt and confused and he says, \u201cYou broke up with me. You gave up on us\u2014on our entire future together. You basically reached in and ripped my heart out and now you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m okay? How the hell am I supposed to be okay, Juliette? What kind of a question is that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m swaying in place.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d I swallow, hard. \u201cI-I was t-talking about your\u2014your dad\u2014I thought maybe\u2014oh, God, I\u2019m sorry\u2014you\u2019re right, I\u2019m so stupid\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have come, I sh-shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliette,\u201d he says, so desperately, catching me around the waist as I back away. His eyes are shut tight. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says, \u201ctell me what I\u2019m supposed to do. How am I supposed to feel? It\u2019s one shitty thing right after another and I\u2019m trying to be okay\u2014God, I\u2019m trying so hard but it\u2019s really freaking difficult and I miss\u201d\u2014his voice catches\u2014\u201cI miss you,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss you so much it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>My fingers are clenched in his shirt.</p> <p>My heart is hammering in the silence.</p><p>I see the difficulty he has in meeting my eyes when he whispers, \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m straining every muscle in my body just to keep myself from reaching forward to touch him. \u201cAdam\u2014of course I still love you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, his voice rough with emotion, \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like this before. I can barely remember my mom, and other than that it was just me and James and my piece-of-shit dad. And James has always loved me in his own way, but you\u2014with you\u2014\u201d He falters. Looks down. \u201cHow am I supposed to go back?\u201d he asks, so quietly. \u201cHow am I supposed to forget what it was like to be with you? To be loved by you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m crying until it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cYou say you love me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know I love you.\u201d He looks up, meets my eyes. \u201cSo why the hell can\u2019t we be together?\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t know how to say anything but \u201cI\u2019m s-sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, you have no idea how sorry I am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just try?\u201d He\u2019s gripping my shoulders now, his words urgent, anguished; our faces too dangerously close. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take whatever I can get, I swear, I just want to know I have you in my life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt won\u2019t be enough, Adam, and you know it. One day we\u2019ll take a stupid risk or take a chance we shouldn\u2019t. One day we\u2019ll think it\u2019ll be okay and it won\u2019t. And it won\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut look at us now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can make this work\u2014I can be close to you without kissing you\u2014I just need to spend a few more months training\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour training might never be enough.\u201d I cut him off, knowing I need to tell him everything now. Knowing he has a right to know the same things I do. \u201cBecause the more I train, the more I learn exactly how dangerous I am. And you c-can\u2019t be near me. It\u2019s not just my skin anymore. I could hurt you just by holding your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He blinks several times. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. Press my palm flat against the side of the tunnel before digging my fingers in and dragging them right through the stone. I punch my fist into the wall and grab a handful of rough rock, crush it in my hand, allow it to sift as sand through my fingers to the floor.</p><p>Adam is staring at me. Astonished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who shot your father,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Kenji was covering for me. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t tell you the truth. But I was so blinded by this\u2014this all-consuming rage\u2014I just wanted to kill him. And I was torturing him,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI shot him in his legs because I was taking my time. Because I wanted to enjoy that last moment. That last bullet I was about to put through his heart. And I was so close. I was so close, and Kenji,\u201d I tell him, \u201cKenji had to pull me away. Because he saw that I\u2019d gone insane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of control.\u201d My voice is a rasp, a broken plea. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me or what\u2019s happening to me and I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m capable of yet. I don\u2019t know how much worse this is going to get. Every day I learn something new about myself and every day it terrifies me. I\u2019ve done terrible things to people,\u201d I whisper. I swallow back the sob building in my throat. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not okay,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m not okay, Adam. I\u2019m not okay and I\u2019m not safe for you to be around.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring at me, so stunned he\u2019s forgotten how to speak.</p><p>\u201cNow you know that the rumors are true,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI am crazy. And I am a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he breathes. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, desperate now. \u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2014you\u2019re stronger than this\u2014I know you are\u2014I know you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve known your heart for ten years,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019ve seen what you had to live through, what you had to go through, and I\u2019m not giving up on you now, not because of this, not because of something like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? How can you still believe that, after everything\u2014after all of this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says to me, his hands gripping me tighter now, \u201care one of the bravest, strongest people I\u2019ve ever met. You have the best heart, the best intentions\u2014\u201d He stops. Takes a tight, shaky breath. \u201cYou\u2019re the best person I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he says to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through the worst possible experiences and you survived with your humanity still intact. How the hell,\u201d he says, his voice breaking now, \u201cam I supposed to let go of you? How can I walk away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI refuse to believe that this is the end of us. Not if you still love me. Because you\u2019re going to get through this,\u201d he says, \u201cand I will be waiting for you when you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m not going anywhere. There won\u2019t be another person for me. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever wanted and that\u2019s never,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s never going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow touching.\u201d</p><p>Adam and I freeze. Turn around slowly to face the unwelcome voice.</p><p>He\u2019s right there.</p><p>Warner is standing right in front of us, his hands tied behind his back, his eyes blazing bright with anger and hurt and disgust. Castle comes up behind him to lead him in whatever whichever wherever direction and he sees where Warner is stuck, still, staring at us, and Adam is like one block of marble, not moving, not making any effort to breathe or speak or look away. I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019m burning so bright I\u2019ve burnt to a crisp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lovely when you\u2019re blushing,\u201d Warner says to me. \u201cBut I really wish you wouldn\u2019t waste your affections on someone who has to beg for your love.\u201d He cocks his head at Adam. \u201cHow sad for you,\u201d he says. \u201cThis must be terribly embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sick bastard,\u201d Adam says to him, his voice like steel.</p><p>\u201cAt least I still have my dignity.\u201d</p><p>Castle shakes his head, exasperated. Pushes Warner forward. \u201cPlease get back to work\u2014both of you,\u201d he shouts at us as he and Warner make their way past. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting valuable time standing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go to hell,\u201d Adam shouts at Warner.</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m going to hell,\u201d Warner says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll ever deserve her.\u201d</p><p>And Adam doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He just watches, eyes focused, as Warner and Castle disappear around the corner.</p><p>FORTY-EIGHT</p><p>James joins us during our training session before dinner.</p><p>He\u2019s been hanging out with us a lot since we got back, and we all seem happier when he\u2019s around. There\u2019s something about his presence that\u2019s so disarming, so welcome. It\u2019s so good to have him back.</p><p>I\u2019ve been showing him how easily I can break things now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bricks are nothing. It feels like crushing a piece of cake. The metal pipes bend in my hands like plastic straws. Wood is a little tricky because if I break it the wrong way I can catch a splinter, but just about nothing is difficult anymore. Kenji has been thinking of new ways to test my abilities; lately he\u2019s been trying to see if I can project\u2014if I can focus my power from a distance.</p><p>Not all abilities are designed for projection, apparently. Lily, for example, has that incredible photographic memory. But she\u2019d never be able to project that ability onto anyone else.</p><p>Projection is, by far, the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever attempted to do. It\u2019s extremely complicated and requires both mental and physical exertion. I have to be wholly in control of my mind, and I have to know exactly how my brain communicates with whichever invisible bone in my body is responsible for my gift. Which means I have to know how to locate the source of my ability\u2014and how to focus it into one concentrated point of power I can tap into from anywhere.</p><p>It\u2019s hurting my brain.</p> <p>\u201cCan I try to break something, too?\u201d James is asking. He grabs one of the bricks off the stack and weighs it in his hands. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m super strong like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever felt super strong?\u201d Kenji asks him. \u201cLike, you know, abnormally strong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d James says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never tried to break anything, either.\u201d He blinks at Kenji. \u201cDo you think maybe I could be like you guys? That maybe I have some kind of power, too?\u201d</p><p>Kenji studies him. Seems to be sorting some things out in his head. Says, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely possible. Your brother\u2019s obviously got something in his DNA, which means you might, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d James is practically jumping up and down.</p> <p>Kenji chuckles. \u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m just saying it might be possi\u2014no,\u201d he shouts, \u201cJames\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d James is wincing, dropping the brick to the floor and clenching his fist against the gash bleeding in the palm of his hand. \u201cI think I pressed too hard and it slipped,\u201d he says, struggling not to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Kenji is shaking his head, breathing fast. \u201cDamn, kid, you can\u2019t just go around slicing your hand open like that. You\u2019re going to give me a freaking heart attack. Come here,\u201d he says, more gently now. \u201cLet me take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d James says, cheeks flushed, hiding his hand behind his back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019ll go away soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of cut is not just going to go away,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cNow let me take a look at it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I interrupt him, caught by the intense look on James\u2019 face, the way he seems to be so focused on the clenched fist he\u2019s hiding. \u201cJames\u2014what do you mean it\u2019ll \u2018go away\u2019? Do you mean it\u2019s going to get better? On its own?\u201d</p> <p>James blinks at me. \u201cWell yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cIt always gets better really quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does? What gets better really quickly?\u201d Kenji is staring too now, already catching on to my theory and throwing looks at me, mouthing Holy shit over and over again.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get hurt,\u201d James says, looking at us like we\u2019ve lost our minds. \u201cLike if you cut yourself,\u201d he says to Kenji, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it just get better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on the size of the cut,\u201d Kenji tells him. \u201cBut for a gash like the one on your hand?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019d need to clean it to make sure it didn\u2019t get infected. Then I\u2019d have to wrap it up in gauze and some kind of ointment to keep it from scarring. And then,\u201d he says, \u201cit would take at least a couple days for it to scab up. And then it would begin to heal.\u201d</p><p>James is blinking like he\u2019s never heard of something so absurd in his life.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your hand,\u201d Kenji says to him.</p><p>James hesitates.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I tell him. \u201cReally. We\u2019re just curious.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, so slowly, James shows us his clenched fist. Even more slowly, he uncurls his fingers, watching our reactions the whole time. And exactly where just a moment ago there was a huge gash, now there\u2019s nothing but perfect pink skin and a little pool of blood.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit on a cracker,\u201d Kenji breathes. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says to me, jumping forward to grab James\u2019 arm, barely able to rein in his smiles, \u201cbut I need to get this guy over to the medical wing. That okay? We can pick up again tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not hurt anymore,\u201d James protests. \u201cI\u2019m okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, kid, but you\u2019re going to want to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you like,\u201d he says, leading James out the door, \u201cto start spending some time with two very pretty girls....\u201d</p><p>And they\u2019re gone.</p><p>And I\u2019m laughing.</p><p>Sitting in the middle of the training room all by myself when I hear 2 familiar knocks at my door.</p><p>I already know who it\u2019s going to be.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars.\u201d</p><p>I whip around, not because I\u2019m surprised to hear Castle\u2019s voice, but because I\u2019m surprised at the intonation. His eyes are narrowed, his lips tight, his eyes sharp and flashing in this light.</p><p>He is very, very angry.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the hallway,\u201d I tell him, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can discuss your public and wildly inappropriate displays of affection at a later time, Ms. Ferrars, but right now I have a very important question to ask you and I would advise you to be honest, as acutely honest as is physically possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u201d\u2014I can hardly breathe\u2014\u201cwhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Castle narrows his eyes at me. \u201cI have just had a conversation with Warner, who says he is able to touch you without consequence, and that this information is something you are well aware of.\u201d</p><p>And I think, Wow, I did it. I actually managed to die of a stroke at age 17.</p><p>\u201cI need to know,\u201d Castle hurries on, \u201cwhether or not this information is true and I need to know right now.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s glue all over my tongue, stuck to my teeth, my lips, the roof of my mouth, and I can\u2019t speak, I can\u2019t move, I\u2019m pretty sure I just had a seizure or an aneurysm or heart failure or something equally as awful but I can\u2019t explain any of this to Castle because I can\u2019t move my jaw even an inch.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferrars. I don\u2019t think you understand how important this question is. I need an answer from you, and I need it thirty seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, I need an answer today, right now, this very moment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I choke out, blushing through my skull, horribly ashamed, embarrassed, horrified in every possible way and the only thing I can think of is Adam Adam Adam how will Adam respond to this information now, why does this have to happen now, why did Warner say anything at all and I want to kill him for sharing the secret that was mine to tell, mine to hide, mine to hoard.</p><p>Castle looks like he\u2019s a balloon that fell in love with a pushpin that got too close and ruined him forever. \u201cSo it\u2019s true, then?\u201d</p><p>I drop my eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He falls to the floor right across from me, astonished. \u201cHow is it even possible, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Because Warner is Adam\u2019s brother, I don\u2019t tell him.</p><p>And I don\u2019t tell him because it is Adam\u2019s secret to tell and I will not talk about it until he does, even though I desperately want to tell Castle that the connection must be in their blood, that they both must share a similar kind of gift or Energy, or oh oh oh</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Warner is one of us.</p><p>FORTY-NINE</p><p>\u201cIt changes everything.\u201d</p><p>Castle isn\u2019t even looking at me. \u201cThis\u2014I mean\u2014this means so many things,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to tell him everything and we\u2019ll have to test him to be sure, but I\u2019m fairly positive it\u2019s the only explanation. And he would be welcome to take refuge here if he wanted it\u2014I would have to give him a regular room, allow him to live among us as an equal. I cannot keep him here as a prisoner, at the very least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014but, Castle\u2014why? He\u2019s the one who almost killed Adam! And Kenji!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand\u2014this news might change his entire outlook on life.\u201d Castle is shaking his head, one hand almost covering his mouth, his eyes wide. \u201cHe might not take it well\u2014he might be thrilled\u2014he might lose his mind completely\u2014he might wake up a new man in the morning. You would be surprised what these kinds of revelations will do to people.</p><p>\u201cOmega Point will always be a place of refuge for our kind,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s an oath I made to myself many years ago. I cannot deny him food and shelter if, for example, his father were to cast him out entirely.\u201d</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Castle says suddenly, looking up at me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything? Why not report this information? This is important for us to know and it doesn\u2019t condemn you in any way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want Adam to know,\u201d I admit out loud for the first time, my voice 6 broken bits of shame strung together. \u201cI just ...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to know.\u201d</p><p>Castle actually looks sad for me. He says, \u201cI wish I could help you keep your secret, Ms. Ferrars, but even if I wanted to, I\u2019m not sure Warner will.\u201d</p><p>I focus on the mats laid out on the floor. My voice sounds tiny when I ask, \u201cWhy did he even tell you? How did that even come up in conversation?\u201d</p><p>Castle rubs his chin, thoughtful. \u201cHe told me of his own accord. I volunteered to take him on his daily rounds\u2014walking him to the restroom, et cetera\u2014because I wanted to follow up and ask him questions about his father and see what he knew about the state of our hostages. He seemed perfectly fine. In fact, he looked much better than he was when he first showed up. He was compliant, almost polite. But his attitude changed rather dramatically after we stumbled upon you and Adam in the hall....\u201d His voice trails off, his eyes snap up, his mind working quickly to fit all the pieces together and he\u2019s gaping at me, staring at me in a way that is entirely foreign to Castle, in a way that says he is utterly, absolutely baffled.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I should be offended.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with you,\u201d Castle whispers, a dawning, groundbreaking realization in his voice. He laughs, once, hard, fast. Shakes his head. \u201cHe held you captive and managed to fall in love with you in the process.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the mats like they\u2019re the most fascinating things I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ms. Ferrars,\u201d Castle says to me. \u201cI do not envy you your predicament. I can see now why this situation must be uncomfortable for you.\u201d</p><p>I want to say to him, You have no idea, Castle. You have no idea because you don\u2019t even know the entire story. You don\u2019t know that they\u2019re brothers, brothers who hate each other, brothers who only seem to agree on one thing, and that one thing happens to be killing their own father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I don\u2019t say any of those things.

I\u2019m wondering how many more mistakes I\u2019ll have to make before things finally fall into place.</p><p>If they ever will.</p><p>FIFTY</p> <p>I\u2019m so humiliated.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about this all night and I came to a realization this morning. Warner must\u2019ve told Castle on purpose. Because he\u2019s playing games with me, because he hasn\u2019t changed, because he\u2019s still trying to get me to do his bidding. He\u2019s still trying to get me to be his project and he\u2019s trying to hurt me.</p><p>I won\u2019t allow it.</p><p>I will not allow Warner to lie to me, to manipulate my emotions to get what he wants. I can\u2019t believe I felt pity for him\u2014that I felt weakness, tenderness for him when I saw him with his father\u2014that I believed him when he told me his thoughts about my journal. I\u2019m such a gullible fool.</p><p>I was an idiot to ever think he might be capable of human emotion.</p> <p>I told Castle that maybe he should put someone else on this assignment now that he knows Warner can touch me; I told him it might be dangerous now. But he laughed and he laughed and he laughed and he said, \u201cOh, Ms. Ferrars, I\u2019m quite, quite certain you will be able to defend yourself. In fact, you\u2019re probably much better equipped against him than any of us. Besides,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is an ideal situation. If he truly is in love with you, you must be able to use that to our advantage somehow. We need your help,\u201d he said to me, serious again. \u201cWe need all the help we can find, and right now you\u2019re the one person who might be able to get the answers we need. Please,\u201d he said. \u201cTry to find out anything you can. Anything at all. Winston and Brendan\u2019s lives are at risk.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s right.</p><p>So I\u2019m shoving my own concerns aside because Winston and Brendan are out there, hurting somewhere, and we need to find them. And I\u2019m going to do whatever I can to help.</p><p>Which means I have to talk to Warner again.</p><p>I have to treat him just like the prisoner that he is. No more side conversations. No falling for his efforts to confuse me. Not again and again and again. I\u2019m going to be better. Smarter.</p><p>And I want my notebook back.</p> <p>The guards are unlocking his room for me and I\u2019m marching in, I\u2019m sealing the door shut behind me and I\u2019m getting ready to give him the speech I\u2019ve already prepared when I stop in place.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I was expecting.</p><p>Maybe I thought I\u2019d catch him trying to break a hole in the wall or maybe he\u2019d be plotting the demise of every person at Omega Point or I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know anything because I only know how to fight an angry body, an insolent creature, an arrogant monster, and I do not know what to do with this.</p><p>He\u2019s sleeping.</p><p>Someone put a mattress in here, a simple rectangle of average quality, thin and worn but better than the ground, at least, and he\u2019s lying on top of it in nothing but a pair of black boxer briefs.</p><p>His clothes are on the floor.</p><p>His pants, his shirts, his socks are slightly damp, wrinkled, obviously hand-washed and laid out to dry; his coat is folded neatly over his boots, and his gloves are resting right next to each other on top of his coat.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t moved an inch since I stepped into this room.</p> <p>He\u2019s resting on his side, his back to the wall, his left arm tucked under his face, his right arm against his torso, his entire body perfect bare, strong, smooth, and smelling faintly of soap. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t stop staring at him. I don\u2019t know what it is about sleep that makes our faces appear so soft and innocent, so peaceful and vulnerable, but I\u2019m trying to look away and I can\u2019t. I\u2019m losing sight of my own purpose, forgetting all the brave things I said to myself before I stepped in here. Because there\u2019s something about him\u2014there\u2019s always been something about him that\u2019s intrigued me and I don\u2019t understand it. I wish I could ignore it but I can\u2019t.</p><p>Because I look at him and wonder if maybe it\u2019s just me? Maybe I\u2019m naive?</p><p>But I see layers, shades of gold and green and a person who\u2019s never been given a chance to be human and I wonder if I\u2019m just as cruel as my own oppressors if I decide that society is right, that some people are too far gone, that sometimes you can\u2019t turn back, that there are people in this world who don\u2019t deserve a second chance and I can\u2019t I can\u2019t I can\u2019t</p><p>I can\u2019t help but disagree.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but think that 19 is too young to give up on someone, that 19 years old is just the beginning, that it\u2019s too soon to tell anyone they will never amount to anything but evil in this world.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but wonder what my life would\u2019ve been like if someone had taken a chance on me.</p><p>So I back away. I turn to leave.</p><p>I let him sleep.</p><p>I stop in place.</p><p>I catch a glimpse of my notebook lying on the mattress next to his outstretched hand, his fingers looking as if they\u2019ve only just let go. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to steal it back if I can be stealthy enough.</p><p>I tiptoe forward, forever grateful that these boots I wear are designed to make no sound at all. But the closer I inch toward his body, the more my attention is caught by something on his back.</p><p>A little rectangular blur of black.</p><p>I creep closer.</p><p>Blink.</p><p>Squint.</p><p>Lean in.</p><p>It\u2019s a tattoo.</p><p>No pictures. Just 1 word. 1 word, typed into the very center of his upper back. In ink.</p><p>IGNITE</p><p>And his skin is shredded with scars.</p><p>Blood is rushing to my head so quickly I\u2019m beginning to feel faint. I feel sick. Like I might actually, truly upturn the contents of my stomach right now. I want to panic, I want to shake someone, I want to know how to understand the emotions choking me because I can\u2019t even imagine, can\u2019t even imagine, can\u2019t even imagine what he must\u2019ve endured to carry such suffering on his skin.</p><p>His entire back is a map of pain.</p><p>Thick and thin and uneven and terrible. Scars like roads that lead to nowhere. They\u2019re gashes and ragged slices I can\u2019t understand, marks of torture I never could have expected. They\u2019re the only imperfections on his entire body, imperfections hidden away and hiding secrets of their own.</p><p>And I realize, not for the first time, that I have no idea who Warner really is.</p><p>\u201cJuliette?\u201d</p><p>I freeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d His eyes are wide, alert.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I came to talk to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he gasps, jumping away from me. \u201cI\u2019m very flattered, love, but you could\u2019ve at least given me a chance to put my pants on.\u201d He\u2019s pulled himself up against the wall but makes no effort to grab his clothes. His eyes keep darting from me to the pants on the floor like he doesn\u2019t know what to do. He seems determined not to turn his back to me.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind?\u201d he says, nodding to the clothes next to my feet and affecting an air of nonchalance that does little to hide the apprehension in his eyes. \u201cIt gets chilly in here.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m staring at him, staring at the length of him, awed by how incredibly flawless he looks from the front. Strong, lean frame, toned and muscular without being bulky. He\u2019s fair without being pale, skin tinted with just enough sunlight to look effortlessly healthy. The body of a perfect boy.</p><p>What a lie appearances can be.</p><p>What a terrible, terrible lie.</p><p>His gaze is fixed on mine, his eyes green flames that will not extinguish and his chest is rising and falling so fast, so fast, so fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your back?\u201d I hear myself whisper.</p><p>I watch as the color drains from his face. He looks away, runs a hand across his mouth, his chin, down the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWho hurt you?\u201d I ask, so quietly. I\u2019m beginning to recognize the strange feeling I get just before I do something terrible. Like right now. Right now I feel like I could kill someone for this.</p><p>\u201cJuliette, please, my clothes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it your father?\u201d I ask, my voice a little sharper. \u201cDid he do this to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Warner cuts me off, frustrated now.</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters!\u201d</p><p>He says nothing.</p><p>\u201cThat tattoo,\u201d I say to him, \u201cthat word\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, though he says it quietly. Clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ...\u201d I blink. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>Warner shakes his head, runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cIs it from a book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d he asks, looking away again. \u201cWhy are you suddenly so interested in my life?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know, I want to tell him. I want to tell him I don\u2019t know but that\u2019s not true.</p><p>Because I feel it. I feel the clicks and the turns and the creaking of a million keys unlocking a million doors in my mind. It\u2019s like I\u2019m finally allowing myself to see what I really think, how I really feel, like I\u2019m discovering my own secrets for the first time. And then I search his eyes, search his features for something I can\u2019t even name. And I realize I don\u2019t want to be his enemy anymore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d I say to him. \u201cI\u2019m not on base with you this time. I\u2019m not going to be your weapon and you\u2019ll never be able to change my mind about that. I think you know that now.\u201d I study the floor. \u201cSo why are we still fighting each other? Why are you still trying to manipulate me? Why are you still trying to get me to fall for your tricks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he says, looking at me like he\u2019s not sure I\u2019m even real, \u201cno idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell Castle you could touch me? That wasn\u2019t your secret to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He exhales a deep breath. \u201cOf course.\u201d Seems to return to himself. \u201cListen, love, could you at least toss me my jacket if you\u2019re going to stay here and ask me all these questions?\u201d</p><p>I toss him his jacket. He catches it. Slides down to the floor. And instead of putting his jacket on, he drapes it over his lap. Finally, he says, \u201cYes, I did tell Castle I could touch you. He had a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t any of his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s his business,\u201d Warner says. \u201cThe entire world he\u2019s created down here thrives on exactly that kind of information. And you\u2019re here, living among them. He should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it such a big deal?\u201d he asks, studying my eyes too carefully. \u201cWhy does it bother you so much for someone to know that I can touch you? Why does it have to be a secret?\u201d</p><p>I struggle to find the words that won\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about Kent? You think he\u2019d have a problem knowing I can touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to find out like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why does it matter?\u201d he insists. \u201cYou seem to care so much about something that makes no difference in your personal life. It wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he says, \u201cmake any difference in your personal life. Not if you still claim to feel nothing but hatred for me. Because that\u2019s what you said, isn\u2019t it? That you hate me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fold myself to the floor across from Warner.

But just when I think I finally get you, you surprise me. And I never really know who you are or who you\u2019re going to be.\u201d I look up. \u201cBut I know that I don\u2019t hate you anymore.

I\u2019ve seen too much. You\u2019re too human.\u201d</p><p>His hair is so gold. His eyes so green.

I\u2019m just saying that I don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014I hesitate, breathe\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know how to hate you anymore. Even though I want to. I really want to and I know I should but I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looks away.</p><p>And he smiles.</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of smile that makes me forget how to do everything but blink and blink and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to me. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t convince my eyes to find something else to focus on.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why my heart is losing its mind.</p> <p>He touches my notebook like he\u2019s not even aware he\u2019s doing it. His fingers run the length of the cover once, twice, before he registers where my eyes have gone and he stops.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote these words?\u201d He touches the notebook again. \u201cEvery single one?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He says, \u201cJuliette.\u201d</p><p>I stop breathing.</p><p>He says, \u201cI would like that very much. To be your friend,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p> <p>And I don\u2019t really know what happens in my brain.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s broken and I\u2019m foolish enough to think I can fix him. Maybe it\u2019s because I see myself, I see 3, 4, 5, 6, 17-year-old Juliette abandoned, neglected, mistreated, abused for something outside of her control and I think of Warner as someone who\u2019s just like me, someone who was never given a chance at life. I think about how everyone already hates him, how hating him is a universally accepted fact.</p><p>Warner is horrible.</p><p>There are no discussions, no reservations, no questions asked. It has already been decided that he is a despicable human being who thrives on murder and power and torturing others.</p><p>But I want to know. I need to know. I have to know.</p><p>If it\u2019s really that simple.</p><p>Because what if one day I slip? What if one day I fall through the cracks and no one is willing to pull me back? What happens to me then?</p><p>So I meet his eyes. I take a deep breath.</p> <p>And I run.</p><p>I run right out the door.</p><p>FIFTY-ONE</p><p>Just a moment.</p><p>Just 1 second, just 1 more minute, just give me another hour or maybe the weekend to think it over it\u2019s not so much it\u2019s not so hard it\u2019s all we ever ask for it\u2019s a simple request.</p><p>But the moments the seconds the minutes the hours the days and years become one big mistake, one extraordinary opportunity slipped right through our fingers because we couldn\u2019t decide, we couldn\u2019t understand, we needed more time, we didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019ve done.</p><p>We have no idea how we even got here when all we ever wanted was to wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night and maybe stop for ice cream on the way home and that one decision, that one choice, that one accidental opportunity unraveled everything we\u2019ve ever known and ever believed in and what do we do?</p><p>What do we do</p><p>from here?</p><p>FIFTY-TWO</p><p>Things are getting worse.</p><p>The tension among the citizens of Omega Point is getting tighter with each passing hour. We\u2019ve tried to make contact with Anderson\u2019s men to no avail\u2014we\u2019ve heard nothing from their team or their soldiers, and we have no updates on our hostages. But the civilians of Sector 45\u2014the sector Warner used to be in charge of, the sector he used to oversee\u2014are beginning to grow more and more unsettled. Rumors about us and our resistance are spreading too quickly.</p><p>The Reestablishment tried to cover up the news of our recent battle by calling it a standard attack on rebel party members, but the people are getting smarter. Protests are breaking out among them and some are refusing to work, standing up to authority, trying to escape the compounds, and running back to unregulated territory.</p><p>It never ends well.</p><p>The losses have been too many and Castle is anxious to do something. We all have a feeling we\u2019re going to be heading out again, and soon. We haven\u2019t received any reports that Anderson is dead, which means he\u2019s probably just biding his time\u2014or maybe Adam is right, and he\u2019s just recovering. But whatever the reason, Anderson\u2019s silence can\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Castle says to me.</p><p>I\u2019ve just collected my dinner. I\u2019ve just sat down at my usual table with Adam and Kenji and James. I blink at Castle, confused.</p><p>Kenji says, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Adam says, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Castle says, \u201cMy apologies, Ms. Ferrars, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. I confess I\u2019m just a bit surprised to see you here. I thought you were currently on assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I startle. Glance at my food and back at Castle again. \u201cI\u2014well yes, I am\u2014but I\u2019ve talked to Warner twice already\u2014I actually just saw him yesterday\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s excellent news, Ms. Ferrars. Excellent news.\u201d Castle clasps his hands together; his face is the picture of relief. \u201cAnd what have you been able to discover?\u201d He looks so hopeful that I actually begin to feel ashamed of myself.</p><p>Everyone is staring at me and I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Castle drops his hands. Looks down. Nods to himself. \u201cSo. You\u2019ve decided that your two visits have been more than sufficient?\u201d He won\u2019t look at me. \u201cWhat is your professional opinion, Ms. Ferrars? Do you think it would be best to take your time in this particular situation? That Winston and Brendan will be relaxing comfortably until you find an opportunity in your busy schedule to interrogate the only person who might be able to help us find them? Do you think that y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go right now.\u201d I grab my tray and jump up from table, nearly tripping over myself in the process. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019ll go right now. I\u2019ll see you guys at breakfast,\u201d I whisper, and run out the door.</p><p>Brendan and Winston</p><p>Brendan and Winston</p><p>Brendan and Winston, I keep telling myself.</p><p>I hear Kenji laughing as I leave.</p><p>I\u2019m not very good at interrogation, apparently.</p><p>I have so many questions for Warner but none of them have to do with our hostage situation. Every time I tell myself I\u2019m going to ask the right questions, Warner somehow manages to distract me. It\u2019s almost like he knows what I\u2019m going to ask and is already prepared to redirect the conversation.</p><p>It\u2019s confusing.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any tattoos?\u201d he\u2019s asking me, smiling as he leans back against the wall in his undershirt; pants on, socks on, shoes off. \u201cEveryone seems to have tattoos these days.\u201d</p><p>This is not a conversation I ever thought I\u2019d have with Warner.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an opportunity to get one. Besides, I don\u2019t think anyone would ever want to get that close to my skin.\u201d</p><p>He studies his hands. Smiles. Says, \u201cMaybe someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I agree.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cSo what about your tattoo?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy IGNITE?\u201d</p><p>His smile is bigger now. Dimples again. He shakes his head, says, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d I tilt my head at him, confused. \u201cYou want to remind yourself to catch on fire?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, presses back a laugh. \u201cA handful of letters doesn\u2019t always make a word, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath. Sits up straighter. \u201cSo,\u201d he says. \u201cYou used to read a lot?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m caught off guard. It\u2019s a strange question, and I can\u2019t help but wonder for a moment if it\u2019s a trick. If admitting to such a thing might get me into trouble. And then I remember that Warner is my hostage, not the other way around. \u201cYes,\u201d I say to him. \u201cI used to.\u201d</p><p>His smile fades into something a bit more serious, calculated. His features are carefully wiped clean of emotion. \u201cAnd when did you have a chance to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs slowly, glances at nothing across the room. \u201cIt just seems strange that a girl who\u2019s been so wholly isolated her entire life would have much access to literature. Especially in this world.\u201d</p><p>I say nothing.</p><p>He says nothing.</p><p>I breathe a few beats before answering him.</p><p>\u201cI ... I never got to choose my own books,\u201d I tell him, and I don\u2019t know why I feel so nervous saying this out loud, why I have to remind myself not to whisper. \u201cI read whatever was available. My schools always had little libraries and my parents had some things around the house. And later ...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cLater, I spent a couple of years in hospitals and psychiatric wards and a juvenile d-detention center.\u201d My face enflames as if on cue, always ready to be ashamed of my past, of who I\u2019ve been and continue to be.</p><p>But it\u2019s strange.</p><p>While one part of me struggles to be so candid, another part of me actually feels comfortable talking to Warner. Safe. Familiar.</p><p>Because he already knows everything about me.</p><p>He knows every detail of my 17 years. He has all of my medical records, knows all about my incidents with the police and the painful relationship I have had with my parents. And now he\u2019s read my notebook, too.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I could reveal about my history that would surprise him; nothing about what I\u2019ve done would shock or horrify him. I don\u2019t worry that he\u2019ll judge me or run away from me.</p><p>And this realization, perhaps more than anything else, rattles my bones.</p><p>And gives me some sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cThere were always books around,\u201d I continue, somehow unable to stop now, eyes glued to the floor. \u201cIn the detention center. A lot of them were old and worn and didn\u2019t have covers, so I didn\u2019t always know what they were called or who wrote them. I just read anything I could find. Fairy tales and mysteries and history and poetry. It didn\u2019t matter what it was. I would read it over and over and over again. The books ... they helped keep me from losing my mind altogether ...\u201d I trail off, catching myself before I say much more. Horrified as I realize just how much I want to confide in him. In Warner.</p><p>Terrible, terrible Warner who tried to kill Adam and Kenji. Who made me his toy.</p><p>I hate that I should feel safe enough to speak so freely around him. I hate that of all people, Warner is the one person I can be completely honest with. I always feel like I have to protect Adam from me, from the horror story that is my life. I never want to scare him or tell him too much for fear that he\u2019ll change his mind and realize what a mistake he\u2019s made in trusting me; in showing me affection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But with Warner there\u2019s nothing to hide.</p><p>I want to see his expression; I want to know what he\u2019s thinking now that I\u2019ve opened up, offered him a personal look at my past, but I can\u2019t make myself face him. So I sit here, frozen, humiliation perched on my shoulders and he doesn\u2019t say a word, doesn\u2019t shift an inch, doesn\u2019t make a single sound. Seconds fly by, swarming the room all at once and I want to swat them all away; I want to catch them and shove them into my pockets just long enough to stop time.</p><p>Finally, he interrupts the silence.</p><p>\u201cI like to read, too,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I look up, startled.</p><p>He\u2019s leaned back against the wall, one hand caught in his hair. He runs his fingers through the golden layers just once. Drops his hand. Meets my gaze. His eyes are so, so green.</p><p>\u201cYou like to read?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought The Reestablishment was going to destroy all of those things. I thought it was illegal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are, and it will be,\u201d he says, shifting a little. \u201cSoon, anyway. They\u2019ve destroyed some of it already, actually.\u201d He looks uncomfortable for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I only really started reading when the plan was in place to destroy everything. I was assigned to sort through some lists\u2014give my opinion on which things we\u2019d keep, which things we\u2019d get rid of, which things we\u2019d recycle for use in campaigns, in future curriculum, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that\u2019s okay?\u201d I ask him. \u201cTo destroy what\u2019s left of culture\u2014all the languages\u2014all those texts? Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s playing with my notebook again. \u201cThere ... are many things I\u2019d do differently,\u201d he says, \u201cif I were in charge.\u201d A deep breath. \u201cBut a soldier does not always have to agree in order to obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do differently?\u201d I ask. \u201cIf you were in charge?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. Sighs. Looks at me, smiles at me out of the corner of his eye. \u201cYou ask too many questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou just seem so different now. Everything you say surprises me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re just ... so calm. A little less crazy.\u201d</p><p>He laughs one of those silent laughs, the kind that shakes his chest without making a sound, and he says, \u201cMy life has been nothing but battle and destruction. Being here?\u201d He looks around. \u201cAway from duties, responsibilities. Death,\u201d he says, eyes intent on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s like a vacation. I don\u2019t have to think all the time. I don\u2019t have to do anything or talk to anyone or be anywhere. I\u2019ve never had so many hours to simply sleep,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of luxurious. I think I\u2019d like to get held hostage more often,\u201d he adds, mostly to himself.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but study him.</p><p>I study his face in a way I\u2019ve never dared to before and I realize I don\u2019t have the faintest idea what it must be like to live his life. He told me once that I didn\u2019t have a clue, that I couldn\u2019t possibly understand the strange laws of his world, and I\u2019m only just beginning to see how right he was. Because I don\u2019t know anything about that kind of bloody, regimented existence. But I suddenly want to know.</p><p>I suddenly want to understand.</p><p>I watch his careful movements, the effort he makes to look unconcerned, relaxed. But I see how calculated it is. How there\u2019s a reason behind every shift, every readjustment of his body. He\u2019s always listening, always touching a hand to the ground, the wall, staring at the door, studying its outline, the hinges, the handle. I see the way he tenses\u2014just a little bit\u2014at the sound of small noises, the scratch of metal, muffled voices outside the room. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s always alert, always on edge, ready to fight, to react. It makes me wonder if he\u2019s ever known tranquillity. Safety. If he\u2019s ever been able to sleep through the night. If he\u2019s ever been able to go anywhere without constantly looking over his own shoulder.</p><p>His hands are clasped together.</p> <p>He\u2019s playing with a ring on his left hand, turning and turning and turning it around his pinkie finger. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken me so long to notice he\u2019s wearing it; it\u2019s a solid band of jade, a shade of green pale enough to perfectly match his eyes. And then I remember, all at once, seeing it before.</p><p>Just one time.</p><p>The morning after I\u2019d hurt Jenkins. When Warner came to collect me from his room. He caught me staring at his ring and quickly slipped his gloves on.</p><p>It\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>He catches me looking at his hands and quickly clenches his left fist, covers it with his right.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a ring,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you hiding it if it\u2019s nothing?\u201d I\u2019m already so much more curious than I was a moment ago, too eager for any opportunity to crack him open, to figure out what on earth goes on inside of his head.</p><p>He sighs.</p><p>Flexes and unflexes his fingers. Stares at his hands, palms down, fingers spread. Slips the ring off his pinkie and holds it up to the fluorescent light; looks at it. It\u2019s a little O of green. Finally, he meets my eyes. Drops the ring into the palm of his hand and closes a fist around it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He rubs the side of his neck, massages the tension out of the lowest part, the part that just touches his upper back. I can\u2019t help but watch. Can\u2019t help but wonder what it would feel like to have someone massage the pain out of my body that way. His hands look so strong.</p><p>I\u2019ve just about forgotten what we were talking about when he says, \u201cI\u2019ve had this ring for almost ten years. It used to fit my index finger.\u201d He glances at me before looking away again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I bite down on my bottom lip. Disappointed.</p><p>\u201cDo you like Shakespeare?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>An odd segue.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cAll I know about him is that he stole my name and spelled it wrong.\u201d</p><p>Warner stares at me for a full second before he bursts into laughter\u2014strong, unrestrained gales of laughter\u2014trying to rein it in and failing.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly uncomfortable, nervous in front of this strange boy who laughs and wears secret rings and asks me about books and poetry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be funny,\u201d I manage to tell him.</p><p>But his eyes are still full of smiles when he says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t know much about him until roughly a year ago. I still don\u2019t understand half the things he says, so I think we\u2019re going to get rid of most of it, but he did write a line I really liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee it?\u201d</p><p>But Warner is already on his feet, unbuttoning his pants and I\u2019m wondering what could possibly be happening, worried I\u2019m being tricked into some new sick game of his when he stops. Catches the horrified look on my face. Says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. I\u2019m not getting naked, I promise. It\u2019s just another tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I ask, frozen in place, wanting and not wanting to look away.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>His pants are unzipped but hanging low on his waist. His boxer-briefs are visible underneath. He tugs and tugs on the elastic band of his underwear until it sits just below his hipbone.</p><p>I\u2019m blushing through my hairline.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen such an intimate area of any boy\u2019s body before, and I can\u2019t make myself look away. My moments with Adam were always in the dark and always interrupted; I never saw this much of him not because I didn\u2019t want to, but because I never had a chance to. And now the lights are on and Warner\u2019s standing right in front of me and I\u2019m so caught, so intrigued by the cut of his frame. I can\u2019t help but notice the way his waist narrows into his hips and disappears under a piece of fabric. I want to know what it would be like to understand another person without those barriers.</p><p>To know a person so thoroughly, so privately.</p><p>I want to study the secrets tucked between his elbows and the whispers caught behind his knees. I want to follow the lines of his silhouette with my eyes and the tips of my fingers. I want to trace rivers and valleys along the curved muscles of his body.</p><p>My thoughts shock me.</p><p>There\u2019s a desperate heat in the pit of my stomach I wish I could ignore. There are butterflies in my chest I wish I could explain away. There\u2019s an ache in my core that I\u2019m unwilling to name.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>He\u2019s so beautiful.</p><p>I must be insane.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels very ... relevant, I think. Even though it was written so long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I rip my eyes away from his lower half, desperately trying to keep my imagination from drawing in the details. I look back at the words tattooed onto his skin and focus this time. \u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s 2 lines. Font like a typewriter inked across the very bottom of his torso.</p><p>hell is empty</p><p>and all the devils are here</p><p>Yes. Interesting. Yes. Sure.</p><p>I think I need to lie down.</p><p>\u201cBooks,\u201d he\u2019s saying, pulling his boxer-briefs up and rezipping his pants, \u201care easily destroyed. But words will live as long as people can remember them. Tattoos, for example, are very hard to forget.\u201d He buttons his button. \u201cI think there\u2019s something about the impermanence of life these days that makes it necessary to etch ink into our skin,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reminds us that we\u2019ve been marked by the world, that we\u2019re still alive. That we\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know this Warner. I\u2019d never be able to recognize this Warner.</p><p>He smiles to himself. Sits down again. Says, \u201cNo one else will ever need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent a moment. I frown at the floor. \u201cIt must be great to go through life with so much confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are confident,\u201d he says to me. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn and resilient. So brave. So strong. So inhumanly beautiful. You could conquer the world.\u201d</p><p>I actually laugh, look up to meet his eyes. \u201cI cry too much. And I\u2019m not interested in conquering the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he says, \u201cis something I will never understand.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re just scared. You\u2019re afraid of what you\u2019re unfamiliar with. You\u2019re too worried about disappointing people. You stifle your own potential,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause of what you think others expect of you\u2014because you still follow the rules you\u2019ve been given.\u201d He looks at me, hard. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stop expecting me to use my power to kill people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugs. \u201cI never said you had to. But it will happen along the way; it\u2019s an inevitability in war. Killing is statistically impossible to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always avoid killing people, Warner. You avoid killing them by not going to war.\u201d</p> <p>But he grins, so brilliantly, not even paying attention. \u201cI love it when you say my name,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner isn\u2019t your name,\u201d I point out. \u201cYour name is Aaron.\u201d</p><p>His smile is wide, so wide. \u201cGod, I love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you say it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAaron? Or Warner?\u201d</p><p>His eyes close. He tilts his head back against the wall. Dimples.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m struck by the reality of what I\u2019m doing here. Sitting here, spending time with Warner like we have so many hours to waste. Like there isn\u2019t a very terrible world outside of these walls. I don\u2019t know how I manage to keep getting distracted and I promise myself that this time I won\u2019t let the conversation veer out of control. But when I open my mouth he says</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to give you your notebook back.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls closed.</p><p>\u201cI know you want it back,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to keep it forever.\u201d He holds it up, shows it to me. Grins. And then puts it in his pocket. The one place I\u2019d never dare to reach.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I can\u2019t help but ask. \u201cWhy do you want it so much?\u201d</p><p>He spends far too long just looking at me. Not answering my question. And then he says</p><p>\u201cOn the darkest days you have to search for a spot of brightness, on the coldest days you have to seek out a spot of warmth; on the bleakest days you have to keep your eyes onward and upward and on the saddest days you have to leave them open to let them cry. To then let them dry. To give them a chance to wash out the pain in order to see fresh and clear once again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you have that memorized,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He leans back again. Closes his eyes again. Says, \u201cNothing in this life will ever make sense to me but I can\u2019t help but try to collect the change and hope it\u2019s enough to pay for our mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote that, too?\u201d I ask him, unable to believe it\u2019s possible he\u2019s reciting the same words that fell from my lips to my fingertips and bled onto a page. Still unable to believe he\u2019s now privy to my private thoughts, feelings I captured with a tortured mind and hammered into sentences I shoved into paragraphs, ideas I pinned together with punctuation marks that serve no function but to determine where one thought ends and another begins.</p><p>This blond boy has my secrets in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote a lot of things,\u201d he says, not looking at me. \u201cAbout your parents, your childhood, your experiences with other people. You talked about hope and redemption and what it would be like to see a bird fly by. You wrote about pain. And what it\u2019s like to think you\u2019re a monster. What it was like to be judged by everyone before you\u2019d even spoken two words to them.\u201d A deep inhale. \u201cSo much of it was like seeing myself on paper,\u201d he whispers. \u201cLike reading all the things I never knew how to say.\u201d</p> <p>And I wish my heart would just shut up shut up shut up shut up.</p><p>\u201cEvery single day I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, his words barely a breath now. \u201cSorry for believing the things I heard about you. And then for hurting you when I thought I was helping you. I can\u2019t apologize for who I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat part of me is already done; already ruined. I gave up on myself a long time ago. But I am sorry I didn\u2019t understand you better. Everything I did, I did because I wanted to help you to be stronger. I wanted you to use your anger as a tool, as a weapon to help harness the strength inside of you; I wanted you to be able to fight the world. I provoked you on purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cI pushed you too far, too hard, did things to horrify and disgust you and I did it all on purpose. Because that\u2019s how I was taught to steel myself against the terror in this world. That\u2019s how I was trained to fight back. And I wanted to teach you. I knew you had the potential to be more, so much more. I could see greatness in you.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me. Really, really looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go on to do incredible things,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that. I think I just wanted to be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>And I try. I try so hard to remember all the reasons why I\u2019m supposed to hate him, I try to remember all the horrible things I\u2019ve seen him do. But I\u2019m tortured because I understand too much about what it\u2019s like to be tortured. To do things because you don\u2019t know any better. To do things because you think they\u2019re right because you were never taught what was wrong.</p><p>Because it\u2019s so hard to be kind to the world when all you\u2019ve ever felt is hate.</p><p>Because it\u2019s so hard to see goodness in the world when all you\u2019ve ever known is terror.</p><p>And I want to say something to him. Something profound and complete and memorable but he seems to understand. He offers me a strange, unsteady smile that doesn\u2019t reach his eyes but says so much.</p><p>Then</p><p>\u201cTell your team,\u201d he says, \u201cto prepare for war. Unless his plans have changed, my father will be ordering an attack on civilians the day after tomorrow and it will be nothing short of a massacre. It will also be your only opportunity to save your men. They are being held captive somewhere in the lower levels of Sector 45 Headquarters. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why you\u2019re here, love. I\u2019m not an idiot. I know why you\u2019re being forced to spend time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why offer the information so freely?\u201d I ask him. \u201cWhat reason do you have to help us?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a flicker of change in his eyes that doesn\u2019t last long enough for me to examine it. And though his expression is carefully neutral, something in the space between us feels different all of a sudden. Charged.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he says. \u201cYou must tell them now.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-THREE</p><p>Adam, Kenji, Castle, and I are camped out in his office trying to discuss strategy.</p><p>Last night I ran straight to Kenji\u2014who then took me to Castle\u2014to tell him what Warner told me. Castle was both relieved and horrified, and I think he still hasn\u2019t digested the information yet.</p><p>He told me he was going to meet with Warner in the morning, just to follow up, just to see if Warner would be willing to elaborate at all (he wasn\u2019t), and that Kenji, Adam, and I should meet him in his office at lunch.</p><p>So now we\u2019re all crammed into his small space, along with 7 others. The faces in this room are many of the same ones I saw when we journeyed into The Reestablishment\u2019s storage compound; that means they\u2019re important, integral to this movement. And it makes me wonder when I ever became a part of Castle\u2019s core group at Omega Point.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but feel a little proud. A little thrilled to be someone he relies on. To be contributing.</p><p>And it makes me wonder how much I\u2019ve changed in such a short period of time. How different my life has become, how much stronger and how much weaker I feel now. It makes me wonder whether things would\u2019ve turned out differently if Adam and I had found a way to stay together. If I ever would\u2019ve ventured outside of the safety he introduced to my life.</p><p>I wonder about a lot of things.</p><p>But when I look up and catch him staring at me, my wonders disappear; and I\u2019m left with nothing but the pains of missing him. Left wishing he wouldn\u2019t look away the moment I look up.</p><p>This was my miserable choice. I brought it upon myself.</p><p>Castle is sitting at his desk, elbows propped up on the table, chin resting on clasped hands. His eyebrows are furrowed, his lips pursed, his eyes focused on the papers in front of him.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t said a word in 5 minutes.</p><p>Finally, he looks up. Looks at Kenji, who is sitting right in front of him, between me and Adam. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he says. \u201cOffensive or defensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuerrilla warfare,\u201d Kenji says without hesitation. \u201cNothing else.\u201d</p><p>A deep breath. \u201cYes,\u201d Castle says. \u201cI thought so too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be split up,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cDo you want to assign groups, or should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll assign the preliminary groups. I\u2019d like you to look them over and suggest changes, if any.\u201d</p><p>Kenji nods.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. And weapons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll oversee that,\u201d Adam says. \u201cI can make sure everything is clean, loaded, ready to go. I\u2019m already familiar with the armory.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea.</p><p>\u201cGood. Excellent. We\u2019ll assign one group to try and get on base to find Winston and Brendan; everyone else will spread out among the compounds. Our mission is simple: save as many civilians as possible. Take out only as many soldiers as is absolutely necessary. Our fight is not against the men, but against their leaders\u2014we must never forget that. Kenji,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019d like you to oversee the groups entering the compounds. Do you feel comfortable doing that?\u201d</p><p>Kenji nods.</p><p>\u201cI will lead the group onto base,\u201d Castle says. \u201cWhile you and Mr. Kent would be ideal for infiltrating Sector 45, I\u2019d like you to stay with Ms. Ferrars; the three of you work well together, and we could use your strengths on the ground. Now,\u201d he says, spreading out the papers in front of him, \u201cI\u2019ve been studying these blueprints all ni\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone is banging on the glass window in Castle\u2019s door.</p><p>He\u2019s a youngish man I\u2019ve never seen before, with bright, light-brown eyes and hair cropped so close to the crown I can\u2019t even make out the color. His eyes are pulled together, his forehead tight, tense. \u201cSir!\u201d he\u2019s shouting, he\u2019s been shouting, I realize, but his voice is muffled and only then does it dawn on me that this room must be soundproof, if only just a little bit.</p><p>Kenji jumps out of his chair, yanks the door open.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d The man is out of breath. It\u2019s clear he ran all the way here. \u201cSir, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel?\u201d Castle is up, around his desk, charging forward to grip this boy\u2019s shoulders, trying to focus his eyes. \u201cWhat is it\u2014what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Samuel says again, this time more normally, his breathing almost within his grasp. \u201cWe have a\u2014a situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me everything\u2014now is not the time to hold back if something has happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with anything topside, sir, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d His eyes dart in my direction for one split second. \u201cOur ... visitor\u2014he\u2014he is not cooperating, sir, he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s giving the guards a lot of trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d Castle\u2019s eyes are two slits.</p><p>Samuel drops his voice. \u201cHe\u2019s managed to make a dent in the door, sir. He\u2019s managed to dent the steel door, sir, and he\u2019s threatening the guards and they\u2019re beginning to worry\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Castle says without looking at me. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to do this, but you\u2019re the only one he\u2019ll listen to and we can\u2019t afford this distraction, not right now.\u201d His voice is so thin, so stretched it sounds as if it might actually crack. \u201cPlease do what you can to contain him, and when you deem it safe for one of the girls to enter, perhaps we can find a way to sedate him without endangering them in the process.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flick up to Adam almost accidentally. He doesn\u2019t look happy.</p> <p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d Castle\u2019s jaw tightens. \u201cPlease. Go now.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Turn to leave.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d Castle adds as I walk out the door, his voice too soft for the words he speaks next. \u201cUnless we have been deceived, the supreme will be massacring unarmed civilians tomorrow, and we can\u2019t afford to assume Warner has given us false information. We leave at dawn.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-FOUR</p><p>The guards let me into Warner\u2019s room without a single word.</p> <p>My eyes dart around the now partially furnished space, heart pounding, fists clenching, blood racing racing racing. Something is wrong. Something has happened. Warner was perfectly fine when I left him last night and I can\u2019t imagine what could\u2019ve inspired him to lose his mind like this but I\u2019m scared.</p><p>Someone has given him a chair. I realize now how he was able to dent the steel door. No one should\u2019ve given him a chair.</p><p>Warner is sitting in it, his back to me. Only his head is visible from where I\u2019m standing.</p><p>\u201cYou came back,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOf course I came back,\u201d I tell him, inching closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. Runs a hand through his hair. Looks up at the ceiling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I\u2019m so worried now. \u201cAre you\u2014did something happen to you? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to leave. I can\u2019t be here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he said to me? Did he tell you what he said to me?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHe just walked into my room this morning. He walked right in here and said he wanted to have a conversation with me.\u201d Warner laughs again, loud, too loud. Shakes his head. \u201cHe told me I can change. He said I might have a gift like everyone else here\u2014that maybe I have an ability. He said I can be different, love. He said he believes I can be different if I want to be.\u201d</p><p>Castle told him.</p><p>Warner stands up but doesn\u2019t turn around all the way and I see he\u2019s not wearing a shirt. He doesn\u2019t even seem to mind that I can see the scars on his back, the word IGNITE tattooed on his body. His hair is messy, untamed, falling into his face and his pants are zipped but unbuttoned and I\u2019ve never seen him so disheveled before. He presses his palms against the stone wall, arms outstretched; his body is bowed, his head down as if in prayer. His entire body is tense, tight, muscles straining against his skin. His clothes are in a pile on the floor and his mattress is in the middle of the room and the chair he was just sitting in is facing the wall, staring at nothing at all and I realize he\u2019s begun to lose his mind in here.</p> <p>\u201cCan you believe that?\u201d he asks me, still not looking in my direction. \u201cCan you believe he thinks I can just wake up one morning and be different? Sing happy songs and give money to the poor and beg the world to forgive me for what I\u2019ve done? Do you think that\u2019s possible? Do you think I can change?\u201d</p><p>He finally turns to face me and his eyes are laughing, his eyes are like emeralds glinting in the setting sun and his mouth is twitching, suppressing a smile. \u201cDo you think I could be different?\u201d He takes a few steps toward me and I don\u2019t know why it affects my breathing. Why I can\u2019t find my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a question,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s right in front of me and I don\u2019t even know how he got there. He\u2019s still looking at me, his eyes so focused and so simultaneously unnerving, brilliant, blazing with something I can never place.</p><p>My heart it will not be still it refuses to stop skipping skipping skipping</p><p>\u201cTell me, Juliette. I\u2019d love to know what you really think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Barely a whisper in an attempt to buy some time.</p><p>Warner\u2019s lips flicker up and into a smile before they fall open, just a bit, just enough to twitch into a strange, curious look that lingers in his eyes. He doesn\u2019t answer. He doesn\u2019t say a word. He only moves closer to me, studying me and I\u2019m frozen in place, my mouth stuffed full of the seconds he doesn\u2019t speak and I\u2019m fighting every atom in my body, every stupid cell in my system for being so attracted to him.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>God.</p><p>I am so horribly attracted to him.</p><p>The guilt is growing inside of me in stacks, settling on my bones, snapping me in half. It\u2019s a cable twisted around my neck, a caterpillar crawling across my stomach. It\u2019s the night and midnight and the twilight of indecision. It\u2019s too many secrets I no longer contain.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand why I want this.</p><p>I am a terrible person.</p><p>And it\u2019s like he sees what I\u2019m thinking, like he can feel the change happening in my head, because suddenly he\u2019s different. His energy slows down, his eyes are deep, troubled, tender; his lips are soft, still slightly parted and now the air in this room is too tight, too full of cotton and I feel the blood rushing around in my head, crashing into every rational region of my brain.</p><p>I wish someone would remind me how to breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you answer my question?\u201d He\u2019s looking so deeply into my eyes that I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t buckled under the intensity and I realize then, right in this moment I realize that everything about him is intense. Nothing about him is manageable or easy to compartmentalize. He\u2019s too much. Everything about him is too much. His emotions, his actions, his anger, his aggression.</p><p>His love.</p><p>He\u2019s dangerous, electric, impossible to contain. His body is rippling with an energy so extraordinary that even when he\u2019s calmed down it\u2019s almost palpable. It has a presence.</p><p>But I\u2019ve developed a strange, frightening faith in who Warner really is and who he has the capacity to become. I want to find the 19-year-old boy who would feed a stray dog. I want to believe in the boy with a tortured childhood and an abusive father. I want to understand him. I want to unravel him.</p><p>I want to believe he is more than the mold he was forced into.</p><p>\u201cI think you can change,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cI think anyone can change.\u201d</p><p>And he smiles.</p><p>It\u2019s a slow, delighted smile. The kind of smile that breaks into a laugh and lights up his features and makes him sigh. He closes his eyes. His face is so touched, so amused. \u201cIt\u2019s just so sweet,\u201d he says. \u201cSo unbearably sweet. Because you really believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>He finally looks at me when he whispers, \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heartless,\u201d he says to me, his words cold, hollow, directed inward. \u201cI\u2019m a heartless bastard and a cruel, vicious being. I don\u2019t care about people\u2019s feelings. I don\u2019t care about their fears or their futures. I don\u2019t care about what they want or whether or not they have a family, and I\u2019m not sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been sorry for anything I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>It actually takes me a few moments to find my head. \u201cBut you apologized to me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou apologized to me just last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different,\u201d he says, cutting me off. \u201cYou don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not different,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m just another person, just like everyone else. And you\u2019ve proven you have the capacity for remorse. For compassion. I know you can be kind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d His voice is suddenly hard, suddenly too strong. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to change. I can\u2019t erase the nineteen miserable years of my life. I can\u2019t misplace the memories of what I\u2019ve done. I can\u2019t wake up one morning and decide to live on borrowed hopes and dreams. Someone else\u2019s promises for a brighter future.</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never given a damn about others and I don\u2019t make sacrifices and I do not compromise. I am not good, or fair, or decent, and I never will be. I can\u2019t be. Because to try to be any of those things would be embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you think that?\u201d I want to shake him. \u201cHow can you be ashamed of an attempt to be better?\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019s not listening. He\u2019s laughing. He\u2019s saying, \u201cCan you even picture me? Smiling at small children and handing out presents at birthday parties? Can you picture me helping a stranger? Playing with the neighbor\u2019s dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say to him. \u201cYes I can.\u201d I\u2019ve already seen it, I don\u2019t say to him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I insist. \u201cWhy is that so hard to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of life,\u201d he says, \u201cis impossible for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>Warner clenches and unclenches 5 fingers before running them through his hair. \u201cBecause I feel it,\u201d he says, quieter now. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able to feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat people think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir feelings\u2014their energy\u2014it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he says, frustrated, stumbling backward, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able to tell. I know how everyone hates me. I know how little my father cares for me. I know the agony of my mother\u2019s heart. I know that you\u2019re not like everyone else.\u201d His voice catches. \u201cI know you\u2019re telling the truth when you say you don\u2019t hate me. That you want to and you can\u2019t. Because there\u2019s no ill will in your heart, not toward me, and if there was I would know. Just like I know,\u201d he says, his voice husky with restraint, \u201cthat you felt something when we kissed. You felt the same thing I did and you\u2019re ashamed of it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dripping panic everywhere.</p><p>\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d I ask him. \u201cH-how\u2014you can\u2019t just know things like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever looked at me like you do,\u201d he whispers. \u201cNo one ever talks to me like you do, Juliette. You\u2019re different,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re so different. You would understand me. But the rest of the world does not want my sympathies. They don\u2019t want my smiles. Castle is the only man on Earth who\u2019s been the exception to this rule, and his eagerness to trust and accept me only shows how weak this resistance is. No one here knows what they\u2019re doing and they\u2019re all going to get themselves slaughtered\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2014that can\u2019t be true\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Warner says, urgently now. \u201cYou must understand\u2014the only people who matter in this wretched world are the ones with real power. And you,\u201d he says, \u201cyou have power. You have the kind of strength that could shake this planet\u2014that could conquer it. And maybe it\u2019s still too soon, maybe you need more time to recognize your own potential, but I will always be waiting. I will always want you on my side. Because the two of us\u2014the two of us,\u201d he says, he stops. He sounds breathless. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d His eyes are intent on mine, eyebrows drawn together. Studying me. \u201cOf course you can,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou think about it all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong with these people.

At least they\u2019re not murdering innocent people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think your new friends have never killed before?\u201d Warner shouts, pointing at the door. \u201cYou think Kent has never killed anyone? That Kenji has never put a bullet through a stranger\u2019s body? They were my soldiers!\u201d he says. \u201cI saw them do it with my own eyes!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were trying to survive,\u201d I tell him, shaking, fighting to ignore the terror of my own imagination. \u201cTheir loyalties were never with The Reestablishment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy loyalties,\u201d he says, \u201cdo not lie with The Reestablishment. My loyalties lie with those who know how to live. I only have two options in this game, love.\u201d He\u2019s breathing hard. \u201cKill. Or be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell him, backing away, feeling sick. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like that. You don\u2019t have to live like that. You could get away from your father, from that life. You don\u2019t have to be what he wants you to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe damage,\u201d he says, \u201cis already done. It\u2019s too late for me. I\u2019ve already accepted my fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014Warner\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to worry about me,\u201d he says. \u201cI know exactly what my future looks like and I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m happy to live in solitude. I\u2019m not afraid of spending the rest of my life in the company of my own person. I do not fear loneliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have that life,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not stay here,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wanted you to know that. I\u2019m going to find a way out of here and I\u2019m going to leave as soon as I have the chance. My vacation,\u201d he says, \u201chas officially come to an end.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-FIVE</p><p>Tick tock.</p><p>Castle called an impromptu meeting to brief everyone on the details of tomorrow\u2019s fight; there are less than 12 hours until we leave. We\u2019ve gathered in the dining hall because it\u2019s the easiest place to seat everyone at once.</p> <p>We had 1 final meal, a handful of forced conversation, 2 tense hours filled with brief, spastic moments of laughter that sounded more like choking. Sara and Sonya were the last to sneak into the hall, both spotting me and waving a quick hello before they sat down on the other side of the room. Then Castle began to speak.</p><p>Everyone will need to fight.</p><p>All able-bodied men and women. The elderly unable to enter battle will stay back with the youngest ones, and the youngest ones will include James and his old group of friends.</p><p>James is currently crushing Adam\u2019s hand.</p><p>Anderson is going after the people, Castle says. The people have been rioting, raging against The Reestablishment now more than ever. Our battle gave them hope, Castle says to us. They\u2019d only heard rumors of a resistance, and the battle concretized those rumors. They are looking to us to support them, to stand by them, and now, for the first time, we will be fighting with our gifts out in the open.</p><p>On the compounds.</p><p>Where the civilians will see us for what we are.</p><p>Castle is telling us to prepare for aggression on both sides. He says that sometimes, especially when frightened, people will not react positively to seeing our kind. They prefer the familiar terror as opposed to the unknown or the inexplicable, and our presence, our public display might create new enemies.</p> <p>We have to be ready for that.</p><p>\u201cThen why should we care?\u201d someone shouts from the back of the room. She gets to her feet and I notice her sleek black hair, one heavy sheet of ink that stops at her waist. Her eyes are glittering under the fluorescent lights. \u201cIf they\u2019re only going to hate us,\u201d she says, \u201cwhy should we even defend them? That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>Castle takes a deep breath. \u201cWe cannot fault them all for the foolishness of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not just one, is it?\u201d a new voice chimes in. \u201cHow many of them are going to turn on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no way of knowing,\u201d Castle says. \u201cIt could be one. It could be none. I am merely advising you to be cautious. You must never forget that these civilians are innocent and unarmed. They are being murdered for their disobedience\u2014for merely speaking out and asking for fair treatment. They are starved and they\u2019ve lost their homes, their families. Surely, you must be able to relate. Many of you still have family lost, scattered across the country, do you not?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a general murmur among the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou must imagine that it is your mother. Your father. Your brothers and sisters among them. They are hurting and they are beaten down. We have to do what little we can to help. It\u2019s the only way. We are their only hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about our men?\u201d Another person gets to his feet. He must be in his late 40s, round and robust, towering over the room. \u201cWhere is the guarantee that we will get Winston and Brendan back?\u201d</p><p>Castle\u2019s gaze drops for only a second. I wonder if I\u2019m the only one who noticed the pain flit in and out of his eyes. \u201cThere is no guarantee, my friend. There never is. But we will do our best. We will not give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what good was it to take the kid hostage?\u201d he protests. \u201cWhy not just kill him? Why are we keeping him alive? He\u2019s done us no good and he\u2019s eating our food and using resources that should go to the rest of us!\u201d</p><p>The crowd bursts into an aggravated frenzy, angry, insane with emotions. Everyone is shouting at once, shouting things like, \u201cKill him!\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019ll show the supreme!\u201d and \u201cWe have to make a statement!\u201d and \u201cHe deserves to die!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden constriction in my heart. I\u2019ve almost begun to hyperventilate and I realize, for the very first time, that the thought of Warner dead is anything but appealing to me.</p><p>It horrifies me.</p><p>I look to Adam for a different kind of reaction but I don\u2019t know what I was expecting. I\u2019m stupid to be surprised at the tension in his eyes, his forehead, the stiff set of his lips. I\u2019m stupid to have expected anything but hatred from Adam. Of course Adam hates Warner. Of course he does.</p><p>Warner tried to murder him.</p><p>Of course he, too, wants Warner dead.</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Castle shouts. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset! Tomorrow is a difficult thing to face, but we can\u2019t channel our aggression onto one person. We have to use it as fuel for our fight and we have to remain united. We cannot allow anything to divide us. Not now!\u201d</p><p>6 ticks of silence.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fight until he\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe kill him tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him now!\u201d</p><p>The crowd is a roar of angry bodies, determined, ugly faces so scary, so savage, so twisted in inhuman rage. I hadn\u2019t realized that the people of Omega Point were harboring so much resentment.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d Castle\u2019s hands are in the air, his eyes on fire. Every table and chair in the room has begun to rattle. People are looking around, scattered and scared, unnerved.</p><p>They\u2019re still unwilling to undermine Castle\u2019s authority. At least for now.</p><p>\u201cOur hostage,\u201d Castle begins, \u201cis no longer a hostage.\u201d</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible.</p><p>It\u2019s not possible.</p><p>\u201cHe has come to me, just tonight,\u201d Castle says, \u201cand asked for sanctuary at Omega Point.\u201d</p><p>My brain is screaming, raging against the 14 words Castle has just confessed.</p><p>It can\u2019t be true. Warner said he was going to leave. He said he was going to find a way to get out.</p><p>But Omega Point is even more shocked than I am. Even Adam is shaking with anger beside me. I\u2019m afraid to look at his face.</p><p>\u201cSILENCE! PLEASE!\u201d Castle holds out another hand to quell the explosion of protests.</p><p>He says, \u201cWe have recently discovered that he, too, has a gift. And he says he wants to join us. He says he will fight with us tomorrow. He says he will fight against his father and help us find Brendan and Winston.\u201d</p><p>Chaos</p><p>Chaos</p><p>Chaos</p><p>explodes in every corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a liar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you believe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a traitor to his own people! He\u2019ll be a traitor to us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never fight beside him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him first!\u201d</p><p>Castle\u2019s eyes narrow, flashing under the fluorescent lights, and his hands move through the air like whisks, gathering up every plate, every spoon, every glass cup in the room and he holds them there, right in midair, daring someone to speak, to shout, to disagree.</p><p>\u201cYou will not touch him,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI took an oath to help the members of our kind and I will not break it now. Think of yourselves!\u201d he shouts. \u201cThink of the day you found out! Think of the loneliness, the isolation, the terror that overcame you! Think of how you were cast off by your families and your friends! You don\u2019t think he could be a changed man? How have you changed, friends? You judge him now! You judge one of your own who asks for amnesty!\u201d</p><p>Castle looks disgusted.</p><p>\u201cIf he does anything to compromise any of us, if he does one single thing to disprove his loyalty\u2014only then are you free to pass judgment upon his person. But we first give him a chance, do we not?\u201d He is no longer bothering to hide his anger. \u201cHe says he will help us find our men! He says he will fight against his father! He has valuable information we can use! Why should we be unwilling to take a chance? He is no more than a child of nineteen! He is only one and we are many more!\u201d</p><p>The crowd is hushed, whispering amongst itself and I hear snippets of conversation and things like \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201che\u2019s going to get all of us killed!\u201d but no one speaks up and I\u2019m relieved. I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m feeling right now and I wish I didn\u2019t care at all about what happens to Warner.</p><p>I wish I could want him dead. I wish I felt nothing for him.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d someone asks. A new voice, a calm voice, a voice struggling to be rational.</p><p>The voice sitting right beside me.</p><p>Adam gets to his feet. Swallows, hard. Says, \u201cHow do you know he has a gift? Have you tested him?\u201d</p><p>And he looks at me, Castle looks at me, he stares at me as if to will me to speak and I feel like I\u2019ve sucked all of the air out of this room, like I\u2019ve been thrown into a vat of boiling water, like I will never find my heartbeat ever again and I am begging praying hoping and wishing he will not say the words he says next but he does.</p><p>Of course he does.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Castle says. \u201cWe know that he, like you, can touch Juliette.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-SIX</p><p>It\u2019s like spending 6 months just trying to inhale. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s like forgetting how to move your muscles and reliving every nauseous moment in your life and struggling to get all the splinters out from underneath your skin. It\u2019s like that one time you woke up and tripped down a rabbit hole and a blond girl in a blue dress kept asking you for directions but you couldn\u2019t tell her, you had no idea, you kept trying to speak but your throat was full of rain clouds and it\u2019s like someone has taken the ocean and filled it with silence and dumped it all over this room.</p><p>It\u2019s like this.</p><p>No one is speaking. No one is moving. Everyone is staring.</p><p>At me.</p> <p>At Adam.</p><p>At Adam staring at me.</p><p>His eyes are wide, blinking too fast, his features shifting in and out of confusion and anger and pain and confusion so much confusion and a touch of betrayal, of suspicion, of so much more confusion and an extra dose of pain and I\u2019m gaping like a fish in the moments before it dies.</p><p>I wish he would say something. I wish he would at least ask or accuse or demand something but he says nothing, he only studies me, stares at me, and I watch as the light goes out of his eyes, as the anger gives way to the pain and the extraordinary impossibility he must be experiencing right now and he sits down.</p><p>He does not look in my direction.</p> <p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s up. He\u2019s up. He\u2019s up and he\u2019s charging out of the room and I scramble to my feet, I chase him out the door and I hear the chaos erupt in my wake, the crowd dissolving into anger all over again and I almost slam right into him, I\u2019m gasping and he spins around and he says</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d His eyes are so hurt, so deep, so blue.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s touched you.\u201d It\u2019s not a question. He can hardly meet my eyes and he looks almost embarrassed by the words he speaks next. \u201cHe\u2019s touched your skin.\u201d</p><p>If only it were just that. If only it were that simple. If only I could get these currents out of my blood and Warner out of my head and why am I so confused</p> <p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I tell him, I hardly move my lips. The answer to his nonquestion is yes.</p><p>Adam touches his fingers to his mouth, looks up, looks away, makes a strange, disbelieving sound. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>I tell him.</p><p>I tell him when it happened, how it all began, I tell him how I was wearing one of the dresses Warner always made me wear, how he was fighting to stop me before I jumped out the window, how his hand grazed my leg and how he touched me and nothing happened.</p><p>I tell him how I tried to pretend it was all just a figment of my imagination until Warner caught us again.</p><p>I don\u2019t tell him how Warner told me he missed me, how he told me he loved me and he kissed me, how he kissed me with such wild, reckless intensity. I don\u2019t tell him that I pretended to return Warner\u2019s affections just so I could slip my hands under his coat to get the gun out of his inside pocket. I don\u2019t tell him that I was surprised, shocked, even, at how it felt to be in his arms, and that I pushed away those strange feelings because I hated Warner, because I was so horrified that he\u2019d shot Adam that I wanted to kill him.</p><p>All Adam knows is that I almost did. That I almost killed Warner.</p> <p>And now Adam is blinking, digesting the words I\u2019m telling him, innocent of the things I\u2019ve kept to myself.</p><p>I really am a monster.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d I manage to say. \u201cI thought it would complicate things between us\u2014after everything we\u2019ve had to deal with\u2014I just thought it would be better to ignore it and I don\u2019t know.\u201d I fumble, fail for words. \u201cIt was stupid. I was stupid. I should have told you and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t want you to find out like this.\u201d</p><p>Adam is breathing hard, rubbing the back of his head before running a hand through his hair and he says, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t get it\u2014I mean\u2014do we know why he can touch you? Is it like me? Can he do what I do? I don\u2019t\u2014God, Juliette, and you\u2019ve been spending all that time alone with him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAll I did was talk to him and he never tried to touch me. And I have no idea why he can touch me\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone does. He hasn\u2019t started testing with Castle yet.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighs and drags a hand across his face and says, so quietly only I can hear him, \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m surprised. We share the same goddamn DNA.\u201d He swears under his breath. Swears again. \u201cAm I ever going to catch a break?\u201d he asks, raising his voice, talking to the air. \u201cIs there ever going to be a time when some shitty thing isn\u2019t being thrown in my face? Jesus. It\u2019s like this insanity is never going to end.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him that I don\u2019t think it ever will.</p><p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d</p><p>I freeze at the sound of his voice.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut tight, so tight, refusing to believe my ears. Warner cannot be here. Of course he\u2019s not here. It\u2019s not even possible for him to be out here but then I remember. Castle said he\u2019s no longer a hostage.</p><p>Castle must\u2019ve let him out of his room.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening. Warner is not standing so close to me and Adam right now, not again, not like this not after everything this cannot be happening</p><p>but Adam looks over my shoulder, looks behind me at the person I\u2019m trying so hard to ignore and I can\u2019t lift my eyes. I don\u2019t want to see what\u2019s about to happen.</p><p>Adam\u2019s voice is like acid when he speaks. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Kent.\u201d I can actually hear Warner smile. \u201cWe should catch up, you know. Especially in light of this new discovery. I had no idea we had so much in common.\u201d</p><p>You really, truly have no idea, I want to say out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou sick piece of shit,\u201d Adam says to him, his voice low, measured.</p><p>\u201cSuch unfortunate language.\u201d Warner shakes his head. \u201cOnly those who cannot express themselves intelligently would resort to such crude substitutions in vocabulary.\u201d A pause. \u201cIs it because I intimidate you, Kent? Am I making you nervous?\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou seem to be struggling to hold yourself together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will kill you\u2014\u201d Adam charges forward to grab Warner by the throat just as Kenji slams into him, into both of them, shoving them apart with a look of absolute disgust on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d His eyes are blazing. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but you\u2019re standing right in front of the doorway and you\u2019re scaring the shit out of the little kids, Kent, so I\u2019m going to have to ask you to calm your ass down.\u201d Adam tries to speak but Kenji cuts him off. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t have a clue what Warner is doing out of his room, but that\u2019s not my call to make. Castle is in charge around here, and we have to respect that. You can\u2019t go around killing people just because you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the same guy who tried to torture me to death!\u201d Adam shouts. \u201cHe had his men beat the shit out of you! And I have to live with him? Fight with him? Pretend everything is fine? Has Castle lost his mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastle knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Kenji snaps. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have an opinion. You will defer to his judgment.\u201d</p><p>Adam throws his hands in the air, furious. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this. This is a joke! Who does this? Who treats hostages like they\u2019re on some kind of retreat?\u201d he shouts again, making no effort to keep his voice down. \u201cHe could go back and give away every detail of this place\u2014he could give away our exact location!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Warner says. \u201cI have no idea where we are.\u201d</p><p>Adam turns on Warner so quickly that I spin around just as fast, just to catch the action. Adam is shouting, saying something, looking like he might attack Warner right here in this moment and Kenji is trying to restrain him but I can hardly hear what\u2019s going on around me. The blood is pounding too hard in my head and my eyes are forgetting to blink because Warner is looking at me, only me, his eyes so focused, so intent, so heart-wrenchingly deep it renders me completely still.</p><p>Warner\u2019s chest is rising and falling, strong enough that I can see it from where I\u2019m standing. He\u2019s not paying attention to the commotion beside him, the chaos of the dining hall or Adam trying to pummel him into the ground; he\u2019s not moved a single inch. He will not look away and I know I have to do it for him.</p><p>I turn my head.</p><p>Kenji is yelling at Adam to calm down about something and I reach out, I grab Adam\u2019s arm, I offer him a small smile and he stills. \u201cCome on,\u201d I tell him. \u201cLet\u2019s go back inside. Castle isn\u2019t finished yet and we need to hear what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>Adam makes an effort to regain control of himself. Takes a deep breath. Offers me a quick nod and allows me to lead him forward. I\u2019m forcing myself to focus on Adam so I can pretend Warner isn\u2019t here.</p><p>Warner isn\u2019t a fan of my plan.</p><p>He\u2019s now standing in front of us, blocking our path and I look at him despite my best intentions only to see something I\u2019ve never seen before. Not to this degree, not like this.</p><p>Pain.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Adam snaps at him, but Warner doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me. He\u2019s looking at my hand clenched around Adam\u2019s covered arm and the agony in his eyes is breaking my knees and I can\u2019t speak, I shouldn\u2019t speak, I wouldn\u2019t know what to say even if I could speak and then he says my name. He says it again. He says, \u201cJuliette\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d Adam barks again, this time losing restraint and pushing Warner with enough strength to knock him to the floor. Except Warner doesn\u2019t fall. He trips backward, just a little, but the movement somehow triggers something within him, some kind of dormant anger he\u2019s all too eager to unleash and he\u2019s charging forward, ready to inflict damage and I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do to make it stop, I\u2019m trying to come up with a plan and I\u2019m stupid.</p><p>I\u2019m stupid enough to step in the middle.</p><p>Adam grabs me to try and pull me back but I\u2019m already pressing a palm to Warner\u2019s chest and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking but I\u2019m not thinking at all and that seems to be the problem. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m caught in the milliseconds standing between 2 brothers willing to destroy one another and it\u2019s not even me who manages to do anything at all.</p><p>It\u2019s Kenji.</p><p>He grabs both boys by the arms and tries to pry them apart but the sudden sound that rips through his throat is a torture and a terror I wish I could tear out of my skull.</p><p>He\u2019s down.</p><p>He\u2019s on the ground.</p><p>He\u2019s choking, gasping, writhing on the floor until he goes limp, until he can hardly breathe and then he\u2019s still, too still, and I think I\u2019m screaming, I keep touching my lips to see where this sound is coming from and I\u2019m on my knees. I\u2019m trying to shake him awake but he\u2019s not moving, he\u2019s not responding and I have no idea what just happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have no idea if Kenji is dead.</p><p>FIFTY-SEVEN</p><p>I\u2019m definitely screaming.</p><p>Arms are pulling me up off the floor and I hear voices and sounds I don\u2019t care to recognize because all I know is that this can\u2019t happen, not to Kenji, not to my funny, complicated friend who keeps secrets behind his smiles and I\u2019m ripping away from the hands holding me back and I\u2019m blind, I\u2019m bolting into the dining hall and a hundred blurry faces blend into the background because the only one I want to see is wearing a navy-blue blazer and headful of dreads tied into a ponytail.</p> <p>\u201cCastle!\u201d I\u2019m screaming. I\u2019m still screaming. I may have fallen to the floor, I\u2019m not sure, but I can tell my kneecaps are starting to hurt and I don\u2019t care I don\u2019t care I don\u2019t care\u2014\u201cCastle! It\u2019s Kenji\u2014he\u2019s\u2014please\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Castle run before.</p><p>He charges through the room at an inhuman speed, past me and into the hall. Everyone in the room is up, frantic, some shouting, panicked, and I\u2019m chasing Castle back into the tunnel and Kenji is still there. Still limp. Still.</p><p>Too still.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the girls?\u201d Castle is shouting. \u201cSomeone\u2014get the girls!\u201d He\u2019s cradling Kenji\u2019s head, trying to pull Kenji\u2019s heavy body into his arms and I\u2019ve never heard him like this before, not even when he talked about our hostages, not even when he talked about what Anderson has done to the civilians. I look around and see the members of Omega Point standing all around us, pain carved into their features and so many of them have already started crying, clutching at each other and I realize I never fully recognized Kenji. I didn\u2019t understand the reach of his authority. I\u2019d never really seen just how much he means to the people in this room.</p> <p>How much they love him.</p><p>I blink and Adam is one of 50 different people trying to help carry Kenji and now they\u2019re running, they\u2019re hoping against hope and someone is saying, \u201cThey\u2019ve gone to the medical wing! They\u2019re preparing a bed for him!\u201d And it\u2019s like a stampede, everyone rushing after them, trying to find out what\u2019s wrong and no one will look at me, no one will meet my eyes and I pull myself away, out of sight, around the corner, into the darkness. I taste the tears as they fall into my mouth, I count each salty drop because I can\u2019t understand what happened, how it happened, how this is even possible because I wasn\u2019t touching him, I couldn\u2019t have been touching him please please please I couldn\u2019t have touched him but then I freeze. Icicles form along my arms as I realize:</p><p>I\u2019m not wearing my gloves.</p><p>I forgot my gloves. I was in such a rush to get here tonight that I just jumped out of the shower and left my gloves in my room and it doesn\u2019t seem real, it doesn\u2019t seem possible that I could\u2019ve done this, that I could\u2019ve forgotten, that I could be responsible for yet another life lost and I just I just I just</p><p>I fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cJuliette.\u201d</p> <p>I look up. I jump up.</p><p>I say, \u201cStay away from me\u201d and I\u2019m shaking, I\u2019m trying to push the tears back but I\u2019m shrinking into nothingness because I\u2019m thinking this must be it. This must be my ultimate punishment. I deserve this pain, I deserve to have killed one of my only friends in the world and I want to shrivel up and disappear forever. \u201cGo away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliette, please,\u201d Warner says, coming closer. His face is cast in shadow. This tunnel is only half lit and I don\u2019t know where it leads. All I know is that I do not want to be alone with Warner.</p><p>Not now. Not ever again.</p><p>\u201cI said stay away from me.\u201d My voice is trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you. Please\u2014just leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t abandon you like this!\u201d he says. \u201cNot when you\u2019re crying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t understand that emotion,\u201d I snap at him. \u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t care because killing people means nothing to you!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s breathing hard. Too fast. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about Kenji!\u201d I explode. \u201cI did that! It\u2019s my fault! It\u2019s my fault you and Adam were fighting and it\u2019s my fault Kenji came out to stop you and it\u2019s my fault\u2014\u201d My voice breaks once, twice. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault he\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><p>Warner\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m agony.</p><p>I\u2019m sobbing about what I\u2019ve done and how of course he\u2019s dead, didn\u2019t you see him, he wasn\u2019t even moving and I killed him and Warner remains utterly silent. He doesn\u2019t say a single thing as I hurl awful, horrible insults at him and accuse him of being too coldhearted to understand what it\u2019s like to grieve. I don\u2019t even realize he\u2019s pulled me into his arms until I\u2019m nestled against his chest and I don\u2019t fight it. I don\u2019t fight it at all. I cling to him because I need this warmth, I miss feeling strong arms around me and I\u2019m only just beginning to realize how quickly I came to rely on the healing properties of an excellent hug.</p><p>How desperately I\u2019ve missed this.</p><p>And he just holds me. He smooths back my hair, he runs a gentle hand down my back, and I hear his heart beat a strange, crazy beat that sounds far too fast to be human.</p><p>His arms are wrapped entirely around me when he says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill him, love.\u201d</p><p>And I say, \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t see what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are misunderstanding the situation entirely. You didn\u2019t do anything to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head against his chest. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you. I know it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>I pull back. Look up into his eyes. \u201cHow can you know something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you who hurt Kenji. It was me.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-EIGHT</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Warner says, \u201cthough he is severely injured. I suspect they should be able to revive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u201d\u2014I\u2019m panicking, panicking in my bones\u2014\u201cwhat are you talking about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Warner says. \u201cSit down. I\u2019ll explain.\u201d He folds himself onto the floor and pats the place beside him. I don\u2019t know what else to do and my legs are now officially too shaky to stand on their own.</p><p>My limbs spill onto the ground, both our backs against the wall, his right side and my left side divided only by a thin inch of air.</p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3 seconds pass.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe Castle when he told me I might have a ... a gift,\u201d Warner says. His voice is pitched so low that I have to strain to hear it even though I\u2019m only inches away. \u201cA part of me hoped he was trying to drive me mad for his own benefit.\u201d A small sigh. \u201cBut it did make a bit of sense, if I really thought about it. Castle told me about Kent, too,\u201d Warner says. \u201cAbout how he can touch you and how they\u2019ve discovered why. For a moment I wondered if perhaps I had a similar ability. One just as pathetic. Equally as useless.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI was extremely reluctant to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a useless ability,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He turns to face me. Our shoulders are almost touching. \u201cTell me, love. What can he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can disable things. Abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, \u201cbut how will that ever help him? How could it ever help him to disable the powers of his own people? It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s wasteful. It won\u2019t help at all in this war.\u201d</p><p>I bristle. Decide to ignore that. \u201cWhat does any of this have to do with Kenji?\u201d</p><p>He turns away from me again. His voice is softer when he says, \u201cWould you believe me if I told you I could sense your energy right now? Sense the tone and weight of it?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, study his features and the earnest, tentative note in his voice. \u201cYes,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI think I\u2019d believe you.\u201d</p><p>Warner smiles in a way that seems to sadden him. \u201cI can sense,\u201d he says, taking a deep breath, \u201cthe emotions you\u2019re feeling most strongly. And because I know you, I\u2019m able to put those feelings into context. I know the fear you\u2019re feeling right now, for example, is not directed toward me, but toward yourself, and what you think you\u2019ve done to Kenji. I sense your hesitation\u2014your reluctance to believe that it wasn\u2019t your fault. I feel your sadness, your grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can really feel that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He nods without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI never knew that was possible,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either\u2014I wasn\u2019t aware of it,\u201d he says. \u201cNot for a very long time. I actually thought it was normal to be so acutely aware of human emotions. I thought perhaps I was more perceptive than most. It\u2019s a big factor in why my father allowed me to take over Sector 45,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBecause I have an uncanny ability to tell whenever someone is hiding something, or feeling guilty, or, most importantly, lying.\u201d A pause. \u201cThat,\u201d he says, \u201cand because I\u2019m not afraid to deliver consequences if the occasion calls for it.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until Castle suggested there might be something more to me that I really began to analyze it. I nearly lost my mind.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI kept going over it, thinking of ways to prove and disprove his theories. Even with all my careful deliberation, I dismissed it. And while I am a bit sorry\u2014for your sake, not for mine\u2014that Kenji had to be stupid enough to interfere tonight, I think it was actually quite serendipitous. Because now I finally have proof. Proof that I was wrong. That Castle,\u201d he says, \u201cwas right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took your Energy,\u201d he tells me, \u201cand I didn\u2019t know I could. I could feel it all very vividly when the four of us connected. Adam was inaccessible\u2014which, by the way, explains why I never suspected him of being disloyal. His emotions were always hidden; always blocked off. I was naive and assumed he was merely robotic, devoid of any real personality or interests. He eluded me and it was my own fault. I trusted myself too much to be able to anticipate a flaw in my system.\u201d</p><p>And I want to say, Adam\u2019s ability isn\u2019t so useless after all, is it?</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAnd Kenji,\u201d Warner says after a moment. He rubs his forehead. Laughs a little. \u201cKenji was ... very smart. A lot smarter than I gave him credit for\u2014which, as it turns out, was exactly his tactic. Kenji,\u201d he says, blowing out a breath, \u201cwas careful to be an obvious threat as opposed to a discreet one.</p><p>\u201cHe was always getting into trouble\u2014demanding extra portions at meals, fighting with the other soldiers, breaking curfew. He broke simple rules in order to draw attention to himself. In order to trick me into seeing him as an irritant and nothing more. I always felt there was something off about him, but I attributed it to his loud, raucous behavior and his inability to follow rules. I dismissed him as a poor soldier. Someone who would never be promoted. Someone who would always be recognized as a waste of time.\u201d He shakes his head. Raises his eyebrows at the ground. \u201cBrilliant,\u201d he says, looking almost impressed. \u201cIt was brilliant. His only mistake,\u201d Warner adds after a moment, \u201cwas being too openly friendly with Kent. And that mistake nearly cost him his life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo\u2014what? You were trying to finish him off tonight?\u201d I\u2019m still so confused, trying to make an attempt to refocus the conversation. \u201cDid you hurt him on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose.\u201d Warner shakes his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually know what I was doing. Not at first. I\u2019ve only ever just sensed Energy; I never knew I could take it. But I touched yours simply by touching you\u2014there was so much adrenaline among the group of us that yours practically threw itself at me. And when Kenji grabbed my arm,\u201d he says, \u201cyou and I, we were still connected. And I ... somehow I managed to redirect your power in his direction. It was quite accidental but I felt it happen. I felt your power rush into me. Rush out of me.\u201d He looks up. Meets my eyes. \u201cIt was the most extraordinary thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d</p><p>I think I\u2019d fall down if I weren\u2019t already sitting.</p><p>\u201cSo you can take\u2014you can just take other people\u2019s powers?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t hurt Kenji on purpose?\u201d</p><p>Warner laughs, looks at me like I\u2019ve just said something highly amusing. \u201cIf I had wanted to kill him, I would have. And I wouldn\u2019t have needed such a complicated setup to accomplish it. I\u2019m not interested in theatrics,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I want to hurt someone, I won\u2019t require much more than my own two hands.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned into silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually amazed,\u201d Warner says, \u201chow you manage to contain so much without finding ways to release the excess. I could barely hold on to it. The transfer from my body to Kenji\u2019s was not only immediate, it was necessary. I couldn\u2019t tolerate the intensity for very long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t hurt you?\u201d I blink at him, astonished. \u201cAt all? My power just goes into you? You just absorb it?\u201d</p><p>He nods. Says, \u201cWould you like to see?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m saying yes with my head and my eyes and my lips and I\u2019ve never been more terrified to be excited in my life. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says, so quietly. \u201cJust touch me.\u201d</p><p>My heart is beating pounding racing running through my body and I\u2019m trying to focus. Trying to stay calm. This is going to be fine, I say to myself. It\u2019s going to be fine. It\u2019s just an experiment. There\u2019s no need to get so excited about being able to touch someone again, I keep saying to myself.</p><p>But oh, I am so, so excited.</p> <p>He holds out his bare hand.</p><p>I take it.</p><p>I wait to feel something, some feeling of weakness, some depletion of my Energy, some sign that a transfer is taking place from my body to his but I feel nothing at all. I feel exactly the same. But I watch Warner\u2019s face as his eyes close and he makes an effort to focus. Then I feel his hand tighten around mine and he gasps.</p><p>His eyes fly open and his free hand goes right through the floor.</p><p>I jerk back, panicked. I\u2019m tipping sideways, my hands catching me from behind. I must be hallucinating. I must be hallucinating the hole in the floor not 4 inches from where Warner is still sitting on the ground. I must\u2019ve been hallucinating when I saw his resting palm press too hard and go right through. I must be hallucinating everything. All of this. I\u2019m dreaming and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to wake up soon. That must be it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-how,\u201d I stammer, \u201chow did you d-do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, love, it\u2019s all right, I promise\u2014it\u2019s new for me, too\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy\u2014my power? It doesn\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t feel any pain?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cOn the contrary. It\u2019s the most incredible rush of adrenaline\u2014it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever known. I actually feel a little light-headed,\u201d he says, \u201cin the best possible way.\u201d He laughs. Smiles to himself. Drops his head into his hands. Looks up. \u201cCan we do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say too quickly.</p><p>He\u2019s grinning. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I just, I still can\u2019t believe you can touch me. That you really\u2014I mean\u201d\u2014I\u2019m shaking my head\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s no catch? There are no conditions? You touch me and no one gets hurt? And not only does no one get hurt, but you enjoy it? You actually like the way it feels to touch me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s blinking at me now, staring like he\u2019s not sure how to answer my question.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s a breathless word.</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>I can hear how hard his heart is beating. I can actually hear it in the silence between us. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>\u201cYou never have to be afraid of touching me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt me. It can only give me strength.\u201d</p><p>I want to laugh one of those strange, high-pitched, delusional laughs that signals the end of a person\u2019s sanity. Because this world, I think, has a terrible, terrible sense of humor. It always seems to be laughing at me. At my expense. Making my life infinitely more complicated all the time. Ruining all of my best-laid plans by making every choice so difficult. Making everything so confusing.</p><p>I can\u2019t touch the boy I love.</p><p>But I can use my touch to strengthen the boy who tried to kill the one I love.</p><p>No one, I want to tell the world, is laughing.</p><p>\u201cWarner.\u201d I look up, hit with a sudden realization. \u201cYou have to tell Castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has to know! It would explain Kenji\u2019s situation and it could help us tomorrow! You\u2019ll be fighting with us and it might come in handy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warner laughs.</p><p>He laughs and laughs and laughs, his eyes brilliant, gleaming even in this dim light. He laughs until it\u2019s just a hard breath, until it becomes a gentle sigh, until it dissolves into an amused smile. And then he grins at me until he\u2019s grinning to himself, until he looks down and his gaze drops to my hand, the one lying limp on my lap and he hesitates just a moment before his fingers brush the soft, thin skin covering my knuckles.</p><p>I don\u2019t breathe.</p><p>I don\u2019t speak.</p><p>I don\u2019t even move.</p><p>He\u2019s hesitant, like he\u2019s waiting to see if I\u2019ll pull away and I should, I know I should but I don\u2019t. So he takes my hand. Studies it. Runs his fingers along the lines of my palm, the creases at my joints, the sensitive spot between my thumb and index finger and his touch is so tender, so delicate and gentle and it feels so good it hurts, it actually hurts. And it\u2019s too much for my heart to handle right now.</p><p>I snatch back my hand in a jerky, awkward motion, face flushing, pulse tripping.</p><p>Warner doesn\u2019t flinch. He doesn\u2019t look up. He doesn\u2019t even seem surprised. He only stares at his now empty hands as he speaks. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, his voice both strange and soft, \u201cI think Castle is little more than an optimistic fool. He tries too hard to welcome too many people and it\u2019s going to backfire, simply because it\u2019s impossible to please everyone.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe is the perfect example of the kind of person who doesn\u2019t know the rules of this game. Someone who thinks too much with his heart and clings too desperately to some fantastical notion of hope and peace. It will never help him,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIn fact, it will be the end of him, I\u2019m quite sure of it.</p><p>\u201cBut there is something about you,\u201d Warner says, \u201csomething about the way you hope for things.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s so naive that it\u2019s oddly endearing. You like to believe people when they speak,\u201d he says. \u201cYou prefer kindness.\u201d He smiles, just a little. Looks up. \u201cIt amuses me.\u201d</p><p>All at once I feel like an idiot. \u201cYou\u2019re not fighting with us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Warner is smiling openly now, his eyes so warm. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to leave.\u201d I\u2019m numb.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014how can you leave? You told Castle you\u2019re going to fight with us tomorrow\u2014does he know you\u2019re leaving? Does anyone know?\u201d I ask him, searching his face. \u201cWhat do you have planned? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Warner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliette,\u201d he whispers, and his eyes are urgent, tortured all of a sudden. \u201cI need to ask you somethi\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone is bolting down the tunnels.</p><p>Calling my name.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>FIFTY-NINE</p><p>I jump up, frantic, and tell Warner I\u2019ll be right back.</p><p>I\u2019m saying don\u2019t leave yet, don\u2019t go anywhere just yet I\u2019ll be right back but I don\u2019t wait for his response because I\u2019m on my feet and I\u2019m running toward the lighted hallway and I almost slam right into Adam. He steadies me and pulls me tight, so close, always forgetting not to touch me like this and he\u2019s anxious and he says, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere,\u201d and \u201cI thought you\u2019d come down to the medical wing,\u201d and \u201cit wasn\u2019t your fault, I hope you know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>It keeps hitting me in the face, in the skull, in the spine, this knowledge of just how much I care about him. How much I know he cares about me. Being close to him like this is a painful reminder of everything I had to force myself to walk away from. I take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I ask, \u201cis Kenji okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not conscious yet,\u201d he says to me, \u201cbut Sara and Sonya think he\u2019s going to be okay. They\u2019re going to stay up with him all night, just to be sure he makes it through in one piece.\u201d A pause. \u201cNo one knows what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d His eyes lock mine in place. \u201cYou know that, right? You didn\u2019t even touch him. I know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And even though I open my mouth a million times to say, It was Warner. Warner did it. He\u2019s the one who did this to Kenji, you have to get him and catch him and stop him he is lying to all of you! He\u2019s going to escape tomorrow! I don\u2019t say any of it and I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m protecting him.</p><p>I think part of me is afraid to say the words out loud, afraid to make them true. I still don\u2019t know whether or not Warner is really going to leave or even how he\u2019s going to escape; I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible. And I don\u2019t know if I can tell anyone about Warner\u2019s ability yet; I don\u2019t think I want to explain to Adam that while he and the rest of Omega Point were tending to Kenji, I was hiding in a tunnel with Warner\u2014our enemy and hostage\u2014holding his hand and testing out his new power.</p><p>I wish I weren\u2019t so confused.</p><p>I wish my interactions with Warner would stop making me feel so guilty. Every moment I spend with him, every conversation I have with him makes me feel like I\u2019ve somehow betrayed Adam, even though technically we\u2019re not even together anymore. My heart still feels so tied to Adam; I feel bound to him, like I need to make up for already having hurt him so much. I don\u2019t want to be the reason for the pain in his eyes, not again, and somehow I\u2019ve decided that keeping secrets is the only way to keep him from getting hurt. But deep down, I know this can\u2019t be right. Deep down, I know it could end badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I don\u2019t know what else to do.</p><p>\u201cJuliette?\u201d Adam is still holding me tight, still so close and warm and wonderful. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m not sure what makes me ask it, but suddenly I need to know.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to tell him?\u201d</p> <p>Adam pulls back, just an inch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner.

I\u2019d like to be able to watch him die and feel no sympathy, no remorse. He\u2019s the textbook definition of a monster,\u201d Adam says to me. \u201cJust like my dad. And I\u2019ll drop dead before I recognize him as my brother.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly I\u2019m feeling like I might fall over.</p><p>Adam grabs my waist, tries to focus my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re still in shock,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to get you something to eat\u2014or maybe some water\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I allow myself to enjoy one last second in his arms before I break away, needing to breathe. I keep trying to convince myself that Adam is right, that Warner has done terrible, awful things and I shouldn\u2019t forgive him. I shouldn\u2019t smile at him. I shouldn\u2019t even talk to him. And then I want to scream because I don\u2019t think my brain can handle the split personality I seem to be developing lately.</p><p>I tell Adam I need a minute. I tell him I need to stop by the bathroom before we head over to the medical wing and he says okay, he says he\u2019ll wait for me.</p><p>He says he\u2019ll wait for me until I\u2019m ready.</p><p>And I tiptoe back into the dark tunnel to tell Warner that I have to leave, that I won\u2019t be coming back after all, but when I squint into the darkness I can\u2019t see a thing.</p> <p>I look around.</p><p>He\u2019s already gone.</p><p>SIXTY</p><p>We don\u2019t have to do anything at all to die.</p><p>We can hide in a cupboard under the stairs our whole life and it\u2019ll still find us. Death will show up wearing an invisible cloak and it will wave a magic wand and whisk us away when we least expect it. It will erase every trace of our existence on this earth and it will do all this work for free. It will ask for nothing in return. It will take a bow at our funeral and accept the accolades for a job well done and then it will disappear.</p><p>Living is a little more complex. There\u2019s one thing we always have to do.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>In and out, every single day in every hour minute and moment we must inhale whether we like it or not. Even as we plan to asphyxiate our hopes and dreams still we breathe. Even as we wither away and sell our dignity to the man on the corner we breathe. We breathe when we\u2019re wrong, we breathe when we\u2019re right, we breathe even as we slip off the ledge toward an early grave. It cannot be undone.</p> <p>So I breathe.</p><p>I count all the steps I\u2019ve climbed toward the noose hanging from the ceiling of my existence and I count out the number of times I\u2019ve been stupid and I run out of numbers.</p><p>Kenji almost died today.</p><p>Because of me.</p><p>It\u2019s still my fault that Adam and Warner were fighting. It\u2019s still my fault that I stepped between them. It\u2019s still my fault that Kenji felt the need to pull them apart and if I hadn\u2019t been caught in the middle Kenji never would\u2019ve been hurt.</p><p>And I\u2019m standing here. Staring at him.</p><p>He\u2019s barely breathing and I\u2019m begging him. I\u2019m begging him to do the one thing that matters. The only thing that matters. I need him to hold on but he\u2019s not listening. He can\u2019t hear me and I need him to be okay. I need him to pull through. I need him to breathe.</p><p>I need him.</p><p>Castle didn\u2019t have much more to say.</p><p>Everyone was standing around, some wedged into the medical wing, others standing on the other side of the glass, watching silently. Castle gave a small speech about how we need to stick together, how we\u2019re a family and if we don\u2019t have each other then who do we have? He said we\u2019re all scared, sure, but now is the time for us to support one another. Now is the time to band together and fight back. Now is the time, he said, for us to take back our world.</p><p>\u201cNow is the time for us to live,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll postpone tomorrow\u2019s departure just long enough for everyone to have a final breakfast together. We cannot go into battle divided,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have faith in ourselves and in each other. Take a little more time in the morning to find peace with yourselves. After breakfast we leave. As one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kenji?\u201d someone asked, and I was startled to hear the familiar voice.</p><p>James. He was standing there with his fists clenched, tearstains streaked across his face, his bottom lip trembling even as he fought to hide the pain in his voice.</p><p>My heart split clean in half.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Castle asked him.</p><p>\u201cWill he fight tomorrow?\u201d James demanded, sniffing back the last of his tears, fists beginning to shake. \u201cHe wants to fight tomorrow. He told me he wants to fight tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Castle\u2019s face creased as it pulled together. He took his time responding. \u201cI ... I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t think Kenji will be able to join us tomorrow. But perhaps,\u201d he said, \u201cperhaps you could stay and keep him company?\u201d</p><p>James didn\u2019t respond. He only stared at Castle. Then he stared at Kenji. He blinked several times before pushing through the crowd to clamber onto Kenji\u2019s bed. Burrowed into his side and promptly fell asleep.</p><p>We all took that as our cue to leave.</p><p>Well. Everyone but me, Adam, Castle, and the girls. I find it interesting that everyone refers to Sonya and Sara as \u201cthe girls,\u201d as if they\u2019re the only girls in this entire place. They\u2019re not. I don\u2019t even know how they got that nickname and while a part of me wants to know, another part of me is too exhausted to ask.</p><p>I curl into my seat and stare at Kenji, who is struggling to breathe in and out. I prop my head up on my fist, fighting the sleep weaving its way into my consciousness. I don\u2019t deserve to sleep. I should stay here all night and watch over him. I would, too, if I could touch him without destroying his life.</p><p>\u201cYou two should really get to bed.\u201d</p><p>I jolt awake, jerking up, not realizing I\u2019d actually dozed off for a second. Castle is staring at me with a soft, strange look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a big day tomorrow. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk her out,\u201d Adam says. He moves to stand up. \u201cAnd then I can be right back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Castle cuts him off. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll be fine with the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you need to sleep more than we do,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Castle smiles a sad smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be getting any sleep tonight.\u201d</p><p>He turns to look at Kenji, his eyes crinkling in happiness or pain or something in between. \u201cDid you know,\u201d Castle says to us, \u201cthat I\u2019ve known Kenji since he was a small boy? I found him shortly after I\u2019d built Omega Point. He grew up here. When I first met him he was living in an old shopping cart he\u2019d found on the side of the highway.\u201d Castle pauses. \u201cHas he ever told you that story?\u201d</p><p>Adam sits back down. I\u2019m suddenly wide-awake. \u201cNo,\u201d we both say at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014forgive me.\u201d Castle shakes his head. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t waste your time with these things,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there\u2019s too much on my mind right now. I\u2019m forgetting which stories to keep to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014please\u2014I want to know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Castle stares into his hands. Smiles a little. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to it,\u201d he says. \u201cKenji has never talked to me about what happened to his parents, and I try not to ask. All he ever had was a name and an age. I stumbled upon him quite accidentally. He was just a boy sitting in a shopping cart. Far from civilization. It was the dead of winter and he was wearing nothing but an old T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants a few sizes too big for him. He looked like he was freezing, like he could use a few meals and place to sleep. I couldn\u2019t just walk away,\u201d Castle says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just leave him there. So, I asked him if he was hungry.\u201d</p><p>He stops, remembering.</p><p>\u201cKenji didn\u2019t say a single thing for at least thirty seconds. He simply stared at me. I almost walked away, thinking I\u2019d frightened him. But then, finally, he reached out, grabbed my hand, placed it in his palm and shook it. Very hard. And then he said, \u2018Hello, sir. My name is Kenji Kishimoto and I am nine years old. It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u2019\u201d Castle laughs out loud, his eyes shining with an emotion that betrays his smiles. \u201cHe must\u2019ve been starving, the poor kid. He always,\u201d Castle says, blinking up at the ceiling now, \u201che always had a strong, determined sort of personality. So much pride.</p><p>Unstoppable, that boy.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re all silent for a while.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea,\u201d Adam says, \u201cthat you two were so close.\u201d</p><p>Castle stands up. Looks around at us and smiles too brightly, too tightly. Says, \u201cYes. Well, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be just fine. He\u2019ll be just fine in the morning, so you two should definitely get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you su\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please, get to bed. I\u2019ll be fine here with the girls, I promise.\u201d</p><p>So we get up. We get up and Adam manages to lift James from Kenji\u2019s bed and into his arms without waking him. And we walk out.</p><p>I glance back.</p><p>I see Castle fall into his chair and drop his head into his hands and rest his elbows on his knees. I see him reach out a shaky hand to rest on Kenji\u2019s leg and I wonder at how much I still don\u2019t know about these people I live with. How little I\u2019ve allowed myself to become a part of their world.</p><p>And I know I want to change that.</p><p>SIXTY-ONE</p><p>Adam walks me to my room.</p><p>It\u2019s been lights-out for about an hour now, and, with the exception of faint emergency lights glowing every few feet, everything is, quite literally, out. It\u2019s absolute blackness, and even still, the guards on patrol manage to spot us only to warn us to go straight to our separate quarters.</p><p>Adam and I don\u2019t really speak until we reach the mouth of the women\u2019s wing. There\u2019s so much tension, so many unspoken worries between us. So many thoughts about today and tomorrow and the many weeks we\u2019ve already spent together. So much we don\u2019t know about what\u2019s already happening to us and what will eventually happen to us. Just looking at him, being so close and being so far away from him\u2014it\u2019s painful.</p><p>I want so desperately to bridge the gap between our bodies. I want to press my lips to every part of him and I want to savor the scent of his skin, the strength in his limbs, in his heart. I want to wrap myself in the warmth and reassurance I\u2019ve come to rely on.</p><p>But.</p><p>In other ways, I\u2019ve come to realize that being away from him has forced me to rely on myself. To allow myself to be scared and to find my own way through it. I\u2019ve had to train without him, fight without him, face Warner and Anderson and the chaos of my mind all without him by my side. And I feel different now. I feel stronger since putting space between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I don\u2019t know what that means.</p><p>All I know is that it\u2019ll never be safe for me to rely on someone else again, to need constant reassurance of who I am and who I might someday be. I can love him, but I can\u2019t depend on him to be my backbone. I can\u2019t be my own person if I constantly require someone else to hold me together.</p><p>My mind is a mess. Every single day I\u2019m confused, uncertain, worried I\u2019m going to make a new mistake, worried I\u2019m going to lose control, worried I\u2019m going to lose myself. But it\u2019s something I have to work through. Because for the rest of my life, I\u2019ll always, always be stronger than everyone around me.</p><p>But at least I\u2019ll never have to be scared anymore.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Adam asks, finally dispelling the silence between us. I look up to find that his eyes are worried, trying to read me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYes. I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d I offer him a tight smile, but it feels wrong to be this close to him without being able to touch him at all.</p><p>Adam nods. Hesitates. Says, \u201cIt\u2019s been one hell of a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019ll be one hell of day tomorrow, too,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says quietly, still looking at me like he\u2019s trying to find something, like he\u2019s searching for an answer to an unspoken question and I wonder if he sees something different in my eyes now. He grins a small grin. Says, \u201cI should probably go,\u201d and nods at James bundled in his arms.</p> <p>I nod, not sure what else to do. What to say.</p><p>So much is uncertain.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this,\u201d Adam says, answering my silent thoughts. \u201cAll of it. We\u2019re going to be okay. And Kenji will be fine.\u201d He touches my shoulder, allows his fingers to trail down my arm and stop just short of my bare hand.</p><p>I close my eyes, try to savor the moment.</p><p>And then his fingers graze my skin and my eyes fly open, my heart racing in my chest.</p><p>He\u2019s staring at me like he might\u2019ve done much more than touch my hand if he weren\u2019t holding James against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find a way,\u201d he says to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to find a way to make this work. I promise. I just need some time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m afraid to speak. Afraid of what I might say, what I might do; afraid of the hope ballooning inside of me.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d I say.</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to think of hope as a dangerous, terrifying thing.</p><p>SIXTY-TWO</p><p>I\u2019m so tired when I walk into my room that I\u2019m only half conscious as I change into the tank top and pajama pants I sleep in. They were a gift from Sara. It was her recommendation that I change out of my suit while I sleep; she and Sonya think it\u2019s important to give my skin direct contact with fresh air.</p> <p>I\u2019m about to climb under the covers when I hear a soft knock at my door.</p><p>Adam</p><p>is my first thought.</p><p>But then I open the door. And promptly close it.</p><p>I must be dreaming.</p><p>\u201cJuliette?\u201d</p><p>Oh. God.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I shout-whisper through the closed door.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now. You need to speak with me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s important,\u201d Warner says. \u201cI heard Kent telling you that those twin girls would be in the medical wing tonight and I figured it would be a good time for us to speak privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard my conversation with Adam?\u201d I begin to panic, worried he might\u2019ve heard too much.</p><p>\u201cI have zero interest in your conversation with Kent,\u201d he says, his tone suddenly flat, neutral. \u201cI left just as soon as I heard you\u2019d be alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I exhale. \u201cHow did you even get in here without guards stopping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should open the door so I can explain.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cPlease, love, I\u2019m not going to do anything to hurt you. You should know that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you five minutes. Then I have to sleep, okay? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. Crack the door open. Peek at him.</p><p>He\u2019s smiling. Looking entirely unapologetic.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>He slips past me and sits down directly on my bed.</p><p>I close the door, make my way across the room from him, and sit on Sonya\u2019s bed, suddenly all too aware of what I\u2019m wearing and how incredibly exposed I feel. I cross my arms over the thin cotton clinging to my chest\u2014even though I\u2019m sure he can\u2019t actually see me\u2014and make an effort to ignore the cold chill in the air. I always forget just how much the suit does to regulate my body temperature so far belowground.</p><p>Winston was a genius to design it for me.</p><p>Winston.</p><p>Winston and Brendan.</p><p>Oh how I hope they\u2019re okay.</p><p>\u201cSo ... what is it?\u201d I ask Warner. I can\u2019t see a single thing in this darkness; I can hardly make out the form of his silhouette. \u201cYou just left earlier, in the tunnel. Even though I asked you to wait.\u201d</p><p>A few beats of silence.</p><p>\u201cYour bed is so much more comfortable than mine,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYou have a pillow. And an actual blanket?\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re living like a queen in these quarters. They treat you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarner.\u201d I\u2019m feeling nervous now. Anxious. Worried. Shivering a little and not from the cold. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>A tight breath.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>The world stops spinning.</p><p>\u201cWhen I leave tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cI want you to come with me. I never had a chance to finish talking to you earlier and I thought asking you in the morning would be bad timing all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come with you.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m still breathing.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to run away with you.\u201d This can\u2019t possibly be happening.</p><p>A pause. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d I\u2019m shaking my head over and over and over again. \u201cYou really have lost your mind.\u201d</p><p>I can almost hear him smile in the dark. \u201cWhere\u2019s your face? I feel like I\u2019m talking to a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>I stand up. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t see you,\u201d he says, but his voice is suddenly much closer than it was before. \u201cCan you see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lie, and I\u2019m trying to ignore the immediate tension, the electricity humming in the air between us.</p><p>I take a step back.</p><p>I feel his hands on my arms, I feel his skin against my skin and I\u2019m holding my breath. I don\u2019t move an inch. I don\u2019t say a word as his hands drop to my waist, to the thin material making a poor attempt to cover my body. His fingers graze the soft skin of my lower back, right underneath the hem of my shirt and I\u2019m losing count of the number of times my heart skips a beat.</p><p>I\u2019m struggling to get oxygen in my lungs.</p><p>I\u2019m struggling to keep my hands to myself.</p><p>\u201cIs it even possible,\u201d he whispers, \u201cthat you can\u2019t feel this fire between us?\u201d His hands are traveling up my arms again, his touch so light, his fingers slipping under the straps of my shirt and it\u2019s ripping me apart, it\u2019s aching in my core, it\u2019s a pulse beating in every inch of my body and I\u2019m trying to convince myself not to lose my head when I feel the straps fall down and everything stops.</p><p>The air is still.</p><p>My skin is scared.</p><p>Even my thoughts are whispering.</p><p>2</p><p>4</p><p>6 seconds I forget to breathe.</p><p>Then I feel his lips against my shoulder, soft and scorching and tender, so gentle I could almost believe it\u2019s the kiss of a breeze and not a boy.</p><p>Again.</p><p>This time on my collarbone and it\u2019s like I\u2019m dreaming, reliving the caress of a forgotten memory and it\u2019s like an ache looking to be soothed, it\u2019s a steaming pan thrown in ice water, it\u2019s a flushed cheek pressed to a cool pillow on a hot hot hot night and I\u2019m thinking yes, I\u2019m thinking this, I\u2019m thinking thank you thank you thank you</p><p>before I remember his mouth is on my body and I\u2019m doing nothing to stop him.</p><p>He pulls back.</p><p>My eyes refuse to open.</p><p>His finger t-touches my bottom lip.</p><p>He traces the shape of my mouth, the curves the seam the dip and my lips part even though I asked them not to and he steps closer. I feel him so much closer, filling the air around me until there\u2019s nothing but him and his body heat, the smell of fresh soap and something unidentifiable, something sweet but not, something real and hot, something that smells like him, like it belongs to him, like he was poured into the bottle I\u2019m drowning in and I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m leaning into him, inhaling the scent of his neck until I find his fingers are no longer on my lips because his hands are around my waist and he says</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d and he whispers it, letter by letter he presses the word into my skin before he hesitates.</p><p>Then.</p><p>Softer.</p><p>His chest, heaving harder this time. His words, almost gasping this time. \u201cYou destroy me.\u201d</p><p>I am falling to pieces in his arms.</p><p>My fists are full of unlucky pennies and my heart is a jukebox demanding a few nickels and my head is flipping quarters heads or tails heads or tails heads or tails heads or tails</p><p>\u201cJuliette,\u201d he says, and he mouths the name, barely speaking at all, and he\u2019s pouring molten lava into my limbs and I never even knew I could melt straight to death.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he says. He says \u201cI want all of you. I want you inside and out and catching your breath and aching for me like I ache for you.\u201d He says it like it\u2019s a lit cigarette lodged in his throat, like he wants to dip me in warm honey and he says \u201cIt\u2019s never been a secret. I\u2019ve never tried to hide that from you. I\u2019ve never pretended I wanted anything less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you said you wanted f-friendship\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, he swallows, \u201cI did. I do. I do want to be your friend.\u201d He nods and I register the slight movement in the air between us. \u201cI want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. The one you take into your arms and into your bed and into the private world you keep trapped in your head. I want to be that kind of friend,\u201d he says. \u201cThe one who will memorize the things you say as well as the shape of your lips when you say them.

I want to know how to convince you to design a smile just for me.\u201d I feel his chest rising, falling, up and down and up and down and \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI do want to be your friend.\u201d He says \u201cI want to be your best friend in the entire world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t think.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe</p><p>\u201cI want so many things,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI want your mind.

His 4 fingers graze the side of my face, slowly, so slowly before they slip behind my head, caught in that in-between spot just above my neck. His thumb brushes the apple of my cheek.</p><p>He keeps looking at me, looking into my eyes for help, for guidance, for some sign of a protest like he\u2019s so sure I\u2019m going to start screaming or crying or running away but I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I could even if I wanted to because I don\u2019t want to. I want to stay here. Right here. I want to be paralyzed by this moment.</p><p>He moves closer, just an inch. His free hand reaches up to cup the other side of my face.</p><p>He\u2019s holding me like I\u2019m made of feathers.</p><p>He\u2019s holding my face and looking at his own hands like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s caught this bird who\u2019s always so desperate to fly away. His hands are shaking, just a little bit, just enough for me to feel the slight tremble against my skin. Gone is the boy with the guns and the skeletons in his closet. These hands holding me have never held a weapon. These hands have never touched death. These hands are perfect and kind and tender.</p><p>And he leans in, so carefully. Breathing and not breathing and hearts beating between us and he\u2019s so close, he\u2019s so close and I can\u2019t feel my legs anymore. I can\u2019t feel my fingers or the cold or the emptiness of this room because all I feel is him, everywhere, filling everything and he whispers</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He says \u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot me for this.\u201d</p><p>And he kisses me.</p><p>His lips are softer than anything I\u2019ve ever known, soft like a first snowfall, like biting into cotton candy, like melting and floating and being weightless in water. It\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s so effortlessly sweet.</p><p>And then it changes.</p><p>\u201cOh God\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kisses me again, this time stronger, desperate, like he has to have me, like he\u2019s dying to memorize the feel of my lips against his own. The taste of him is making me crazy; he\u2019s all heat and desire and peppermint and I want more. I\u2019ve just begun reeling him in, pulling him into me when he breaks away.</p><p>He\u2019s breathing like he\u2019s lost his mind and he\u2019s looking at me like something has broken inside of him, like he\u2019s woken up to find that his nightmares were just that, that they never existed, that it was all just a bad dream that felt far too real but now he\u2019s awake and he\u2019s safe and everything is going to be okay and</p> <p>I\u2019m falling.</p><p>I\u2019m falling apart and into his heart and I\u2019m a disaster.</p><p>He\u2019s searching me, searching my eyes for something, for yeses or nos or maybe a cue to keep going and all I want is to drown in him. I want him to kiss me until I collapse in his arms, until I\u2019ve left my bones behind and floated up into a new space that is entirely our own.</p><p>No words.</p><p>Just his lips.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Deep and urgent like he can\u2019t afford to take his time anymore, like there\u2019s so much he wants to feel and there aren\u2019t enough years to experience it all. His hands travel the length of my back, learning every curve of my figure and he\u2019s kissing my neck, my throat, the slope of my shoulders and his breaths come harder, faster, his hands suddenly threaded in my hair and I\u2019m spinning, I\u2019m dizzy, I\u2019m moving and reaching up behind his neck and clinging to him and it\u2019s ice-cold heat, it\u2019s an ache that attacks every cell in my body. It\u2019s a wanting so desperate, a need so exquisite that it rivals everything, every happy moment I ever thought I knew.</p><p>I\u2019m against the wall.</p><p>He\u2019s kissing me like the world is rolling right off a cliff, like he\u2019s trying to hang on and he\u2019s decided to hold on to me, like he\u2019s starving for life and love and he\u2019s never known it could ever feel this good to be close to someone. Like it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever felt anything but hunger and he doesn\u2019t know how to pace himself, doesn\u2019t know how to eat in small bites, doesn\u2019t know how to do anything anything anything in moderation.</p><p>My pants fall to the floor and his hands are responsible.</p><p>I\u2019m in his arms in my underwear and a tank top that\u2019s doing little to keep me decent and he pulls back just to look at me, to drink in the sight of me and he\u2019s saying \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful\u201d he\u2019s saying \u201cyou\u2019re so unbelievably beautiful\u201d and he pulls me into his arms again and he picks me up, he carries me to my bed and suddenly I\u2019m resting against my pillows and he\u2019s straddling my hips and his shirt is no longer on his body and I have no idea where it went. All I know is that I\u2019m looking up and into his eyes and I\u2019m thinking there isn\u2019t a single thing I would change about this moment.</p><p>He has a hundred thousand million kisses and he\u2019s giving them all to me.</p><p>He kisses my top lip.</p><p>He kisses my bottom lip.</p><p>He kisses just under my chin, the tip of my nose, the length of my forehead, both temples, my cheeks, all across my jawline. Then my neck, behind my ears, all the way down my throat and</p><p>my body. His entire form is moving down my figure, disappearing as he shifts downward and suddenly his chest is hovering above my hips; suddenly I can\u2019t see him anymore. I can only make out the top of his head, the curve of his shoulders, the unsteady rise and fall of his back as he inhales, exhales. He\u2019s running his hands down and around my bare thighs and up again, up past my ribs, around my lower back and down again, just past my hip bone. His fingers hook around the elastic waist of my underwear and I gasp.</p><p>His lips touch my bare stomach.</p><p>It\u2019s just a whisper of a kiss but something collapses in my skull. It\u2019s a feather-light brush of his mouth against my skin in a place I can\u2019t quite see. It\u2019s my mind speaking in a thousand different languages I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>And I realize he\u2019s working his way up my body.</p><p>He\u2019s leaving a trail of fire along my torso, one kiss after another, and I really don\u2019t think I can take much more of this; I really don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to survive this. There\u2019s a whimper building in my throat, begging to break free and I\u2019m locking my fingers in his hair and I\u2019m pulling him up, onto me, on top of me.</p><p>I need to kiss him.</p><p>I\u2019m reaching up only to slip my hands down his neck, over his chest and down the length of his body and I realize I\u2019ve never felt this, not to this degree, not like every moment is about to explode, like every breath could be our last, like every touch is enough to ignite the world. I\u2019m forgetting everything, forgetting the danger and the horror and the terror of tomorrow and I can\u2019t even remember why I\u2019m forgetting, what I\u2019m forgetting, that there\u2019s something I already seem to have forgotten. It\u2019s too hard to pay attention to anything but his eyes, burning; his skin, bare; his body, perfect.</p><p>He\u2019s completely unharmed by my touch.</p><p>He\u2019s careful not to crush me, his elbows propped up on either side of my head, and I think I must be smiling at him because he\u2019s smiling at me, but he\u2019s smiling like he might be petrified; he\u2019s breathing like he\u2019s forgotten he\u2019s supposed to, looking at me like he\u2019s not sure how to do this, hesitating like he\u2019s unsure how to let me see him like this. Like he has no idea how to be so vulnerable.</p><p>But here he is.</p><p>And here I am.</p><p>Warner\u2019s forehead is pressed against mine, his skin flushed with heat, his nose touching my own. He shifts his weight to one arm, uses his free hand to softly stroke my cheek, to cup my face like it\u2019s spun from glass and I realize I\u2019m still holding my breath and I can\u2019t even remember the last time I exhaled.</p><p>His eyes shift down to my lips and back again. His gaze is heavy, hungry, weighed down by emotion I never thought him capable of. I never thought he could be so full, so human, so real. But it\u2019s there. It\u2019s right there. Raw, written across his face like it\u2019s been ripped out of his chest.</p><p>He\u2019s handing me his heart.</p><p>And he says one word. He whispers one thing. So urgently.</p><p>He says, \u201cJuliette.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes.</p><p>He says, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to call me Warner anymore.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know me,\u201d he says, breathless, his fingers pushing a stray strand of hair away from my face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be Warner with you,\u201d he says. \u201cI want it to be different now. I want you to call me Aaron.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m about to say yes, of course, I completely understand, but there\u2019s something about this stretch of silence that confuses me; something about this moment and the feel of his name on my tongue that unlocks other parts of my brain and there\u2019s something there, something pushing and pulling at my skin and trying to remind me, trying to tell me and</p><p>it slaps me in the face</p><p>it punches me in the jaw</p><p>it dumps me right into the ocean.</p><p>\u201cAdam.\u201d</p><p>My bones are full of ice. My entire being wants to vomit. I\u2019m tripping out from under him and pulling myself away and I almost fall right to the floor and this feeling, this feeling, this overwhelming feeling of absolute self-loathing sticks in my stomach like the slice of a knife too sharp, too thick, too lethal to keep me standing and I\u2019m clutching at myself, I\u2019m trying not to cry and I\u2019m saying no no no this can\u2019t happen this can\u2019t be happening I love Adam, my heart is with Adam, I can\u2019t do this to him</p><p>and Warner looks like I\u2019ve shot him all over again, like I\u2019ve wedged a bullet in his heart with my bare hands and he gets to his feet but he can hardly stand. His frame is shaking and he\u2019s looking at me like he wants to say something but every time he tries to speak he fails. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry,\u201d I stammer, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014I never meant for this to happen\u2014I wasn\u2019t thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019s not listening.</p><p>He\u2019s shaking his head over and over and over and he\u2019s looking at his hands like he\u2019s waiting for the part where someone tells him this isn\u2019t real and he whispers \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me? Am I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m so sick, I\u2019m so confused, because I want him, I want him and I want Adam, too, and I want too much and I\u2019ve never felt more like a monster than I have tonight.</p> <p>The pain is so plain on his face and it\u2019s killing me.</p><p>I feel it. I feel it killing me.</p><p>I\u2019m trying so hard to look away, to forget, to figure out how to erase what just happened but all I can think is that life is like a broken tire swing, an unborn child, a fistful of wishbones. It\u2019s all possibility and potential, wrong and right steps toward a future we\u2019re not even guaranteed and I, I am so wrong. All of my steps are wrong, always wrong. I am the incarnation of error.</p><p>Because this never should have happened.</p><p>This was a mistake.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re choosing him?\u201d Warner asks, barely breathing, still looking as if he might fall over. \u201cIs that what just happened? You\u2019re choosing Kent over me? Because I don\u2019t think I understand what just happened and I need you to say something, I need you to tell me what the hell is happening to me right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I gasp. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not choosing anyone\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m n-not\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I am.

You are making a mistake,\u201d he says, his voice louder now. \u201cYou\u2019re scared. You don\u2019t want to make the difficult choice and you\u2019re running away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just d-don\u2019t want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you want to be with me!\u201d he explodes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God what am I saying I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m finding these words, where they\u2019re coming from or which tree I\u2019ve plucked them from. They just keep growing in my mouth and sometimes I bite down too hard on an adverb or a pronoun and sometimes the words are bitter, sometimes they\u2019re sweet, but right now everything tastes like romance and regret and liar liar pants on fire all the way down my throat.</p><p>Warner is still staring.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He struggles to rein in his temper and takes a step closer, so much closer, and I can see his face too clearly, I can see his lips too clearly, I can see the anger and the pain and the disbelief etched into his features and I\u2019m not so sure I should be standing anymore. I don\u2019t think my legs can carry me much longer.</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d I pluck another word from the tree lying in my mouth, lying lying lying on my lips.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m wrong.\u201d He says the sentence quietly, so, so quietly. \u201cI\u2019m wrong that you want me. That you want to be with me.\u201d His fingers graze my shoulders, my arms; his hands slide down the sides of my body, tracing every inch of me and I\u2019m pressing my mouth shut to keep the truth from falling out but I\u2019m failing and failing and failing because the only truth I know right now is that I\u2019m mere moments from losing my mind.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, love.\u201d His lips are whispering against my jaw. \u201cAm I blind, too?\u201d</p><p>I am actually going to die.</p> <p>\u201cI will not be your clown!\u201d He breaks away from me. \u201cI will not allow you to make a mockery of my feelings for you! I could respect your decision to shoot me, Juliette, but doing this\u2014doing\u2014doing what you just did\u2014\u201d He can hardly speak. He runs a hand across his face, both hands through his hair, looking like he wants to scream, to break something, like he\u2019s really, truly about to lose his mind. His voice is a rough whisper when he finally speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s the play of a coward,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought you were so much better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a coward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be honest with yourself!\u201d he says. \u201cBe honest with me! Tell me the truth!\u201d</p><p>My head is rolling around on the floor, spinning like a wooden top, circling around and around and around and I can\u2019t make it stop. I can\u2019t make the world stop spinning and my confusion is bleeding into guilt which quickly evolves into anger and suddenly it\u2019s bubbling raging rising to the surface and I look at him. I clench my shaking hands into fists. \u201cThe truth,\u201d I tell him, \u201cis that I never know what to think of you! Your actions, your behavior\u2014you\u2019re never consistent! You\u2019re horrible to me and then you\u2019re kind to me and you tell me you love me and then you hurt the ones I care most about!</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a liar,\u201d I snap, backing away from him. \u201cYou say you don\u2019t care about what you do\u2014you say you don\u2019t care about other people and what you\u2019ve done to them but I don\u2019t believe it. I think you\u2019re hiding. I think the real you is hiding underneath all of the destruction and I think you\u2019re better than this life you\u2019ve chosen for yourself. I think you can change. I think you could be different. And I feel sorry for you!\u201d</p><p>These words these stupid stupid words they won\u2019t stop spilling from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your horrible childhood. I\u2019m sorry you have such a miserable, worthless father and I\u2019m sorry no one ever took a chance on you. I\u2019m sorry for the terrible decisions you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry that you feel trapped by them, that you think of yourself as a monster who can\u2019t be changed. But most of all,\u201d I tell him, \u201cmost of all I\u2019m sorry that you have no mercy for yourself!\u201d</p><p>Warner flinches like I\u2019ve slapped him in the face.</p><p>The silence between us has slaughtered a thousand innocent seconds and when he finally speaks his voice is barely audible, raw with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou pity me.\u201d</p><p>My breath catches. My resolve wavers.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m some kind of broken project you can repair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve done!\u201d His words are furious as he steps forward. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve had to be a part of. You have no idea what I\u2019m capable of or how much mercy I deserve. I know my own heart,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI know who I am. Don\u2019t you dare pity me!\u201d</p><p>Oh my legs are definitely not working.</p><p>\u201cI thought you could love me for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought you would be the one person in this godforsaken world who would accept me as I am! I thought you, of all people, would understand.\u201d His face is right in front of mine when he says, \u201cI was wrong. I was so horribly, horribly wrong.\u201d</p><p>He backs away. He grabs his shirt and he turns to leave and I should let him go, I should let him walk out the door and out of my life but I can\u2019t, I catch his arm, I pull him back and I say, \u201cPlease\u2014that\u2019s not what I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>He spins around and he says, \u201cI do not want your sympathy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d he says, \u201cis a painful reminder of why I prefer to live among the lies.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stomach the look in his eyes, the wretched, awful pain he\u2019s making no effort to conceal. I don\u2019t know what to say to make this right. I don\u2019t know how to take my words back.</p><p>I know I don\u2019t want him to leave.</p><p>Not like this.</p><p>He looks as if he might speak; he changes his mind. He takes a tight breath, presses his lips together as if to stop the words from escaping and I\u2019m about to say something, I\u2019m about to try again when he pulls in a shaky breath, when he says, \u201cGood-bye, Juliette.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s killing me, I can\u2019t understand my sudden anxiety and I need to know, I have to say it, I have to ask the question that isn\u2019t a question and I say \u201cI won\u2019t see you again.\u201d</p><p>I watch him struggle to find the words, I watch him turn to me and turn away and for one split second I see what\u2019s happened, I see the difference in his eyes, the shine of emotion I never would\u2019ve dreamed him capable of and I know, I understand why he won\u2019t look at me and I can\u2019t believe it. I want to fall to the floor as he fights himself, fights to speak, fights to swallow back the tremor in his voice when he says, \u201cI certainly hope not.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s it.</p><p>He walks out.</p><p>I\u2019m split clean in half and he\u2019s gone.</p><p>He\u2019s gone forever.</p><p>SIXTY-THREE</p><p>Breakfast is an ordeal.</p><p>Warner has disappeared and he\u2019s left a trail of chaos in his wake.</p><p>No one knows how he escaped, how he managed to get out of his room and find his way out of here and everyone is blaming Castle. Everyone is saying he was stupid to trust Warner, to give him a chance, to believe he might have changed.</p><p>Angry is an insult to the level of aggression in here right now.</p><p>But I\u2019m not going to be the one to tell everyone that Warner was already out of his room last night. I\u2019m not going to be the one to tell them that he probably didn\u2019t have to do much to find the exit. I won\u2019t explain to them that he\u2019s not an idiot.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he figured it out easily enough. I\u2019m sure he found a way to get past the guards.</p><p>Now everyone is ready to fight, but for all the wrong reasons. They want to murder Warner: first for all he\u2019s done; second for betraying their trust. More frightening still, everyone is worried that he\u2019ll give away all of our most sensitive information. I have no idea what Warner managed to discover about this place before he left, but nothing that happens now can possibly be good.</p><p>No one has even touched their breakfasts.</p><p>We\u2019re all dressed, armed, ready to face what could be an almost instant death, and I\u2019m feeling little more than entirely numb. I didn\u2019t sleep at all last night, my heart and mind plagued and conflicted and I can\u2019t feel my limbs, I can\u2019t taste the food I\u2019m not eating and I can\u2019t see straight, I can\u2019t focus on the things I\u2019m supposed to be hearing. All I can think about are all the casualties and Warner\u2019s lips on my neck, his hands on my body, the pain and passion in his eyes and the many possible ways I could die today. I can only think about Warner touching me, kissing me, torturing me with his heart and Adam sitting beside me, not knowing what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>It probably won\u2019t even matter after today.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll be killed and maybe all the agony of these past 17 years will have been for naught. Maybe I\u2019ll just fall right off the face of the Earth, gone forever, and all of my adolescent angst will have been a ridiculous afterthought, a laughable memory.</p><p>But maybe I\u2019ll survive.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll survive and I\u2019ll have to face the consequences of my actions. I\u2019ll have to stop lying to myself; I\u2019ll have to actually make a decision.</p><p>I have to face the fact that I\u2019m battling feelings for someone who has no qualms about putting a bullet in another man\u2019s head. I have to consider the possibility that I might really be turning into a monster. A horrible, selfish creature who cares only about herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe Warner was right all along.</p><p>Maybe he and I really are perfect for each other.</p><p>Just about everyone has filed out of the dining hall. People are saying last-minute good-byes to the old and the young ones they\u2019re leaving behind. James and Adam had a lengthy good-bye just this morning. Adam and I have to head out in about 10 minutes.</p><p>\u201cWell damn. Who died?\u201d</p> <p>I spin around at the sound of his voice. Kenji is up. He\u2019s in this room. He\u2019s standing next to our table and he looks like he\u2019s about to fall right over but he\u2019s awake. He\u2019s alive.</p><p>He\u2019s breathing.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap.\u201d Adam is gaping. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to see you too, Kent.\u201d Kenji grins a crooked grin. He nods at me. \u201cYou ready to kick some ass today?\u201d</p><p>I tackle him.</p> <p>\u201cWHOA\u2014hey\u2014thank you, yeah\u2014that\u2019s\u2014uh\u2014\u201d He clears his throat. Tries to shift away from me and I flinch, pull back. I\u2019m covered everywhere except for my face; I\u2019m wearing my gloves and my reinforced knuckles, and my suit is zipped up to my neck. Kenji never usually shies away from me.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, maybe you should hold off on touching me for a little while, yeah?\u201d Kenji tries to smile, tries to make it sound like he\u2019s joking, but I feel the weight of his words, the tension and the sliver of fear he\u2019s trying so hard to hide. \u201cI\u2019m not too steady on my feet just yet.\u201d</p><p>I feel the blood rush out of me, leaving me weak in the knees and needing to sit down.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her,\u201d Adam says. \u201cYou know she didn\u2019t even touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that, actually,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m blaming her\u2014I\u2019m just saying maybe she\u2019s projecting and doesn\u2019t know it, okay? Because last I checked, I don\u2019t think we have any other explanations for what happened last night. It sure as hell wasn\u2019t you,\u201d he says to Adam, \u201cand shit, for all we know, Warner being able to touch Juliette could just be a fluke. We don\u2019t know anything about him yet.\u201d A pause. He looks around. \u201cRight? Unless Warner pulled some kind of magical rabbit out of his ass while I was busy being dead last night?\u201d</p><p>Adam scowls. I don\u2019t say a word.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. So. I think it\u2019s best if, unless absolutely necessary, I stay away.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cRight? No offense, right? I mean, I did nearly just die. I think you could cut me some slack.\u201d</p><p>I can hardly hear my own voice when I say, \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d I try to laugh. I try to figure out why I\u2019m not telling them about Warner. Why I\u2019m still protecting him. Probably because I\u2019m just as guilty as he is.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d Adam tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can barely stand up on your own!\u201d Adam says.</p><p>And he\u2019s right. Kenji is clearly leaning on the table for support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die out there than sit in here like some kind of idiot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKenji\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kenji says, cutting me off. \u201cSo I heard through the very loud grapevine that Warner got his ass the hell out of here last night. What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>Adam makes a strange sound. It\u2019s not quite a laugh. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWho even knows. I never thought it was a good idea to keep him hostage here. It was an even stupider idea to trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo first you insult my idea, and then you insult Castle\u2019s, huh?\u201d Kenji\u2019s eyebrow is cocked.</p><p>\u201cThey were bad calls,\u201d Adam says. \u201cBad ideas. Now we have to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell how was I supposed to know Anderson would be so willing to let his own son rot in hell?\u201d</p><p>Adam flinches and Kenji backpedals.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey\u2014I\u2019m sorry, man\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to say it like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Adam cuts him off. His face is suddenly hard, suddenly cold, closed off. \u201cMaybe you should get back to the medical wing. We\u2019re leaving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere but out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable. This isn\u2019t a joke,\u201d I tell him. \u201cPeople are going to die today.\u201d</p><p>But he laughs at me. Looks at me like I\u2019ve said something obliquely entertaining. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you trying to teach me about the realities of war?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAre you forgetting that I was a soldier in Warner\u2019s army? Do you have any idea how much crazy shit we\u2019ve seen?\u201d He gestures between himself and Adam. \u201cI know exactly what to expect today. Warner was insane. If Anderson is even twice as bad as his son, then we are diving right into a bloodbath. I can\u2019t leave you guys hanging like that.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m caught on one sentence. One word. I just want to ask. \u201cWas he really that bad ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Kenji is staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWarner. Was he really that ruthless?\u201d</p><p>Kenji laughs out loud. Laughs louder. Doubles over. He\u2019s practically wheezing when he says, \u201cRuthless? Juliette, the guy is sick. He\u2019s an animal. I don\u2019t think he even knows what it means to be human. If there\u2019s a hell out there, I\u2019m guessing it was designed especially for him.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so hard to pull this sword out of my stomach.</p><p>A rush of footsteps.</p><p>I turn around.</p><p>Everyone is supposed to exit the tunnels in a single-file line in an attempt to maintain order as we leave this underground world. Kenji and Adam and I are the only fighters who haven\u2019t joined the group yet.</p><p>We all get to our feet.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014so, does Castle know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Adam is looking at Kenji. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be okay with you going out there today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastle wants me to be happy,\u201d Kenji says matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be happy if I stay here. I\u2019ve got work to do. People to save. Ladies to impress. He\u2019d respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about everyone else?\u201d I ask him. \u201cEveryone was so worried about you\u2014have you even seen them yet? To at least tell them you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cThey\u2019d probably shit a brick if they knew I was going up. I thought it\u2019d be safer to keep it quiet. I don\u2019t want to freak anyone out. And Sonya and Sara\u2014poor kids\u2014they\u2019re passed the hell out. It\u2019s my fault they\u2019re so exhausted, and they\u2019re still talking about heading out today. They want to fight even though they\u2019re going to have a lot of work to do once we\u2019re done with Anderson\u2019s army. I\u2019ve been trying to convince them to stay here but they can be so damn stubborn. They need to save their strength,\u201d he says, \u201cand they\u2019ve already wasted too much of it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a waste\u2014,\u201d I try to tell him.</p><p>\u201cAnywayyy,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cCan we please get going? I know you\u2019re all about hunting down Anderson,\u201d he says to Adam, \u201cbut personally? I would love to catch Warner. Put a bullet through that worthless piece of crap and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>Something punches me in the gut so hard I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m actually going to be sick. I\u2019m seeing spots, struggling to keep myself standing, fighting to ignore the image of Warner dead, his body crumpled in red.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014you okay?\u201d Adam pulls me to the side. Takes a good look at my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I lie to him. Nod too many times. Shake my head once or twice. \u201cI just didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d I lie again. I pause. Grab his shirt. \u201cHey\u2014just be careful out there, okay?\u201d</p><p>He exhales a heavy breath. Nods once. \u201cYeah. You too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go let\u2019s go let\u2019s go!\u201d Kenji interrupts us. \u201cToday is our day to die, ladies.\u201d</p><p>Adam shoves him. A little.</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re abusing the crippled kid, huh?\u201d Kenji takes a moment to steady himself before punching Adam in the arm. \u201cSave your angst for the battlefield, bro. You\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p><p>A shrill whistle sounds in the distance.</p><p>It\u2019s time to go.</p><p>SIXTY-FOUR</p><p>It\u2019s raining.</p><p>The world is weeping at our feet in anticipation of what we\u2019re about to do.</p><p>We\u2019re all supposed to split off into clusters, fighting in tight groups so we can\u2019t all be killed at once. We don\u2019t have enough people to fight offensively so we have to be stealthy. And though I feel a pang of guilt for admitting it, I\u2019m so happy Kenji decided to come with us. We would\u2019ve been weaker without him.</p><p>But we have to get out of the rain.</p><p>We\u2019re already soaked through, and while Kenji and I are wearing suits that offer at least a modicum of protection against the natural elements, Adam is wearing nothing but crisp cotton basics, and I\u2019m worried we won\u2019t last long like this. All members of Omega Point have already scattered. The immediate area above the Point is still nothing but a barren stretch of land that leaves us vulnerable upon exiting.</p><p>Lucky for us, we have Kenji. The 3 of us are already invisible.</p><p>Anderson\u2019s men aren\u2019t far from here.</p><p>All we know is that ever since Anderson arrived, he\u2019s been going out of his way to make a point about his power and the iron grip of The Reestablishment. Any voice of opposition, no matter how weak or feeble, no matter how unthreatening or innocuous, has been silenced. He\u2019s angry that we\u2019ve inspired rebellion and now he\u2019s trying to make a statement. What he really wants is to destroy all of us.</p><p>The poor civilians are just caught in his friendly fire.</p><p>Gunshots.</p><p>We automatically move toward the sound echoing in the distance. We aren\u2019t saying a word. We understand what we need to do and how we have to operate. Our only mission is to get as close as possible to the devastation and then to take out as many of Anderson\u2019s men as we can. We protect the innocent. We support our fellow Point men and women.</p><p>We try very hard not to die.</p><p>I can make out the compounds creeping closer in the distance, but the rain is making it difficult to see. All the colors are bleeding together, melting into the horizon, and I have to strain to discern what lies ahead of us. I instinctively touch the guns attached to the holsters on my back and I\u2019m momentarily reminded of my last encounter with Anderson\u2014my only encounter with the horrible, despicable man\u2014and I wonder what\u2019s happened to him. I wonder if maybe Adam was right when he said that Anderson might be severely wounded, that perhaps he\u2019s still struggling to recuperate. I wonder if Anderson will make an appearance on the battlefield. I wonder if perhaps he\u2019s too much of a coward to fight in his own wars.</p><p>The screams tell us we\u2019re getting closer.</p><p>The world around us is a blurry landscape of blues and grays and mottled hues and the few trees still standing have a hundred shaky, quivering arms ripping through their trunks, reaching up to the sky as if in prayer, begging for relief from the tragedy they\u2019ve been rooted in. It\u2019s enough to make me feel sorry for the plants and animals forced to bear witness to what we\u2019ve done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They never asked for this.</p><p>Kenji guides us toward the outskirts of the compounds and we slip forward to stand flush against the wall of one of the little square houses, huddled under the extra bit of roof that, at least for a moment, grants us reprieve from the clenched fists falling from the sky.</p><p>Wind is gnawing at the windows, straining against the walls. Rain is popping against the roof like popcorn against a pane of glass.</p><p>The message from the sky is clear: we are pissed.</p> <p>We are pissed and we will punish you and we will make you pay for the blood you spill so freely. We will not sit idly by, not anymore, not ever again. We will ruin you, is what the sky says to us.</p><p>How could you do this to me? it whispers in the wind.</p><p>I gave you everything, it says to us.</p><p>Nothing will ever be the same again.</p><p>I\u2019m wondering why I still can\u2019t see any sign of the army. I don\u2019t see anyone else from Omega Point. I don\u2019t see anyone at all. In fact, I\u2019m starting to feel like this compound is a little too peaceful.</p> <p>I\u2019m about to suggest we move when I hear a door slam open.</p><p>\u201cThis is the last of them,\u201d someone shouts. \u201cShe was hiding out over here.\u201d A soldier is dragging a crying woman out from the compound we\u2019re huddled against and she\u2019s screaming, she\u2019s begging for mercy and asking about her husband and the soldier barks at her to shut up.</p><p>I have to keep the emotions from spilling out of my eyes, my mouth.</p><p>I do not speak.</p><p>I do not breathe.</p><p>Another soldier jogs over from somewhere I can\u2019t see. He shouts some kind of approving message and makes a motion with his hands that I don\u2019t understand. I feel Kenji stiffen beside me.</p> <p>Something is wrong.</p><p>\u201cToss her in with everyone else,\u201d the second soldier shouts. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll call this area clear.\u201d</p><p>The woman is hysterical. She\u2019s screeching, clawing at the soldier, telling him she\u2019s done nothing wrong, she doesn\u2019t understand, where is her husband, she\u2019s been looking for her daughter everywhere and what is happening, she cries, she screams, she flails her fists at the man gripping her like an animal.</p><p>He presses the barrel of his gun to her neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019ll shoot you right now.\u201d</p><p>She whimpers once, twice, and then she\u2019s limp. She\u2019s fainted in his arms and the soldier looks disgusted as he pulls her out of sight toward wherever they\u2019re keeping everyone else. I have no idea what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening.</p><p>We follow them.</p><p>The wind and the rain pick up in pace and there\u2019s enough noise in the air and distance between us and the soldiers that I feel safe to speak. I squeeze Kenji\u2019s hand. He\u2019s still the glue between me and Adam, projecting his powers to keep us all invisible. \u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re rounding them up,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cThey\u2019re creating groups of people to kill all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I hear him clear his throat. \u201cYeah, she and whoever else they think might be connected to the protests. They don\u2019t just kill the inciters,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey kill the friends and the family members, too. It\u2019s the best way to keep people in line. It never fails to scare the shit out of the few left alive.\u201d</p><p>I have to swallow back the vomit threatening to overpower me.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a way to get them out of there,\u201d Adam says. \u201cMaybe we can take out the soldiers in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but listen, you guys know I\u2019m going to have to let go of you, right? I\u2019m already kind of losing strength; my Energy is fading faster than normal. So you\u2019ll be visible,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a clearer target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what other choice do we have?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWe could try to take them out sniper-style,\u201d Kenji says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to engage in direct combat. We have that option.\u201d He pauses. \u201cJuliette, you\u2019ve never been in this kind of situation before. I want you to know I\u2019d respect your decision to stay out of the direct line of fire. Not everyone can stomach what we might see if we follow those soldiers. There\u2019s no shame or blame in that.\u201d</p><p>I taste metal in my mouth as I lie. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet a moment. \u201cJust\u2014all right\u2014but don\u2019t be afraid to use your abilities to defend yourself,\u201d he says to me. \u201cI know you\u2019re all weird about not wanting to hurt people or whatever, but these guys aren\u2019t messing around. They will try to kill you.\u201d</p><p>I nod even though I know he can\u2019t see me. \u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cYeah.\u201d But I\u2019m panicked through my mind.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>SIXTY-FIVE</p><p>I can\u2019t feel my knees.</p><p>There are 27 people lined up, standing side by side in the middle of a big, barren field. Men and women and children of all different ages. All different sizes. All standing before what could be called a firing squad of 6 soldiers. The rain is rushing down around us, hard and angry, pelting everything and everyone with teardrops as hard as my bones. The wind is absolutely frantic.</p><p>The soldiers are deciding what to do. How to kill them. How to dispose of the 27 sets of eyes staring straight ahead. Some are sobbing, some are shaking from fear and grief and horror, others still are standing perfectly straight, stoic in the face of death.</p><p>One of the soldiers fires a shot.</p><p>The first man crumples to the ground and I feel like I\u2019ve been whipped in the spine. So many emotions rush in and out of me in the span of a few seconds that I\u2019m afraid I might faint; I\u2019m clinging to consciousness with an animal desperation and trying to swallow back the tears, trying to ignore the pain spearing through me.</p><p>I can\u2019t understand why no one is moving, why we\u2019re not moving, why none of the civilians are moving even just to jump out of the way and it occurs to me, it dawns on me that running, trying to escape or trying to fight back is simply not a viable option. They are utterly overpowered. They have no guns. No ammunition of any kind.</p><p>But I do.</p><p>I have a gun.</p><p>I have 2, in fact.</p><p>This is the moment, this is where we have to let go, this is where we fight alone, just the 3 of us, 3 ancient kids fighting to save 26 faces or we die trying. My eyes are locked on a little girl who can\u2019t be much older than James, her eyes so wide, so terrified, the front of her pants already wet from fear and it rips me to pieces, it kills me, and my free hand is already reaching for my gun when I tell Kenji I\u2019m ready.</p><p>I watch the same soldier focus his weapon on the next victim when Kenji releases us.</p><p>3 guns are up, aimed to fire, and I hear the bullets before they\u2019re released into the air; I see one find its mark in a soldier\u2019s neck and I have no idea if it\u2019s mine.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter now.</p><p>There are still 5 soldiers left to face, and now they can see us.</p><p>We\u2019re running.</p><p>We\u2019re dodging the bullets aimed in our direction and I see Adam dropping to the ground, I see him shooting with perfect precision and still failing to find a target. I look around for Kenji only to find that he\u2019s disappeared and I\u2019m so happy for it; 3 soldiers go down almost instantly. Adam takes advantage of the remaining soldiers\u2019 distraction and takes out a fourth. I shoot the fifth from behind.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether or not I\u2019ve killed him.</p><p>We\u2019re screaming for the people to follow us, we\u2019re herding them back to the compounds, yelling for them to stay down, to stay out of sight; we tell them help is coming and we\u2019ll do whatever we can to protect them and they\u2019re trying to reach out to us, to touch us, to thank us and take our hands but we don\u2019t have time. We have to hurry them to some semblance of safety and move on to wherever the rest of this decimation is taking place.</p><p>I still haven\u2019t forgotten the one man we weren\u2019t able to save. I haven\u2019t forgotten number 27.</p><p>I never want that to happen again.</p><p>We\u2019re bolting across the many miles of land dedicated to these compounds now, not bothering to keep ourselves hidden or to come up with a definitive plan. We still haven\u2019t spoken. We haven\u2019t discussed what we\u2019ve done or what we might do and we only know that we need to keep moving.</p><p>We follow Kenji.</p><p>He weaves his way through a demolished cluster of compounds and we know something has gone horribly wrong. There\u2019s no sign of life anywhere. The little metal boxes that used to house civilians are completely destroyed and we don\u2019t know if there were people inside when this happened.</p><p>Kenji tells us we have to keep looking.</p><p>We move deeper through the regulated territory, these pieces of land dedicated to human habitation, until we hear a rush of footsteps, the sound of a softly churning mechanical sound.</p><p>The tanks.</p><p>They run on electricity so they\u2019re less conspicuous as they move through the streets, but I\u2019m familiar enough with these tanks to be able to recognize the electric thrum. Adam and Kenji do too.</p><p>We follow the noise.</p><p>We\u2019re fighting against the wind trying push us away and it\u2019s almost as if it knows, as if the wind is trying to protect us from whatever is waiting on the other side of this compound. It doesn\u2019t want us to have to see this. It doesn\u2019t want us to have to die today.</p><p>Something explodes.</p><p>A raging fire rips through the atmosphere not 50 feet from where we\u2019re standing. The flames lick the earth, lapping up the oxygen, and even the rain can\u2019t douse the devastation all at once. The fire whips and sways in the wind, dying down just enough, humbled into submission by the sky.</p><p>We need to be wherever that fire is.</p><p>Our feet fight for traction on the muddy ground and I don\u2019t feel the cold as we run, I don\u2019t feel the wet, I only feel the adrenaline coursing through my limbs, forcing me to move forward, gun clenched too tight in my fist, too ready to aim, too ready to fire.</p><p>But when we reach the flames I almost drop my weapon.</p><p>I almost fall to the floor.</p><p>I almost can\u2019t believe my eyes.</p><p>SIXTY-SIX</p><p>Dead dead dead is everywhere.</p><p>So many bodies mixed and meshed into the earth that I have no idea whether they\u2019re ours or theirs and I\u2019m beginning to wonder what it means, I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself and this weapon in my hand and I can\u2019t help but wonder about these soldiers, I wonder how they could be just like Adam, just like a million other tortured, orphaned souls who simply needed to survive and took the only job they could get.</p><p>My conscience has declared war against itself.</p><p>I\u2019m blinking back tears and rain and horror and I know I need to move my legs, I know I need to push forward and be brave, I have to fight whether I like it or not because we can\u2019t let this happen.</p><p>I\u2019m tackled from behind.</p><p>Someone pins me down and my face is buried in the ground and I\u2019m kicking, I\u2019m trying to scream but I feel the gun wrenched out of my grip, I feel an elbow in my spine and I know Adam and Kenji are gone, they\u2019re deep in battle and I know I\u2019m about to die. I know it\u2019s over and it doesn\u2019t feel real, somehow, it feels like this is a story someone else is telling, like death is a strange, distant thing you\u2019ve only ever seen happen to people you\u2019ve never known and surely it doesn\u2019t happen to me, to you, to any of the rest of us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But here it is.</p><p>It\u2019s a gun in the back of my head and a boot pressed down on my back and it\u2019s my mouth full of mud and it\u2019s a million worthless moments I never really lived and it\u2019s all right in front of me. I see it so clearly.</p><p>Someone flips me over.</p><p>The same someone who held a gun to my head is now pointing it at my face, inspecting me as if trying to read me and I\u2019m confused, I don\u2019t understand his angry gray eyes or the stiff set of his mouth because he\u2019s not pulling the trigger. He\u2019s not killing me and this, this more than anything else is what petrifies me.</p> <p>I need to take off my gloves.</p><p>My captor shouts something I don\u2019t catch because he\u2019s not talking to me, he\u2019s not looking in my direction because he\u2019s calling to someone else and I use his moment of distraction to yank off the steel knuckle brace on my left hand only to toss it to the ground. I have to get my glove off. I have to get my glove off because it\u2019s my only chance for survival but the rain has made the leather too wet and it\u2019s sticking to my skin, refusing to come off easily and the soldier spins back too soon. He sees what I\u2019m trying to do and he yanks me to my feet, pulls me into a headlock and presses the gun to my skull. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do, you little freak,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. You move even an inch and I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, I don\u2019t believe him.</p><p>I don\u2019t think he\u2019s supposed to shoot me, because if he wanted to, he would\u2019ve done it already. But he\u2019s waiting for something. He\u2019s waiting for something I don\u2019t understand and I need to act fast. I need a plan but I have no idea what to do and I\u2019m only clawing at his covered arm, at the muscle he\u2019s bound around my neck and he shakes me, shouts at me to stop squirming and he pulls me tighter to cut off my air supply and my fingers are clenched around his forearm, trying to fight the viselike grip he has around me and I can\u2019t breathe and I\u2019m panicked, I\u2019m suddenly not so sure he\u2019s not going to kill me and I don\u2019t even realize what I\u2019ve done until I hear him scream.</p><p>I\u2019ve crushed all the bones in his arm.</p> <p>He falls to the floor, he drops his gun to grab at his arm, and he\u2019s screaming with a pain so excruciating I\u2019m almost tempted to feel remorse for what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>Instead, I run.</p><p>I\u2019ve only gotten a few feet before 3 more soldiers slam into me, alerted by what I\u2019ve done to their comrade, and they see my face and they\u2019re alight with recognition. One of them appears vaguely familiar, almost as if I\u2019ve seen his shaggy brown hair before, and I realize: they know me. These soldiers knew me when Warner held me captive. Warner had made a complete spectacle out of me. Of course they\u2019d recognize my face.</p><p>And they\u2019re not letting me go.</p><p>The 3 of them are pushing me face-first into the ground, pinning down my arms and legs until I\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019ve decided to rip my limbs off. I\u2019m trying to fight back, I\u2019m trying to get my mind in the right place to focus my Energy, and I\u2019m just about to knock them back but then</p><p>a sharp blow to my head and I\u2019m rendered almost entirely unconscious.</p> <p>Sounds are mixing together, voices are becoming one big mess of noise and I can\u2019t see colors, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me because I can\u2019t feel my legs anymore. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m walking or if I\u2019m being carried but I feel the rain. I feel it fall fast down the planes of my face until I hear the sound of metal on metal, I hear a familiar electric thrum and then the rain stops, it disappears from the sky and I only know 2 things and I only know 1 of those things for certain.</p><p>I am in a tank.</p><p>I am going to die.</p><p>SIXTY-SEVEN</p><p>I hear wind chimes.</p><p>I hear wind chimes being blown into hysteria by a wind so violent as to be a legitimate threat and all I can think is that the tinkling sounds seem so incredibly familiar to me. My head is still spinning but I have to stay as aware as possible. I have to know where they\u2019re taking me. I have to have some idea of where I am. I need to have a point of reference and I\u2019m struggling to keep my head straight without making it known that I\u2019m not unconscious.</p><p>The soldiers don\u2019t speak.</p><p>I was hoping to at least glean a bit of information from the conversations they might have but they do not say a word to one another. They are like machines, like robots programmed to follow through with a specific assignment, and I wonder, I\u2019m so curious, I can\u2019t figure out why I had to be dragged away from the battlefield to be killed. I wonder why my death has to be so special. I wonder why they\u2019re carrying me out of the tank toward the chaos of an angry wind chime and I dare to open my eyes just a sliver and I nearly gasp.</p> <p>It\u2019s the house.</p><p>It\u2019s the house, the house on unregulated turf, the one painted the perfect shade of robin\u2019s-egg blue and the only traditional, functioning home within a 500-mile radius. It\u2019s the same house Kenji told me must be a trap, it\u2019s the house where I was so sure I\u2019d meet Warner\u2019s father, and then it hits me. A sledgehammer. A bullet train. A rush of realization crushing my brain.</p><p>Anderson must be here. He must want to kill me himself.</p><p>I am a special delivery.</p><p>They even ring the doorbell.</p><p>I hear feet shuffling. I hear creaks and groans. I hear the wind snapping through the world and then I see my future, I see Anderson torturing me to death in every possible way and I wonder how I\u2019m going to get myself out of this. Anderson is too smart. He will probably chain me to the floor and cut off my hands and feet one at a time. He is likely going to want to enjoy this.</p><p>He answers the door.</p><p>\u201cAh! Gentlemen. Thank you very much,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease follow me.\u201d And I feel the soldier carrying me shift his weight under my damp, limp, suddenly heavy body. I\u2019m starting to feel a cold chill seep into my bones and I realize I\u2019ve been running through the pouring rain for too long.</p><p>I\u2019m shaking and it\u2019s not from fear.</p><p>I\u2019m burning and it\u2019s not from anger.</p><p>I\u2019m so delirious that even if I had the strength to defend myself I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to do it right. It\u2019s amazing how many different ways I could meet my end today.</p><p>Anderson smells rich and earthy; I can smell him even though I\u2019m being carried in someone else\u2019s arms, and the scent is disturbingly pleasant. He closes the front door behind us just after advising the waiting soldiers to return to work. Which is essentially an order for them to go kill more people.</p><p>I think I\u2019m starting to hallucinate.</p><p>I see a warm fireplace like the kind I\u2019ve only ever read about. I see a cozy living room with soft, plush couches and a thick oriental rug gracing the floor. I see a mantel with pictures on it that I can\u2019t recognize from here and Anderson is telling me to wake up, he\u2019s saying you need to take a bath, you\u2019ve gotten yourself quite dirty haven\u2019t you, and that won\u2019t do, will it? I\u2019m going to need you to be awake and fully coherent or this won\u2019t be much fun at all, he says, and I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019m losing my mind.</p><p>I feel the thud thud thud of heavy footsteps climbing a stairwell and realize my body is moving with it. I hear a door whine open, I hear the shuffle of other feet and there are words being spoken that I can\u2019t distinguish anymore. Someone says something to someone and I\u2019m dropped onto a cold, hard floor.</p><p>I hear myself whimper.</p><p>\u201cBe careful not to touch her skin,\u201d is the only sentence I can make out in a single thread. Everything else is \u201cbathe\u201d and \u201csleep\u201d and \u201cin the morning\u201d and \u201cno, I don\u2019t think so\u201d and \u201cvery good,\u201d and I hear another door slam shut. It\u2019s the one right next to my head.</p><p>Someone is trying to take my suit off.</p><p>I snap up so quickly it\u2019s painful; I feel something sear through me, through my head until it hits me square in the eye and I know I\u2019m a mix of so many things right now. I can\u2019t remember the last time I ate anything and I haven\u2019t truly slept in over 24 hours. My body is soaked through, my head is pounding with pain, my body has been twisted and stepped on, and I\u2019m aching in a million different ways. But I will not allow any strange man to take my clothes off. I\u2019d rather be dead.</p><p>But the voice I hear isn\u2019t male at all. It sounds soft and gentle, motherly. She\u2019s speaking to me in a language I don\u2019t understand but maybe it\u2019s just my head that can\u2019t understand anything at all. She makes soothing noises, she rubs her hands in small circles on my back. I hear a rush of water and feel the heat rise up around me and it\u2019s so warm, it feels like steam and I think this must be a bathroom, or a tub, and I can\u2019t help but think that I haven\u2019t taken a hot shower since I was back at the headquarters with Warner.</p><p>I try to open my eyes and fail.</p><p>It\u2019s like two anvils are sitting on my eyelids, like everything is black and messy and confusing and exhausting and I can only make out the general circumstances of my situation. I see through little more than slits; I see only the gleaming porcelain of what I assume is a bathtub and I crawl over despite the protests in my ear and clamber up.</p><p>I topple right into the hot water fully clothed, gloves and boots and suit intact and it\u2019s an unbelievable pleasure I didn\u2019t expect to experience.</p><p>My bones begin to thaw and my teeth are slowing their chatter and my muscles are learning to relax. My hair floats up around my face and I feel it tickle my nose.</p><p>I sink beneath the surface.</p><p>I fall asleep.</p><p>SIXTY-EIGHT</p><p>I wake up in a bed made of heaven and I\u2019m wearing clothes that belong to a boy.</p><p>I\u2019m warm and comfortable but I can still feel the creak in my bones, the ache in my head, the confusion clouding my mind. I sit up. I look around.</p><p>I\u2019m in someone\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>I\u2019m tangled in blue-and-orange bedsheets decorated with little baseball mitts. There\u2019s a little desk with a little chair set off to the side and there\u2019s a set of drawers, a collection of plastic trophies in perfectly straight rows on top. I see a simple wooden door with a traditional brass knob that must lead outside; I see a sliding set of mirrors that must be hiding a closet. I look to my right to find a little bedside table with an alarm clock and a glass of water and I grab it.</p><p>It\u2019s almost embarrassing how quickly I inhale the contents.</p><p>I climb out of bed only to find that I\u2019m wearing a pair of navy gym shorts that are hanging so low on my hips I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re going to fall off. I\u2019m wearing a gray T-shirt with some kind of logo on it and I\u2019m swimming in the extra material. I have no socks. No gloves. No underwear.</p><p>I have nothing.</p><p>I wonder if I\u2019m allowed to step outside and I decide it\u2019s worth a shot. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing here. I have no idea why I\u2019m not dead yet.</p><p>I freeze in front of the mirrored doors.</p><p>My hair has been washed well and it falls in thick, soft waves around my face. My skin is bright and, with the exception of a few scratches, relatively unscathed. My eyes are wide; an odd, vibrant mix of green and blue blinking back at me, surprised and surprisingly unafraid.</p><p>But my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My neck is one mess of purple, one big bruise that discolors my entire appearance. I hadn\u2019t realized just how tightly I was being choked to death yesterday\u2014I think it was yesterday\u2014and I only now realize just how much it hurts to swallow. I take a sharp breath and push past the mirrors. I need to find a way to get out of here.</p><p>The door opens at my touch.</p><p>I look around the hallway for any sign of life. I don\u2019t have any idea what time of day it is or what I\u2019ve gotten myself into. I don\u2019t know if anyone exists in this house except for Anderson\u2014and whoever it was that helped me in the bathroom\u2014but I have to assess my situation. I have to figure out exactly how much danger I\u2019m in before I can devise a plan to fight my way out.</p><p>I try to tiptoe quietly down the stairs.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>The stairs creak and groan under my weight and I hardly have a chance to backpedal before I hear him call my name. He\u2019s downstairs.</p><p>Anderson is downstairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shy,\u201d he says. I hear the rustle of something that sounds like paper. \u201cI have food for you and I know you must be starving.\u201d</p><p>My heart is suddenly beating in my throat. I wonder what choices I have, what options I have to consider and I decide I can\u2019t hide from him in his own hideout.</p> <p>I meet him downstairs.</p><p>He\u2019s the same beautiful man he was before. Hair perfect and polished, clothing crisp, clean, expertly pressed. He\u2019s sitting in the living room in an overstuffed chair with a blanket draped over his lap. I notice a gorgeous, rustic-looking, intricately carved walking stick leaning against the armrest. He has a stack of papers in his hand.</p><p>I smell coffee.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he says to me, not at all surprised by my strange, wild appearance. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>I do.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I look up. I don\u2019t answer him.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very surprised to see me here. It\u2019s a lovely little house, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He looks around. \u201cI had this preserved shortly after I moved my family to what is now Sector 45. This sector was supposed to be mine, after all. It turned out to be the ideal place to store my wife.\u201d He waves a hand. \u201cApparently she doesn\u2019t do very well in the compounds,\u201d he says, as if I\u2019m supposed to have any idea what he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>Store his wife?</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I allow anything out of his mouth to surprise me.</p><p>Anderson seems to catch my confusion. He looks amused. \u201cAm I to understand that my love-struck boy didn\u2019t tell you about his beloved mother? He didn\u2019t go on and on and on about his pathetic love for the creature that gave birth to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d is the first word I speak.</p><p>\u201cI am truly shocked,\u201d Anderson says, smiling like he\u2019s not shocked at all. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bother to mention that he has a sick, ailing mother who lives in this house? He didn\u2019t tell you that\u2019s why he wanted the post here, in this sector, so desperately? No? He didn\u2019t tell you anything about that?\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cI am just so shocked,\u201d he lies again.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep my heart rate down, trying to figure out why on earth he\u2019s telling me this, trying to stay one step ahead of him, but he\u2019s doing a damn good job of confusing the hell out of me.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was chosen as supreme commander,\u201d he goes on, \u201cI was going to leave Aaron\u2019s mother here and take him with me to the capital. But the boy didn\u2019t want to leave his mother behind. He wanted to take care of her. He didn\u2019t want to leave her. He needed to be with her like some stupid child,\u201d he says, raising his voice at the end, forgetting himself for a moment. He swallows. Regains his composure.</p><p>And I\u2019m waiting.</p><p>Waiting for the anvil he\u2019s preparing to drop on my head.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how many other soldiers wanted be in charge of Sector 45? How many fine candidates we had to choose from? He was only eighteen years old!\u201d He laughs. \u201cEveryone thought he\u2019d gone mad. But I gave him a chance,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI thought it might be good for him to take on that kind of responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Still waiting.</p><p>A deep, contented sigh. \u201cDid he ever tell you,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cwhat he had to do to prove he was worthy?\u201d</p><p>There it is.</p><p>\u201cDid he ever tell you what I made him do to earn it?\u201d</p><p>I feel so dead inside.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anderson says, eyes bright, too bright. \u201cI suspect he didn\u2019t want to mention that part, did he? I bet he didn\u2019t include that part of his past, did he?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear this. I don\u2019t want to know this. I don\u2019t want to listen anymore\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI won\u2019t spoil it for you. Best to let him share those details with you himself.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not calm anymore. I\u2019m not calm and I\u2019ve officially begun to panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be heading back to base in just a bit,\u201d Anderson says, sorting through his papers, not seeming to mind having an entirely one-sided conversation with me. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to be under the same roof as his mother for very long\u2014I do not get on well with the ill, unfortunately\u2014but this has turned out to be a convenient little camp under the present circumstances. I\u2019ve been using it as a base from which to oversee all that\u2019s going on at the compounds.\u201d</p><p>The battle.</p><p>The fighting.</p><p>The bloodshed and Adam and Kenji and Castle and everyone I\u2019ve left behind</p><p>How could I forget</p><p>The horrifying, terrifying possibilities are flashing through my mind. I have no idea what\u2019s happened. If they\u2019re okay. If they know I\u2019m still alive. If Castle managed to get Brendan and Winston back.</p><p>If anyone I know has died.</p><p>My eyes are crazed, darting around. I get to my feet, convinced that this is all just an elaborate trap, that perhaps someone is going to maul me from behind or someone is waiting in the kitchen with a cleaver, and I can\u2019t catch my breath, I\u2019m wheezing and I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do what to do what to do and I say \u201cWhat am I doing here? Why did you bring me here? Why haven\u2019t you killed me yet?\u201d</p><p>Anderson looks at me. He cocks his head. He says, \u201cI am very upset with you, Juliette. Very, very unhappy.\u201d He says, \u201cYou have done a very bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d seems to be the only question I know how to ask. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d For one crazy moment I wonder if he knows about what happened with Warner. I almost feel myself blush.</p><p>But he takes a deep breath. Grabs the cane resting against his chair. He has to use his entire upper body to get to his feet. He\u2019s shaking, even with the cane to support him.</p><p>He\u2019s crippled.</p><p>He says, \u201cYou did this to me. You managed to overpower me. You shot me in my legs. You almost shot me in the heart. And you kidnapped my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I gasp, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did this to me.\u201d He cuts me off. \u201cAnd now I want compensation.\u201d</p><p>SIXTY-NINE</p><p>Breathing. I have to remember to keep breathing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cwhat you were able to do entirely on your own. There were only three people in that room,\u201d he says. \u201cYou, me, and my son. My soldiers were watching that entire area for anyone else who might\u2019ve come with you, and they said you were utterly alone.\u201d A pause. \u201cI actually thought you\u2019d come with a team, you see. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be brave enough to meet me by yourself. But then you single-handedly disarmed me and stole back your hostages. You had to carry two men\u2014not including my son\u2014out to safety. How you managed to do it is entirely beyond my comprehension.\u201d</p><p>And it hits me: this choice is simple.</p><p>I either tell him the truth about Kenji and Adam and risk having Anderson go after them, or I take the fall.</p><p>So I meet Anderson\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I nod. I say, \u201cYou called me a stupid little girl. You said I was too much of a coward to defend myself.\u201d</p><p>He looks uncomfortable for the very first time. Seems to realize that I could probably do the same thing to him again, right now if I wanted.</p><p>And I think, yes, I probably could. What an excellent idea.</p><p>But for now, I\u2019m still strangely curious to see what he wants from me. Why he\u2019s talking to me. I\u2019m not worried about attacking him right away; I know that I have an advantage over him now. I should be able to overtake him easily.</p><p>Anderson clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cI was planning on returning to the capital,\u201d he says. He takes a deep breath. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that my work here is not yet finished. Your people are making things infinitely more complicated and it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to simply kill all the civilians.\u201d A pause. \u201cWell, no, actually, that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not hard to kill them, it\u2019s only that it\u2019s becoming impractical.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cIf I were to kill them all, I wouldn\u2019t have any left to rule over, would I?\u201d</p><p>He actually laughs. Laughs as if he\u2019s said something funny.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He takes a deep breath. He\u2019s smiling. \u201cI must admit, Juliette\u2014I\u2019m thoroughly impressed. You alone were able to overpower me. You had enough foresight to think of taking my son hostage. You saved two of your own men. You caused an earthquake to save the rest of your team!\u201d He laughs. He laughs and laughs and laughs.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother telling him that only 2 of those things are true.</p><p>\u201cI see now that my son was right. You could be invaluable to us, especially right now. You know the inside of their headquarters better than anything Aaron is able to remember.\u201d</p><p>So Warner has been to see his father.</p><p>He\u2019s shared our secrets. Of course he has. I can\u2019t imagine why I\u2019m so surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Anderson says to me, \u201ccould help me destroy all of your little friends. You could tell me everything I need to know. You could tell me all about the other freaks, what they\u2019re capable of, what their strengths and weaknesses are. You could take me to their hideout. You would do whatever I asked you to do.\u201d</p><p>I want to spit in his face.</p><p>\u201cI would sooner die,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019d rather be burned alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I highly doubt that,\u201d he says. He shifts his weight onto the cane to better hold himself up. \u201cI think you\u2019d change your mind if you actually had the opportunity to feel the skin melt off your face. But,\u201d he says, \u201cI am not unkind. I certainly won\u2019t rule it out as an option, if you\u2019re really that interested.\u201d</p><p>Horrible, horrible man.</p><p>He smiles, wide, satisfied by my silence. \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>The front door flies open.</p><p>I don\u2019t move. I don\u2019t turn around. I don\u2019t know if I want to see what\u2019s about to happen to me but then I hear Anderson greet his visitor. Invite him in. Ask him to say hello to their new guest.</p><p>Warner steps into my line of vision.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly weak through the bone, sick and slightly mortified. Warner doesn\u2019t say a word. He\u2019s wearing his perfect suit with his perfect hair and he looks exactly like the Warner I first met; the only difference now is the look in his eyes. He\u2019s staring at me in a state of shock so debilitating he actually looks ill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou kids remember each other, right?\u201d Anderson is the only one laughing.</p><p>Warner is breathing like he\u2019s hiked several mountains, like he can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s seeing or why he\u2019s seeing it and he\u2019s staring at my neck, at what must be the ugly blotchy bruise staining my skin and his face twists into something that looks like anger and horror and heartbreak. His eyes drop to my shirt, to my shorts, and his mouth falls open just enough for me to notice before he\u2019s reining himself in, wiping the emotions off his face. He\u2019s struggling to stay composed but I can see the rapid motions of his chest rising and falling. His voice isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it could be when he says, \u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had her collected for us,\u201d Anderson says simply.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Warner asks. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want her\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Anderson says, considering. \u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true. I could certainly benefit from having her around, but I decided at the last moment that I wasn\u2019t interested in her company anymore.\u201d He shakes his head. Looks down at his legs. Sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just so frustrating to be crippled like this,\u201d he says, laughing again. \u201cIt\u2019s just so unbelievably frustrating. But,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cat least I\u2019ve found a fast and easy way to fix it. To put it all back to normal, as they say. It\u2019ll be just like magic.\u201d</p><p>Something about his eyes, the sick smile in his voice, the way he says that last line makes me feel ill. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask, almost afraid to hear his response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you even have to ask, my dear. I mean, honestly\u2014did you really think I wouldn\u2019t notice my son\u2019s brand-new shoulder?\u201d He laughs. \u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t find it strange to see him come home not only unharmed, but entirely healed? No scars, no tenderness, no weakness\u2014as if he\u2019d never been shot at all! It\u2019s a miracle,\u201d he says. \u201cA miracle, my son informs me, that was performed by two of your little freaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Horror is building inside of me, blinding me.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d He glances at Warner. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I gasp. \u201cOh, God\u2014what have you done\u2014WHERE ARE THEY\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Anderson says to me. \u201cThey are perfectly unharmed. I simply had them collected, just as I had you collected. I need them to stay alive and healthy if they\u2019re going to heal me, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know about this?\u201d I turn to Warner, frantic. \u201cDid you do this? Did you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014Juliette,\u201d he says, \u201cI swear\u2014this wasn\u2019t my idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are both getting agitated over nothing,\u201d Anderson says, waving a lazy hand in our direction. \u201cWe have more important things to focus on right now. More pressing issues to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Warner asks, \u201care you talking about?\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem to be breathing.</p><p>\u201cJustice, son.\u201d Anderson is staring at me now. \u201cI\u2019m talking about justice. I like the idea of setting things right. Of putting order back into the world. And I was waiting for you to arrive so I could show you exactly what I mean. This,\u201d he says, \u201cis what I should\u2019ve done the first time.\u201d He glances at Warner. \u201cAre you listening? Pay close attention now. Are you watching?\u201d</p><p>He pulls out a gun.</p><p>And shoots me in the chest.</p><p>SEVENTY</p><p>My heart has exploded.</p><p>I\u2019m thrown backward, tripping over my own feet until I hit the floor, my head slamming into the carpeted ground, my arms doing little to break my fall. It\u2019s pain like I\u2019ve never known it, pain I never thought I could feel, never would have even imagined. It\u2019s like dynamite has gone off in my chest, like I\u2019ve been lit on fire from the inside out, and suddenly everything slows down.</p><p>So this, I think, is what it feels like to die.</p> <p>I\u2019m blinking and it seems to take forever. I see an unfocused series of images in front of me, colors and bodies and lights swaying, stilted movements all blurred together. Sounds are warped, garbled, too high and too low for me to hear clearly. There are icy, electric bursts surging through my veins, like every part of my body has fallen asleep and is trying to wake up again.</p><p>There\u2019s a face in front of me.</p><p>I try to concentrate on the shape, the colors, try to bring everything into focus but it\u2019s too difficult and suddenly I can\u2019t breathe, suddenly I feel like there are knives in my throat, holes punched into my lungs, and the more I blink, the less clearly I\u2019m able to see. Soon I\u2019m only able to take in the tightest breaths, tiny little gasps that remind me of when I was a child, when the doctors told me I suffered from asthma attacks. They were wrong, though; my shortness of breath had nothing to do with asthma. It had to do with panic and anxiety and hyperventilation. But this feeling I\u2019m feeling right now is very similar to what I experienced then. It\u2019s like trying to take in oxygen by breathing through the thinnest straw. Like your lungs are just closing up, gone for the holidays. I feel the dizziness take over, the light-headed feeling take over. And the pain, the pain, the pain. The pain is terrible. The pain is the worst. The pain never seems to stop.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m blind.</p><p>I feel rather than see the blood, feel it leaking out of me as I blink and blink and blink in a desperate attempt to regain my vision. But I can see nothing but a haze of white. I hear nothing but the pounding in my eardrums and the short, the short, the short frantic gasp gasp gasps of my own breath and I feel hot, so hot, the blood of my body still so fresh and warm and pooling underneath me, all around me.</p><p>Life is seeping out of me and it makes me think about death, makes me think about how short a life I lived and how little I lived it. How I spent most of my years cowering in fear, never standing up for myself, always trying to be what someone else wanted. For 17 years I tried to force myself into a mold that I hoped would make other people feel comfortable, safe, unthreatened.</p><p>And it never helped.</p><p>I will have died having accomplished nothing. I am still no one. I am nothing more than a silly little girl bleeding to death on a psychotic man\u2019s floor.</p><p>And I think, if I could do it over again, I\u2019d do it so differently.</p><p>I\u2019d be better. I\u2019d make something of myself. I\u2019d make a difference in this sorry, sorry world.</p><p>And I\u2019d start by killing Anderson.</p><p>It\u2019s too bad I\u2019m already so close to dead.</p><p>SEVENTY-ONE</p><p>My eyes open.</p><p>I\u2019m looking around and wondering at this strange version of an afterlife. Odd, that Warner is here, that I still can\u2019t seem to move, that I still feel such extraordinary pain. Stranger still to see Sonya and Sara in front of me. I can\u2019t even pretend to understand their presence in this picture.</p><p>I\u2019m hearing things.</p><p>Sounds are beginning to come in more clearly, and, because I can\u2019t lift my head to look around, I try instead to focus on what they\u2019re saying.</p><p>They\u2019re arguing.</p><p>\u201cYou have to!\u201d Warner shouts.</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t\u2014we can\u2019t t-touch her,\u201d Sonya is saying, choking back tears. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to help her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s actually dying,\u201d Sara gasps. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were telling the truth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dying!\u201d Warner says. \u201cShe is not going to die! Please, listen, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d he says, desperate now, \u201cyou can help her\u2014I\u2019ve been trying to explain to you,\u201d he says, \u201call you have to do is touch me and I can take your power\u2014I can be the transfer, I can control it and redirect your Energy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d Sonya says. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014Castle never said you could do that\u2014he would\u2019ve told us if you could do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, please, just listen to me,\u201d he says, his voice breaking. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to trick you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kidnapped us!\u201d they both shout at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t me! I wasn\u2019t the one who kidnapped you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we supposed to trust you?\u201d Sara says. \u201cHow do we know you didn\u2019t do this to her yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you care?\u201d He\u2019s breathing so hard now. \u201cHow can you not care? Why don\u2019t you care that she\u2019s bleeding to death\u2014I thought you were her friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we care!\u201d Sara says, her voice catching on the last word. \u201cBut how can we help her now? Where can we take her? Who can we take her to? No one can touch her and she\u2019s lost so much blood already\u2014just look at he\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sharp intake of breath.</p><p>\u201cJuliette?\u201d</p><p>Footsteps stomp stomp stomp the ground. Rushing around my head. All the sounds are banging into each other, colliding again, spinning around me. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not dead yet.</p><p>I have no idea how long I\u2019ve been lying here.</p><p>\u201cJuliette? JULIETTE\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warner\u2019s voice is a rope I want to cling to. I want to catch it and tie it around my waist and I want him to haul me out of this paralyzed world I\u2019m trapped in. I want to tell him not to worry, that it\u2019s fine, that I\u2019m going to be okay because I\u2019ve accepted it, I\u2019m ready to die now, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t say anything. I still can\u2019t breathe, can hardly shape my lips into words. All I can do is take these torturous little gasps and wonder why the hell my body hasn\u2019t given up yet.</p><p>All of a sudden Warner is straddling my bleeding body, careful not to allow any of his weight to touch me, and he shoves up my shirtsleeves. Grabs ahold of my bare arms and says, \u201cYou are going to be okay. We\u2019re going to fix this\u2014they\u2019re going to help me fix this and you\u2014you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d Deep breaths. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be perfect. Do you hear me? Juliette, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I blink at him. I blink and blink and blink at him and find I\u2019m still fascinated by his eyes. Such a startling shade of green.</p><p>\u201cEach one of you, grab my arms,\u201d he shouts to the girls, his hands still gripped firmly around my shoulders. \u201cNow! Please! I\u2019m begging you\u2014\u201d</p><p>And for some reason they listen.</p><p>Maybe they see something in him, see something in his face, in his features. Maybe they see what I see from this disjointed, foggy perspective. The desperation in his expression, the anguish carved into his features, the way he looks at me, like he might die if I do.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but think this is an interesting parting gift from the world.</p><p>That at least, in the end, I didn\u2019t die alone.</p><p>SEVENTY-TWO</p><p>I\u2019m blind again.</p><p>Heat is pouring into my being with such intensity it\u2019s literally taken over my vision. I can\u2019t feel anything but hot, hot, searing hot heat flooding my bones, my nerves, my skin, my cells.</p><p>Everything is on fire.</p><p>At first I think it\u2019s the same heat in my chest, the same pain from the hole where my heart used to be, but then I realize this heat doesn\u2019t actually hurt. It\u2019s a soothing kind of heat. So potent, so intense, but somehow it\u2019s welcome. My body does not want to reject it. Does not want to flinch away from it, is not looking for a way to protect itself from it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I actually feel my back lift off the floor when the fire hits my lungs. I\u2019m suddenly gasping in huge, raging hyperventilated breaths, taking in lungfuls of air like I might cry if I don\u2019t. I\u2019m drinking oxygen, devouring it, choking on it, taking it in as quickly as possible, my entire body heaving as it strains to return to normal.</p><p>My chest feels like it\u2019s being stitched back together, like the flesh is regenerating itself, healing itself at an inhuman rate and I\u2019m blinking and breathing and I\u2019m moving my head and trying to see but it\u2019s still so blurry, still unclear but it\u2019s getting easier. I can feel my fingers and my toes and the life in my limbs and I can actually hear my heart beating again and suddenly the faces above me come into focus.</p><p>All at once the heat is gone.</p><p>The hands are gone.</p> <p>I collapse back onto the floor.</p><p>And everything goes black.</p><p>SEVENTY-THREE</p><p>Warner is sleeping.</p><p>I know this because he\u2019s sleeping right next to me. It\u2019s dark enough that it takes me several tries to blink my eyes open and understand that I\u2019m not blind this time. I catch a glimpse out the window and find the moon filled to the brim, pouring light into this little room.</p> <p>I\u2019m still here. In Anderson\u2019s house. In what probably used to be Warner\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>And he\u2019s asleep on the pillow right next to me.</p><p>His features are so soft, so ethereal in the moonlight. His face is deceptively calm, so unassuming and innocent. And I think of how impossible it is that he\u2019s here, lying next to me. That I\u2019m here, lying next to him.</p><p>That we\u2019re lying in his childhood bed together.</p><p>That he saved my life.</p><p>Impossible is such a stupid word.</p> <p>I shift hardly at all and Warner reacts immediately, sitting straight up, chest heaving, eyes blinking. He looks at me, sees that I\u2019m awake, that my eyes are open, and he freezes in place.</p><p>There are so many things I want to say to him. So many things I have to tell him. So many things I need to do now, that I need to sort through, that I have to decide.</p><p>But for now, I only have one question.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your father?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>It takes Warner a moment to find his voice. He says, \u201cHe\u2019s back on base. He left right after\u201d\u2014he hesitates, struggles for a second\u2014\u201cright after he shot you.\u201d</p><p>Incredible.</p><p>He left me bleeding all over his living room floor. What a nice little present for his son to clean up. What a nice little lesson for his son to learn. Fall in love, and you get to watch your love get shot.</p><p>\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here?\u201d I ask Warner. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m alive?\u201d</p> <p>Warner shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And I think, Good. That\u2019s very good. It\u2019ll be so much better if he thinks I\u2019m dead.</p><p>Warner is still looking at me. Looking and looking and looking at me like he wants to touch me but he\u2019s afraid to get too close. Finally, he whispers, \u201cAre you okay, love? How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>And I smile to myself, thinking of all the ways I could answer that question.</p><p>I think of how my body is more exhausted, more defeated, more drained than it\u2019s ever been in my life. I think about how I\u2019ve had nothing but a glass of water in 2 days. How I\u2019ve never been more confused about people, about who they seem to be and who they actually are, and I think about how I\u2019m lying here, sharing a bed in a house we were told doesn\u2019t exist anymore, with one of the most hated and feared people of Sector 45. And I think about how that terrifying creature has the capacity for such tenderness, how he saved my life. How his own father shot me in the chest. How only hours earlier I was lying in a pool of my own blood.</p><p>I think about how my friends are probably still locked in battle, how Adam must be suffering not knowing where I am or what\u2019s happened to me. How Kenji is still pulling the weight of so many. How Brendan and Winston might still be lost. How the people of Omega Point might all be dead. And it makes me think.</p><p>I feel better than I ever have in my entire life.</p><p>I\u2019m amazed by how different I feel now. How different I know things will be now. I have so many things to do. So many scores to settle. So many friends who need my help.</p><p>Everything has changed.</p><p>Because once upon a time I was just a child.</p><p>Today I\u2019m still just a child, but this time I\u2019ve got an iron will and 2 fists made of steel and I\u2019ve aged 50 years. Now I finally have a clue. I\u2019ve finally figured out that I\u2019m strong enough, that maybe I\u2019m a touch brave enough, that maybe this time I can do what I was meant to do.</p><p>This time I am a force.</p><p>A deviation of human nature.</p><p>I am living, breathing proof that nature is officially screwed, afraid of what it\u2019s done, what it\u2019s become.</p><p>And I\u2019m stronger. I\u2019m angrier.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to do something I\u2019ll definitely regret and this time I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m done being nice. I\u2019m done being nervous. I\u2019m not afraid of anything anymore.</p><p>Mass chaos is in my future.</p><p>And I\u2019m leaving my gloves behind. </p> </body></html>"]
