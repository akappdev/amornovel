I hate to look at it. I hate it when it stutters and trembles and reminds me that my identity is gone. But I look at it anyway; because it also reminds me that I\u2019m going to find the boy who took everything from me. I\u2019m going to kill the boy who killed me, and when I kill him, I\u2019m going to do it with my left hand.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Nastya</p> <p>Dying really isn\u2019t so bad after you\u2019ve done it once.</p><p>And I have.</p><p>I\u2019m not afraid of death anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid of everything else.</p><p>August in Florida means three things: heat, oppressive humidity, and school. School. I haven\u2019t been to school in over two years. Not unless you count sitting at the kitchen table being home-schooled by your mom, and I don\u2019t. It\u2019s Friday. My senior year starts on Monday, but I haven\u2019t registered. If I don\u2019t go in today, I won\u2019t have a schedule on Monday morning, and I\u2019ll have to wait at the office for one. I think I\u2019d rather skip the bad 80\u2019s movie scene where I walk in late on the first day and everybody has to stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at me, because while that wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing that would ever happen to me, it would still suck.</p> <p>My aunt pulls into the parking lot of Mill Creek Community High School with me in tow. It\u2019s a cookie cutter high school. Except for the putrid color of the walls and the name on the sign, it\u2019s an exact replica of the last one I attended. Margot\u200c\u2014\u200cshe made me drop the aunt part because it makes her feel old\u200c\u2014\u200cturns down the radio she\u2019s been blaring the entire way here. Thankfully it\u2019s a short ride, because loud sounds make me edgy. It\u2019s not the sound itself that bothers me; it\u2019s just the fact that it\u2019s loud. The loud sounds make it impossible to hear the soft ones and the soft sounds are the ones you have to be afraid of. I can handle it now because we\u2019re in a car, and I usually feel safe in cars. Outside is a different story. I never feel safe outside.</p><p>\u201cYour mother expects a phone call when we\u2019re done here,\u201d Margot tells me. My mother expects a lot of things she\u2019s never going to get. In the scheme of things, a phone call is not much to ask, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll get one. \u201cYou could at least text her. Four words. Registered. All is well. If you\u2019re feeling really generous, you could even throw one of those little happy faces on the end.\u201d</p><p>I look sideways at her from the passenger seat. Margot is my mother\u2019s younger sister by a good ten years. She is the opposite of my mother in almost every way. She doesn\u2019t even look like her which means that she doesn\u2019t look like me, either, because I am a carbon copy of my mother. Margot is dirty blond with blue eyes and a perpetual tan that she easily maintains by working nights and napping by the pool during the day; even though she\u2019s a nurse and she should know better. I have pale white skin, dark brown eyes, and long, wavy, just-this-side-of-black hair. She looks like she belongs in a Coppertone ad. I look like I belong in a coffin. People would have to be stupid to believe we\u2019re related, even if it is one of the only things about me that\u2019s true.</p><p>She\u2019s still got that cocky smile on her face, knowing that even if she hasn\u2019t convinced me to placate my mother, then at least she\u2019s planted a little guilt. It\u2019s impossible to dislike Margot, even when you really, really try, which makes me hate her a little, because I\u2019ll never be one of those people. She took me in, not because I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go, but because I don\u2019t have anywhere else I can stand to be. Luckily for her, she really only has to see me in passing, because once school starts, we\u2019ll rarely ever be home at the same time. Even so, I doubt taking in a sullen, bitter, teenage girl with more issues than National Geographic is at the center of the vision board for a single woman in her early thirties. I wouldn\u2019t do it, but then I\u2019m not a very good person. Maybe that\u2019s why I ran like hell from the people who love me the most. If I could be alone, I would. Gratefully. I\u2019d rather be alone than have to pretend I\u2019m okay. But they won\u2019t give me that option. So I\u2019ll settle for being with someone who at least doesn\u2019t love me as much. I\u2019m thankful for Margot. Not that I tell her this. Not that I tell her anything. I don\u2019t.</p><p>When I walk in, the main office is a mass of commotion. Phones ringing, copiers running, voices everywhere. There are three lines leading up to the front counter. I don\u2019t know which one to get into so I pick the one closest to the door and hope for the best. Margot sweeps in behind me and immediately pulls me around the side, past all of the lines, and up to the receptionist. She\u2019s lucky I saw her coming, or the second her hand was on my arm, she would have found herself face down on the ground with my knee in her back.</p><p>\u201cWe have an appointment with Mr. Armour, the principal,\u201d she says authoritatively. Margot, the responsible adult. She\u2019s playing my mom\u2019s part today. This is a side of her I don\u2019t usually see. She prefers the cool aunt role. She doesn\u2019t have any kids of her own, so this is a little out of her depth. I didn\u2019t even realize we had an appointment, but I see the sense in it now. The receptionist, a fiftyish, unpleasant-looking woman, motions us to a couple of chairs next to a closed, dark wood door.</p> <p>We only have to wait a few minutes and no one notices or acknowledges me at all. The anonymity is nice. I wonder how long it will last. I look down at myself. I didn\u2019t get decked out for the visit today. I expected to come in, fill out some paperwork, hand over some immunization records and be done with it. I wasn\u2019t expecting the swarms of students crowding the office. I\u2019m wearing jeans and a black v-neck t-shirt, both a little \u2013 ok, a lot \u2013 tighter than they need to be, but otherwise completely non-descript. The shoes are where I made the effort. Black stilettos. Four-and-a-half inches of insanity. I\u2019m not using them so much for the height, even though I seriously need it, as for the effect. I wouldn\u2019t have bothered with them today, except I needed the practice. My balance on them has gotten better, but I figured a dress rehearsal wouldn\u2019t hurt. I\u2019d prefer to avoid eating ass on my first day of school.</p><p>I look at the clock on the wall. The second hand is bouncing back and forth inside my head, even though I know I can\u2019t possibly hear the ticking over everything else going on. I wish I could tune out the noise in this room. It\u2019s disconcerting. There are too many sounds at once and my brain is trying to separate them, to sort them out into neat little piles, but it\u2019s almost impossible with all of the machines and voices melting together. I open and close my hand in my lap and hope we get called in soon.</p><p>A few minutes that seem like an hour later, the heavy wooden door opens and we\u2019re ushered inside by a forty-something man in an ill-fitting shirt and tie. Attire aside, he\u2019s not a bad-looking guy. Too good-looking to be a principal. He smiles warmly before sliding back behind his desk, into an oversized leather chair. The desk is imposing. Too big for this office. Obviously the furniture is meant to intimidate, because the man does not. Even before he\u2019s said much, I peg him as soft. I hope I\u2019m right. I\u2019m going to need him on this.</p><p>I settle back into one of two matching burgundy leather chairs opposite Mr. Armour\u2019s desk. Margot sinks into the chair next to me and launches into her spiel. I listen for a few minutes as she explains my \u201cunique situation\u201d to him. Unique situation, indeed. As she goes into detail, I see him glance over at me. His eyes widen just slightly as he looks closer, and I catch the glimmer of recognition in them. Yes, that\u2019s me. He remembers me. If I had gotten further away, this might not even be necessary. The name wouldn\u2019t mean much of anything. The face would mean even less. But I\u2019m only two hours from ground zero and if even one person puts it together, I\u2019ll be right back where I was there. I can\u2019t take the chance, so here we sit, in Mr. Armour\u2019s office, three days before the start of my senior year. Nothing like last minute. Though this, at least, is not my fault. My parents fought the move until the end, but they finally relented. I may have Margot to thank for some of that. Though I think the fact that I broke my father\u2019s heart helped the cause a little, too. And, probably, they were all just tired.</p><p>I\u2019m completely zoned out on the conversation now, and I\u2019m busy checking out Armour\u2019s office. There\u2019s not much to distract, a couple of houseplants that look like they need to be watered, along with a few family pictures. The diploma on the wall is from the University of Michigan. His first name is Alvis. Huh. What kind of crap name is Alvis? I don\u2019t even think it means anything, but I\u2019ll definitely check later. I\u2019m running through possible origins in my head when I see Margot pulling out a file and handing it to him. Doctor\u2019s notes. Lots of them. As he looks over the paperwork, my eyes are drawn to the old-school metal hand-crank pencil sharpener on his desk. It strikes me as odd. The desk is a rich, fancy cherry number, nothing like the crap industrial ones teachers get. Why anyone would mount such an ancient pencil sharpener on it is beyond me. It\u2019s a complete contradiction. I wish I could ask about it. Instead, I focus on the ring of adjustable pencil holes and wonder idly if my pinky finger would fit into any of them. I\u2019m contemplating how much it would hurt to sharpen it, and how much blood there might be, when I hear Mr. Armour\u2019s tone shift.</p><p>\u201cNot at all?\u201d He sounds nervous.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Margot confirms. She\u2019s got her put-on, no-nonsense demeanor in full swing.</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, we\u2019ll do what we can. I\u2019ll make sure her teachers are informed before Monday. Has she filled in a class request form?\u201d And like clockwork, we\u2019ve gotten to the part where he\u2019s started to talk about me like I\u2019m not in the room. Margot hands him the form and he peruses it quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll get this to the guidance department so they can have a schedule drawn up by Monday morning. I can\u2019t promise she\u2019ll get these electives. Most classes are already full at this point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe understand. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do whatever possible. We appreciate your cooperation and, of course, your discretion,\u201d Margot adds. It\u2019s a warning. Go Margot. I think it\u2019s kind of wasted on him, though. I do get the feeling he genuinely wants to help. Plus, I think I make him uncomfortable, which means he probably hopes to see as little of me as possible.</p><p>Mr. Armour walks us to the door, shaking Margot\u2019s hand and nodding almost imperceptibly at me with a strained smile that I think might be pity, or possibly, disdain. Then, just as quickly, he looks away. He follows us back into the chaos of the front office and asks us to wait a moment while he heads down a hallway to the guidance office with my paperwork.</p><p>I look around and see that several of the same people I saw earlier are still waiting in line. I thank whatever god still believes in me for appointments. I\u2019d rather clean the inside of a Port-O-Let with my tongue than spend another minute in this cacophony. We stand against the wall as far out of the way as we can get. There are no empty chairs now. I glance to the front of the line where a dirty-blonde Ken doll is tossing his most panty-dropping smile in the direction of Ms. Unpleasant on the other side of the counter. Ms. Unpleasant is now positively glowing in the aura of this boy\u2019s flirtations. I don\u2019t blame her. He\u2019s the kind of good-looking that transforms once self-respecting females into useless puddles of dumbass. I struggle to separate out their conversation. Something about an office aide position. Aahh, lazy bastard. He cocks his head to the side and says something that makes Ms. Unpleasant laugh and shake her head in resignation. He\u2019s won whatever it is he came here for. I watch the slight shift in his eyes. He knows it, too. I\u2019m almost impressed. While he\u2019s waiting, the door opens again and a psychotically cute girl walks in and scans the room until her eyes land on him.</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d she yells over the commotion and everyone turns. She seems oblivious to the attention. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit in the car all day! Come on!\u201d I check her out while she glowers at him. She\u2019s blonde, like him, though not exactly; her hair is lighter, like she spent the whole summer in the sun. She\u2019s attractive in the most obvious way possible, wearing a pink, well-filled out halter top and carrying an obsessively color-coordinated, pink Coach purse. He seems mildly amused by her displeasure. Must be his girlfriend. A matching set, I think. Panty-Combusting Ken comes complete with Piqued Princess Barbie: unachievable measurements, designer purse and annoyed scowl included! He holds up a finger to her to convey that he\u2019ll just be a minute. If I were him, I\u2019d choose a different finger. I smirk at the thought and glance up to see him smirking right back at me, his eyes alight with mischief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind him, Ms. Unpleasant quickly scrawls something on his form and signs the bottom. She passes it back to him, but he\u2019s still looking at me. I point to her and raise my eyebrows at him. Aren\u2019t you going to get what you came for? He turns and takes the form from her hands, thanks her and winks. He winks at the menopausal office lady. He\u2019s so blatantly obvious, it\u2019s almost inspired. Almost. She shakes her head again and shoos him toward the door. Well-played, Ken, well-played.</p><p>While I\u2019ve been amusing myself with the office drama, Margot\u2019s been whispering with a woman who I assume is the guidance counselor. Drew, who I desperately want to keep calling Ken, is still standing near the door, talking to a couple other guys who are waiting at the back of the line. I wonder if he\u2019s purposely trying to piss off Barbie. It seems easily done.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Margot re-emerges, ushering me toward the front doors.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d a woman\u2019s raised voice shrills, before we make it to the exit. Everyone in line turns in unison, watching the woman hold up a file folder in my direction. \u201cHow do you pronounce this name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNAH-stee-ya,\u201d Margot enunciates, and I inwardly cringe, acutely aware of the audience around us. \u201cNastya Kashnikov. It\u2019s Russian.\u201d She tosses the last two words off over her shoulder, obviously pleased with herself for some reason. We head out the door with everyone\u2019s eyes on our backs.</p><p>When we reach the car, she lets out a sigh and her demeanor noticeably shifts back to the Margot I know. \u201cWell, that hurdle\u2019s cleared. For now,\u201d she adds. Then she smiles her dazzling, all-American-girl smile. \u201cIce cream?\u201d she asks, sounding like she might need it more than me. I smile back, because even at 10:30 in the morning, there\u2019s only one answer to that question.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Josh</p><p>Monday, 7:02 AM. Pointless. That\u2019s what today is going to be, along with the 179 school days that come after it. I\u2019d contemplate the waste of it all now if I had the time, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna be late as it is. I head to the laundry room and yank some clothes out of the still-running dryer. I forgot to turn it on last night, but I don\u2019t have time to wait; so now I\u2019m stuck pulling on a pair of damp jeans while I walk and trying not to trip over myself. Whatever. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m surprised.</p> <p>I grab a coffee mug out of the cabinet and attempt to fill it without spilling it all over the counter and burning myself in the process. I put it on the kitchen table, next to a shoe box full of prescription bottles, in time to see my grandfather coming out of his room. His white hair is so disheveled that he momentarily reminds me of a mad scientist. He walks alarmingly slow, but I know better than to offer to help him. He hates that. He used to be so badass and now he\u2019s not, and he feels every bit of that loss.</p><p>\u201cCoffee\u2019s on the table,\u201d I say, grabbing my keys and heading for the door. \u201cI laid out your pills and logged them already. Bill\u2019s coming in an hour. You sure you\u2019ll be ok until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an invalid, Josh,\u201d he practically growls at me. I try not to smile. He\u2019s pissed. Pissed is good. It makes things seem a little bit normal.</p><p>I\u2019m in my truck and down the driveway in seconds, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be enough. I don\u2019t live far from school, but the back-up to get into the parking lot on the first day is always a bitch. Most teachers will look the other way today, but I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it anyway; no one\u2019s going to give me a detention, late or not. I floor it, and a couple of minutes later, I\u2019m waiting to get into the lot. The line of cars snakes out onto the road, but at least it\u2019s periodically moving. I\u2019m running on four hours of sleep and only one cup of coffee. I wish I had had time to grab another one for myself, but I didn\u2019t, and it probably would have ended up in my lap by the time I got to school anyway.</p><p>I pull out my schedule while I\u2019m idling and check it again. Shop isn\u2019t until fourth period, but at least it\u2019s not all the way at the end of the day. The rest of it I don\u2019t give a shit about.</p><p>When I finally make it onto campus, Drew is out front with his usual followers, regaling them with any number of BS stories about his summer. I know they\u2019re all BS because he spent most of the summer hanging out with me and I know for a fact that we didn\u2019t do crap. Apart from the time he spent disappearing with whatever girl he was hooking up with, he was on my couch. Looking at him now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone happier to be back at school. I\u2019d roll my eyes if it didn\u2019t seem such a chick thing to do, so instead, I just stare blankly ahead and keep walking. He nods in my direction as I pass, and I return the gesture. I\u2019ll talk to him later. He knows I won\u2019t go near him when he\u2019s surrounded. No one else acknowledges me and I pass through the rest of the crowds, into the main courtyard, just as the first bell rings.</p> <p>My first three classes could all be the same. All I do is listen to rules, pick up syllabi and try to stay awake. My grandfather was up five times last night, which means I was up five times last night, too. I really have to start getting more sleep. In a week you will, I think bitterly, but I won\u2019t dwell on that now.</p><p>10:45 AM. First lunch. I\u2019d rather just head straight to shop. Eating this early sucks. I make my way to the courtyard and park myself on the back of the bench farthest from the center, the same one I\u2019ve sat at for the past two years. No one bothers me because it\u2019s easier to pretend I don\u2019t exist. I\u2019d rather spend the half-hour sweeping sawdust than sitting here, but there isn\u2019t any sawdust to sweep yet. At least it\u2019s early enough that the metal benches aren\u2019t scorching under the sun. Now I just have to wait out the next thirty minutes, which will probably be the longest of the day.</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Surviving. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now, and it hasn\u2019t been quite as horrible as I expected. I get a lot of sideways looks, probably because of the way I\u2019m dressed, but other than that, no one really talks to me. Except for Drew, the Ken doll. I did run into him this morning, but mostly it was a non-event. He talked. I walked. He gave up. I\u2019ve made it to lunch and this is the test. No one\u2019s really had much of an opportunity for socializing yet, so I\u2019ve been able to skate below the surface, but lunch is just a highly unsupervised hell dimension. Avoidance seems the best option at first, but I have to face the looks and the comments at some point. Personally, I\u2019d rather shove a cactus up my ass, but apparently that option isn\u2019t on the table, so I might as well just rip the Band-Aid off now and get it over with. Then, I\u2019ll find an empty restroom and check my hair and fix my lipstick or as we cowards like to call it\u200c\u2014\u200chide.</p><p>I try to surreptitiously check out my clothes and make sure nothing\u2019s where it shouldn\u2019t be and that I\u2019m not flashing anything more than I\u2019d originally planned. I\u2019ve got on the same stilettos as Friday, but this time I went with a low cut black tank top and an almost non-existent skirt that my ass doesn\u2019t look half-bad in. I left my hair down so it falls past my shoulders and covers the scar on my forehead. My eyes are rimmed with thick black eyeliner. It\u2019s slutty and probably only attractive to the basest of human creatures. Drew. I smile to myself as I recall him looking me up and down in the hallway this morning. Barbie would be pissed.</p><p>I don\u2019t dress this way because I like it so much or because I want people to stare at me in general. But people are going to stare at me for the wrong reasons anyway, and if they are going to stare at me for the wrong reasons, then at least I should get to pick them. Plus, a little unwelcome staring is a small price to pay for scaring everyone off. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a girl in the school who will want to talk to me, and any boy who\u2019s interested probably won\u2019t be much for conversation. And so what? If I\u2019m going to get unwanted attention, better it be for my ass than for my psychosis and my effed-up hand.</p><p>Margot hadn\u2019t gotten home by the time I left for school this morning or she might have tried to talk me out of it. I wouldn\u2019t have blamed her. I think my first period teacher wanted to nail me on a dress code violation when I first walked in; but once he checked my name on his roster, he ushered me to a seat and didn\u2019t look at me again for the rest of the class.</p><p>Three years ago, my mother would have had a fit, cried, lamented her shortcomings as a parent, or possibly just locked me in my room, if she saw me at school like this. Today, she\u2019d look disappointed but would ask if it made me happy and I\u2019d nod my head and lie so we could pretend it wasn\u2019t a problem. The clothes probably wouldn\u2019t even be the biggest issue, because I\u2019m not sure she would mind the streetwalker uniform nearly as much as the make-up. My mother loves her face. It\u2019s not out of arrogance or conceit; it\u2019s out of respect. She\u2019s grateful for what she was born with. She should be. It\u2019s an awesome face, a perfect face, an ethereal face. The kind people write songs and poems and suicide notes about. It\u2019s that exotic kind of beauty that men in romance novels obsess over, even if they have no idea who you are, because they must possess you. That kind of beauty. That\u2019s my mom. I grew up wanting to look just like her. Some people tell me I do, and maybe it\u2019s true, under there somewhere. If you scrape off the make-up and dress me to look like a girl as opposed to what I look like now\u200c\u2014\u200ca profanity-spewing guttersnipe being dragged out of a crack house on Cops.</p> <p>I imagine my mother shaking her head and giving me the disappointed look, but she chooses her battles these days and I\u2019m not sure this one would make the cut. Mom\u2019s beginning to believe I may be a lost cause and that\u2019s a good thing. Because I am, and I left her house so she could accept it. I was a lost cause a long time ago. That thought makes me sad for my mother, because she didn\u2019t ask for any of this. She thought she\u2019d gotten her miracle, and I was the only one who knew she hadn\u2019t, no matter how much I wanted to give it to her. Maybe I was the one who took it away.</p><p>Which brings me back to the courtyard, where I am still waiting on the outskirts like a guest on an episode of Extreme Avoidance: High School Edition. I planned to get here early enough to make it across before lunch was in full swing, but I got sidelined by my history teacher, and that three minutes meant the difference between a half-empty courtyard and the one teeming with students that I\u2019m staring at right now. I\u2019m focused, at the moment, on the brick pavers covering the entirety of said courtyard, and seriously questioning the wisdom of my four-and-a-half-inch stilettos. I\u2019m gauging my odds of making it across with both my ankles and my dignity intact when I hear a voice to my right call out.</p><p>I turn instinctively, but I know immediately that it\u2019s the wrong thing to do. Sitting on a bench, a couple feet away, is the owner of that voice and he\u2019s looking right at me. He\u2019s leaning back casually, with his legs spread farther apart than they need to be in a blatant display of wishful thinking. He smiles, and I can\u2019t deny that he knows he\u2019s good-looking. If self-adoration were cologne, he would be the boy you couldn\u2019t stand next to without choking. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Like me. We could be brother and sister, or one of those really creepy couples who look like they should be brother and sister. I\u2019m pissed at myself for looking. Now, when I turn and ignore him to make my way across the battlefield, I can be certain that his eyes\u200c\u2014\u200cas well as every other set of eyes on that bench with him\u200c\u2014\u200care going to be trained on my back. And when I say my back, I mean my ass. I re-contemplate the unstable surface of the pavers. No pressure or anything. I avert my eyes back to the task at hand in time to hear him add, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for someplace to sit, my lap is free.\u201d And there it is. It\u2019s not even clever or original, but his equally wit-free friends laugh anyway. There go my hopes for our bourgeoning sibling kinship. I step off the ledge and start walking, keeping my eyes trained straight ahead as if I have some purpose outside of simply surviving this walk. I\u2019m not even halfway through the day. I still have four of the seven classes left on the schedule that shit gave birth to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I got to school early enough this morning to stop in the office and pick up my schedule. Of course, if I\u2019d known at the time what I\u2019d find on it, I might have put off the inevitable. It was crazy in there again, but Ms. Marsh, the guidance counselor, had given instructions for me to go to her office and pick up my schedule from her personally\u200c\u2014\u200cjust another one of the many perks of being me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Nastya, Nastya,\u201d she said, repeating my name with two different pronunciations and absent-mindedly looking to me for confirmation, which I didn\u2019t give her. She was far too cheery for the first day of school or for seven o\u2019clock in the morning in general. It was definitely unnatural. It\u2019s probably a class for guidance counselors only\u200c\u2014\u200cHow to Emit Inappropriate Joy in the Face of Adolescent Horror. I\u2019m fairly certain they don\u2019t make teachers take it, because they don\u2019t even bother to pretend. Half of them are as miserable as I am.</p><p>She motioned for me to sit. I didn\u2019t. My skirt was way too short for sitting in a chair that didn\u2019t have a desk obscuring it. She handed me a map of campus and my schedule. I scanned it, mostly looking for the electives, because I knew what all the required courses were going to be. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. For a minute I was convinced she must have handed me the wrong schedule, so I checked the top of the paper. No, that\u2019s me. I wasn\u2019t sure what the right reaction was in that situation. You know the one, where the universe decides to put its steel-toed boot up your ass yet again. Crying was out of the question and a screaming hissy-fit laced with maniacal laughter and profanity was, most definitely, off the table, which left me with my only other option\u200c\u2014\u200cstunned silence.</p><p>Ms. Marsh must have caught the look on my face, and I\u2019m betting it was pretty expressive, because she immediately launched into a detailed explanation involving graduation requirements and over-filled electives. She sounded almost like she was apologizing to me and maybe she should have been, because it seriously sucked, but I almost wished I could have told her it was okay, so she\u2019d stop feeling bad. I\u2019d survive it. It would take more than a few shitty classes to break me. I took my schedule, my map, and my abject horror and made my way to class, reading it again and again as I went. Unfortunately, it stayed the same every time.</p> <p>At this point, I\u2019ve made it almost to the halfway mark. It hasn\u2019t been so bad, relatively speaking, and everything in my life is relative. My teachers aren\u2019t horrible. My English teacher, Ms. McAllister, actually looks me in the eye like she\u2019s daring me to expect her to treat me differently. I like her. But the worst is yet to come so I won\u2019t start pouring the champagne just yet.</p><p>Plus, I still have to navigate the trail of tears that is this courtyard. I\u2019m nothing if not a coward, but I can\u2019t put it off much longer. I\u2019m about six feet in and not doing so badly. I\u2019m focused on my goal\u200c\u2014\u200cthe beacon that is the double-door entrance to the English wing\u200c\u2014\u200con the opposite side of my brick-lined square nemesis. I take in everything I can with my peripheral vision. It\u2019s packed out here. And loud. So unbearably loud. I try to let all of the separate conversations and voices melt together into what I imagine is one continuous hum. There are small groups around all of the benches, piled on top of them and standing next to them. Some students sit on the outer edges of the garden boxes that are placed incrementally throughout. Then, there are the smart ones who sit on the ground in the shade of the walkway that runs around the perimeter. There aren\u2019t enough places to sit, there\u2019s barely any reprieve from the sun, and it\u2019s hotter than hell out here. I can\u2019t imagine the utter craphole the cafeteria must be that this many people would rather sweat their asses off out here to avoid it. My old high school was the same way, but I never had to deal with the lunch period madness or any of the decisions that came along with it, like where to sit and who to sit with. I spent every lunch period practicing in the music room and that was the only place I wanted to be.</p><p>By now, I\u2019m almost there. So far I\u2019ve only seen a few faces I recognize: a boy who was in my history class, sitting by himself reading a book and a couple of girls from math, who are giggling with angry Barbie of front office-tirade fame. I can feel some of the looks I\u2019m getting, but other than the ego-addled ass**le with the free lap seating, no one else has spoken to me. There are two more benches I have to pass to get to the doors and it\u2019s the one on the left that catches my attention. It\u2019s empty, save for one boy, sitting right in the middle. It might not seem strange except for the fact that every other bench in this place, in truth every other place where a person could justifiably put their ass, is filled. Yet there is no one sitting on that bench, except him. When I look more closely, there\u2019s no one even hanging around in the immediate vicinity. It\u2019s like there\u2019s an invisible force field surrounding this space and he\u2019s the only one inside it. Curiosity claims me, and I momentarily forget my purpose. I can\u2019t help but look at the boy. He\u2019s perched on top of the backrest, his worn-out brown work boots planted firmly on the seat. He\u2019s leaning over with his elbows resting on his knees in a pair of faded jeans. I can\u2019t see his face very well. His light brown hair hangs tousled over his forehead, and his eyes are cast downward at his hands. He\u2019s not eating; he\u2019s not reading; he\u2019s not looking at anyone. Until he is. And then he\u2019s looking at me. Crap.</p><p>I turn away instantly, but it\u2019s still too late. It wasn\u2019t like I just glanced at him. I was at a dead stop, in the middle of the courtyard, full-on staring. I\u2019m only steps away from the asylum beyond those double doors and I take the risk of quickening my walk as much as I can without drawing attention. I make it to the relative obscurity of the building\u2019s overhang and reach for the door handle and pull. Nothing. It doesn\u2019t give. And I repeat, crap. It\u2019s locked. It\u2019s the middle of the day. Why would they lock the doors from the outside?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s locked,\u201d a voice from below me says. No shit. I look down. I hadn\u2019t even noticed the boy with the sketchbook, sitting on the ground right next to the doors. Where he\u2019s positioned, he\u2019s blocked by a large planter box, invisible from the main courtyard. Smart kid. His clothes are a mess and his hair looks like it hasn\u2019t seen a brush in a week. He\u2019s sitting shoulder to shoulder with a brown-haired girl wearing sunglasses in the shade and holding a camera. She looks up at me briefly before turning her attention back to her camera. Other than the sunglasses, she\u2019s entirely non-descript. I wonder if I should have gone that route, but it\u2019s too late to second guess now.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want anyone sneaking in to smoke in the bathrooms during lunch,\u201d sketchbook boy with holes in his concert t-shirt tells me.</p><p>Oh. I wonder what happens if you\u2019re late to class. I guess you\u2019re just SOL. I\u2019m trying to figure out some other escape route, when I notice he\u2019s still craning his neck up and looking at me. It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not a couple of steps closer or I\u2019m quite sure he could see right up my nearly non-existent skirt. At least I\u2019m wearing cute underwear; they\u2019re the only thing on me that isn\u2019t black. I glance at the sketchbook he\u2019s holding. His arm is draped over the top so I can\u2019t see what he\u2019s drawing. I wonder if he\u2019s any good. I can\u2019t draw for crap. I nod my head in thanks to him and turn to see if I can find somewhere else to go. Before I can walk away, two girls come barreling out of the door, almost running me down and knocking me off of my awesome shoes. They\u2019re talking a mile-a-minute and don\u2019t even notice me there, which is fine, because I\u2019m able to slip through the doors just past them. I wander into the cool, empty reprieve of the English building and remember how to breathe.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Josh</p><p>Fourth hour can\u2019t come soon enough. I\u2019m sweating already from sitting out in the sun at lunch, but there won\u2019t be much in the way of air-conditioning in the workshop. When I walk in, I immediately feel at home, even though the space looks entirely different than it did in June. There aren\u2019t tools and pieces of lumber on every surface. No carpet of sawdust covering the floor. No machines running. It\u2019s the quiet that\u2019s initially unnerving. It\u2019s not supposed to be quiet in here and this is the only time of year when it is. The first couple weeks are a rehash of rules for equipment usage and safety procedures that I could recite verbatim if anybody asked. Nobody asks. Everybody knows I know them. I could teach this class if I wanted to. I throw my books down on the far corner work table where I sit every year, at least during the time we\u2019re expected to sit. Before I can pull the stool out from under the table, Mr. Turner calls me over.</p><p>I like Mr. Turner, but he doesn\u2019t care whether I like him or not. He wants my respect and he has that, too. What he tells me to do, I do. He\u2019s one of the few people who don\u2019t mind expecting things from me. At this point, I think I\u2019ve learned as much from Mr. Turner as I did from my dad.</p> <p>Mr. Turner\u2019s been running this program for as long as anyone can remember, years before I got here, when it wasn\u2019t anything more than a cop-out elective. Now it\u2019s one of the premier programs in the state. He runs it like a business wrapped around a master class in craftsmanship. In the advanced classes, our work raises the money for the materials and the equipment. We take orders, fill them and that money gets filtered back into the program.</p><p>You don\u2019t get into the advanced classes without going through the introductory levels first and even that isn\u2019t a guarantee. Mr. Turner only takes the students who live up to his expectations in terms of work ethic and ability. That\u2019s how he keeps the upper level classes so small. You need his approval to get in, and in a school with overflowing electives around every corner, he\u2019s still able to get away with it because he\u2019s that good.</p><p>When I get to his desk, he asks about my summer. He\u2019s trying to be polite but he knows me well enough that he doesn\u2019t have to bother. I\u2019ve been in one of his classes every year since ninth grade. He knows my shit and he knows me. All I really want to do is build stuff and be left alone and he allows me both. I answer in as few words as possible and he nods, knowing we\u2019re done with the pretense.</p><p>\u201cTheater department wants shelving built in their prop storage room. Can you head over there, take the measurements, plan it out and make a list of what we need? You don\u2019t need to be here for all this.\u201d He picks up a stack of papers, which I assume are handouts on rules and procedures, with a measured amount of boredom and resignation. He just wants to build, too. But he also doesn\u2019t want someone losing a finger. \u201cBring me what you come up with at the end of class and I\u2019ll get you what you need. You can probably have it finished up in a week or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I hold back a smile. The preliminary crap is the only part of this class I don\u2019t like and I\u2019ve just been freed from it. I get to build, even if it is just shelves. And I get to do it away from everybody else.</p><p>I scrawl my signature across the bottom of the waivers and hand them back to him. Then I grab my books in time to see a couple other kids coming in. There shouldn\u2019t be many\u200c\u2014\u200cprobably only about a dozen or so students\u200c\u2014\u200cin this section. I know everybody who\u2019s come in so far, except for one person; the girl from the courtyard\u200c\u2014\u200cthe one who was watching me. She can\u2019t possibly be in this class. She must agree, judging by the look on her face as she scans the room, taking in everything from the high ceilings down to the industrial power tools. Her eyes narrow just slightly with curiosity, but that\u2019s all I see of her because this time she turns and catches me looking.</p><p>I watch people a lot. Normally it\u2019s not an issue because no one really looks at me, and if they do, I\u2019m pretty adept at looking away fast. Very fast. But damn if that girl wasn\u2019t faster. I know she\u2019s new here. If not, she\u2019s made some drastic, unfortunate transformation over the summer, because I\u2019m more than aware of most of the people on this campus, and even if I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d remember the girl who comes to school looking like an undead whore. Regardless, I\u2019m out the door about ten seconds later and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll have worked out her schedule before I get back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hole up in the theater prop room for all of fourth period, measuring and drawing up plans and material lists for the shelving they need. There\u2019s no clock in here and I\u2019m not ready when the bell rings. I shove the legal pad with my notes on it into my backpack and head out towards the English wing. I get to Ms. McAllister\u2019s room and walk past everyone still milling around in the hallway, eking out every last second to socialize before the bell rings. The door is propped open and Ms. McAllister looks up when I walk in.</p><p>\u201cAah, Mr. Bennett. We meet again.\u201d I had her last year. They must have moved her up from junior to senior English.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolite as always. How was your summer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the third person who\u2019s asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon-answer. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill loquacious,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>\u201cStill ironic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose we are both nothing if not consistent.\u201d She stands up and turns to pick up her roster and three stacks of papers off the top of the file cabinet behind her.</p><p>\u201cCan you bring that desk up to the front for me?\u201d She points at a lopsided desk in the corner of the room. I drop my things on a desk in the back and walk over to pick up the broken one and move it to the front. \u201cJust put it there.\u201d She motions in front of the whiteboard. \u201cI just need something to put all of this on so I can talk.\u201d She drops the stacks of papers onto the desk as the warning bell rings.</p><p>\u201cYou need a podium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh, I\u2019m lucky to have a desk with a working drawer,\u201d she notes with forced exasperation, walking over to the open classroom door without missing a beat. \u201cYou fools better get in here before that bell rings because I do believe in giving detention on the first day of school and I give morning detention not afternoon.\u201d She sing-songs the last couple of words as a mass of students barrels into the room just before the tardy bell goes off.</p><p>Ms. McAllister doesn\u2019t do bullshit. She\u2019s not intimidated by the popular kids or the ones with the rich parents and she doesn\u2019t want to be your friend. Last year, she managed to convince me that there was actually something here that might be worth learning without ever once making me talk in class.</p><p>Generally, I have two types of teachers. There are the ones who ignore me completely and pretend I don\u2019t exist, and there are the ones who call me out and force attention on me because they think it\u2019s good for me\u200c\u2014\u200cor maybe just because it gives them some sort of control-freakish thrill to know that they can. Ms. McAllister isn\u2019t either of those. She leaves me alone without ignoring me; so as teachers go, she\u2019s damn near perfect.</p> <p>She pulls out the doorstop just as Drew slips through the opening.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ms. McAllister.\u201d He smiles and winks because he has no shame.</p><p>\u201cImmune to your charms, Mr. Leighton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday, we\u2019ll recite poetry to one another.\u201d He slides into the only empty desk, right in the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cThat we will. But the poetry unit isn\u2019t until next semester so you\u2019ll have to stow your sonnets until then.\u201d She retreats to her desk and pulls a yellow slip of paper out of the drawer and walks back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be too disappointed. We do have a date tomorrow morning. Six forty-five AM. In the media center.\u201d She winks back at him as she lays the detention slip on his desk.</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Fourth hour shop class wasn\u2019t so horrible. Mr. Turner didn\u2019t pay much attention to me at all, which in a class of fourteen is pretty hard to do. He did check my schedule right off the bat to make sure I was in the right place and then asked me why they put me there. I shrugged. He shrugged. Then he handed it back, telling me I wouldn\u2019t be up to speed with everyone else, but if I really wanted to stay, he could let me be an assistant or something like that. It\u2019s obvious he doesn\u2019t really want me participating, but I think I\u2019ll stay. It\u2019s a small class where I can probably be left alone, which is as much as I\u2019m prepared to ask on day one.</p><p>I make it all the way through to fifth period before being faced with one of those inane get-to-know-you games in my suckfest of a music class\u200c\u2014\u200ca class which I will soon be clawing my way out of by any means necessary. The teacher, Miss Jennings, a cute, twenty-something woman with a blonde bob, pale skin and hatefully-perfect piano-playing hands makes us sit in a circle. An elementary school, duck-duck-goose-style circle. This affords each of us the best possible vantage point for studying, and subsequently, dissecting one another. Oh, and getting to know each other, of course. That, too.</p> <p>As get-to-know you games go, this isn\u2019t the worst I\u2019ve endured. Everyone has to say three things about themselves and one of those things has to be a lie. Then the class tries to figure out which one is the lie. It\u2019s kind of sad that I\u2019m not actually going to take part in the game, because if I was going to play, it would be fairly awesome. I\u2019m pretty sure I would hand over large quantities of cash to listen to my classmates and the adorable blonde pixie teacher debate the possible veracity of each of my responses:</p><p>My name is Nastya Kashnikov.</p><p>I was a piano-playing prodigy who doesn\u2019t belong anywhere near an Intro to Music class.</p><p>I was murdered two and a half years ago.</p><p>Discuss.</p><p>Instead, when they get to me, I sit stone-faced and silent. Ms. Jennings looks at me expectantly. Check your roster. She\u2019s still looking at me. I\u2019m looking at her. We have a weird staring thing going on between us. Check your roster. I know they told you. I\u2019m trying to will her telepathically now, but I am sadly lacking in the superpower department.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to share three things about yourself?\u201d she asks as if I am simply a moron with no clue what\u2019s going on around me.</p><p>I finally throw her a bone and shake my head as slightly as I can. No.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Don\u2019t be shy. Everyone\u2019s done it so far. It\u2019s easy. You don\u2019t have to reveal your darkest secrets or anything,\u201d she says lightly.</p><p>That\u2019s a good thing, because my darkest secrets would probably give her nightmares.</p><p>\u201cCan you at least tell everyone your name?\u201d she finally asks, obviously not one to engage in a battle of wills. Her patience is running low and she\u2019s covering.</p><p>Again, I shake my head. I have not broken eye contact with her yet, and I think it\u2019s starting to freak her out a little bit. I kind of feel sorry for her, but she should have read her paperwork before class. All the other teachers did.</p><p>\u201cO-kaaay,\u201d she drags the word out and her tone changes. She\u2019s really starting to get annoyed now, but then, so am I. I check out the dark brown roots coming through in her hair because it gives me something to focus on while her head is down, scanning what I assume is the class roster on a clipboard in front of her. \u201cWe\u2019ll use process of elimination. You must be,\u201d she pauses, her smile wavers just a little, and I know this is where it clicks because she\u2019s all sorts of aware when she looks back up at me and says, \u201cI am so sorry. You must be Nastya.\u201d</p><p>This time I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Nastya</p><p>By the time I pull into Margot\u2019s driveway at just after three o\u2019clock, I\u2019m literally drenched in relief, or maybe it\u2019s just sweat because the humidity here is ridiculous. Either way I\u2019ll take it because, for the first time today, I feel like I can breathe. All in all, it could have been worse. Word traveled fairly quickly after fifth hour but at least the day was almost done. I figure by tomorrow it will all be out in the open and then we can just get on with it.</p><p>Even seventh hour, the cruel joke that is my Speech and Debate elective, went as well as could be expected, which is saying a lot, seeing as how I\u2019m at a disadvantage with the whole speech part. We got to do the infinitely cool circle thing again, but by that point I was desensitized to both my dread and the whispers that had already begun to follow me.</p><p>My good pal, Drew, was also there. He didn\u2019t sit next to me, which I was glad for, because his comments were amusing enough and easily ignorable, but I was afraid I might have to fend off his hands, too. My relief only lasted so long before I realized that he had positioned himself directly across the circle from me so that, every time I lifted my head, I couldn\u2019t help but see him and his I-can-make-you-a-woman eyes and his I-know-what-you-look-like-under-your-clothes smirk. I bet he practices in the mirror. I think he could teach a class. I looked down at my desk and traced the names carved in the surface to keep myself from smiling, not because I found him attractive, which he undeniably was, but because he was entertaining as all hell.</p><p>I\u2019m actually kind of thankful that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s something to focus on other than the things about that class that suck; for example, everything. I should also mention that everything includes the dark-eyed, dark-haired, refreshingly charm-free jackhole from the courtyard, whose name is, apparently, Ethan. Fortunately, there were plenty of free desks in the room so I didn\u2019t have to take him up on his infinitely appealing lap offer. Not so fortunately, one of those free desks was next to mine so that\u2019s where he sat. He didn\u2019t make any more comments, but he smirked a lot, and he wasn\u2019t nearly as good at it as Drew.</p><p>I get inside and throw my backpack on the kitchen table and pull out everything that needs a signature so Margot can sign it before she goes to work. Before I can get it all unpacked, my phone vibrates, and I have to stop to dig it out. I don\u2019t bother keeping it accessible. It\u2019s not like I need it that often. It can only be one of two people. My mother or Margot. No one else uses the number; not even my dad anymore.</p><p>I only keep the phone for the most necessary of communication\u200c\u2014\u200ctexts, mostly one-way, from them to me. When I have to, I\u2019ll use it to let Margot know where I am or if I\u2019m going to be late. That was part of the deal for me staying here. It\u2019s understood that that\u2019s all the information I\u2019ll part with. No How was your day? No Did you make any friends? No Have you looked for a therapist yet? Just basic logistical facts. Talking has never been the issue. Communication is the issue.</p><p>The message is from Margot. Went to grab take-out for your first day. Back in a few. I\u2019m still trying to get used to eating at four o\u2019clock. Margot works the night shift, which means we eat dinner early so she can shower and get to work. Then again, apparently lunch here is at ten forty-five in the morning, so I guess it all works out.</p><p>I kick off the torture devices and change into running clothes so I can go after the early bird special. I\u2019d go now, but it\u2019s hot and I make sure never to be outside at this time of day when the sun has a way of stalking me, searing memories into my skin. I won\u2019t even go out to check the mail if I don\u2019t have to. My phone vibrates again. I look at the screen. Mom. Hope your first day was good. Love you. M. I put the phone back on the table. She doesn\u2019t expect a reply.</p><p>Margot gets back with all manner of Chinese food. We won\u2019t need to cook for a week. That\u2019s a good thing, because I can\u2019t cook real food to save my life and I get the feeling, from the drawer full of take-out menus, that Margot can\u2019t either. I\u2019ve been here for five days and I don\u2019t think the kitchen\u2019s been used once. At least meals aren\u2019t awkward with Margot. She has no problem talking enough for both of us. Whatever I fail to bring to the conversation, she dutifully makes up for. I\u2019m not even sure she needs me sitting here.</p><p>After less than a week, I know who she\u2019s dated for the past three years and who she\u2019s dating now. I know all of her workplace gossip, even though I have no idea who any of the people she mentions are. I\u2019m sure Andrea would not appreciate the fact that Margot is telling me about her financial problems and Eric would not want me know that his girlfriend cheated on him and Kelly would be appalled to learn that I am aware of her bipolar disorder and every medication she takes for it. But the more Margot talks, the less awkward it is that I don\u2019t, and I prefer conversations about people I don\u2019t care about. The times she brings up my family are worse, because I don\u2019t want to think about them, and I can\u2019t tell her to shut the hell up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After we eat, she rushes to shower off a day\u2019s worth of sweat and suntan oil and I pack up container after container of leftovers and wait for the sun to fade so I can run.</p><p>I never even make it out the front door because the sky turns black before sunset and opens up in torrential rain. I don\u2019t mind running in rain but this is even a bit much for me. It\u2019s too difficult to see and impossible to hear anything through this kind of downpour. When I look out the sliding glass door at the back of the house, it seems like it might be raining horizontally, and even I\u2019m not desperate enough to go out in this kind of lightning. I kick off my sneakers and sit and then stand and then sit and then stand again. My brain is on the spin-cycle right now.</p><p>I have no treadmill here so I do jumping jacks in place until I get bored, switch to alternating sets of chest presses and mountain climbers, move on to weighted squats and lunges and then do as many push-ups as I can before my arms give out and I drop my face into the carpet. It\u2019s not the kind of soul-draining exhaustion I\u2019m looking for, but for tonight, it will have to do.</p><p>I pull out clothes for tomorrow and pack up all of the signed paperwork and shove it into my backpack. I almost wish I had homework, but I don\u2019t, so I wander around the living room. Margot\u2019s got a stack of newspapers piled up next to the front door and I realize that I haven\u2019t checked the birth announcements for nearly two weeks. I grab the papers and sift through them until I find the right section. The first one is disappointing. Nothing new. All of the overused classics and the same trendy crap that I wouldn\u2019t saddle a cat with, much less a kid. My name, of course, is never there, but it\u2019s not my name I\u2019m looking for. I scan four papers; there are three Alexanders, four Emmas, two Sarahs, a crapload of names ending in \u2013den (Jaden, Cayden, Braden, gag), a bunch I don\u2019t remember, and one worthy of going on my wall. I cut it out and grab my laptop. I pull up the internet and wait for my start page to load. Within seconds, I\u2019m staring at the lovely, pink-and-blue-splattered baby name website that greets me every time I get online.</p> <p>I type in my newfound query, Paavo, which turns out to be nothing but the Finnish version of Paul. It\u2019s kind of a letdown.</p><p>I like names. I collect them: names, origins, meanings. They\u2019re an easy thing to collect. They don\u2019t cost anything and they don\u2019t really take up any space. I like to look at them and pretend that they mean something; and maybe they don\u2019t, but the pretending is nice. I keep most of them on the walls of my bedroom at home\u200c\u2014\u200chome where I used to live. I keep the ones that echo. Good names with significance. Not the crap everyone seems to be using these days. I like foreign names, too; the unusual ones that you rarely see. If I ever had a baby, I\u2019d pick one of those, but babies aren\u2019t really something I see in my future, even the far off one.</p><p>I fold up the papers to put them away, glancing down one more time. Out of the corner of my eye, I catch one of the Sarahs again, and I smile. It reminds me of the one amusing part of my day.</p><p>I was running to my locker between classes and had to duck around the corner and wait when I saw Drew in a heated exchange with Barbie, two lockers down from mine. I decided that if I had to choose between being tardy to class or walking into the middle of that verbal smackdown, the tardy was the lesser of the evils. It wasn\u2019t that difficult dodging Drew\u2019s not-so-subtle come-ons when I ran into him by myself, but I certainly didn\u2019t want to take the chance that he\u2019d proposition me in front of his girlfriend. That would definitely make my ever-growing list of things I do not need. So I leaned against the wall and waited for them to move on.</p><p>\u201cGive me twenty bucks.\u201d I heard Drew say to her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Apparently annoyed is the only quality her voice possesses.</p><p>\u201cBecause I need twenty bucks.\u201d His tone indicated that this should be enough of a reason.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then, what must have been the sound of her slamming her locker. Hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d No, you won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Smart girl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I won\u2019t.\u201d I peered around and caught him flash that cocky smile at her. \u201cWhat? At least I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask one of your whores?\u201d Damn.</p><p>\u201cBecause none of them love me as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stupid grin might work on every other female in this school, but you know it won\u2019t work with me, so forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, you know you\u2019re going to give it to me, so come on.\u201d</p><p>Sarah. I smiled. I couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the absolute perfection of the name; bland, common, and wholly unoriginal. Best of all, it means princess.</p><p>She exhaled loudly and I leaned around to see her digging in her purse. Seriously? She\u2019s going to give him money? He\u2019s better than I gave him credit for. Maybe I just gave her too much credit. My self-respect may not be off the charts, but hers must be nonexistent. She took out a twenty-dollar bill and shoved it at him.</p><p>\u201cHere. Just so I can get you to leave me alone.\u201d He grabbed it and started walking away, but not before she yelled after him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay me back, I am so telling Mom!\u201d</p><p>Mom? Oh.</p> <p>That little revelation was fun, though it does make me wonder if my observation skills are failing me. Did I really miss that? My brother, Asher, and I used to bicker with the best of them, but our animosity threshold was several levels lower than theirs.</p><p>I toss the last of the newspapers back on top of the pile and return to the computer, trying to come up with anything else I can do online to kill time. I\u2019m not on Facebook or anything else anymore, so there\u2019s no point in that. I could torture myself by using Asher\u2019s name and passwords to check up on people I used to be friends with, but I decide against it. There\u2019s isn\u2019t anything I want to know.</p><p>The lightning is flashing incessantly outside the window, taunting me every time it lights up the sky. My phone is on my bed, whispering in my ear like a bottle of scotch to a recovering alcoholic, while the rain continues cackling at me through my window. I may actually be desperate enough to go out in this weather. I need to run that badly. More jumping jacks. Lift some weights. More push-ups. Lift more weights. I may not be able to get a treadmill in here, but a punching bag I think I can manage, even if it\u2019s just one of those portable ones. I don\u2019t think Margot will let me hang a heavy bag in her living room, but I\u2019m not that picky. I\u2019ll take anything I can hit right now.</p><p>Cookies. I need to bake cookies. It\u2019s the next best thing to running. Not really, but I do love cookies and I don\u2019t like the shit that they sell in packages, which is what Margot buys. Oreos are acceptable. Because they\u2019re Oreos and no matter what you do, you can\u2019t replicate them. Trust me on this one. I\u2019ve spent more than a few days in my kitchen, trying to do just that. It\u2019s never going to happen. So Oreos get a pass, but factory-sealed chocolate chip cookies that are shelf-stable for up to six months are another story. Life really is too short for that. Believe me, I know.</p><p>I rummage through Margot\u2019s kitchen and I have no idea why I\u2019m surprised that she doesn\u2019t own any flour or baking soda or baking powder or vanilla or just about any ingredient that could possibly be required for baking. I do locate some sugar and salt, and miraculously, a set of measuring cups, but that won\u2019t get me very far. I resolve to head to the grocery store this weekend. I won\u2019t make it long without cookies. Or cake.</p><p>I give up, eat half a bag of jelly beans, leaving the black ones because they suck, and head to the shower to wash the shit that was this day off of me. I have a riveting conversation with myself while letting the conditioner set in my hair. I talk about my crap schedule. I tell myself about the unfortunate irony that is my music class and wonder if that tops the ridiculousness of Speech &amp; Debate. I ponder, out loud, whether any female in the school, student or teacher, is immune to the charms of a certain blond named Drew. Then I answer\u200c\u2014\u200cME. Oh, and Sarah of course, though he seems to be able to badger her into submission. I have these conversations periodically, just to make sure my voice still works in case I ever want to use it again. Returning to the world of the vocal was always the plan, but some days I wonder if I ever will. Most of the time, I don\u2019t have much exciting news, so I repeat names or random words, but today was noteworthy, so it warranted full sentences. Sometimes I even sing, but I save that for the days when my self-loathing is at peak levels and I want to hurt myself.</p><p>I crawl into my bed, which is covered in a sage green floral-print comforter, just like the one in my bedroom at home. It was probably more my mother\u2019s doing than Margot\u2019s. I think she has trouble grasping the concept that I was trying to get away from that place, not bring it with me. I lift up the mattress and pull out the composition book I\u2019ve hidden there. I\u2019ll have to find a better place for it soon. The rest of them are in the back of my closet, packed in a cardboard box, underneath old paperbacks and my middle school yearbooks. The one in my hands is black and white with the word Trig written in red marker across the cover. Like all of the others, the first few pages are filled with fake class notes. I grab a pen and I write. Exactly three and a half pages later, I slide the book back to its hiding place and turn off the light, wondering what fresh hell tomorrow will bring.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck. I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk.</p><p>On Friday morning, the first thing I do is pick up my amended schedule from the Guidance Office. Ms. McAllister signed off on my teacher aide position for fifth hour, so I have now officially dropped Intro to Music, which means I get to spend that period making photocopies and handing out papers instead of wanting to bleed myself dry.</p><p>At this point, I\u2019ve gotten better on the shoes, even though they\u2019re too cramped at the front and my toes unleash a string of expletives at me when I put them on. I chose my second most appalling outfit for today\u2019s endeavors \u2013 more black on black, because that\u2019s really all I have anyway. I keep the thick black eyeliner, the red lipstick and the black nail polish. The stilettos, as always, are the exclamation point on an ensemble that screams Hideous! I am a slutty horror show. I think of pearl buttons and white eyelet skirts and wonder what Emilia would be wearing if she were alive today.</p><p>I\u2019ve been successfully hiding in hallways and bathrooms during lunch all week. The disheveled artist boy, whose name I have since learned\u200c\u2014\u200cby surreptitiously glancing at the cover on his sketchbook\u200c\u2014\u200cis Clay, was kind enough to give me an unsolicited short list of my best bets for solitude when he caught me trying the doors to the English wing again on the second day. I\u2019ve checked out most them. Give me a few more days and I\u2019ll probably be able to draw a map and star the best places for disappearing. Then I can sell it to other losers like me.</p><p>I find, from my daily walks, that the layout here stays pretty much the same. You would think there was a designated seating chart for the courtyard. No one strays from the place they planted themselves the day before. I recognize more of the faces at this point, but even the ones I know don\u2019t acknowledge me. I am left blissfully alone. I\u2019ve scared, offended or made everyone uncomfortable enough to stay away. Mission accomplished. It\u2019s even worth all of the discomfort of the shoes. If I don\u2019t do anything wrong, it should stay this way.</p><p>I\u2019m considering which direction to head today, when I pass the boy in the force field. I wonder how he does that. Maybe I can find out his secret, because I would love to get one of those for myself. Sometimes I think he\u2019s invisible and I\u2019m the only one who sees him, but I guess that\u2019s not the case, because if it was, I\u2019m sure someone would have grabbed that bench by now. Maybe he\u2019s a ghost and no one goes near the bench because he haunts it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He always sits in the same position and he\u2019s completely motionless. Ever since he caught me on Monday, I\u2019ve been trying not to stare more than a couple of seconds each day. He hasn\u2019t looked up at me again. I still get the feeling he\u2019s watching, but maybe I just kind of want him to be. I shake that off quickly. The last thing I need is anyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>Still, he is extremely nice to look at. Nice arms. Not douchebag workout arms, just work arms. I saw him on the first day in my shop class, but only for a second, and then he left and never came back. Now the only time I ever see him is at lunch. That handful of seconds I spend crossing the courtyard becomes the most intriguing part of my day. If I\u2019m being honest with myself, those precious seconds are the only reason I still walk across this damn thing every day. I walked it on the first day to make a point. I walked it on the second day to see if he was still there and still alone. I walked it on the third and the fourth to see if he\u2019d look up at me again. He didn\u2019t. Today, I just wanted to look. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing when the pointed end of the heel of my shoe ends up lodged in the crack between two brick pavers. Beautiful. Fortunately, since I was walking pathetically slow to make the most of my stalking experience, I don\u2019t end up face first on the ground. Not so fortunately, I am now stuck directly between his bench and that of Princess Sarah and her ladies in waiting. I try to nonchalantly wiggle my heel out from where it\u2019s ensnared, but it won\u2019t budge. I\u2019ll have to maneuver my way down to kneeling and try to pull it out with my hands, which will be a feat of balance, but bending over in this dress is so not an option.</p><p>I kneel down slowly and slip my foot out of the shoe. Then I grab the heel with my right hand and yank it. It comes out easier than I expect and I stand up and slip my foot back into it. I glance to my left and see that statue boy still hasn\u2019t moved. He seems utterly oblivious to my shoe debacle. It\u2019s a small miracle, but small miracles are the only kind I can hope for right now, so I\u2019ll take it. Too bad I haven\u2019t gone completely unnoticed, because the next thing I hear\u200c\u2014\u200c</p><p>\u201cI think those are made for street corners, not school.\u201d Sarah. This is followed by giggles and then another female voice\u200c\u2014\u200c</p> <p>\u201cYeah, does your dad know you left Hell dressed like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought her dad was in Transylvania.\u201d More giggles. Seriously.</p><p>The insults here are really subpar. At least they could throw something mildly entertaining at me if they\u2019re going to make me turn around. I look to my right to find the fountain of wit that spewed that gem at me. Several girls surround Sarah and are looking at me and, yes, still giggling. I guess I congratulated myself a minute or two too soon. I mentally run through my options A) Hurl said shoe at them B) Hurl insults at them C) Ignore them and walk away D) Smile my most demonic and unhinged smile at them. I\u2019ve chosen D, the only real option of the bunch. I won\u2019t ignore this, at least not in the slink away with my tail between my legs way. Besides, since I\u2019m apparently the spawn of Satan, or possibly Dracula, depending on who you ask, it can never hurt to throw a little crazy out there just to drive the message home before the weekend. I stare them down for a few more seconds, debating whether to unleash the smile all at once or just let it subtly drift across my face, when I\u2019m interrupted by a voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s mouth, which was open in what I suspect was the formation of another display of her scathing wit, clamps shut so fast I think I hear her teeth clash. I turn around, even though I kind of know that the only person in that general vicinity is the last one I would expect to be all knight-in-shining-armor. Not that the situation even called for it. It was hardly an attack. It was more like a sort of lame insult version of karaoke. A performance by amateurs. Something you mock rather than fear. I can tell these girls wouldn\u2019t have stopped there, and if I was the type to care it might have hurt my feelings, but I don\u2019t care and my feelings haven\u2019t been hurt in a very long time.</p> <p>At this point, I\u2019m completely turned around and mine aren\u2019t the only eyes on the boy in the bubble. In fact, there are quite a few sets of eyes watching him now, waiting to see if anything else comes out of his mouth. I feel like I\u2019ve found myself in the middle of a Twilight Zone episode, where everything around me has frozen and I\u2019m the only one who can move. But I don\u2019t.</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes are trained on Sarah, giving her a look that matches the don\u2019t-fuck-with-me tone in his voice. His glance flicks to me for a second and then he\u2019s back to staring at his hands like nothing at all happened. I\u2019m contemplating moving now but I can\u2019t seem to find my legs just yet. I turn away from the boy and catch Sarah staring at me now. The look on her face isn\u2019t carved out of jealousy or even bitterness, which is what I kind of expect; it\u2019s forged out of one-hundred-percent-pure, rock solid, WTF. As much as I\u2019m trying to keep my face blank, I have a feeling that my expression quite possibly looks a lot like hers, but probably for very different reasons.</p><p>She seems perplexed as all hell that he said something. I don\u2019t really know this kid well enough to know if his interference is the most surprising element of this whole situation. If you ask me, the weird part about it is how everybody reacted. They all shut up. They didn\u2019t question him, didn\u2019t laugh or ask why, they didn\u2019t ignore him and continue with the ridicule, and they didn\u2019t turn their derision on him. They just stopped. He said enough and that was that. Because I said so. End of story. Don\u2019t make me have to tell you twice.</p><p>In the mere seconds that I have been standing here, everyone else has gone back to what they were doing and maybe it\u2019s my imagination, but the decibel level seems to have dropped just a bit, as if no one wants to be heard discussing what just happened. What the hell did just happen?</p><p>I\u2019ll think about it in a few minutes, or after school, or maybe never, but right now I want to get the hell out of the middle of this courtyard. I make it across without any more shoe malfunctions, and mercifully, someone has stuck a book in the door to the English building so I\u2019m able to walk right in. I glance down as I push through the door and see that it\u2019s an art history book and sitting next to it is a smirking Clay, sketchbook, as always, in hand. I really want to ask if he knows what that was about, but I can\u2019t, so I slip into the building. I make it halfway down the corridor and turn off into the stairwell and lean up against the wall, grateful to be alone in the quiet.</p><p>Before I can turn recent events over in my mind, I hear the door open again. I press my back to the wall of the stairwell, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible. If I press hard enough, maybe I can make myself disappear. I concentrate on the direction of the footsteps which are getting louder by the second. The cadence is slow and one foot falls ever-so-slightly heavier than the other. The steps are solid, but soft. They aren\u2019t clumsy or awkward. It\u2019s a graceful walk. Whoever it is, they\u2019re taller than me; it doesn\u2019t take them near as many steps to get to the alcove where I\u2019m loitering. I wait for the footsteps to pass, but they don\u2019t. They turn right at me and now I\u2019m just hoping that whoever it is will simply ignore me. I look down at the floor so I won\u2019t have to make eye contact and I wait for it to be over.</p> <p>And then, before I can remember to hold my breath, a set of well-worn work boots stops in front of me. Steel-toed, if I\u2019m not mistaken. I don\u2019t need to look up to know who they belong to. I\u2019ve been looking at those boots on the seat of an industrial metal bench for five days now. Apparently confusion and curiosity have turned me momentarily stupid, because against my better judgment, I do look up and it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever been to him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that again,\u201d he says, impaling me with his sickeningly perfect blue eyes like he wishes I didn\u2019t exist. But the way he says it isn\u2019t angry. It\u2019s just matter-of-fact. He\u2019s completely calm. There\u2019s almost no tone in his voice at all. He doesn\u2019t wait for any sort of acknowledgement or response, even though right now I just might be pissed off enough to give him one, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a thank you. Then he\u2019s crossed the alcove and walked out the door on the other side of the stairwell as if he was never here at all.</p><p>I won\u2019t do that again? No one asked you to do it this time, ass**le. Does he honestly think he just did me a favor? That, by calling attention to me and pissing off a bunch of vanity obsessed girls on my behalf, girls who will no doubt be seeking to save face when he is not around, he has helped me. He\u2019s more delusional than I am. I\u2019d like to tell him so. Too bad I don\u2019t even know his name. And if I had a list of questions, what\u2019s your name? probably wouldn\u2019t even make the cut.</p><p>What I want to know is why anyone listened to him. They shut up like they were being reprimanded by an angry dad, because that\u2019s exactly what he sounded like. It\u2019s the same tone of voice he used with me just now. I\u2019m almost surprised he didn\u2019t throw a young lady on the end of it for good measure. Clearly, I\u2019m the only one here who doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m supposed to listen to him. It\u2019s as if he commands some sort of respect or reverence. Maybe his dad is like the principal or the mayor or a mob boss and no one wants to piss him off. Who knows? All I know is that I\u2019m pissed off.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Josh</p><p>I\u2019ve gotten through the rest of the day without seeing the girl again. I\u2019ve mentally flogged myself for opening my stupid mouth at lunch. If there was a reason for it, I might cut myself some slack, but the girl really didn\u2019t seem like the helpless type. Maybe I was just trying to stop her from making enemies of those bitches. Maybe I just wanted Sarah to shut the hell up because I know she\u2019s better than that. Maybe I just wanted the girl to look at me again.</p><p>The halls are already emptying out as I push my way towards the back of the school, against the flow of the rest of the students. I want to get to the theater wing before they lock the doors so I can pick up my level. I left it there earlier and I need it this afternoon. Plus, I won\u2019t leave it overnight, anyway. It\u2019s mine. It was my father\u2019s. It\u2019s old and wooden and archaic but I won\u2019t use another one and I won\u2019t take the chance that it\u2019ll disappear if I leave it here; so I go back to get it. When I get there, it\u2019s sitting where I left it on one of the unfinished shelving units I\u2019ve been working on all week. I check my progress and run my hands along the edges. I\u2019ll be done with the whole thing by next Wednesday. I could drag it out until Friday, but I\u2019m hoping Mr. Turner will be done with the preliminary procedure crap before that. I\u2019d like to get back to shop and work on something more interesting than shelves. I grab the level and head back out to the parking lot.</p> <p>I\u2019m almost to my car when I hear my name.</p><p>\u201cBennett! Josh!\u201d Drew corrects himself almost instantly because he knows he sounds like an ass**le calling me by my last name. He\u2019s standing in the next row of cars and he\u2019s not alone. He rarely is, so it\u2019s not surprising to see a girl standing next to him as he leans against his car in the pose I have grown accustomed to seeing; the one where he tries to look casually indifferent while he works out the path of least resistance into a girl\u2019s pants or down her shirt or up her skirt. Whatever the case may be.</p><p>What\u2019s surprising is the girl he\u2019s talking to. It doesn\u2019t take more than a glance to know who she is; crazy-long black hair, tight black dress that barely covers her ass or her chest, black spike heels, black shit all over her eyes. Eyes that are turning to glare at me right now. As I get closer, the blank expression she usually wears changes. It\u2019s subtle and I doubt most people would notice, because the change is mostly in the eyes, but I can see the difference. It\u2019s not blank. She\u2019s pissed, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, she\u2019s pissed at me. I don\u2019t get much of an opportunity to examine it because she\u2019s walking away before I even reach them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCall me!\u201d Drew yells over his shoulder to her, laughing as if this is some sort of joke.</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d I ask, laying my books and my level on the hood of his car. Most of the parking lot has emptied out by this point. For as slow as the traffic moves into this place in the morning, the afternoon exodus takes no time at all.</p><p>\u201cI plan to,\u201d Drew responds, not looking at me. He\u2019s still watching the girl walk away. I ignore the innuendo. If I had to acknowledge every thinly-veiled sexual suggestion that comes from his mouth, we\u2019d talk of nothing else, which would probably make him happy.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome Russian chick. Nastya something I haven\u2019t learned to pronounce. I was starting to worry that I was losing my appeal because she\u2019d never talk to me, but apparently, she doesn\u2019t talk to anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised? She kind of screams antisocial.\u201d I pick the level up off the car and turn it over in my hands watching the water shift from one side to the other.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not that. She doesn\u2019t talk, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d I look at him skeptically.</p><p>\u201cAt all.\u201d He shakes his head, smiling with warped satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Maybe she doesn\u2019t speak English. But then I guess she could still say yes and no and shit.\u201d He shrugs as if it\u2019s of no consequence.</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s in my Speech &amp; Debate class.\u201d He smirks at the irony of that fact. I don\u2019t respond. I\u2019m trying to process the information, and Drew can keep this conversation going on his own. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. Gives me a chance to work on her every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a very good sign if you have to work on her. Maybe you are losing your appeal,\u201d I reply dryly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he says in all seriousness, looking down at his watch. His smile returns. \u201cIt\u2019s 3:00. Better get your ass home.\u201d And with that, he hops in his car and drives off, leaving me standing in the parking lot, thinking of pissed off Russian girls and black dresses.</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m waiting here. Waiting for something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Something that isn\u2019t yet. But that\u2019s all I feel and nothing else. I don\u2019t know if I even exist. And then someone flips a switch and the light is gone, the room is gone, the weightlessness is gone. I want to ask to wait, because I wasn\u2019t finished yet, but I don\u2019t have a chance. There is no gentle pulling. No coaxing. No choice. I\u2019m wrenched out. Yanked, as if my head is being snapped back. I\u2019m in the dark and everything is pain. There are too many sensations at once. Every nerve ending is on fire. Like the shock of being born. And then, there are flashes of everything. Color, voices, machines, harsh words. The pain doesn\u2019t flash. The pain is constant, steady, never-ending. It\u2019s the only thing I know. I don\u2019t want to be awake anymore.</p><p>I made it through my second Monday at school. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be drained just from the constant suck of it all, but apparently not, because I still can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve been in bed for two hours now; I know it\u2019s after midnight but I can\u2019t see the clock from here so I\u2019m not sure exactly what time it is. I think about the composition book tucked under the mattress beneath me. I reach down and shove my hand under to touch it. My three and a half pages are done, every word accounted for, but still no sleep. Maybe writing them again would help, but it won\u2019t bring me the soul-sucking exhaustion my body is begging for, so I pull my hand back and rest it on my stomach, opening and closing it to the rhythm of my breathing.</p><p>I can hear that the hard rain has stopped, so I peel off the covers and look out the window. My window faces into the backyard and it\u2019s too dark to see if it\u2019s still pissing rain, so I head to the front of the house and peer into the beam cast by the streetlamp. There\u2019s no rain visible in the yellow glow reflecting off of the wet sidewalk below and I\u2019m stripping out of my makeshift pajamas before I even get back to my bedroom, giddy with the thought of running out the past few days, pounding my aggression into the sidewalk and leaving it behind me as I go. It takes no time to slip on a pair of running shorts and a t-shirt and throw on my shoes. My feet love me again. I glance at the clock. 12:30. I hook a canister of pepper spray onto my hip and grip the kubotan that holds my keys in my right hand, even though it\u2019s annoying as all hell to run with. It\u2019s my security blanket. Clutched in my fingers, offering me the illusion of a security that doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>I lock the door behind me and force myself to ease into a jog, down the driveway and into the rain-drenched streets, but it\u2019s not easy. I want to tear down the road until I can\u2019t breathe, until there is not enough oxygen left in the world to keep me from suffocating. The humidity is brutal, especially paired with the late summer temperatures, but I can\u2019t care. It\u2019ll only mean more sweat and I can handle that. Every drop is the stress leaching out of me, taking with it all of my anxiety and energy so I can collapse into sleep tonight or this morning or whenever the hell I crawl into bed. Maybe I\u2019ll stay out until it\u2019s time to go to school and then sleepwalk through the day. All the better. My feet disobey me and break into a full-throttle run only seconds after I hit the road. My legs will hate me later, but it will be worth it. I run fast and far the way I\u2019ve become accustomed to running. I wish I was on one, long, straight expanse of highway so I could just keep going without having to turn or think or make decisions of any kind. Instead, I head right and follow my feet without thinking. I don\u2019t pay any attention to the houses or the cars. My body and my mind have missed this over the past couple of weeks; first through the drama of the move to Margot\u2019s house, and then with the constant nightly rain that traps me indoors. If this is what I have to do every night\u200c\u2014\u200cwait until it stops, even in the dregs of night\u200c\u2014\u200cthen I will. I won\u2019t go this long without it again.</p><p>The first night I ever ran, I ended up throwing up all over my shoes. It was one of the best nights of my life. It didn\u2019t start out that way. It started out with me fighting with my parents. Followed by me listening to my parents fight about me. I sat in that room and sat in that room and sat in that room on the comforter that looks exactly like the one I sleep on here. I sat in that room until I couldn\u2019t sit there anymore. I couldn\u2019t be in that house, listening to another fight that I caused. My father would ask my mother why she kept blaming herself and my mother would ask my father why it didn\u2019t bother him and my father would tell my mother that it killed him inside but that he didn\u2019t see the point in drowning in it and my mother would tell my father that as long as I was drowning in it, she would be, too. It was always the same fight on an endless loop.</p><p>It was nine o\u2019clock at night and the first shoes I could find were a pair of sneakers and I shoved my feet into them without socks and ran down the stairs, flinging the door open and not bothering to close it. It was my very unsophisticated, very literal version of running away. I ran and ran and ran. There was no slow warm up. There was no pace or purpose. There was only away.</p> <p>I don\u2019t even know how far I made it that night, probably not very, before I was gasping and my lungs ached and my stomach convulsed and I puked right where I was standing. And it was awesome. It was cathartic and constructive and destructive and perfect. Then I sat on the ground and cried\u200c\u2014\u200cthe ugly kind of crying where you keep sucking breaths in all at once and it makes that horrible sound as the air scrapes against your throat. Then I got up and went home.</p><p>I ran every night after that. I learned to control myself and to warm up and to pace myself, but I always ended up pushing too far, running too hard, running too long. My therapist told my parents it was healthy. Maybe not the vomiting so much, but the running in general. It was a healthy outlet. My parents love the word healthy.</p><p>My dad tried to come with me a couple of times. He tried, he did. But I wouldn\u2019t hold back for him and he couldn\u2019t keep up. I don\u2019t think pushing himself to the point of heaving was as appealing for him as it was for me. The only reason I ran was to drain every ounce of energy out of myself so that there was nothing left to use for regret or fear or remembering. It takes much more to drain me now. I run longer every day. It\u2019s gotten harder to achieve the body-draining fatigue that I love, because if I\u2019m going to run, I want to feel like I\u2019ve been wrung out and spun dry, but it still does the trick. It\u2019s the only therapy I get now.</p><p>My lungs feel okay but my stomach is teetering. I\u2019ve been out of commission for a little while lately, so hopefully, I can tap myself out easily tonight. With every step, I stomp out the shit in my head until it\u2019s all but gone. It will come back in the daylight, when I\u2019m replenished enough to think, but for now it\u2019s away and for now that\u2019s enough. My thoughts drift off with the last vestiges of my energy and adrenaline, leaving me with the all too familiar feeling of nausea I\u2019ve come to know well. I slow to a jog, and then a walk, trying to lull my stomach into submission, but it\u2019s not working.</p><p>My feet stop, giving me a minute to scan the street for a gutter or well-placed hedge to throw up in, and for the first time since I bolted through the door, I take note of my surroundings. I haven\u2019t been on this street before. I\u2019m not sure how far I\u2019ve run, but it\u2019s unfamiliar. It\u2019s late. Most of the houses are dark now and I try to slow my already rapid breathing. I bolt for the nearest hedge to heave into. I miscalculate the distance and end up running straight into it. Thorns. Of course. Insult to injury. The thorns slash my legs every time I move but I\u2019m too busy puking to extricate them just yet. When my stomach has been thoroughly emptied, I lift my legs out as carefully as possible, trying to minimize the damage, but it\u2019s already been done. I can see blood just beginning to seep through the torn skin on my calves but it\u2019s the least of my worries right now. I close my eyes, then lift them open again. I force myself to take in my surroundings and to remind myself where I am, and more importantly, where I am not.</p><p>The sickness in my stomach is replaced by a new kind of dread. The houses are the same, all the same. I can\u2019t find a street sign, but I know I ran fast and I ran far and I didn\u2019t pay attention to anything. I broke every rule that I have and I\u2019ve gotten what I deserve for it. It\u2019s the middle of the night and I am alone and lost and drenched in darkness.</p><p>I instinctively pat my pocket, feeling for my phone so I can use the GPS. Empty. Of course I didn\u2019t bring it. I ran out the door so fast I forgot, because I\u2019m careless and impatient and I didn\u2019t think of anything beyond air and sneakers.</p><p>I follow the sidewalk. I must be on the outer edge of the community against the preserve that walls it in. I know that this sidewalk probably circles the whole neighborhood, which can give me some bearings and I should stay on it. But I can\u2019t help it. I want to get the hell away from all of those trees. I can\u2019t see past them and I can\u2019t control what comes out of them and there are too many sounds to process.</p><p>There are no street lamps where I\u2019m standing now, but I can see the faint yellow glow of one up ahead. The houses along the other side of the street are shadowed in dark and sleep. Like all sane people at this hour. The churning in my stomach is still there, but it\u2019s being overshadowed by the fear of being lost.</p><p>My kubotan is swinging at my side until my keys are nothing but a blur. I listen to the quiet that settles around me. I can hear everything: the hum of the streetlamps from overhead, crickets chirping, unintelligible voices coming from a television somewhere, and a sound I can\u2019t place right away. It\u2019s rhythmic and coarse. Following the direction of the sound, I glance down into the darkness and see light coming from one house at the end of the road. It\u2019s brighter than what could be given off by the front lamps alone. I head towards the house, not knowing what I expect to find there. Maybe someone awake who can give me directions. Directions you can\u2019t ask for, idiot. In the distance the rhythmic scratching sound continues. Soft and almost musical and I follow it. The house is close and the sound is louder now, though I still can\u2019t tell what it is, until a moment later I\u2019m there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stop at the end of the driveway, in front of a pale yellow house with a brightly lit open garage. I want to look in to see if anyone is inside before I get too close, but my feet won\u2019t stop. The sight of it pulls me in. As soon as I reach the threshold, I am frozen, only one thought forming in my mind. I know this place. I take a tentative step closer, looking around, remembering details of a place I know I have never been. I know this place. The thought invades my brain repeatedly, and as it does, I finally take note of the rhythmic sound, still humming in my ears. There is a figure sitting at a workbench on the far wall of the garage, his hand moving back and forth, sanding down the narrow edge of a wooden beam. My eyes are fixed on those hands as if they\u2019re hypnotizing me. I pull my gaze away to follow the dust falling to the floor, catching the light as it goes. I know this place. The thought comes at me again and I suck in my breath all at once and I just need a second. One more second to process what it means. I know this place. But before I can think, the hands have stopped, the sound has stopped and the person in the garage has turned around to face me.</p><p>And I know him, too.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Nastya</p> <p>Lit up by the fluorescent lights, Josh Bennett studies me across the garage. I haven\u2019t moved or looked away. I don\u2019t see any recognition in his eyes and I wonder if he knows who I am. I\u2019m just now remembering that I probably look like a different person. My hair is pulled back in a ponytail and I don\u2019t have a trace of make-up on my sweat-covered, and probably very flushed, face. I\u2019m in running clothes and sneakers. I\u2019m not sure I would recognize myself if I didn\u2019t already know what I was supposed to look like under the crap I\u200c\u2014\u200cjust barely\u200c\u2014\u200ccover myself in at school. I\u2019m beginning to wish I at least had the make-up on because I\u2019m feeling very exposed under the fluorescent lights with this boy staring at me. He\u2019s skewering me with those eyes. I know I\u2019m being assessed somehow, but I\u2019m not sure on what criteria.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I live?\u201d He\u2019s annoyed and he doesn\u2019t bother hiding the accusation in his words.</p><p>Obviously I didn\u2019t, because it would have been the last place on earth I would have come, but I guess now he thinks I\u2019m a stalker. My right hand tightens around the kubotan, even though I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in any real danger and my left hand matches it, even though it\u2019s holding nothing. I probably look crazy or confused or both.</p><p>His eyes drop down to my legs, which are criss-crossed by the bloody tendrils that infernal shrub left in its wake, and then they return to my face and I wonder what he sees there. I wonder if he senses how defeated I feel. I did not plan for anyone to see me like this, much less Josh Bennett, who apparently I am supposed to fear or revere, though I don\u2019t know why. Is he wearing a ring? Is he waiting for me to kneel down and kiss it?</p><p>One of us is going to have to blink first, so I take a tentative step back as if I\u2019m trying to evade a predator, hoping he won\u2019t notice that I\u2019m moving until I\u2019m already gone. I lift my foot to take another step.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want a ride home?\u201d He looks away before he says it and his tone loses some of its edge. My foot comes down harder than I mean it to. If I had a list of the things Josh Bennett might say to me in this situation, asking me if I want a ride wouldn\u2019t have made the top fifty. His voice is devoid of any emotion as usual. For the record, no I do not want a ride home, but I think I need one. And it sucks to need something from someone who so clearly detests you, but I\u2019m not proud enough to say no.</p><p>I nod, opening and closing my mouth quickly because I really want to say something, even if I don\u2019t know what it is I want to say. He stands and walks to the door that leads into the house, opening it enough to reach in and grab a set of keys that must have been hanging on the inside wall. He turns to close the door but looks back in and pauses a moment as if he\u2019s listening for something. I imagine he must be checking to see if his parents are awake, but they probably aren\u2019t. They\u2019re probably asleep at this hour along with the rest of the civilized world. Except for me. And Josh Bennett who apparently likes to do woodworking in the dead of night in his garage. I look around to try to figure out what exactly he was working on but it all just looks like a bunch of wood and tools to me and I can\u2019t tell. I glance at the garage one more time, memorizing it, and as much as I hate to admit it, I know I\u2019m coming back here.</p><p>I walk out and wait in the driveway next to the truck parked in it. It\u2019s the only car here so I guess he doesn\u2019t have his own. It\u2019s a beautiful truck, even I can admit that, and I\u2019m not a big truck person. His father must take good care of it. I wish my car was that shiny, but I hate to wash it, so I\u2019m lucky you can even tell what color the paint is at this point.</p><p>Josh stops at a small refrigerator that sits on the floor under one of the work benches and pulls a bottle of water out of it. He walks up and hands it to me, wordlessly, before unlocking my door and opening it. I take the bottle out of his hand and look at it, suddenly aware of just how much I must be sweating. I turn to climb into the truck and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in a skirt, because I\u2019m seriously short and I have to take a pretty big step up to get into it. He closes the door behind me, then walks around and climbs in the driver\u2019s side. He seems a lot more graceful doing it than me, like he was born climbing in and out of this truck. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m allowed to hate Josh Bennett, because I\u2019m thinking I might start.</p><p>And then we sit. He doesn\u2019t look at me, but he doesn\u2019t start the car, either. I wonder what the hell he\u2019s waiting for and maybe wandering lost in the dark might not be the worst thing after all. Everything feels endless right now. My stupidity hits me upside the head a moment later when I realize that he\u2019s not sitting here to make me uncomfortable, he just doesn\u2019t know where to go. Looking around the car for something to write on is futile. There isn\u2019t a damn thing in here. It\u2019s the cleanest car I\u2019ve ever seen. When I get in my car tomorrow morning, it\u2019s going to feel like a slum compared to this. Before I can do the eye-pleading thing with him and hope he understands, he reaches across the dashboard and pulls the GPS down and hands it to me.</p><p>The ride is ridiculously short. It takes only minutes to get back to Margot\u2019s and I feel stupid for having him drive me. I paid attention to everything on the way. I tell myself it\u2019s so I won\u2019t get lost again, but really I need to find my way back there.</p> <p>I should say thank you, but he won\u2019t expect it and I get the feeling he\u2019s more comfortable with the silence anyway. When he pulls into the driveway, I reach for the door almost before he\u2019s put the truck in park, determined to put us both out of our misery. I jump down onto the ground and turn to close the door. I don\u2019t say thank you. He doesn\u2019t say good night, but he does speak.</p><p>\u201cYou look different,\u201d he says and I shut the door in his face.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Josh Bennett walks in and heads straight for my table in shop and I try not to look, but I really, really want to. I just don\u2019t want him to know that I\u2019m looking. Soon I have no choice in the matter because he\u2019s standing in front of me, staring at my face. I stare back at him and I want to scream What?! I can almost see the word, interrobang and all, floating up from my lips in unspoken fervor, because he\u2019s the only person I know who can appear seriously put out with no expression at all on his face. Does everyone irritate him so much or is it just a special gift I have? He seems disturbed by the fact that I even exist, much less occupy the same space in his precious shop class.</p><p>\u201cI sit here,\u201d he finally says, and again, he doesn\u2019t sound pissed, just matter-of-fact, like that\u2019s the way things are and I should know it like everyone else. Does this mean I\u2019m supposed to get up? Move? Where? This is where Mr. Turner put me and I\u2019m trying to decide if I want to have a stare-down with Josh Bennett or get up and move because our near silent dispute already has an audience. Before I can make my decision, Mr. Turner calls Josh over to his desk. He leaves his books on my\u200c\u2014\u200chis?\u200c\u2014\u200ctable in an obvious show of ownership and refusal to concede and walks to the front of the room. I see Mr. Turner look in my direction and back to Josh and I assume he\u2019s telling him that he told me to sit here. I don\u2019t know if Josh is going to get his way or not, but the way things seem to go around here, that\u2019s usually what happens. I\u2019m not going to give him a chance to be smug about it, so before he turns to come back, I move myself.</p><p>There aren\u2019t any other empty tables. The one I was sitting at was the last one. There are empty seats at the others but I don\u2019t want to sit next to anyone; it becomes too awkward for me and for the person stuck sitting with me. Plus, I like sitting in the back so I know no one is behind me.</p><p>There\u2019s a counter built around the perimeter of the room with storage cabinets underneath, so I take my books and place them on it and hope like hell I can sit up here without flashing the world. I push myself up on the counter and turn to face the front. As I do, I see Josh walking back. He doesn\u2019t look at me but he does speak. His back is turned to the rest of the class and his voice is low so I\u2019m pretty sure no one but me can hear it.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to make you move.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I should be annoyed that he assumes he had the power to make me move or if I should feel bad for misinterpreting him. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll never understand Josh Bennett and then I\u2019m wondering why I try.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a party tonight at Trevor Mason\u2019s. Want to go?\u201d</p><p>I look at Drew. We\u2019re sitting in Debate. It\u2019s almost two-thirty and I\u2019m trying to pull the last five facts I need to finish my assignment off of the internet before the bell so I don\u2019t have to deal with it tonight or any other time this weekend. I don\u2019t know what Drew\u2019s working on, other than me, because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s accomplished a thing this entire period. He\u2019ll no doubt procure an A for whatever non-work he did. That\u2019s how things work for Drew around here.</p><p>What did he just ask me? It was pretty straightforward and shockingly innuendo-free so I\u2019m momentarily dumbfounded. Go to a party tonight? Not what I was expecting. He\u2019s been tossing all of his sexually-charged material my way since the first day of school. I\u2019d call it banter, but it\u2019s really not, since my contribution is nothing more than pointed looks and hand gestures and even those are few and far between. He tried to get me to resort to note writing a few days ago but I shut that down quickly enough. Note writing is for fact-based, pertinent information only, not conversations.</p><p>Go to a party with Drew? Why not? I surprise even myself, but really, why not? Okay, there are probably about a hundred reasons why not. Because let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s probably not asking me for my sparkling wit and entertaining anecdotes. But much to my chagrin, Drew is actually one of the few things in my day that I don\u2019t completely dread, because at least with him, I feel a certain sense of control. I can handle Drew. He doesn\u2019t scare me, and right now, that may just be enough. I find that, in spite of his blatant man-whorishness and put-on cocky smolder, I like him. Not like him, like him. But I do like him and I wonder what that says about me. He\u2019s entertaining, and I am sorely in need of entertainment. I nod to him. Sure, party, of course. He looks surprised for a moment. Hell, I\u2019m kind of surprised myself. Then the surprise is gone and the self-assured, of-course-you-said-yes smile spreads across his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at nine?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod, digging a notebook out of my backpack and ripping a page out of it. I grab the pen he\u2019s been holding out of his hand and write down the address because addresses are acceptable note material.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably wear black,\u201d he mocks as I write the address. I\u2019ve worn nothing but black in the past two weeks. I hand the paper to him, seeing that conquering gleam lingering in his eyes. I tilt my head to the side and look him up and down in all his preppy hotness until my eyes rest back on his face. Then I shrug and walk away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Josh</p><p>Drew pulls into my driveway just after midnight and I know immediately that no good can come of this. I put down the pencil I\u2019ve been using to mark down measurements with and watch him get out of the car and walk towards the garage.</p><p>\u201cDude, I need a favor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to take Nastya.\u201d Take Nastya? At first I wonder where he wants me to take her, until I glance down the driveway and see what he means.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No way.\u201d I look past him to the dark figure slumped over in the front seat of the car. \u201cWhat did you do to her? Is she even conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. No,\u201d he says defensively, following my eye-line back to the car. So now we\u2019re both standing in my garage, his arms crossed, my hands shoved in my pockets, watching through the windshield of his car for signs of movement. \u201cShe just drank too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much of what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlame throwers.\u201d He avoids my eyes when he says it.</p><p>\u201cWhat ass**le gave her flame throwers?\u201d He looks at me without answering which is answer enough. He\u2019s an idiot. A flame thrower is grain alcohol mixed with cherry Kool-Aid. He might as well have chloroformed her. \u201cWhat were you thinking? She weighs like 25 pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, OK, Dad. Thanks for the lecture, but it\u2019s not really solving the problem. Besides, how was I supposed to know she couldn\u2019t handle it? She looks like a badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA 25-pound badass.\u201d It\u2019s true. She does look like a badass. I\u2019ve seen her arms, and she\u2019s ripped which is kind of weird and scary all at once because it just seems all wrong on her. She\u2019s really small and fragile-looking, and at the same time, it\u2019s like she\u2019s some exotic teenage mercenary, all rock solid, dressed in black, ready to take somebody down. None of it makes any sense. It\u2019s kind of disconcerting. She\u2019s like an optical illusion. You look at it from one angle and you see the picture and you think you\u2019ve got a lock on it and then it shifts and the image changes to something entirely different and you can\u2019t even find the original picture anymore. It\u2019s a serious mindfuck.</p><p>\u201cJosh, seriously. I can\u2019t take her home like this and if I miss curfew again my mom will rip my balls off.\u201d He\u2019s not really making his case with that point. I\u2019d pay good money to watch Drew finally get nailed for something. Drew\u2019s mom is the sweetest woman on earth, but there\u2019s one person who can piss her off like no one else and he\u2019s standing in front of me, begging for a stay of execution, or maybe just a stay of castration. I won\u2019t say no. He knew it when he came here. The asking is just a formality. I never say no to Drew.</p><p>I walk over to the car and open the passenger door. I try to wake her up and ask if she can walk into the house. She stirs a little and opens her eyes. I\u2019m not even sure they focus on me and then her head drops forward onto her chest like it\u2019s too heavy for her to hold up and I know there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll be walking anywhere. She barely even moves when I drag her out of the seat and pick her up to carry her into the house.</p> <p>\u201cShit, Drew,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>He leans against his car and exhales. \u201cTrue story.\u201d</p><p>Nastya</p><p>When I pry my eyes open, it takes me a minute to try to figure out where I am. And I do try, really try, to figure out where I am and I have no freaking clue and that seriously scares the crap out of me. I reach up to brush my hair back out of my eyes so I can look around and attempt to determine what the hell is going on. The only three things that I know for certain took place last night are that one\u200c\u2014\u200csmall elves climbed up my body and tied my hair into a mass of tiny knots, two\u200c\u2014\u200cI must have slept with my mouth open because something crawled into it and died and three\u200c\u2014\u200cI was sucked through a vortex into some animated world where an anvil was dropped on my head.</p><p>I lift my hand to my forehead and press, trying to relieve some of the pounding as I attempt, not without effort, to sit up. I\u2019m on someone\u2019s couch. Someone\u2019s couch. Someone\u2019s couch. And as soon as I remember, I\u2019m wishing I could forget.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Sunshine!\u201d Josh Fucking Bennett. By now, I\u2019m pretty sure that if I were to find his birth certificate that is exactly what it would say. I don\u2019t have time to figure out why I\u2019m here or what he\u2019s playing at with the fake, overwrought cheeriness, because he doesn\u2019t even take a breath and I wonder if the real Josh Bennett has been abducted by aliens, or maybe the elves carted him off after they got done with my hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re awake. I was starting to worry that you might not be feeling well. You know, with all the projectile vomiting last night.\u201d I wince, from either physical pain or embarrassment, I\u2019m not sure which. He sees my discomfort but it doesn\u2019t stop him. I think he might actually be encouraged. \u201cNo, don\u2019t you worry your pretty little head over it,\u201d he says with mock sincerity, then pauses, looking me over. \u201cWell, today, maybe not so pretty, and last night, definitely not so pretty, but still, don\u2019t worry about it. It only took four or five towels to soak it up and I think the smell will go away after a day or two. Hopefully it won\u2019t stick that badly to your hair. I did what I could, but a ponytail probably would have been helpful.\u201d Josh Bennett cleaned up my puke. Fabulous. He\u2019s getting even now and having far too much fun doing it. I can\u2019t decide which is worse, angry dad Josh Bennett or sarcastic, mocking Josh Bennett. I\u2019d like to punch them both in the throat right now but I\u2019m not sure I can lift my arm.</p><p>Why the hell am I here? The last I knew, I was with Drew, at an overcrowded party, drinking something that tasted suspiciously not like alcohol. I look down at myself, eternally grateful for the fact that I am still wearing the same clothes I was in last night, even if they have what I am now sure is throw up splattered on them. At least Josh Bennett didn\u2019t have to strip me and let me wear his boxer shorts. The thought gives me little comfort. Maybe because I\u2019m just now realizing that, while my clothes are still on, my bra is suspiciously MIA. I try to look around to see if it\u2019s lying on the floor or something, but it really hurts to move my head.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t stopped talking, but I have no idea what he\u2019s saying, even though his voice seems to be inside my skull. He\u2019s still on the ponytail thing. Something about them being a requirement for drunk girls. He\u2019s doing nothing to lower his voice. In fact, he might actually believe he\u2019s on a stage somewhere projecting to the back of a theater, because that\u2019s how loud his voice is. He\u2019s obviously annoyed and why shouldn\u2019t he be? It\u2019s the ass-crack of dawn on a Saturday morning and he\u2019s up with a strange girl on his couch\u200c\u2014\u200cthe same strange girl who projectile vomited in his bathroom last night while he tried to hold back her hair. I think I may just have to cut him some slack. Like a whole crapload of slack, especially when he goes into the kitchen and returns with a glass of ice water which I desperately need right now. I look at the glass in his hand as he offers it to me. It\u2019s a pathetic, short glass tumbler. Is he some sort of conservationist? I\u2019m going to need about eighteen of those right now. I take it, gratefully bringing it up to my lips and immediately gulping it down. The liquid is at the back of my throat before it\u2019s coming right back up again. What the hell? Vodka. I spit it out, not even conscious of where it goes, and start retching. My stomach clenches and convulses but nothing else comes up. I glare at Josh Bennett who is staring at me now with a look of what? Disbelief? Repentance? Fear?</p> <p>\u201cShit! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually drink it.\u201d He grabs the glass out of my hand. What did he think I was going to do with it? Bathe? \u201cI thought you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d He looks at me with apology. \u201cIt was a joke. Obviously a shitty one,\u201d he mutters under his breath as he runs back to the kitchen and returns with yet another towel. This boy will be doing laundry all day. I wonder how he\u2019s going to explain this to his parents. It\u2019s a miracle they aren\u2019t out here already, wanting to know what\u2019s going on. I yank the towel out of his hands and get down on the floor to clean up my own mess. Even if this one was his fault, I\u2019d rather not owe him anything else. He stands over me while I mop up what remains of the vodka I sprayed across the floor. I realize what I must look like, down on all fours, my hair, my face, my clothes, a reflection of the cruel joke that has been this night.</p><p>I look up and glower at him, angry just for the fact that he has witnessed my utter humiliation and that, as much as he\u2019s glorying in my downfall, I owe him some debt of gratitude. Drew, on the other hand, is another story. I owe him a fate worse than death. I think I may have preferred to have him dump me on my front porch for my aunt to find rather than putting me at the mercy of Josh Bennett. As soon as the thought crosses my mind, I know that maybe it\u2019s not so true. But it feels like it should be true. I realize I\u2019ve been glaring at him through my entire thought process and I wonder what my face must have betrayed because he\u2019s smiling at me now. Smiling. And it\u2019s almost a real smile, though I can\u2019t be positive, because I\u2019ve never really seen him smile. At school he wears the same unchanging expression, day in and day out, like nothing in the world touches him on any level. And that brings me back to my alien abduction theory, which I\u2019m starting to consider as a real possibility, when he speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to tell me to f**k off right now don\u2019t you, Sunshine?\u201d He\u2019s not done playing with me yet. I narrow my eyes when he calls me Sunshine again, which is a tactical error; because now he knows it annoys me and I have a feeling he\u2019s enjoying annoying me. \u201cWhat? Sunshine fits you. It\u2019s bright and warm and happy. Just. Like. You.\u201d And that\u2019s when I lose it. I can\u2019t help it. As shitty as I feel right now, as stupid as I look, as angry as I am at myself, at Drew, at Josh Fucking Bennett and drinks that taste deceptively like cherry Kool-Aid and nothing else. The ridiculousness of this whole situation slams into me all at once, and for the first time in forever, I laugh. Maybe it\u2019s not even real laughter. Maybe it\u2019s just the deranged cackling of a very unstable girl, but I don\u2019t care, because it feels good and I don\u2019t think I could control it now if I tried. Now the smile is gone from his face. Moved from his to mine, and he\u2019s wearing my confusion. He\u2019s looking at me like the insane girl I am. I may have actually surprised him. You win, Josh Bennett. You earned it.</p><p>When my hysterics subside, he takes the vodka-laden towel from me and goes back into the kitchen. I study the room for the first time. It\u2019s simple. There isn\u2019t much in it that\u2019s modern. Almost everything in here, except for the couch, is made out of wood, which shouldn\u2019t surprise me. None of it goes together. I don\u2019t think any two pieces of furniture in this room match in any way. Every piece is a different style, a different type of wood, a different finish. I wonder if he built any of it. The oddest thing is that there are no fewer than three coffee tables in here. The one in front of the couch I\u2019m sitting on is really nothing to look at. It\u2019s all square edges and plain and the finish is wearing off across the surface where people probably spent years putting down glasses without using coasters. It might not seem out of place, if not for the fact that there are two more across the room, and they are anything but plain. The two of them are from another world and I walk over to get a closer look at them. They don\u2019t even appear to be coffee tables in the traditional sense, but I don\u2019t know what else to call them. They look old. Ornate and understated at the same time. I have no idea why they would be shoved, unceremoniously, against the wall on the far side of the room. I kneel down and reach out to run my fingers along one of the curved legs of the table closest to me, but then I hear Josh coming and I head back over to the couch. I don\u2019t need him thinking I\u2019m, thinking I\u2019m what? Fondling his furniture? I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want him thinking anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Josh comes back, he\u2019s carrying one of those huge plastic hospital mugs. I have a whole collection of them at home. Mine are white with teal lettering. The one he\u2019s holding is red on white. He hands the mug to me. \u201cWater.\u201d I look at him skeptically. \u201cFor real this time. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I manage to get all of the water down in addition to the ibuprofen he hands me with it. Then he takes the mug, without a word, and goes back into the kitchen, returning a moment later with it refilled. He makes me drink that one, too, which I\u2019m none too happy about, because I really just want to get out of here. I look like crap; I feel like crap; and I have no idea how all of this is going to play out on Monday. But I\u2019ll deal with that thought later, when my head isn\u2019t exploding and I\u2019m not on Josh Bennett\u2019s couch.</p><p>I stand up to leave, looking down at myself and wondering if I should even ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the bathroom floor.\u201d He\u2019s smiling at the carpet, not at me, when he says it. \u201cYou seemed really disgusted by it for some reason. Ripped it out from under your shirt, through your sleeve, in one fluid motion and flung it across the room. It was pretty impressive.\u201d Wonderful. Last night\u2019s dinner, the charred remains of my dignity, and apparently, now, my undergarments, too. What else did I leave on Josh Bennett\u2019s bathroom floor? I have to admit that, even in the midst of such utter degradation, I think it\u2019s funny that he can\u2019t seem to say the word bra.</p> <p>He points me in the direction of the bathroom and I walk as gingerly as I can. Every step sends shockwaves rippling from my feet up into my brain. When I get there, my bra mocks me from the tile floor in the corner between the bathtub and the toilet. At least it was a cute black lacy one, because ugly underwear is the only thing that could make this morning any worse. I kneel down to retrieve it, and in the process, wonder if I can possibly scrape up the discarded dregs of my self-respect. I may need them.</p><p>Josh doesn\u2019t need any directions this time. He says nothing at all on the way home and I can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m grateful for that or not. He drops me off at Margot\u2019s with thirty minutes to spare before she gets home from work. It\u2019s just enough time for me to shower and change and pretend all is well before she walks in the door.</p><p>\u201cFeel better, Sunshine.\u201d He\u2019s not looking at me, but I can still see one side of his mouth turned up when I shut the door.</p><p>I think about the fact that he let me sleep on his couch when Drew obviously dumped me there. He held back my hair, cleaned up massive amounts of puke, brought me painkillers and stood over me while he forced me to drink a half-gallon of water so I wouldn\u2019t get dehydrated. There\u2019s nothing sunny or shiny about me, but after last night, he\u2019s earned the right to mock me this morning. So yes, I think, at least for a little while, Josh Bennett can call me whatever the hell he likes.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p> <p>Josh</p><p>At 4:00 on Sunday the doorbell rings. When I open it, I find Drew\u2019s mom on my porch with a plastic container in her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. I made sauce. Drew said you weren\u2019t coming for dinner so I wanted to drop it by.\u201d She knows I can\u2019t make spaghetti sauce to save my life and it pisses me off, so she always brings me some.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I step aside and push the door open so she can come in. \u201cYou could have had Drew bring it to me. You didn\u2019t have to come all the way over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew disappeared somewhere this afternoon. Probably to see whichever girl he\u2019s chasing now.\u201d She raises her eyebrows questioningly at me and I keep my expression blank, wondering if I know exactly which girl that is. I take the container from her and turn to put it in the refrigerator, while she sits down on a barstool at the kitchen counter, in front of the plate of cookies that appeared at my front door earlier today. \u201cBesides, you know I like to check on you and interrogate you on your life every now and then. Even if I know you won\u2019t answer.\u201d She smiles, picking up a cookie.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say for the second time in as many minutes, not sure what I\u2019m thanking her for: coming by, checking on me, not expecting me to answer. Any of a number of things. I could probably thank Mrs. Leighton all day long, but she wouldn\u2019t expect me to.</p> <p>\u201cYou could make it easy on me and just move in with us.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even try to hide the smirk on her face. She\u2019s asked me to move in with them every week since I found out my grandfather was leaving. She always gets the same response, but she never stops asking. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d feel if she did.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say again and now we\u2019re up to three. I don\u2019t need to refuse anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being selfish, you know. I need you to be a good influence on Drew. Someone needs to save that boy from himself. I\u2019m not old enough to be a grandmother.\u201d She looks knowingly at me.</p><p>\u201cI think you give me too much credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh, I love my son, but some days I think you may be the only good thing about him. You are, quite possibly, the only reason I keep him.\u201d She shakes her head and I know she\u2019s not being serious. Drew is a mama\u2019s boy, through and through. He just also happens to be a huge pain in her ass most days. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me. When did you start baking?\u201d She turns the half-eaten cookie over in her hand, examining it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I pause, looking at the plate. Now that part of the bottom is visible, I can see the blue paisley pattern around the edges. I wonder if it\u2019s part of a set and if I should return it. \u201cSomeone else gave me those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else?\u201d she says suspiciously. I can tell her interest is piqued. She got tired of asking Drew about the girls in his life because they come and go so fast that there\u2019s never any point. But she\u2019s never stopped questioning me, waiting for the day when she might actually get an answer. \u201cWell,\u201d she takes another bite of the cookie. \u201cSomeone else can bake. These are delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being evasive,\u201d I smile, answering the question she asked without asking. \u201cI don\u2019t know who it was. They were on my porch this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, pulling the cookie away from her mouth, her smile gone.</p><p>\u201cI have a good idea who it was. I think you\u2019re safe.\u201d Her expression softens to slight relief. I do have a good idea who it was but I can\u2019t know for sure. There was no note with them when the cookies showed up but I couldn\u2019t help the feeling that they were a thank you of sorts. And really, there just isn\u2019t anybody else it could have been. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve eaten like six of them already. If someone wanted to poison me, I think we\u2019d know by now.\u201d</p><p>We talk for a few more minutes and she gets up to leave, asking me one more time if I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t come to dinner. I won\u2019t and she already knows that. I\u2019m still pissed at Drew for Friday night and I don\u2019t feel like dealing with his shit yet.</p><p>\u201cI waited for her in the parking lot this morning,\u201d Drew says when I run into him before the warning bell Monday morning. He called me last night but I didn\u2019t pick up and I deleted the message without listening to it. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since he showed up on Saturday afternoon, wondering what happened with Nastya after he dumped her there. I could say he dropped her off, but we both know that\u2019s not what happened. It would be one thing if he was actually concerned about whether or not she made it home ok or how she was feeling, but his primary concern was finding out how pissed she was at him and I didn\u2019t do anything to try to ease his mind. I hope she\u2019s pissed at him. She should be.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d he laughs as we make our way to first period. \u201cWell, you know, she won\u2019t make distinctive facial expressions at me. She did make one expression involving a finger but it could have just been a tic or some sort of muscle spasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cAre you still pissed at me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. Come on, I dropped a really hot drunk girl, who doesn\u2019t talk, off at your house. That\u2019s like a gift.\u201d</p><p>I stop walking and look at him, wondering, yet again, why we are friends. I know him well enough to know that he\u2019s not being serious. Drew is an ass and a whore but he\u2019s not a complete douchebag. Still, I can\u2019t help but call him on it. He deserves it this time.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize with an utter lack of conviction and keep walking. \u201cI thought you were just asking me to clean up your mess. I didn\u2019t realize you were being a friend and giving me an unresponsive drunk girl to rape. Next time, be a little clearer for me so I don\u2019t miss such a golden opportunity.\u201d I can\u2019t hide the sarcasm in my tone and I don\u2019t try.</p><p>\u201cYou know I was kidding.\u201d He has the grace to at least sound like he feels bad. \u201cI left her with you because I knew you wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Now he makes me sound like some sort of monk and I don\u2019t think I like that any better.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know that. She probably thinks you did exactly what you said you did. Dumped her with some strange guy without thinking twice about what would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did happen? You were so pissed at me on Saturday you wouldn\u2019t tell me shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because I was up half the night cleaning up vomit.\u201d I stop walking and look at him so he realizes that I\u2019m not joking. There is nothing at all funny about the amount of puke I faced on Friday night. I may never be the same again. \u201cYou want to know what happened? She threw up. A lot. She passed out. She woke up. I took her home. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I so owe you,\u201d he says, still cringing from the discussion of vomit.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Nastya</p><p>When I get to shop on Monday, Margot\u2019s blue paisley plate is sitting on the counter in the back of the room where I usually sit. Josh isn\u2019t at his regular table but he must have put it here. I see him on the other side of the shop where all the power tools are. I don\u2019t want to stare at him long enough to figure out what he\u2019s doing, so I shove the plate in my backpack before he gets back to his seat. The bell rings and he slides onto his stool without a glance in my direction and things are normal again. The normalcy doesn\u2019t last long, which shouldn\u2019t surprise me. I don\u2019t think anything is normal where Josh Bennett is concerned. Though, I really shouldn\u2019t be judging him on normalcy, especially when I\u2019m watching him from the confines of my own, very precarious, glass house.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bennett! Is it true you got emancipated?\u201d Emancipated? I look around to see who\u2019s asking the question. It\u2019s some punk-ass skater kid whose name, I think, is Kevin, but I haven\u2019t paid enough attention to know for certain. Mostly what I\u2019ve picked up is that his hair is overlong in the front, his pants are always baggy and he thinks he\u2019s pretty awesome. I really don\u2019t care who asked the question but I\u2019m definitely interested in the answer.</p><p>Josh nods, but says nothing. He\u2019s looking down, working on the scale drawing we were assigned Friday. He doesn\u2019t bother to lift his head and acknowledge Kevin or anyone else whose attention is now on him.</p><p>\u201cSo that means you\u2019re, like, free to do whatever the hell you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d He turns the ruler and traces a line along the edge of it with a pencil. \u201cOf course, I can\u2019t murder anyone, so it has its limits,\u201d he adds dryly, still not looking up. I have to stifle my own smile, especially when Kevin soldiers on, completely oblivious to the innuendo.</p><p>\u201cMan, that\u2019s awesome. I\u2019d be having parties every night.\u201d Kevin doesn\u2019t seem to take the hint that Josh has nothing to say to him and keeps pushing. I\u2019m kind of wishing Josh would give this kid the f**kuppance he so richly deserves, but I think that\u2019s more my style than Josh Bennett\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hear someone tell Kevin, in a hushed voice, to shut up. The kids around him look anywhere from curious to uncomfortable to downright astonished by his line of questioning. I\u2019m in the curious camp myself, but I\u2019m trying to act disinterested. I can tell Mr. Turner\u2019s picked up on it, too, because he keeps glancing in that direction. He\u2019s not going to interfere, but he damn sure wants to know what\u2019s being said. He looks almost disgusted. I know that I\u2019m missing some vital piece of information here and I can\u2019t ask anyone what it is. Why has he been emancipated? Are his parents abusive? Dead? In jail? Out of the country? Maybe there\u2019s a top secret spy mission involved.</p><p>My mind turns while the conversation continues. I\u2019m still trying to figure out why Josh has been emancipated and what it has to do with the fact that everyone stays the hell out of his way. We\u2019ve been sitting here for all of forty-five seconds and yet I almost feel like the air in the room has gotten heavier.</p><p>Josh</p><p>I can see their expressions without looking. Usually everyone ignores me, but the times when they don\u2019t are worse. Like now. You either get the ignorant crap spewed by morons like Kevin Leonard or you get the sucks-to-be-you stares. Especially from the girls. The girls are the worst. Drew says I should use it to my advantage; that I waste the shitty cards I\u2019ve been dealt and that I should at least get something out of being such a tragic figure. But there\u2019s something about being pity-fucked that just doesn\u2019t sit well. It\u2019s hard to want a girl who looks at you like you\u2019re a lost puppy she wants to take home and feed or a dejected child who needs to curl up in her lap and be coddled. There\u2019s nothing hot about a girl feeling sorry for me. Maybe if I was desperate, but probably not even then.</p> <p>The adults are even worse because they love to make their dumbass comments about how well I\u2019m doing; how well adjusted I\u2019ve become; how well I handle everything. As if they have any clue. The only thing I\u2019ve learned to do well is avoid, but everyone would rather believe it\u2019s all good. That way they can crawl back under the shelter of that rock they live under. The one they think death can\u2019t see them through.</p><p>It\u2019s even the same with the teachers. I can get out of almost any assignment I want if I play the death card. It makes everyone uncomfortable, so they\u2019ll do just about anything you want to get you to go away so they can pretend it doesn\u2019t happen. They get to convince themselves that they empathize and that they\u2019ve done their good deed for the day. When I\u2019m lucky, they just ignore me because that\u2019s easier for all of us anyway. Easier than having to acknowledge death.</p><p>One death card might be more than enough to play for a missed assignment or copping a feel on some girl, but I\u2019m racking up a full deck at this point, and I can probably get away with almost anything. People started looking the other way a long time ago. Maybe I did, too.</p><p>When I was eight I went to a spring training game with my dad. Once a month my parents would split up and each take either my sister, Amanda, or I out for the day. One month I\u2019d go with my dad and Amanda would go with my mom. The next month we\u2019d switch. It was March and it was my turn to go with my mom, but since that\u2019s when the game was, I begged to go with my dad instead. I told my mom she could have me April and May to make up for it. Because I was such a f**king prize. My mom said it sounded like a good deal to her and made me shake on it.</p><p>My dad and I got home at six o\u2019clock. I had fallen asleep in the car on the way home. He woke me up when we pulled in but he ended up carrying me into the house anyway because my ass was not crawling out of that car. We ate too much, laughed too much, yelled too much. My stomach hurt. My face was sunburnt. I lost my voice and I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. It was the last happy day of my life.</p> <p>When I woke up, I didn\u2019t have a mom or a sister anymore, but apparently it would all work out, because we\u2019d end up having more money than we would ever need. The trucking company\u2019s lawyers said it was a generous settlement. My dad\u2019s lawyers said it was fair. Fair compensation for my mother\u2019s life. Fair compensation for my dead sister. They didn\u2019t consider the fact that I really lost my father, too, that day. That something in him broke, shattered, melted, combusted, disintegrated like the car my mother was driving when an 18-wheeler delivering soda drove right over it. But I\u2019m sure if they had considered that, too, they would have determined that it was also more than fair. Generous, even. I don\u2019t have a sister to bitch about or a mother to talk to or a father build things with. But I have millions of nearly untouched dollars in bank accounts and brokerage funds and life is so very f**king fair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely awesome,\u201d I reply, hoping my agreement will get Kevin to turn back around and impress someone else with his ignorance and talk of legendary partying. \u201cNobody gives a shit what I do.\u201d It\u2019s true in more ways than one. I look up and focus my eyes on his, hoping he understands.</p><p>I go back to finishing the scale drawing I\u2019ve been working on, glad that everyone\u2019s attention has shifted back to more important things, like math tests and hot girls. Mr. Turner is making his way around the room, looking over everyone\u2019s shoulders to check their progress. He passes my table and glances behind me.</p><p>\u201cNastya, you can\u2019t draw sitting up there. Why don\u2019t you move over and sit at the empty seat next to Kevin?\u201d He sounds almost apologetic for asking her to move. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s even expecting her to do the assignment. So far he\u2019s been acting like she\u2019s not even in the class, which we both know she shouldn\u2019t be. But I guess he got stuck with her, because she\u2019s still here. I think she makes people as uncomfortable as I do. Mr. Turner\u2019s never been awkward with me, but he sure as hell is around her. Maybe it\u2019s the clothes, or lack thereof, because he always seems kind of scared to look at her. I had forgotten she\u2019d been behind me this whole time, and that she probably heard the entire exchange earlier. She starts picking up her things and Mr. Turner shifts his attention back to me.</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d he says, checking out the sketch in front of me. \u201cWhat are you going to use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEuropean ash, probably. Natural finish,\u201d I reply. He nods, but stands there a second longer.</p> <p>\u201cEverything ok?\u201d he asks and I know he\u2019s referring to the Kevin situation, which is stupid, because I don\u2019t let that crap bother me anymore.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s good,\u201d I tell him, turning the ruler on my paper as he walks back up to his desk. Behind me, I hear Nastya hop down off of the counter, the click of her heels hitting the floor. She passes behind me, moving around my table to the one where Kevin Leonard is laughing his self-congratulatory ass off. Everyone\u2019s working on their own now, and the noise level has kicked up considerably, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m imagining things, or maybe I\u2019m just crazy, when I hear the words.</p><p>You lie. They aren\u2019t even a whisper. They drift into my consciousness so soft they almost have no form, as if they\u2019re made of air and longing, but I swear I hear them anyway. When I look up, the only person who could have said them is settling down on a stool next to Kevin Leonard and I kick myself for being ridiculous, because I know they can\u2019t be real, and that the longing those words were born from is mine.</p><p>I make it to art just under the wire, slipping in and sitting at an empty table in the back, behind Clay Whitaker. I\u2019m not much for art but there were no course numbers left to sign me up for an extra shop class. I\u2019d taken them all, so I needed another elective to fill my schedule. Preferably one without homework or thought involved. The path of least resistance is well worn by my boots. Mrs. Carson lets me get by with turning in sketches of furniture that I love and whatever I\u2019m designing to build at some point. Sometimes I draw stuff I see in antique stores. Things I wish I had the talent to make. Maybe one day. I\u2019m not that great when it comes to the drawing. I\u2019m ok. Not terrible, not amazing. I glance at the table in front of me. Clay Whitaker is amazing. He can do with a sketchbook and charcoal what I wish I could do with lumber and tools. I pull out my backpack and rummage through it for the picture I printed off the internet last night. I barely get started when Clay turns around.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d He inclines his head to get a better view of the picture in front of me.</p><p>It\u2019s a late 19th century George II-style marble-topped console table. Our assignment was to bring in a photograph to recreate so that\u2019s what I picked.</p><p>\u201cTable,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOne day you should try drawing something with two legs instead of four.\u201d</p> <p>Drawing people doesn\u2019t interest me, plus, I suck at it. \u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWho, not what,\u201d he corrects. Clay rarely draws anything other than people. He\u2019s obsessed with human faces. If I\u2019m forever drawing furniture, he\u2019s forever drawing people. He\u2019s damn good at it, too. It\u2019s almost creepy how realistic his drawings look. There is some arcane quality about his sketches; some way he makes you see past the face itself and into it. I\u2019ve seen him make even the plainest, most uninspiring face interesting in ways I don\u2019t have words for. I\u2019m jealous of his talent. If I didn\u2019t have something of my own to love like that, I\u2019d be insanely jealous. As it is, I can appreciate his ability without hating him for it, but I know there are a few people in this class who can\u2019t. Sometimes I think Mrs. Carson, herself, is one of them. It must be kind of depressing to have to teach someone who surpasses your abilities on every level.</p><p>My attention shifts back to Clay as he drags a 4x6 photograph off his table and passes it back to me with a shit-eating grin on his face like he knows something I don\u2019t. I take the picture out of his hands and look down at it. I\u2019m not sure who I expected it to be, but it certainly wasn\u2019t the girl whose face I\u2019m looking at now. Even so, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. If there\u2019s an interesting face in this school, it\u2019s Nastya Kashnikov\u2019s, maybe just because she never opens her mouth to take away from the mystery. I stare at the picture a second longer than I should. She\u2019s looking in the general direction of the lens, but not directly facing it. The camera must have been zoomed in on her, because it\u2019s not that well focused, and it\u2019s obvious that she didn\u2019t know the picture was being taken.</p><p>\u201cWhy her?\u201d I ask, reluctantly handing it back.</p><p>\u201cHer face is insane, even with all that shit she covers it up with. If I can do that justice, I\u2019ll never need to draw another girl again.\u201d He\u2019s staring at the photograph like he\u2019s picturing how she looks without the make-up. I want to tell him he\u2019s right. What she looks like in that picture is nothing compared to what she looks like without a trace of make-up on and her hair pulled off her face. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like a picture of, instead of having to rely on my memory of her, lost and dripping sweat in my garage at one in the morning.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think she was your type.\u201d I yank my attention away from thoughts I shouldn\u2019t be having and put the focus back on him so maybe he won\u2019t notice, but Clay always notices. Clay\u2019s as much of an outcast here as anybody and I know he\u2019s a watcher, too. I\u2019ve seen enough of his drawings to know how many people he studies when they don\u2019t know he\u2019s looking. And when Clay looks, he sees, and that\u2019s the most disconcerting thing of all.</p><p>\u201cMy dick doesn\u2019t have to want her. Just my pencil.\u201d He smiles at me again, like he\u2019s got some secret of mine. He probably does. He\u2019s always watching me like he never got the message to leave me the hell alone. For some reason, I don\u2019t mind. He stays in the fringes, and other than the shit he still occasionally takes for coming out, he flies under the radar. I go back to my own crappy drawing and then kick myself when my mouth opens again.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle.\u201d The name is an answer in itself. Yearbook Michelle. Clay\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t throw the word yearbook in front of her name when he says it. She sits with him every day at lunch, camera all but surgically attached to her hands. \u201cI got her to take it in the courtyard one day when Nastya wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d He shrugs, looking a little guilty, though not at all apologetic. He uses her name like he knows her and I wonder how well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019d kick your ass if she knew you took it.\u201d It\u2019s a dumbass thing to say. I don\u2019t know her well enough to know what she\u2019d do and I\u2019m talking about her like I do. She\u2019s ripped enough to kick his ass, and mine, too. Really, she should have kicked my ass for handing her a glass of vodka when she was hung over, but she laughed in my face instead, so what the hell do I know?</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who want to kick my ass,\u201d he responds nonchalantly, as if it\u2019s just a fact of life. It\u2019s true that a lot of the ass**les in this school want to kick the crap out of him, but wanting and doing are two different things. They still talk shit about him, but nobody\u2019s laid a hand on Clay since eighth grade and he and I both know why.</p><p>When my mom died, I went through the angry phase. It\u2019s okay, of course, because anger is acceptable when you\u2019re grieving, especially when you\u2019re an eight year-old boy. People will make a lot of excuses for you. I dealt with my acceptable anger by doing unacceptable things like beating the crap out of other kids who pissed me off. Pissing me off didn\u2019t take much. I was pretty liberal about what would be enough set me off. Turned out, even the unacceptable things I did with my fists were considered acceptable and brushed under the carpet.</p><p>I punched Mike Scanlon in the face, twice, because he said my mom was in the ground getting eaten by maggots. I don\u2019t think there was even enough of her body left after the crash to feed a maggot, but I didn\u2019t argue with him. I just nailed him in the face. Gave him a black eye and a split lip. He told his dad. His dad came to my house and I hid around the corner, listening and wondering how much trouble I was going to get in. But he wasn\u2019t even mad. He told my dad it was okay. He said he understood. He didn\u2019t understand crap, but I didn\u2019t get in trouble. And that\u2019s the way it always went.</p> <p>The only time I really had to answer for it at all was the one time it happened at school. I punched Paul Keller on the soccer field during P.E. and I thought I was in for it. The principal called me in, which had never happened in my life. Lucky for me, he also understood and I got off with a warning and a few trips to the school psychologist. All the kids I beat up learned that no one was going to touch me for anything I did. I could hit them in broad daylight with ten witnesses and even their own dads would tell them to give me a break.</p><p>My angry phase had ended by the time I got to eighth grade, just in time for my dad to have a heart attack. By that time, almost everybody left me alone. No one would give me an excuse to be angry at them. Then one day I was walking home from school and ran into three shits beating the crap out of Clay Whitaker. I didn\u2019t even know him at the time but they were kicking him good and I needed an excuse to kick someone back. I had a lot of healthy, acceptable anger built up and they were good therapy. There were three of them and I wasn\u2019t the biggest kid around. They should have been able to grind me into the sidewalk without breaking a sweat. But they had only garden-variety cruelty to fuel them. I had pure unadulterated rage.</p><p>Clay was sitting on the ground when the other kids finally ran off. I was hurt and out of breath so I sat down, also, because I didn\u2019t know where to go and I didn\u2019t care if anyone else came looking for me. No one did. I probably would have hit them, too. Clay didn\u2019t say thank you, or anything else to me for that matter, which was good, because I didn\u2019t deserve any thanks. I didn\u2019t do it for him. There weren\u2019t any noble intentions.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care if I got in trouble. I didn\u2019t care about Clay Whitaker, sitting a couple feet away, bloody and crying. I just didn\u2019t care. That was the last time I hit anyone. After that day, I decided to wait until someone gave me a good reason. But it didn\u2019t matter, because everyone had already learned that I\u2019d get away with it if I did. I wasn\u2019t even sure what a good reason would be, but I figured I\u2019d know when the time came. And maybe it never would.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say a word to Clay before I finally got up and walked home and we never spoke about what happened. I was used to people not bothering me, but after that day, nobody bothered Clay Whitaker, either.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to understand the feeling,\u201d I mutter, and he knows I\u2019m not serious but he throws his hands up and takes the hint.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll leave you to your very compelling table. I\u2019m going to draw a girl,\u201d he says smugly and turns around to open his sketchbook.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I used to spend excessive amounts of time thinking about what I\u2019d be doing over the next twenty or so years. It usually had something to do with playing the piano in concert halls all over the world. Which would mean lots of world travel that would include stays at fabulously glamorous hotels with fabulously fluffy towels and fluffier bathrobes. There would also be the unbelievably hot, musically gifted, swoon-worthy princes who would tour with me and inevitably fall obsessively in love with me. Because that happens. I would be revered for the talent that came from my father\u2019s side of the family and the beauty that came from my mother\u2019s. I\u2019d wear elegant gowns in colors that haven\u2019t even been imagined yet and everyone would know my name.</p><p>Now I spend my time thinking about what I\u2019ll be doing over the next twenty or so hours and hoping it involves something resembling sleep.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been able to run every night for a week now. The weather has cooperated. My legs are coming back. I push myself harder than I should but I haven\u2019t thrown up again since the second night. My body is remembering. The best part is that I can exhaust myself, drain everything the day dredges up, so I can sleep. I still can\u2019t do without the notebooks, but the running helps. It gives me something, or maybe more accurately, it takes something away. I don\u2019t care. I know I depend on it too much but it\u2019s the one of the only things I can depend on. Exercise, notebooks, hate. The things that do not let me down.</p><p>I know my way around the streets now. I can pay attention without paying attention. I\u2019ve memorized the ambient sound. I know what belongs and what doesn\u2019t. I know where the sidewalks are uneven, where the pavement has been pushed up by the roots of an angry tree. My mind has learned what to expect from the night I run in. I leave around the same time every evening but I don\u2019t run the same route twice. I can get myself home a dozen different ways from any direction if I need to. I am not comfortable. I\u2019ll never be comfortable leaving the house again, but I feel prepared, and that\u2019s better than I was the last time and the most I can expect to be.</p><p>For the past six nights, I have purposely avoided the pale yellow stucco house on Corinthian Way. The one with the perpetually open garage. I run past the street every night, but I can\u2019t ignore the pull I feel to at least glance down the road from the turn off. I can tell by the pattern of the lights whether or not the garage door is up and it hasn\u2019t disappointed yet. It hasn\u2019t been closed once, no matter what time it is. I always wonder what he might say if I were to show up there again. I know it won\u2019t be much but I wonder what the words would be anyway. Would he say anything? Would he ignore me and keep working as if I wasn\u2019t there? Would he tell me to leave? Ask me to stay? No, I know he wouldn\u2019t do that. Josh Bennett doesn\u2019t ask anybody to stay. I could come up with a hundred possibilities, but I really can\u2019t figure out which of them would be the closest to possible. Then, for a just a moment, I lose focus. I stop thinking about what he would say to me and start pondering what I would say to him. That\u2019s the moment I push my feet hard and fast in the opposite direction. And I run far away from Corinthian Way and my absurd, self-destructive thoughts.</p><p>I get back to Margot\u2019s house at 9:25 and head straight for the shower. I talk more to myself in that shower than I have in months. Within the safety of an empty house, under the muting of the running water, I remind myself of all the complications that will come from opening my mouth. I try to get all of the words out of my system. I tell Ethan Hall that he\u2019s a douche while I visualize administering a perfectly executed palm heel strike to his face. Or a fork to his eye, which is equally appealing. I tell Ms. Jennings that, contrary to popular belief, Bach was not more prolific than Telemann; he\u2019s just better remembered. I tell Drew which of his pick-up lines works the best and who I think he should really use them on instead of wasting them on me. I tell my Dad that he can still call me Milly because, even though it\u2019s a sucky nickname, it makes him happy and that makes me happy in a way I don\u2019t know how to be anymore. I tell my therapists thank you, but that nothing they do or say or try to make me say will help. I talk until the water runs cold and my voice feels hoarse from overuse. I hope it\u2019s enough to help me keep my mouth shut. I haven\u2019t said a word to another living person in 452 days. I write my three and a half pages, tuck away my composition book and crawl into bed, knowing how close I came to not making it to 453.</p><p>I\u2019ve been doing a decent job avoiding Josh at school. Other than fifth hour, the only time I have to see him is in shop, which is always a humbling experience since everyone in that class knows their way around lumber and power tools and I\u2019m lucky I can identify a hammer, maybe not even that. The other day this kid named Errol asked me to hand him one, and when I did, he looked at me like I was an idiot. Apparently there are like four hundred kinds of hammers and I didn\u2019t give him the right one. Now nobody even asks me to get them stuff.</p><p>I could have tried to drop the class, but I decided to choose my battles with the guidance department and shop was the lesser of the evils when compared to Speech and Debate and Intro to Music. Between the two of those, I figured I could survive Speech since Mr. Trent had told me I could earn my grade doing research and finding interpretation material. Plus, I had crash hot sexy Drew to amuse me and I\u2019ll take all the amusement I can get. And if I\u2019m being completely honest with myself, which I usually endeavor to avoid, I knew from day one that I needed the hell out of Intro to Music. That class was a fault line running just beneath the surface of my unstable mind. I\u2019d rather avoid it. I\u2019m good at avoiding.</p><p>And besides, being the teacher aide in Ms. McAllister\u2019s fifth hour has been more entertaining than I could have hoped for. It\u2019s like the school equivalent of watching Big Brother; I get to eavesdrop on the drama and it\u2019s not mentally taxing in the least. Drew is in there, along with Josh, dirtbag Ethan, f**kwad Kevin Leonard and this badass girl named Tierney Lowell who Drew argues with non-stop. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s my biggest fan, either. She hasn\u2019t told me outright, but she glares at me like I spend my free time murdering puppies, so it\u2019s an educated guess.</p><p>Shop really isn\u2019t so bad, either, even if it does make me feel inept and useless most of the time. No one bothers me, and Mr. Turner doesn\u2019t expect me to do much of anything. Josh is apparently some sort of god there. He walks around like he built the place. They should give him a dedicated phone line in the workshop, because every time the phone rings, the same thing happens: Turner answers, Turner summons Josh, Josh leaves. He gets sent out a lot. Shelves need fixing? Call Josh Bennett. Drawers stuck? Get Josh. Need an exquisitely-crafted, custom-built dining room set? Josh Bennett is your man.</p> <p>Just don\u2019t ask him to talk. He hasn\u2019t said anything to me since the day he told me he wasn\u2019t going to make me relinquish my seat at his table, benevolent despot that he is. I, obviously, have not said anything to him.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Josh</p><p>Drew walks in at about ten after eleven on Sunday morning. I forgot to lock the door when I went out to get the newspaper this morning so he walks right in. I have to cancel the stupid thing. I don\u2019t read it. It\u2019s another remnant from my grandfather living here. I tried to convince him to read it online but he wouldn\u2019t have it. He said he liked the feel of it in his hands and the smell of the paper. I hate the way newspaper feels and I like the way it smells even less. I make a note to call today and have them stop delivery. I don\u2019t want to have to see another one in my driveway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask while he makes himself at home.</p><p>\u201cSarah. House. Girls. Too many,\u201d he sighs, collapsing prone onto the couch and staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was such a thing as too many girls in your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to Sarah\u2019s friends, I make exceptions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never make exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. True story. But I should.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t blame him. Sarah\u2019s friends are painful. They\u2019re nice to look at, but they all know it, which kind of diminishes the appeal. They\u2019re all the things about the girls at school that I can\u2019t stand and Sarah\u2019s turning just like them. I guess I\u2019m lucky I intimidate them, because after they try their flirting thing once, they usually realize they\u2019re not going to get a reaction and they don\u2019t come back for more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already hit at least three of them. Finally learn your lesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink they finally learned theirs. Plus, Sarah put her foot down and said no more with the friends. Off limits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she really think you\u2019re going to listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe put her foot down to them. I\u2019m off limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow deprived they must feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock. It\u2019s true. I\u2019m like a rite of passage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you. Can\u2019t be in the house. I feel my testosterone levels dropping by the second in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but why are you here?\u201d My house is usually not the first resort for escape when Drew needs to get away from his. It used to be a few years ago, but not anymore. I think it might have something to do with my possession of a Y chromosome.</p><p>\u201cNowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could pick up some grain alcohol. Go make a peace offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going over there alone. They might never find my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving up so soon?\u201d There are a hundred other girls he could go after; this one I just don\u2019t get.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just have to switch tactics. Ideas?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have any ideas and if I did I wouldn\u2019t help him out. I do have questions, though, and I seem to come up with more every day. \u201cWhy do you think she doesn\u2019t talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody knows. I hit her with some of my favorite material, and judging by the look I got, she has no problem grasping the English language. I\u2019m voting no vocal cords.\u201d</p> <p>I know for a fact that\u2019s not true. She laughed when she was here\u200c\u2014\u200cfull-on laughed. I looked it up. You need vocal cords to produce sound like that, so I know that\u2019s not it. Maybe it\u2019s still a physical thing. I don\u2019t know shit about anything like that, but something tells me it\u2019s not physical and that makes me wonder even more. What reason does someone have to not talk? Did she ever talk? Maybe she\u2019s never uttered a single word. I don\u2019t know. I do know that she pays attention; she\u2019s watching everything all the time, even when she\u2019s not even looking. I don\u2019t think she misses a damn thing. It might creep me out if I didn\u2019t kind of get it. I wonder if she sees things that I don\u2019t, but it\u2019s not like she\u2019d tell me and I would never ask anyway.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem like your type,\u201d I say. With rare exception, Drew tends to go the vapid, cute and popular route. He\u2019s all about the path of least resistance when it comes to girls, and fortunately for him, that path seems to lead to almost any girl in school. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been turned down, even though they all know the reputation and he\u2019s never done anything to sugar-coat it. He\u2019s never pulled out the love card and pretended to have any sort of feelings for a girl to get her to sleep with him. He doesn\u2019t have to. They do it anyway without any emotional persuasion from him. They provide that all on their own.</p><p>Most girls think they\u2019ll be the one he ends up staying with but it never happens. You\u2019d think at least one of them would publicly call him out for it. Try to make him take responsibility and own up, but none of them do, because at the end of the day, they know that Drew did exactly what Drew does and most of them realize they probably shouldn\u2019t have bought into the reform-the-asshole fantasy.</p><p>I\u2019d like to blame him, but it\u2019s hard when he doesn\u2019t deny or make excuses or apologies. He is what he is. Take it or leave it. I couldn\u2019t do what he does, not that there isn\u2019t a certain appeal. I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019ve thought about, but it\u2019s way too much responsibility for me. Too many feelings coming off of those girls and I\u2019m not good at deflecting them. They seem to roll right off Drew. The tears and the name calling and the bitterness don\u2019t even faze him. I have enough responsibility and I don\u2019t want anyone else\u2019s feelings to worry about. I banished my own a long time ago and I\u2019ll be damned if I have to deal with someone else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s female. She\u2019s hot. Requirements met,\u201d he says bluntly.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to hate you.\u201d She seems to hate everyone but I don\u2019t bother to say that. I\u2019m really trying to figure out why he\u2019s wasting his time with this girl. It\u2019s out of character. He should have given up on this a while ago.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Doesn\u2019t exerting effort go against your personal philosophy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, but maybe I\u2019m entering a personal growth phase. Trying to improve myself.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a laugh or a gagging sound. I\u2019m not sure which.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lack of faith is insulting. Besides, not all of us have a sure thing in our back pockets with no strings and no effort required.\u201d He looks deliberately at me. I can\u2019t dispute it. There\u2019s no point in acting all high and mighty when I don\u2019t ever have to worry about getting a girl to have sex with me.</p><p>I\u2019ve got Leigh, even though she\u2019s not around as much as she used to be now that she\u2019s in college, but that just makes it easier. She\u2019s only a couple of hours away and she comes by whenever she\u2019s home for weekends and holidays. Then she leaves again. She doesn\u2019t tell me she loves me. She doesn\u2019t ask if I love her. I don\u2019t and I never will. We have an easy non-emotional arrangement; we use each other and go home. It\u2019s about as perfect as a situation gets. Even if I didn\u2019t have Leigh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be desperate enough to sink to Drew\u2019s level. I like getting laid well enough, but knowing me, I\u2019d still feel like a prick and end up dating the girl for months out of guilt.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to judge me. In fact, in light of my newfound self-improvement goals, I\u2019m going to conquer my fear of being flayed alive and go over to her house right now.\u201d He jumps up off the couch and heads for the door.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d I say, not meaning it in the least.</p><p>I spend the rest of the afternoon involved in varying degrees of avoidance. I finally did pick up the phone and cancel the newspaper, which I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d actually do. Then I figured as long as I was dealing with things I\u2019d call the hospice and have them come take away the hospital bed they delivered for my grandfather two months ago. He\u2019s been gone for two weeks, but it feels like forever. If there weren\u2019t so many phone calls to make, I might wonder if he was ever here at all.</p><p>When I hang up with hospice, I look at the phone and think about calling my grandfather. I thought about calling yesterday and the day before and the day before that. But I haven\u2019t actually called. I spoke to him last week and it sucked. He\u2019s a hundred times worse since he left here. His mind isn\u2019t his anymore. It belongs to oxycodone and morphine and every other pain killer they can pump into him to make it easier. Talking to him isn\u2019t even talking to him anymore. He\u2019s a body on the other end of the phone, but the mind is all but gone. I can almost hear his brain struggling to process the words as I speak to him. He can\u2019t make sense of it and I know it frustrates him, and if there is any part of my heart left to break, it breaks with his confusion. Still, I get selfish sometimes and call him anyway. For me. And I talk. I tell him things I wouldn\u2019t tell another living person, because I know that when I hang up, it will be like I never told anyone at all.</p><p>Even the last real conversation we had, on the Saturday night before my great uncle and his wife came to pick him up, was tainted by the drugs. He sat me down to give me the advice he thought I still needed. He told me to sit on the couch and he sat in the recliner across from me the way he had for years when he was imparting whatever piece of wisdom he felt I needed at that point in my life. I never really listened because I didn\u2019t think I needed his wisdom. That night I sat. And I listened. I\u2019d listen to anything he wanted to say. I was greedy for it, desperate for whatever words he had left to give me, even if they were delivered through a drug-addled haze.</p><p>He told me a lot of things that night and I remember them all. There was talk of women and unforgiveable things, porch swings and red brick houses and memories that didn\u2019t exist yet.</p><p>I have to be at Drew\u2019s for dinner at 6:00 which means I need to get in the shower now and find some better clothes to put on. Drew\u2019s mom likes it when you dress for Sunday dinner. It\u2019s not any fancy thing, but according to Mrs. Leighton, dressing nicely makes it special, so that\u2019s what we do. I tried to get out of going, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. I haven\u2019t gone to Sunday dinner in three weeks. I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s actually fun most of the time. I get to eat real food that I don\u2019t have to cook and Drew doesn\u2019t act like such a douche around his family. It\u2019s just that, when I go there, I feel like I\u2019m in an episode of Sesame Street, stuck in the upper quadrant of the TV screen while they sing that one of these things just doesn\u2019t belong here. The normalcy of it reminds me, in detail, of how f**ked my life actually is. I could stand here all day thinking of all of the reasons not to go, but I know I\u2019m not getting out of it, so I suck it up, pull some decent clothes out of the closet and jump in the shower.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Nastya</p><p>There are twenty-seven bones in your hand and wrist. Twenty-two of mine were broken. Relatively speaking, my hand is kind of a miracle. It\u2019s full of plates and screws, and even after several surgeries, it still doesn\u2019t look quite right. But it works better than they thought it would. And it\u2019s not like it can\u2019t do anything; it just can\u2019t do the one thing I want it to. The thing that made me, me.</p><p>I never had much of a social life, even before. After school, I spent my hours in the music lab or in private instruction and my Saturdays were spent playing the piano at weddings. There were times during wedding season that I\u2019d hit three in a day. I\u2019d run out of one church, jump in the car my mom would be waiting in out front, and rush to the next. It got crazy sometimes and I rarely had a free weekend, but the money was awesome, the time commitment minimal, and it was easy. Most wedding coordinators and brides aren\u2019t very original. I had about five pieces of music that were rotated through; the standards that you tend to hear at every wedding. I took it for granted that I could sleepwalk through those things. I had three dresses that got rotated just like the music; all conservative and girly with varying degrees of formality depending on the wedding itself. I wonder what they would have done if I walked in dressed like I do today.</p><p>When I wasn\u2019t playing weddings, I played at upscale malls and restaurants. I was a pretty little novelty in the beginning. I was everybody\u2019s pet. I don\u2019t know if anyone really knew my name; they mostly just called me the Brighton Piano Girl, which was fine, because that\u2019s who I was. Once I got older, everybody was used to seeing me here or there, but back when I started, around eight years old, people usually did a double take. I\u2019d wear my frilly little dresses and my hair would always be tied back out of my face with a matching ribbon. I\u2019d smile and play my Bach or Mozart or whatever overused pieces of music they asked me to play. Everyone knew me and people would always clap when I got done and say hi to me whenever they saw me. I loved every second of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time I was forced to stop, I had quite a bit of money put away. I was saving it to pay for the summer music conservatory in New York that I had been drooling over for three years and was finally old enough, at fifteen, to apply to. My parents said if I wanted to go I had to work for the money, but that was a joke, because work meant play and playing was never work. Between that and school and private instruction and recitals, it hadn\u2019t left much time for a social life, but it was a small sacrifice. Plus, if I\u2019m being honest, it probably wasn\u2019t any sacrifice. I didn\u2019t go to parties and I was too young to drive. I liked Nick Kerrigan but mostly we just looked at each other and looked away a lot.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a bunch of girlfriends to go hang out at the mall with and my mom bought most of my clothes anyway. Even at fifteen, I was younger than fifteen. My style was Sunday school-chic. The couple of friends I had were like me. We spent all of our free hours practicing because that\u2019s who we were. Piano girls. Violin girls. Flute girls. That was normalcy. My grades weren\u2019t awesome and I was the polar opposite of popular, but it was ok. It was better than being normal. I never gave two shits about normal. I wanted extraordinary.</p><p>Normal people had friends. I had music. I wasn\u2019t missing anything.</p><p>These days I\u2019m missing everything. I\u2019m haunted by music; music I can hear, but never play again. Melodies that taunt me note by note, mocking me with the simple fact that they exist.</p> <p>I still have all of the money that I saved for the conservatory. I had more than enough, but I never did get to go. I spent that summer in and out of hospitals, recovering, in physical therapy, learning to pick up quarters off of a table, and with therapists talking about why I was mad.</p><p>At this point I\u2019ve regained enough control in my hand that I could probably bang something out on the piano if I tried, but it would never be what it used to be, what it should be. Music should flow so that you can\u2019t tell where one note ends and the next begins; music should have grace and there is no grace left in my hand. There are metal screws and damaged nerves and shattered bones, but there isn\u2019t any grace.</p><p>Today is Sunday and I have nowhere to be. I never had weddings to do on Sundays but I usually spent the mornings filling in at the Lutheran church if they needed me. I wasn\u2019t religious; it was just a favor to one of my mom\u2019s friends, so I did it. Afternoons were usually spent at the grand piano upstairs in the mall outside Nordstrom\u2019s. Then I\u2019d actually practice the real stuff in the evenings and once in a while I did my homework.</p><p>Now homework is about the only thing I have to do, so miraculously, it\u2019s been getting done. But I\u2019m still kind of crap at it.</p><p>Margot spends the afternoons next to the pool until she has to get ready for work. I can\u2019t sunbathe. It doesn\u2019t work so well with the translucent skin, plus, I suck with the sitting still. I will douse myself with sunscreen on occasion, braid my hair and swim laps until my limbs won\u2019t move. I can\u2019t run in the afternoons so it\u2019s a good alternative.</p> <p>I\u2019m only on lap twenty-five when I lift my head out of the water to see Margot standing at the edge of the pool next to the perpetually-smirking Drew Leighton. I\u2019m momentarily dumbfounded, wondering how he knew where I lived, when I remember that he picked me up for that ill-fated party last week. I am so not about to pull myself up and out of this pool dripping wet and nearly na**d in front of him. I might go to school half-naked, but half-naked and nearly na**d are two entirely different things, and I\u2019m not going to climb out of the pool and define the difference for him in a very small bikini. It\u2019s bad enough that I have no make-up on, but there isn\u2019t anything I can do about that now so I\u2019ve got to let it go. I grab the sunglasses I left at the edge of the pool and compensate by staying as far away from him as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nastya\u2019s aunt,\u201d Margot introduces herself to Drew, \u201cand I assume you two know each other.\u201d She turns and smiles knowingly in my direction. Since the first day of school she\u2019s been pushing me to make friends and have some sort of social life so this must be thrilling her to no end. Drew is putting on the boyish charm in a way that I\u2019m sure has won over many a suspicious mother. He\u2019ll probably need to work a little harder on Margot. She\u2019s younger and cute and used to being flirted with. She isn\u2019t oblivious to what he\u2019s playing. Still, that suspicion is being tempered by her desire for me to get some sort of life. She walks away, leaving me to him, and goes back to her chair and a copy of Cosmopolitan. She\u2019s not fooling me, though. I know she\u2019s straining to hear every word.</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t trapped in the pool by my state of undress, I could fully enjoy the situation a bit more. Drew can\u2019t use his arsenal of sexual innuendos on me now, while he\u2019s being chaperoned. He kicks off his shoes and sits down at the edge of the pool, dangling his feet in the water.</p><p>\u201cI feel I\u2019ve done my penance. You should forgive me now.\u201d</p><p>I just stare at him. I don\u2019t even bother changing my expression. He\u2019s going to have to exert a little effort to get me to waste facial expressions on him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even looked at me in a week. It\u2019s killing my reputation.\u201d</p> <p>I have a feeling a nuclear bomb couldn\u2019t kill his reputation at this point, much less a week without my attention, but I appreciate him giving me the credit.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it up to you. Come to dinner at my house. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>This makes me suspicious and I\u2019m pretty sure it shows. Innocence does not become Drew. It doesn\u2019t gel with the pure unadulterated sex that drips from his pores. I meet his eyes and wait for the catch.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even have to be alone with me. My whole family will be there.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he thinks this is a selling point. It isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t mind parents. I actually used to do quite well with parents. Now, probably not so much, but it\u2019s not the parents that concern me. It\u2019s the sister I\u2019m not going anywhere near. I\u2019m already on her radar. I was even before the unwanted courtyard heroics of a certain Josh Bennett, and I\u2019m not rushing to put myself in the eye of that storm again by showing up to a family dinner on her brother\u2019s arm. No way. Not happening. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to go,\u201d Margot chimes in over her magazine. So much for pretending she\u2019s not eavesdropping. My defiant convictions lasted all of three seconds. \u201cI have to work. There\u2019s no point in you sitting here, eating dinner alone.\u201d Thanks, Margot. I flash her the smile I save for my mortal enemies. She looks at me, face full of innocence, eyes full of mischief. She knows I\u2019m cornered. Damn self-inflicted mutism. Is that even a word? Irrelevant. I shake my head but I can\u2019t offer an excuse and I don\u2019t have one anyway, though I\u2019m sure I could easily come up with something believable: homework, emptying bedpans at the local nursing home, cholera. Alas, they all stay trapped in my throat as I look on helplessly while my evening\u2019s fate is decided by my meddling aunt and a cocksure teenage boy. Margot knows I have nothing to do and Drew isn\u2019t about to give me a chance to get out of it anyway. He\u2019s on his feet in an instant, bolting before the plans can be rescinded.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s at six. I\u2019ll pick you up at 5:45. Dress nice. My mom likes to pretend we\u2019re civilized once a week.\u201d He smiles conspiratorially in Margot\u2019s direction. He knows he has her to thank for this. It\u2019s no mystery that, given a choice, I never would have agreed. I\u2019m angrier at myself. I dug my own grave on this one. You give up talking and you give up free will. I wonder what Margot would think if she knew the truth of Drew Leighton, the sex volcano she just sacrificed me to.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up. I\u2019ll just walk around the house. Nice meeting you.\u201d He turns back to me. \u201cSee you later.\u201d It sounds like a threat.</p> <p>If only Margot hadn\u2019t heard the doorbell, I could be blissfully, comfortably alone this evening, just like I should be. I wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament I\u2019m in now, at five o\u2019clock, staring at my closet and wondering what one wears to Sunday dinner at the home of one\u2019s non-boyfriend. I spent the afternoon alternately putting off the decision and coming up with self-inflicted injuries that might get me out of it.</p><p>Once my fate was decided, I killed most of the day in the kitchen, baking and frosting a three-layer chocolate cake. My mom would have several choice words for me if I were to show up to dinner as a guest empty-handed and desserts are about the only thing in my repertoire. I\u2019ve avoided the inevitable as long as possible, but unless I\u2019m planning to wear the towel I\u2019ve got wrapped around myself, I need to pick something soon. I\u2019m running out of time.</p><p>True to his word, Drew knocks on the door at exactly five forty-five. I\u2019m kind of surprised that he didn\u2019t just beep the horn and expect me to come running. Okay, I\u2019m really not. As much as it pains me to say so, he actually possesses surprisingly good manners. The better to get into girls\u2019 pants, I suppose. I won\u2019t give him too much credit.</p><p>I pick up the cake and hold it in front of my body as if it can actually shield me, preventing Drew from seeing what I\u2019m wearing. It\u2019s a simple sleeveless shift dress with a very subtle scoop neck and a slight A-line skirt that hits just barely above my knee. It\u2019s the most conservative thing in my closet. My mother bought it for me before I left, along with a bunch of other dresses I never wear. I kept it because it was black, but that\u2019s about the only reason. I feel like I\u2019m going on a job interview. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll look even remotely right at a Sunday dinner but I guess it\u2019s better than the stuff I wear to school.</p><p>He opens my car door and I slide in with the cake on my lap.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Drew inclines his head towards the cake. I shrug. I didn\u2019t mind. I like excuses to bake and I don\u2019t get them very often these days, which means that I still bake, but I end up eating most of it myself. Sugar has a very special, oversized place on my food pyramid. \u201cYou\u2019ll get points with my mom, though. She\u2019s pregnant. Again,\u201d he adds pointedly, \u201cand she loves chocolate.\u201d</p><p>We pull into Drew\u2019s driveway about ten minutes later. He lives in a development a few miles down the road from Margot\u2019s. He parks the car and kills the engine but he doesn\u2019t move to get out. He looks uncomfortable, which makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019m really hoping he doesn\u2019t hit on me in the car in front of his parents\u2019 house, because I\u2019ll have to get pissed and the cake will probably not survive. He turns to me and takes a breath. He\u2019s not smiling, and when he speaks, the tone of voice is completely different from what I\u2019m used to with him. The cocky self-assuredness is gone and that makes me nervous. I\u2019m accustomed to his brash over-confidence. I\u2019m prepared for it and it puts us on even footing, like neither of us is real.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry.\u201d The sincerity in his words catches me off-guard. I would have been ready for a full-on assault of charm and creative come-ons but I\u2019m completely unprepared for the utterly guileless apology I\u2019m getting. Maybe this is his new angle. He turns his eyes to the windshield, and I\u2019m glad, because I\u2019m more at ease with him not looking right at me. \u201cYou were ok with Bennett, you know. Josh is the best person I know. I wouldn\u2019t have left you anywhere else. I know it was shitty and I probably should have taken you home and taken care of you myself since it was kind of my fault in the first place. If there are two choices, I\u2019m usually going to pick the wrong one, but I really didn\u2019t do it to be an ass**le. Just comes naturally.\u201d He stops talking and is quiet for a minute before looking back at me again.</p><p>\u201cWe good?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head and study him. Are we? Yes, I think we are. As much as I\u2019d like to question his motives, I also kind of want to believe he\u2019s not a completely awful person. Then at least I\u2019ll have an excuse for why I can\u2019t seem to dislike him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood enough?\u201d he tries.</p><p>I nod. Yes, good enough.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d he repeats, without question this time, and the tell-tale flirt comes back into his voice. His posture loosens and he seems to relax. He\u2019s back in familiar territory. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside before I give in to the fantasy I\u2019m having of covering you in that cake and licking the frosting off.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. I\u2019m kind of glad to have this Drew back. I roll my eyes and shake my head. He shrugs, resigned.</p> <p>\u201cSorry. Nature\u2019s a bitch. Can only fight it for so long.\u201d He comes around to open the car door and offers to take the cake for me but I shake my head. I need to hold it. I cling to the cake like a lifeline as I walk up to the house, hoping my left hand doesn\u2019t choose now to stutter and make me drop it. A three-layer cake with scratch fudge frosting, adorned with piles of shaved curls of dark chocolate, was probably overkill but I\u2019m hoping it does its job and that they\u2019ll notice the cake instead of me.</p><p>We walk into a high-ceilinged foyer that opens up into an exquisitely furnished living room. It\u2019s pristine. I feel like I should take my shoes off so my heels don\u2019t tear into the Berber carpet but that would probably be weird. Plus, as much as the shoes hurt my feet, they give me comfort. I used to perform in front of audiences, now I hide behind cake and high heels. Drew leads me back through a formal dining room. The table must seat at least ten people. It\u2019s already set with china and fabric napkins that are folded to look like swans. Drew must notice me gaping at it.</p><p>\u201cTold you my mom likes to pretend we\u2019re civilized once a week.\u201d Civilized is one thing. This is something different entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s usually not this bad. I think she went a little overboard because I told her I was bringing you. Usually it\u2019s just us and Josh. And he doesn\u2019t count as company.\u201d What the crap? I\u2019m not sure which part of that little explanation I\u2019m supposed to panic about first; either the part where his mother appears to have prepared for the coming of the queen because of me or the part where Josh Bennett is expected. Both are equally appalling but I think I\u2019m giving the edge to Josh. As much as I fear the scrutiny of Drew\u2019s mother, it\u2019s a little worse to imagine eating a meal across the table from the boy who mopped up my vomit and watched me strip my bra off and throw it across the room. I spent most of the afternoon freaking out about what to wear and dreading having to face Drew\u2019s sister. The thought that Josh Bennett might be here never even entered my mind. I don\u2019t have any more time to get used to the idea because the doorbell rings, then opens before anybody could possibly have gotten there. Josh isn\u2019t company here. Of course he doesn\u2019t wait to be let in.</p><p>Before I know what\u2019s happening, Drew\u2019s mother is coming towards me, taking the cake out of my hands. I want to hold onto it, keep it in front of me just a little longer but it\u2019s not an option so I relinquish it to her. My hands feel very empty.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Nastya!\u201d Her smile comes from every part of her face. There isn\u2019t a question where Drew and Sarah came by their looks. Their mother is beautiful. I can\u2019t help glancing down toward her stomach. She must not be very pregnant because I can\u2019t even tell. I wonder how old she is. She has to be at least forty, I imagine. It\u2019s weird to me why anyone would want another baby at that age but I guess if you can, why not? She\u2019s shifting things in the refrigerator now to make room for the cake. I didn\u2019t ask her to but I\u2019m glad. The heat and humidity already started doing a number on the frosting on the way over here.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, it is so sweet of you to bring dessert. It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she says, shutting the refrigerator door and turning towards me. She closes the gap between us a moment later and before I can comprehend what she\u2019s doing, she hugs me. I don\u2019t do hugging. I don\u2019t like people touching me even when there\u2019s no threat involved. It\u2019s too intimate and it bothers me. She doesn\u2019t seem to notice how stiff my arms are at my sides and she lets me go a second later when Drew starts talking.</p><p>\u201cHow come you call her honey and never use terms of endearment on me?\u201d he fake whines.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mrs. Leighton says, patting him on the cheek as she walks by. \u201cJust last week I called you the bane of my existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a good day.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to want to smile watching them. It hasn\u2019t been so long that I don\u2019t remember what it was like when my family was happy, too.</p><p>It\u2019s only seconds before Josh Bennett finds us. Judging by the look on his face, he didn\u2019t know I was going to be here any more than I was expecting him. I think he literally took a step back when he saw me.</p> <p>Drew\u2019s mom steps between us before excessive awkwardness sets in. She hugs him and he actually hugs her back. It looks wrong to me. I\u2019m used to seeing Josh separated by a six-foot radius from all human contact, so to see him here, looking warm and alive and touchable with Drew\u2019s mom, takes me a minute to process. I hope my mouth isn\u2019t hanging open. I\u2019m going to have ten-miles worth of thoughts to sort through when I run tonight. Not only do I have unexpectedly sincere Drew to process, but now I\u2019ve got not-so-untouchable Josh Bennett as well.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s in the kitchen a moment later. She obviously knew I was coming because there\u2019s no surprise on her face. Only disdain.</p><p>\u201cI guess you all already know each other,\u201d Mrs. Leighton says, saving us from friendly pretense. \u201cDinner will be ready in ten minutes. Sarah, you pour drinks. Drew, take Josh and check on your Dad at the grill. Make sure he doesn\u2019t overcook the steaks again. Nastya, you can help me bring in the food from the kitchen.\u201d I nod, thankful that she\u2019s given me something to do so I don\u2019t have to stand around feeling not only out of place, but useless, as well. I follow her to the stove and she hands me a couple of trivets to put out on the table. There\u2019s something at once comforting and unsettling about being asked to help. Like I\u2019m not being treated like an outsider. This morning, my plans consisted of eating FunDip while watching misguided fame whores choke down buffalo testicles on old reruns of Fear Factor. Now I\u2019m standing in black stiletto heels in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting. More thoughts to process for later. I should start writing a list so I won\u2019t forget anything.</p><p>Dinner is actually the most enjoyable thing I\u2019ve done in months. For all the pomp and circumstance of the table, Drew\u2019s parents are completely down to earth. His father is self-deprecating and funny. His mother is sharp as a tack and doesn\u2019t take crap from any of them. Drew turned up the well-bred charm and turned down the suggestiveness as soon as we\u2019d walked into the house. He sits next to me and Josh is on the other side of him so I really can\u2019t even see Josh at all throughout the meal. I make a note to count that particular blessing tonight. Sarah is seated across from me so I can\u2019t avoid seeing her. She says nothing to me and remarkably little to everyone else, but with all the talking going on at the table, it seems to have gone unnoticed. I do catch her looking at me a lot and I can\u2019t figure out if she\u2019s angry or uncomfortable. Maybe she\u2019s afraid it will come out how she\u2019s treated me at school and she doesn\u2019t want her parents to find out that she\u2019s such a stereotypical bitch. They must have some clue. I\u2019ve seen the way she acts with Drew and she can\u2019t hide that all the time. Maybe sibling rivalry is acceptable here but treating other people like crap isn\u2019t.</p><p>Once dinner is finished and we\u2019ve all helped clear the dishes, Mrs. Leighton brings the cake over to the table along with an apple pie. Sarah follows behind her with a stack of plates and forks and a container of vanilla ice cream.</p><p>\u201cThis is delicious, Nastya. Where did you order it from? I need dessert for a dinner party in a couple of weeks and I\u2019d love to bring one of these.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and point to myself.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound shocked so much as intrigued. I nod. \u201cFrom scratch?\u201d I nod again. I only bake from scratch. I don\u2019t have anything against mixes, they just seem like cheating and I don\u2019t feel like I can take credit for them. It\u2019s just a cake. It\u2019s not music, but it\u2019s something.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t bake at all,\u201d she says. I\u2019m sure she could. It\u2019s not that hard; you just need to know the ratios and once you get those down you can play with it. It mostly comes down to math and science, which is funny, because I suck at math and science. \u201cJosh knows someone who can bake. Don\u2019t you?\u201d She looks over at him and I get the feeling the question isn\u2019t entirely innocent. I look down and push the cake around my plate into a pool of melting ice cream.</p><p>\u201cJust someone from school.\u201d He sounds as uncomfortable as I feel. I mentally will everyone to drop it and I think Josh may be doing the exact same thing. I really don\u2019t want him to explain the circumstances surrounding how those cookies ended up on his porch. He obviously didn\u2019t have any trouble figuring out they were from me, which means he knew exactly why they were there.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Drew asks around a mouthful of chocolate cake. Interesting, though not entirely surprising. He didn\u2019t tell Drew. I wonder how his mom knows. Josh is waiting just a little too long to answer and I see Mrs. Leighton\u2019s gaze flick from him to me. She seems satisfied. She got her answer.</p><p>\u201cDrew, talk with your mouth full again and you\u2019ll be serving at my next book club meeting.\u201d She points her fork in his direction and his mouth clamps shut. Obviously this is a threat of monumental proportions. He holds his hands up in surrender to his mother.</p><p>Once we finish cleaning up the dessert dishes, Mrs. Leighton makes coffee and we all sit on the oversized white couches in the living room. I decline the coffee. I don\u2019t drink it, because no matter how much sugar I put into it, it is still tastes like ass-water to me. Maybe it\u2019s just because my taste buds are so desensitized to sweet that anything not comprised of at least ninety percent sugar tastes wrong. Even if I was addicted to caffeine, in a dystopian future where coffee was an illegal controlled substance and I hadn\u2019t gotten my hands on any in three days, I still would have refused it. I never would have overcome my horror if my hand decided to lose its grip while holding a full cup of coffee on one of those white brocade sofas. Sarah doesn\u2019t drink any, either, so I guess it doesn\u2019t seem strange. Josh drinks three cups of it, not that I\u2019m counting.</p><p>I listen to everyone talk until the conversation dwindles and the coffee pot is empty. The phone rings, giving Sarah an escape she must have been desperate for, judging by how fast she jumps off the couch at the sound. Drew walks over to his mother and takes her empty cup. Josh takes Mr. Leighton\u2019s and follows Drew back to the kitchen. I don\u2019t have a coffee cup to use as an excuse to bolt, so I sit in awkward silence, hoping they don\u2019t stay in the kitchen too long. I study the coffee table, not really wanting to make eye contact with either of Drew\u2019s parents. It looks familiar to me. I tilt my head to study the legs and I realize that it\u2019s almost identical in style to the one I had seen in Josh\u2019s living room on the morning we shall not mention. The similarities in the design are clear, but this table is obviously newer. The surface of the wood and the finish are flawless. I don\u2019t even realize that I\u2019m leaning over and running my fingers along the curved wood of the table leg when Drew\u2019s father speaks.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it? Josh made it.\u201d He\u2019s staring, with pride, at the table, and thankfully, not at my face. My hand stops moving but I don\u2019t look away from the table. I pull my arm in and settle back onto the sofa in time to see Josh standing in the doorway from the kitchen, watching us. Mr. Leighton looks up. \u201cWhat was it, Josh? A Christmas gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Leighton\u2019s birthday.\u201d Josh\u2019s hands are shoved in his pockets and he\u2019s looking past us at the table. He doesn\u2019t step any further into the room until Drew comes in behind him, forcing him to move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour big ass truck is blocking me in,\u201d he says, slapping Josh on the back. \u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d He turns, looking halfway contrite about his language. I\u2019ve heard a lot worse than that out of his mouth. I wonder if he thinks his mother is even remotely fooled, because I\u2019m betting she knows his act pretty well.</p><p>\u201cBook club,\u201d she taunts, holding up her hand as if balancing a tray.</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d he responds, shifting his attention back to Josh. \u201cCan you please move your truck so I can take Nastya home?\u201d he begs with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say she lives in Josh\u2019s neighborhood?\u201d Mrs. Leighton asks. I think I actually hear her loading the bullets into that question.</p> <p>Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please no.</p><p>\u201cJosh, can you drop her off? It\u2019s silly for you both to go in the same direction when Josh is going there anyway.\u201d She seems to look at all of us at once. How does she do that? We aren\u2019t even standing next to one other. It\u2019s more than unnerving.</p><p>Between Josh and I, I don\u2019t know which one of us looks the most horrified. We\u2019re both on equal ground with this one. Josh nods in resignation and I try to look like I think this is a good plan. A good, logical, practical, not-at-all-awkward plan.</p><p>Drew and his parents walk us out to the driveway. Sarah never re-emerged after the phone call, which is fine with me. Josh unlocks the car with his remote and Drew opens the door for me while I try to figure out how high I have to hike my skirt up to step into the truck without tearing it. I really don\u2019t want to end the evening by flashing my pink heart polka dot underwear at Drew\u2019s dad. Once I manage to get in, Drew\u2019s mom comes over to the passenger side. Thankfully I\u2019m already up and seated so I don\u2019t have to worry about being hugged again, but what comes next is almost worse.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming. It was so nice to meet you. We\u2019ll see you next Sunday at six?\u201d It\u2019s a question without much question involved. She tilts her head sideways to look past me at Josh. \u201cYou can pick her up on your way, right?\u201d She did it again. She\u2019s good. I try to shake my head. I could write a note for this. This would be note-worthy. I look around frantically for a piece of paper but the truck is as barren as it was the first time I rode in it. Nothing. At this point I\u2019m hoping Josh might save me, save us both. Maybe he has plans and will have to decline and I can nod in unison. No such luck.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. Thanks for dinner, Mrs. Leighton, Mr. Leighton,\u201d he nods at Drew\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cOne day we\u2019ll get you to call us Jack and Lexie,\u201d he laughs, shaking his head as if he knows this will never happen. \u201cMaybe when you\u2019re thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Leighton,\u201d Josh responds.</p><p>Drew waves from the front porch, already on his cell phone, as Josh backs the truck down the long driveway. Ten minutes in a car with Josh Bennett feels much longer than ten minutes in a car with Drew. Drew fills all the silence without ever realizing that he\u2019s doing it. Josh melts into the silence like he\u2019s part of it. He doesn\u2019t say a word on the way home until he pulls into Margot\u2019s driveway for the third time now.</p><p>\u201cYou can get out of it if you want, you know. But you should go. She likes you.\u201d</p><p>I nod and open the door to the truck. I can\u2019t step down and reach the ground, and trying to jump in these shoes, no matter how short the distance, is not going to end with my ankles intact. I bend over and slide my left shoe off, followed by my right, and hop out onto the driveway, turning to shut the door.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need better shoes if you want to get near the tools. Mr. Turner will never let you in the construction area in those things.\u201d He shakes his head as if he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s telling me this. I think it might physically hurt him to talk to me. I don\u2019t know what the right response to that is. I don\u2019t think Mr. Turner is planning to let me near the tools no matter what shoes I\u2019m wearing. I nod again and close the door.</p><p>It\u2019s almost ten at this point. Normally I would be throwing on sneakers and running clothes right about now. I\u2019m torn in half between needing to run and knowing it can\u2019t serve its whole purpose tonight. For the first time in two weeks, I\u2019m not really sure I want to run. I think better when I\u2019m moving and I have plenty to think about tonight, but that\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t have a treadmill to run on here so I have to go out, but when I\u2019m running outside, I have to fragment my mind. I have to keep part of it constantly, acutely aware of every sound, every echo, every movement going on around me. It makes it hard to figure out the things I need to figure out. It\u2019s the same way I have to split my focus every time I\u2019m around other people so I don\u2019t accidentally respond to something or someone. It\u2019s natural to want to talk and I have to remain constantly on alert so that I don\u2019t slip. I thought it would get easier. It should have been harder when I first stopped. But it\u2019s the opposite. When I first stopped I had absolutely nothing I wanted to say. I wasn\u2019t tempted at all. Now, more and more, I find things I\u2019m desperate to say. They constantly bombard my mind and I have to choke them back. It\u2019s exhausting.</p><p>I decide against braving the assault on my senses and I stay in. This whole night has been draining enough.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cParty at Kara\u2019s Friday night. You in?\u201d</p><p>I look at Drew as if this is a rhetorical question. It should be.</p><p>\u201cAt some point I\u2019ll get you to come with me.\u201d No you won\u2019t. \u201cFine. I have a backup plan. And there she is.\u201d I look up to see Nastya coming down the hall towards us. She\u2019s still wearing those shoes. We\u2019ll be starting to work soon and it\u2019s true what I told her. Mr. Turner won\u2019t let her near the workshop unless she\u2019s got on decent shoes that will protect her feet. She obviously doesn\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I have been the backup plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t be any plan, but I\u2019ll break you eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get her wasted again, she can throw up on your couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you never going to get over that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s true. I think the things I saw that night will haunt me forever.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nastypants!\u201d Drew picks up his pace and breaks away from me to reach Nastya just before she gets to the shop door. I half-expect the look she impales him with to kill him on contact. \u201cWhat?\u201d I hear him cajole her as I get closer. \u201cIt\u2019s a term of endearment.\u201d If this is his new tactic, I\u2019m afraid for him. Before I can worry myself too much for his safety, her face subtly changes. I think she\u2019s fighting it, but she loses, because she actually half smiles at him. Maybe it\u2019s not even a smile. Her lips just barely turn up at the corners but on her face it stands out because of the rarity of it. I\u2019d be disappointed that his crap is actually working on her but I don\u2019t think it is. I think she\u2019s amused. The smile is gone in seconds, and she walks into the room, leaving Drew in the hall just as I catch up. He didn\u2019t even ask her about the party.</p><p>\u201cThat worked out well for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d he smiles, seemingly satisfied with the outcome.</p><p>\u201cShe should.\u201d Tierney Lowell is closing her locker across the hall and turning towards us. Really she\u2019s turning towards Drew. I don\u2019t know that she sees me at all. Her jeans are so tight that I wonder if they\u2019re cutting off her circulation and she\u2019s wearing a black bra under a white t-shirt that rides up above the waist to show just enough of her skin to tease. She\u2019s got the body to pull it off and she isn\u2019t shy about it. The two of them hooked up some time last year and the aftermath wasn\u2019t particularly pretty. Tierney didn\u2019t take too well to being discarded. That didn\u2019t surprise me. What surprised me was the fact that it had happened in the first place. She\u2019s hard-core and he\u2019s Drew. It never added up to me. Drew never even told me that it had happened until after it got out, and by that time it was done. Drew was moving on to another girl; Tierney was pissed and people were talking about how clueless she was for being surprised. I don\u2019t think she ever seemed surprised, just disappointed.</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t respond to her and she walks away without another word.</p><p>\u201cThat one was a mistake from the beginning,\u201d he says. Most of them are mistakes if you ask me. The constant drama doesn\u2019t seem worth the trouble. I head in to shop and Drew takes off toward the office where he gets to spend the next period running passes around the school, flirting in the halls and generally avoiding any responsibility whatsoever.</p><p>Nastya is sitting next to Kevin Leonard at the table Mr. Turner moved her to a week ago. I\u2019m glad she stayed there because it made me nervous having her behind me all the time. I like being able to watch everyone else without them watching me. Most people know better than to look at me anyway, but Nastya hasn\u2019t been most people since the day she got here.</p><p>When the bell rings, Mr. Turner does a visual roll check. Then he tells one person from each table to go up to the front and pick up a materials box. I\u2019m the only one at my table so I head up. All of the other tables have two people, except for Nastya\u2019s where there are three: Natsya, Kevin and Chris Jenkins. She doesn\u2019t move to get up and Chris goes to get the box. Inside are several pieces of wood, a hammer, different size nails, sandpaper and a few other items which seem to vary in each box. Kevin grabs the box out of Chris\u2019 hands and turns it over on the table. The box of nails opens when it hits the surface and they go rolling in every direction. This gets everyone\u2019s attention but no one moves to pick them up.</p><p>\u201cClean it up, Leonard,\u201d Mr. Turner calls over to him, not seeming the least bit surprised with his idiocy. I know why Mr. Turner signed him in to this class. As much as I\u2019d like to ignore the fact, Kevin\u2019s pretty good when it comes to building. He doesn\u2019t have much of a sense of artistry or style but he has an innate understanding of construction and balance. Too bad he\u2019s such an ass**le.</p><p>Nastya is kneeling down on the floor, picking up nails and loading them up in her left hand. Chris is gathering up the ones on the table and sweeping them back into the container. Kevin is laughing. Nastya has most of the nails off the floor and her hand is close to full. I think she\u2019s about to stand back up and then the nails are all over the floor again. I\u2019m not even sure what happened. It\u2019s like she just let go of them. She doesn\u2019t even seem surprised. She just starts picking them up again. I think I\u2019m the only one who noticed. Nobody helps her. Not even me.</p><p>Mr. Turner goes on to explain the assignment. We\u2019ll have today, plus the next three periods, to design, plan, and construct something that\u2019s either useful or aesthetically pleasing with whatever materials we find in the box we picked up. We are allowed to add up to two additional items of our choosing but nothing else. I\u2019ve already studied what\u2019s in mine and I know what I\u2019m going to build. I spend the rest of the period measuring, sketching and planning while everyone else sits around arguing about whose idea is better and what they should make. Tomorrow I\u2019ll start construction. The rest of them will probably still be fighting.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent the past hour going through every drawer of every tool cabinet in my garage and I still can\u2019t figure out where I put my stud finder. I slam the bottom drawer on the last cabinet shut and look at the clock on the wall. Ten-thirty. Too late to go buy another one, not that I really need it tonight, but I have nothing else on my plate right now and it\u2019s something to do.</p><p>I stand back up and turn around, looking for something to occupy my time and she\u2019s standing at the top of my driveway, just outside the threshold of my garage. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t gasp or anything equally pathetic, because if I did, I\u2019d probably have to cut off my balls and hand them to her. I wouldn\u2019t deserve them anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks almost exactly the same as the first time she showed up here, except she\u2019s not lost or scared. She came here on purpose. We look at each other for a minute and I realize that I\u2019m waiting for her to say something, which obviously isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to say to her, so in a bold and unprecedented move, I do nothing. I turn around and continue looking for the stud finder I know isn\u2019t here. I pretend not to care what she\u2019s doing but I\u2019m hyperaware of every breath she takes. I can tell the second she decides to stop standing there. Only she doesn\u2019t turn and leave like I expect her to; she steps into the garage.</p><p>I can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m not noticing her now. I watch to see what she\u2019s going to do. She\u2019s looking around again, like she did the night she showed up all sweaty and lost and amazing. She\u2019s not looking at me at the moment; she\u2019s much more interested in the surroundings. It\u2019s just a garage with a lot of wood and tools. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s so mesmerizing about it but I\u2019m not arguing, because while she\u2019s preoccupied with studying the room, I can study her. The make-up is gone again tonight and her hair is up so I can see her face. Even when she went to dinner at Drew\u2019s house, she still had all of the make-up on: black eyeliner, dark red lips, the works. It\u2019s horrible and it makes no sense when you see what\u2019s underneath it.</p><p>She\u2019s not as drenched or out of breath as before but she still must have been running. I wonder if she runs every night. Her legs are all muscle, just like her arms. It still doesn\u2019t look right with her face. Her face reminds me of the porcelain dolls that are still lining the shelves in my sister\u2019s room. Childlike. Smooth and hard and flawless and fragile.</p><p>She walks around, running her hands along the counters, stopping at the vise attached to the end of one of the workbenches. She turns it a few times, watching it close, before sliding her hand in between the plates and continuing tighten it. I can\u2019t even move because I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s going on, but the more it turns, the tighter the hold gets on her hand and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can ignore it before I have to jump up and ask her if she\u2019s batshit crazy. I get the feeling I\u2019m actually standing in my garage, watching this girl decide whether or not to crush her hand. She stops just shy of that point and loosens the vise just enough to where it releases her hand and then she continues her surveying of the room.</p> <p>My eyes shift away before she sees me looking and I start rifling through the same drawers I\u2019ve already searched twice tonight before I start working my way around the counters. The workbench my father and I built together years ago lines the perimeter of the garage. According to Mark Bennett, you could never have enough work surfaces. The more the better. So we built in as much as the garage could handle. I think maybe it was just something to do.</p><p>I hear her move while my back is to her, and when I turn around, she\u2019s sitting on the workbench on the other side of the garage. She\u2019s just planted herself there and made herself comfortable. Okay. It\u2019s kind of freaking me out to have her sitting in my garage, watching me. Because that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing now. She\u2019s watching me and she\u2019s not even bothering to try and conceal the fact that she\u2019s doing it. I kind of want to scream at her to get the hell out, but I also kind of want her to stay. Which makes me the dumbass I am.</p><p>I eventually sit down and work on checking cut lines on some beams I need for a job I have and then planing them. It\u2019s quiet work so I can do it at night, plus I have to stay busy or I\u2019m going to end up in a staring contest with this girl in a lame attempt to read her mind or something. At midnight she jumps off of the counter and heads back down the driveway without a word or any sort of acknowledgement, just the way she came.</p><p>I don\u2019t pay much attention in my first three classes and no one notices. At lunch I watch for her, wondering if she\u2019ll look at me. I never do see her cross the courtyard, but when I get up to head in to the shop wing just before the bell, she\u2019s leaning against the wall with Clay Whitaker. I walk in the other direction.</p><p>I pick up the material box from Monday\u2019s class, bring it to my table and pull out my plans. She walks in and heads to the back counter behind my table to retrieve the box she\u2019s working out of with Kevin and Chris, neither of whom has shown up yet.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Sunshine.\u201d I don\u2019t even bother to think before the words leave my mouth, but at least I don\u2019t say it loud enough for anyone but her to hear. I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, shouldn\u2019t have reacted to last night at all, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I feel like she was messing with me last night and I want to mess with her back. I don\u2019t like her thinking she can just show up at my house to play a game of mystery mindfuck whenever she pleases.</p><p>She\u2019s behind me but I can almost feel her stiffen at the words. Good. Maybe if she doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of the night she coughed up her intestines in my bathroom, she\u2019ll think twice about coming back to my house again like she belongs there. I wonder what it will take for her to pick up on the fact that she lives in the same world as everybody else, and in that world, people leave me the f**k alone.</p><p>She recovers quickly enough and goes back to her table without looking back at me. Kevin and Chris show up a minute later and the bell rings. Mr. Turner sets us all to work and the room gets loud almost immediately. It\u2019s amazing the amount of noise fourteen students can produce when coupled with the sound of sawing and hammering.</p><p>Halfway through the class, Nastya hasn\u2019t moved from her seat, but she can\u2019t feign disinterest. She\u2019s been watching everything Chris and Kevin are doing. At one point, she reaches out and slides the scale drawing Chris had done over in front of her, studying it for a few minutes before pushing it back towards them. They don\u2019t say anything to her, but I do notice Kevin look down her shirt when she leans over and I want to punch him in the face.</p><p>Kevin gets out of his seat a few minutes later and goes over to Mr. Turner\u2019s desk. Mr. Turner scribbles something on a pass and hands it to him and Kevin walks out of the room, leaving Chris with Nastya. It\u2019s obvious Chris needs another set of hands, and he keeps glancing up at her as if he\u2019s not sure he can ask her to help. Finally, frustration gets the better of him and I hear him ask her to hold the pieces he\u2019s working on in place so he can nail them together. He shows her where to put her hands and she nods, placing them on either side, the way he demonstrates to her. Once he gets them in position, they move on to the next set. It looks like he has four identical pieces he\u2019s putting together the same way. I scan over what they\u2019ve done so far. I can\u2019t see what\u2019s on the drawing and I\u2019m trying to figure out what they\u2019re making. It looks cool.</p><p>At that moment, Kevin walks back in, crumpling up the hall pass and tossing it into the trash can in the corner.</p> <p>\u201cBetter not have been slacking while I was gone,\u201d he says, not even bothering to look at Chris before he slaps him on the back. I wish I could say that what happens next takes place in slow motion, like when something catastrophic happens in a movie, where it all slows down so you can see exactly what happened and how. Nothing slows down, but I see it anyway. Kevin\u2019s hand hits Chris\u2019 back; Chris was already mid-movement with the hammer and the momentum he\u2019s already got going, coupled with the slap on his back, sends the hammer down even harder, just not where it\u2019s supposed to go. The hammer hits the ring finger on Nastya\u2019s left hand which had been splayed flat against the table with her thumb bracketing the wood in place.</p><p>I\u2019m focused on her face. I catch her eyes widen almost imperceptibly with the initial shock of pain before they narrow again. Water slips into her eyes and they turn glassy with tears that don\u2019t escape. How the hell is she not crying? I saw how hard that hammer hit her. I heard how hard that hammer hit her. I think even I might have cried. I would have felt stupid after, but it probably would have happened anyway. It had to hurt that much. She doesn\u2019t even move. Neither do Chris or Kevin. They\u2019re just staring at her, her hand still on the table. Get the girl some f**king ice. Chris looks horrified. Kevin looks like he has no idea what just happened. She moves now to look down at her hand but she keeps it in place, staring at it. I\u2019m really hoping someone gets up and gets her some ice soon or I\u2019m going to have to go do it. I should have done it already, but for some reason, I\u2019m frozen here, too. I can\u2019t stop watching her. Why won\u2019t she cry? Chris finally seems to break out of his trance and runs to the freezer that\u2019s kept in the shop area solely for the purpose of having ice on hand. Mr. Turner is already over at the table checking her fingers. I watch her just barely flinch as he checks for movement, but otherwise her face is like stone. Or maybe porcelain.</p><p>Chris comes back with an ice pack and offers it to her. She looks surprised and almost like she\u2019s about to refuse it. It reminds me of the vise again and I wonder if she\u2019s insane. Then I watch her mind change and she accepts it without any acknowledgment of thanks. I\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t thank him. He looks guilty as hell. Looking at his face, you\u2019d think he\u2019s in more pain than she is, but he still hasn\u2019t apologized. Kevin is the one who should be begging for forgiveness but I won\u2019t hold my breath for that one. Mr. Turner comes back from his desk with a clinic pass and sends Valerie Estes, the only other girl here, with Nastya, to hold her books.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been more than a matter of seconds that passed between the hammer coming down on her fingers and when Chris brought her the ice, but it felt longer. Maybe time does slow down. It\u2019s not until she\u2019s left the room and everything has calmed back down that I replay the whole scene in my head. It\u2019s then that I realize that even when the hammer came down, even when the full force of the blow landed on her fingers and the pain had to be excruciating, she never made a sound.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be shitting me.</p><p>That\u2019s my initial thought as I watch her walk back into my garage for the second night in a row. My eyes go to her hand immediately and I see that two of her fingers are splinted together. She doesn\u2019t hesitate tonight. I initially think she\u2019s going to perch herself back up on the counter where she sat last night. For a minute it looks like she thinks so, too. Then she sinks down, cross-legged, onto the floor and leans her back against the cabinets behind her. She doesn\u2019t seem to mind the layer of sawdust carpeting the ground, but I still wonder why she\u2019d choose to sit there. It\u2019s not like the counter is particularly clean but it\u2019s not as bad as the floor out here. Then I realize that she probably couldn\u2019t push herself up onto the counter with one hand.</p><p>I go back to what I was doing before and we remain like this, in silence, for at least half an hour. Me working, her watching.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d I finally ask, because I want to know, even though she won\u2019t respond. She turns her hand over in front of her as if she\u2019s trying to decide if it hurt or not. She shrugs. Good answer. What did I expect? I wait a few more minutes, trying to concentrate on recalibrating my table saw and then I ask the real question.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d It comes out nastier than I mean it to but it\u2019s probably for the best. Nothing. It\u2019s driving me insane, wondering what it is that possesses her to keep coming here. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m particularly friendly. Maybe tonight she\u2019ll get the hint and she won\u2019t come back. I try to convince myself that I\u2019m relieved by that possibility, but I\u2019m not convinced. I shove the thought aside and try to focus on the saw.</p><p>The silence persists. I don\u2019t know how long she plans to stay, hovering, watching. It\u2019s like having a ghost in my garage. I feel like I\u2019m being haunted. With all of the dead people I\u2019ve got in my corner, you\u2019d think one of them would be the one hanging around. In fact, I used to hope for that. Being haunted seemed like a gift. I prayed for it. My mother, my sister, my father, my grandmother. After every one of them died I would hope that they\u2019d come back, even once, and let me see them again. Give me a sign. Let me know that there was something else and it was good and they were good, but none of them ever came back for me. My grandfather assured me before he left, that there was an afterlife, one he\u2019d seen, if only briefly, a long time ago. I listened but I didn\u2019t believe him. It was a story born of disease and painkillers not memories and truth. He\u2019ll be dead any day now and I won\u2019t be waiting for a sign. I\u2019ll just be relieved that I have no one left to lose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At ten-thirty the ghost girl gets up and brushes the sawdust off of her pants with her good hand and then she\u2019s gone again.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Josh shows up at five forty-five on Sunday, right on schedule. I run to the refrigerator as he pulls into the driveway. I made tiramisu for dessert since everybody seems to like coffee, except for Sarah, and I couldn\u2019t care less about her. My fingers are still splinted so I\u2019ve got to get the dish out with one hand and it\u2019s proving difficult. Margot put it in the fridge for me this morning but she left for work early so I\u2019m on my own. It\u2019s awkward, but I manage to stretch my hand over the edge and get a good enough grip on it. The doorbell rings just as I get there, but now I have the dish in one hand and I can\u2019t grab the doorknob with my left so I\u2019m just standing there for a minute, holding tiramisu and looking at the door. Finally I have to put the dish on the floor so I can use my right hand to turn the knob.</p> <p>Josh is standing on the porch, hands in his pockets, looking as if he\u2019s picking me up for a date. His hair, as usual, hangs over his forehead, just a little longer than it needs to be. Like a kid who doesn\u2019t have a mother nagging him to get it cut. I hate to admit how well he cleans up, dressed in a burgundy polo shirt and khaki dress pants, not that I mind the worn out jeans he\u2019s usually in. I\u2019m still surprised to see that he\u2019s not wearing work boots. I was beginning to think they were physically attached to him.</p><p>We\u2019re going to have to hurry to beat the rain. I can see the storm forming in the sky behind him. I\u2019ve been inside all day so I hadn\u2019t noticed. Usually I like to sit at the kitchen table and watch the clouds roll in and the sky turn because it happens so quickly here that you can see it change in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Today I was too busy making tiramisu, kicking myself for not going to the mall to buy a new dress, and ultimately trying to think of a brilliant plan to get out of this dinner. Dysentery was topping my excuse list today. It would have been far easier if Drew\u2019s parents had looked down their noses at me and the whole affair last week had been uncomfortable and forced, but they didn\u2019t and it wasn\u2019t. I won\u2019t ever fit in there the way they\u2019re pretending I do. I\u2019m not even sure why she invited me back. The only thing I contributed to the evening was cake. Though, according to Drew, one could never underestimate the power of cake to his mother. I imagine they\u2019re accepting me for Drew\u2019s sake. And if that\u2019s the case, they probably don\u2019t expect me to be around for long. I wonder how many girls have passed through the Leighton Sunday Dinner, one time, never to be seen again.</p><p>I ended up not bothering with the pretense of a nice conservative innocent dress. I figured the sooner we got to the truth of it, the sooner we could cut our losses and walk. I\u2019m wearing a low cut black halter top and a black miniskirt\u200c\u2014\u200cemphasis on the mini\u200c\u2014\u200cpaired with knee-high, spike-heeled leather boots. If I looked out of place last Sunday, it will be nothing compared to this. After tonight, things can go back to normal. Drew can find himself a nice girl who will have uncommitted sex with him and I can go back to a comfortable, expectation-free existence.</p><p>Josh studies me for a minute, taking in my appearance as if he\u2019s looking for an answer to an unspoken question. His greeting consists of one word, \u201cSunshine.\u201d Mine consists of no words.</p> <p>I kneel down to retrieve the tiramisu from the foyer floor but I can\u2019t get my fingers under it for leverage. I find myself silently cursing hammers and clueless boys. I\u2019m about to try to use the palm of my left hand to push it into my right when Josh steps inside and kneels down, far too close to me, and picks it up without another word. He doesn\u2019t smell like sawdust and there\u2019s nothing right about that. No matter how good he looks right now, Josh Bennett without work boots and the smell of sawdust is all sorts of wrong.</p><p>We pull into the driveway at the Leighton house and have just enough time to jump out and run as the sky opens up. I wrap my arm around the dish and reinforce it against my chest. Somehow both the tiramisu and my ankles survive the jump intact. When I hit the ground, Josh is next to me and he takes the dish out of my hands and runs to the shelter of the porch overhang. We manage to make it without getting completely drenched. Before he opens the door, he hands me back the tiramisu and then reaches up and frames my face with his hands, running his thumbs across the skin below both of my eyes. I think my mouth might be hanging open because I have no idea what the hell he\u2019s doing.</p><p>\u201cBlack shit,\u201d he says, by way of explanation, and I realize that my eye make-up must be running. Then he opens the door for me without another word.</p><p>When we get inside, everything happens almost precisely as it did the week before. The table isn\u2019t set quite as fancy which I\u2019m glad for because it means I\u2019m not such a novelty this week. But then I have to face that, if I\u2019m not a novelty, it means I have a place here and I don\u2019t want that at all.</p><p>We walk into the kitchen, past the dining room where I notice there\u2019s an extra place setting at the table and I wonder who else is coming. Drew is fighting with the stereo because apparently it\u2019s his turn to pick the dinner music tonight and I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s going to be.</p><p>Mrs. Leighton proceeds to rearrange the refrigerator to make room for the dish while telling me that I didn\u2019t have to go to the trouble. I have a monstrous case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and I know that in a minute I\u2019m getting hugged whether I like it or not.</p> <p>Sitting on two bar stools at the granite breakfast bar off of the kitchen are Sarah and a girl I recognize from school. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s the one who accused me of being sired by Dracula. They\u2019re laughing and attempting to knot their hair together. It\u2019s the height of immature teenage girlishness. I want to mock them for it but I\u2019m appalled by the fact that it makes me sad.</p><p>For a moment I feel like a survivor in some post-apocalyptic world, looking through a window, imagining a part of my life that\u2019s gone now. I wonder what it would be like to have even one girlfriend. I used to have a couple, but they weren\u2019t like this either. They were single-mindedly music-obsessed like I was. It was our link. Other girls compared nail polish colors and crushes; we compared audition pieces. Our friendships with each other never came first because music was always more important. Take the music out of the equation and I don\u2019t know if I had anything in common with them at all. Even if I did, I still would have cut them off afterward. It hurt too much to be around them.</p><p>My friend Lily called me for months, but the only things she ever had to talk about were auditions and recitals and practice. I tried to be happy for her, but I wasn\u2019t. I was jealous and pissed. It was like watching my best friend blissfully dating my ex-boyfriend who I was still madly in love with; watching her have everything I loved but couldn\u2019t have anymore. In other words, painful, depressing and unhealthy. And I\u2019m nothing if not healthy.</p><p>Even if I was talking, because let\u2019s face it, the silent thing is definitely a barrier in terms of making friends, I probably still wouldn\u2019t have any. I lost almost the entirety of my sixteenth year. While other girls my age were thinking about homecoming dances, driving lessons and losing their virginity, I was thinking about physical therapy, police line-ups and psychiatric counseling. I left the house to go to doctor\u2019s offices, not football games. I interviewed with police detectives, not the manager at Old Navy.</p><p>Eventually, my body healed as much as it was going to. My mind started getting put back together, too. I think it\u2019s just that the pieces got put back a little out of order. It seems like the more my body healed, the more fractured my mind became, and there aren\u2019t enough wires and screws to fix the breaks in it.</p><p>So I didn\u2019t do the normal stuff I was supposed to be doing at fifteen and sixteen. At the age when most kids are trying to figure out who they are I was busying trying to figure out why I was. I didn\u2019t belong in this world anymore. It\u2019s not that I wanted to be dead, I just felt like I should be. Which is why it\u2019s hard when everyone expects you to be grateful simply because you\u2019re not.</p><p>It left me lots of time to think, lots of time to get angry and feel sorry for myself. To ask Why me? To ask Why? period. I have a black-belt in self-pity. I was an expert in the field. Still am. It\u2019s a skill you never forget. Needless to say, all the thinking and all the questions didn\u2019t accomplish much. That\u2019s when I started focusing on the anger. I stopped worrying about being polite, about hurting people\u2019s feelings and saying what I was supposed to say, healing the way I was supposed to heal so that everyone could believe I was okay again and move on with their lives. My parents needed to believe I was okay, so for a long time I tried to convince them that I was. I tried to convince myself, too, but I was a much tougher sell because I knew the truth. I was so very not okay. I realized that I was going to feel shitty either way. I was probably going to feel shitty for the rest of my life, a life I should not even still be living. A life that should have let me go. So I got angry. Then I got very angry. Then I got angrier still. But you can only go so long being angry before you learn to hate. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and started hating instead. Whining was pathetic, but hate got things done. Hate strengthened my body and shaped my resolve and what I resolved to do was to get revenge. Hate seemed pretty damn healthy to me.</p><p>Nonetheless, I\u2019ve learned that although hatred is good for some things, it won\u2019t make you a lot of friends. I turn away from Sarah and the girl who has since been introduced as Piper. Piper. I roll it around in my head. It\u2019s a pointless name, a meaningless name (unless you count pipe player as a meaning and that thought makes me laugh, because well, you know, pipe player), a name for someone like her. As I walk toward the dining room, I\u2019m not at all confused about why I have no friends.</p> <p>Despite the presence of Sarah and Piper, dinner is fun again. We, okay, they talk about college applications, building the homecoming float, drama auditions and how drastically the tax laws are changing. That last one is courtesy of Mr. Leighton who is a CPA. I kind of tune out at that point because the intricacies of tax law are a little outside of my sphere of comprehension, but then the conversation starts turning toward debate.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a tournament two Saturdays from now,\u201d Drew tells his parents.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you arguing?\u201d his Dad asks, refilling his wine glass. Mrs. Leighton stares at it like she\u2019d like to rip it out of his hand but I guess she\u2019s not allowed. Pregnancy puts a crimp in the whole wine-drinking thing. I can\u2019t blame her, though. I\u2019d kind of like to rip it out of his hand, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly. Something centering on the importance of the conservation of fabric.\u201d He looks in my direction, focusing on my clothes, or lack thereof, while he bullshits them. \u201cMr. Trent assigned Nastya to help me with the research so I wanted to pick something she was passionate about.\u201d</p><p>At that point Sarah chokes on whatever she has in her mouth. Mr. Leighton continues swirling his wine around in his glass as if he\u2019s actually giving credence to what Drew said and considering the relevant arguments on the topic. Piper doesn\u2019t even seem to have gotten the joke. I watch Josh\u2019s jaw twitch out of the corner of my eye, the only sign at all that he\u2019s sitting at the same table with the rest of us, listening to this conversation. I\u2019m still watching him struggle to remain stoic and unaffected when I hear the sound of Mrs. Leighton\u2019s shoe connecting with Drew\u2019s shin.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Josh</p><p>My father started teaching me how to build after my mother and sister died when I was eight. I don\u2019t know if he necessarily wanted to, or if he had no choice because I just kept following him. He holed up in the garage all the time and if I wanted to see him I had to come out here. He never really talked, but I took what I could get. In the beginning, I mostly watched him. I picked up on a lot just by paying attention, but once I got the tools in my hands, I realized how little I knew. The first thing I built was a lopsided birdfeeder. I ended up making four of them before I got it right. I\u2019ve been at this for almost ten years and some days I still feel like I don\u2019t know shit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wonder how much Nastya picks up on. She watches everything that goes on in shop, though she hasn\u2019t touched so much as a nail since the hammer incident. She\u2019s been watching me here at night for the past two weeks. I haven\u2019t been successful in getting her to leave so I\u2019ve given up. Last night I tried being outright rude. I figured if telling her to get the f**k out didn\u2019t do the trick, nothing would, so that\u2019s what I told her. She didn\u2019t get the f**k out, at least not until she felt like it an hour later.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting in her normal spot on the counter again, watching me right now, so I guess that\u2019s my answer. Her legs are ceaselessly swinging back and forth, taunting me as if to say, Ha, ha, we\u2019re here and you can\u2019t make us leave\u200c\u2014\u200cso suck it. I think they\u2019re using a mocking, sing-song, playground voice when they do it. I want to tell them to shut up. I\u2019m pulling the battery off of my drill and putting it on the charger and trying to figure\u200c\u2014\u200c</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have so many saws?\u201d</p><p>You would think I would spin around at this moment in some sort of shocked frenzy, but it\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve been expecting her to talk to me since the day we met and I\u2019ve just been wondering what she was going to say. I can tell you that I\u2019ve run through more than a couple scenarios in my mind and in not one of them did she ask me about the number of saws I own. I do turn around because I need to see her right now but it\u2019s a lot slower and more controlled than even I planned.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all designed for a different purpose, for different jobs, for different kinds of wood. It\u2019s complicated. It would take me hours to go through them all.\u201d OK, it\u2019s not really complicated. It would just take a very lengthy, tedious, boring explanation and right now I don\u2019t want to think about saws. I can\u2019t believe this is what we\u2019re talking about. The word surreal does not suffice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want anything, but I\u2019ll leave if you want me to.\u201d It takes me a minute to switch gears and realize that she\u2019s answering the question that I asked her over a week ago. Is she calling my bluff? I look around the floor for the gauntlet she\u2019s thrown down because she\u2019s obviously waiting to see if I\u2019ll pick it up. I have to decide if I really do want her gone, because if I tell her to leave this time, I have no doubt that she\u2019ll take my word for it.</p><p>I should say yes. Hell, yes. I\u2019ve been trying to get rid of you since you showed up, but that\u2019s a lie and we both know it. I\u2019m not ready to give her an answer yet, so I answer her with another question. She\u2019s talking; I want to keep it that way. Part of me knows that there\u2019s a very real possibility that when she walks out of here tonight, she may not come back no matter what I tell her and I may never hear her speak again. It hits me, once more, just how much she reminds me of a ghost and how at any moment she might just fade away.</p><p>\u201cWho else knows you talk?\u201d I ask, and not just to keep her talking, but because I really do want to know. Does Drew know and he hasn\u2019t told me? Does she talk to her family? Drew said she lived with an aunt\u200c\u2014\u200cactually he said a hot aunt\u200c\u2014\u200cbut that\u2019s all I really know.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever talk? Before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019ve taken this vow of silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, looking right into my eyes. Neither of us will break eye-contact. \u201cAnd you\u2019re never going to ask. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019m never going to ask. Check,\u201d I say matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd why have I agreed to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd why should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I haven\u2019t agreed to keep your secret and you can\u2019t give me any reason why I should. You\u2019re not really making a strong case for yourself. What makes you think I won\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to.\u201d And this is where she wins even if she doesn\u2019t know it yet. She\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want to tell anyone. I want her secret all to myself but she has no way of knowing that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big gamble on your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d She cocks her head to the side and studies me.</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I trust you anyway,\u201d she says, walking out toward the driveway.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to trust you?\u201d I say to her back. This girl really is crazy if she thinks she\u2019s walking in here, out of nowhere, and expecting me to do that.</p><p>She stops, turning to level her eyes at me before she goes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust me. I don\u2019t have any of your secrets.\u201d</p><p>She leaves before I can respond. She never even sat down, but in the few minutes that she was here, everything shifted. Maybe she\u2019s giving me time to decide if I want this, whatever this is. Her secret? Her friendship? Her story? Maybe I don\u2019t want it. I do know that I shouldn\u2019t want it and that may make my decision right there.</p><p>I know something about her that no one else does. I haven\u2019t had a secret in years. Everybody knows my story. Mother and sister killed in a car accident. Tragic. Father has a heart attack. Dies. Grandmother fights ovarian cancer. Loses. A year later grandfather picks up the cancer baton. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to die now, too, or if I\u2019m just supposed to be the last one left.</p><p>I can\u2019t help thinking that there must be something better to be known for.</p><p>I won\u2019t tell anyone about her. I know that much. I still have a hundred questions formulating in my mind but only one that keeps coming back again and again. Why me? It\u2019s the obvious question, the question that still plagues me even hours after she\u2019s left. It\u2019s the one question I don\u2019t ask, because no matter what the answer is, I don\u2019t want it. I just don\u2019t care.</p><p>It\u2019s been days since she spoke to me. I expected her to show up the next night but she didn\u2019t. Or the night after. Or the night after that. I\u2019ve seen her at school every day but she hasn\u2019t so much as looked in my direction once. I\u2019m beginning to think I imagined the entire encounter. Maybe I\u2019m the batshit one in this scenario. I\u2019ve spent the last several days trying to make myself believe that I was glad she had stopped coming and that I couldn\u2019t care less. After all, it was what I wanted. I made several arguments to myself. I wasn\u2019t very convincing.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even had the excuse of seeing her at Drew\u2019s on Sunday. Leigh was here for the weekend and I was with her. It should have made things easier but I think it might have made them worse.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have an accent.\u201d</p><p>When she finally shows up, exactly one week after she spoke to me, this is the first thing I say.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would. The name.\u201d I can\u2019t stand the name. It doesn\u2019t fit. But then maybe nothing about her does. She considers this and for a minute I think she might say something, but she doesn\u2019t. She just keeps walking around my garage and touching tools and running her hands across half-built pieces of furniture and it\u2019s starting to piss me off.</p><p>\u201cAre you Russian?\u201d I ask, hoping to distract her.</p><p>\u201cYou got to ask the questions last time. Tonight\u2019s my turn.\u201d She didn\u2019t answer the question but at least it seems to have temporarily shifted her focus away from all my stuff.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember agreeing to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you the choice.\u201d And she\u2019s back to wandering around my garage again. Studying. I feel like grabbing my crotch and checking to see if my balls are still there because I think they may be in her pocket and I need to get them back. This was fun or different or intriguing for a little while but not anymore. It\u2019s one thing to have her sitting and watching, but if she wants to start with the interrogation and the inevitable teenage girl psychoanalysis, I\u2019m out.</p><p>\u201cYou know who likes to talk? Drew. Why don\u2019t you head over there and make his day?\u201d I need to walk away. I pretend I have to get something out of the tool chest across the room. She\u2019s settles back on the workbench and the legs start swinging immediately.</p><p>\u201cI think there are other things he\u2019d rather I did with my mouth.\u201d There\u2019s nothing coy or suggestive in her tone. She says it like she\u2019s talking about helping him study for trig.</p><p>\u201cDid you really just say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve so,\u201d she says blandly.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you do that you might make his week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make his year if I wanted to.\u201d Confident girl. Makes me wonder if she can back that up and I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about that at all. The legs are still swinging and it\u2019s driving me crazy.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d Not what I planned to ask. I wonder how much it would hurt to cut out my tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me you\u2019re not.\u201d There.</p><p>\u201cDo you live here alone?\u201d That lasted a while.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you emancipated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it hard to get emancipated?\u201d I knew that\u2019s what she was asking. Really, I did.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s embarrassingly easy.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t speak right away which, ironically, is now unusual. I look at her and she\u2019s studying me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out if you\u2019re being sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it really is embarrassingly easy. It basically comes down to two things. Age and money. And, really, it\u2019s the money that\u2019s the most important. I think the state would cut you loose at twelve as long as they knew it wouldn\u2019t cost them a dime to support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you have to do?\u201d If these are the questions she\u2019s going to ask, then I can deal with it. As long as she\u2019s far away from anything personal, I\u2019ll tell her what she wants to know. She lives with her aunt. Maybe she wants to be emancipated, though she\u2019s got to be almost eighteen so there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a point to it now. My grandfather and I took care of it a year ago as soon as he found out he was sick.</p><p>\u201cYou fill out some paperwork, provide documentation that you\u2019re at least sixteen and you have the financial means to support yourself. Then your guardian signs it, quick hearing and you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>She nods as if the explanation is acceptable to her. She doesn\u2019t ask about the money. Maybe she has some social graces.</p><p>\u201cWho was your legal guardian?\u201d Interesting question, but I\u2019m not opening that door. She could ask anyone else. Everyone knows the story, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in danger there just yet. She\u2019ll find out sooner rather than later. I\u2019m not deluded enough to think it won\u2019t come out somehow, but it\u2019s nice to have one person exist who doesn\u2019t know all of my tragic bullshit. At least for a little while.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wondered if that\u2019s who was visiting you on Sunday. Drew said you had company, that\u2019s why you weren\u2019t at dinner.\u201d I did have company and it most definitely wasn\u2019t my grandfather but I\u2019m not getting anywhere near the Leigh situation with this girl. Not now or ever.</p><p>\u201cA friend was in town.\u201d I\u2019m expecting another onslaught of questions but no more come. I have quite a few for her but she seems to be done talking right now and I\u2019m afraid if I invite any more conversation tonight, I\u2019ll probably be the one regretting it.</p><p>After about ten minutes of leg swinging and silence, she starts asking questions again. They aren\u2019t what I expect, but nothing with this girl is. And these questions, I don\u2019t mind. She asks about tools and wood and furniture building. I don\u2019t know how many questions she asks but I know that my voice is hoarse by the end of the evening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she jumps down from the counter\u200c\u2014\u200cher universal sign for I\u2019m leaving now\u200c\u2014\u200cI say the one thing that I\u2019ve been thinking all night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected you to be like.\u201d I catch her eye and she actually looks a little surprised and a lot curious which I think she tries to hide.</p><p>\u201cHow did you expect me to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Nastya</p><p>My mother\u2019s voice. It\u2019s the first thing I remember after I opened my eyes.</p><p>My beautiful girl. You came back to us.</p><p>But she was wrong.</p> <p>If Edna St. Vincent Millay was right and childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies, then my childhood ended when I was fifteen. Which I guess is more than Josh got, because according to what I\u2019ve picked up on from Drew, his ended at eight. I don\u2019t know more than that, because I don\u2019t ask Josh questions I\u2019m not prepared to answer myself.</p><p>I have to go home this weekend. My mom expected me to visit a month ago. I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t shown up here. It isn\u2019t like Charlotte Ward to wait for anything she wants.</p><p>I don\u2019t really have much I need to pack. I left most of my old clothes there. I won\u2019t see anyone except my family, so I\u2019m leaving my Hollywood Boulevard attire at Margot\u2019s, which means my feet will be happy for a couple days at least. I have to miss school on Friday so I can get to Brighton early enough to make the appointment my mom made with my therapist. I thought about telling Josh I was going, but I didn\u2019t end up mentioning it for a lot of reasons, mostly because I\u2019m not responsible to him. I could probably make it back by six o\u2019clock on Sunday to get to dinner, but it might be for the best if I skip it this week.</p><p>When I walk through the front door of the very out of place Victorian-style house I grew up in, I feel home. The feeling only lasts a moment. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s just a knee-jerk reaction; an echo of a feeling that used to exist. Just once, I\u2019d like to go home and have home be what it used to be. Then again, maybe I\u2019m just imagining some sort of halcyon days that exist more in my memory than they ever did in real life.</p><p>My mother is at the dining room table we have never used except for holidays. She has proofs spread all over the surface. My mother is a photographer, which is kind of funny, because she\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous, but she\u2019s never actually in any pictures because she\u2019s always the one taking them. She works freelance but she\u2019s never without an assignment because she\u2019s really good, which means she can make her own rules, take the jobs she wants, come and go as she pleases. My bedroom upstairs used to be covered with her photographs. All of my favorite ones. I\u2019d sit at the table and look at her proofs with her and pick the ones that jumped out at me. There was always one photo that resonated above the others and I\u2019d point it out and she\u2019d make me a copy. It was our ritual. I don\u2019t even remember the last picture I picked. I didn\u2019t know it was going to be the last one. I could walk over to her, sit down at the table and point one out right now, but I don\u2019t. My walls are covered with new wallpaper now.</p><p>As soon as she sees me, she\u2019s out of her chair. I don\u2019t think it takes her more than three steps to reach me and wrap her arms around me. I hug her back because she needs it, even if I don\u2019t. It\u2019s different from hugging Mrs. Leighton but not in the way that you would think. Hugging my mother is far more awkward. She pulls back and I see the expression in her eyes; the one I have gotten so used to; the one I have seen a thousand times in the last three years. The look of person staring out a window, waiting for someone they know is never coming home.</p> <p>I\u2019m not the only one who isn\u2019t the same person anymore. None of us are. I wish I could have made that different for them, given them everything they believed they had gotten back that day when they found me alive and not dead. Who knows what we would be like now, if my mother had been allowed to watch me fade away from her? She would have lost the little girl anyway; just later and gradually. Not the way it happened\u200c\u2014\u200cin one big ass fell swoop. Even if everything hadn\u2019t happened the way it did, that child part of me would still have disappeared. Imperceptibly over time. I just got too old, too fast. All at once.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye.</p><p>I\u2019m saved by the appearance of my brother, Asher, who comes bounding down the stairs. He\u2019s a year younger than me and what seems like two feet taller. He grabs me in a bear hug and lifts me off the ground. He\u2019s gotten the memo that I don\u2019t like being touched about fifty times but he hasn\u2019t bothered to read it yet or he just doesn\u2019t care. He refuses to adhere to any rules or suggested boundaries where I\u2019m involved. It upsets my parents and pisses the crap out of me in a way that only a brother can. Asher calls bullshit on me and I let him. He\u2019s the only one. He\u2019s not afraid of losing me or pushing me away, because he knows that right now is about as far away as I can get, and he figures he has nothing to lose.</p><p>I have an hour before I have to be at therapy. Asher says he\u2019ll drive me. I shrug. I can drive myself, but my appointment is at three-thirty which is the witching hour as far as I\u2019m concerned, so I\u2019ll take the company, and besides, I miss him. Asher might be my younger brother, but I don\u2019t think he realizes it. He would beat the world down for me if it would make things better, and I think he feels like a failure because it won\u2019t.</p><p>On the drive, he regales me with stories from school. He\u2019s a junior and a popular one. Playing baseball as opposed to the piano will do that for you. He\u2019s dating a girl named Addison. I\u2019d like to tell him that her name has the misfortune of meaning Adam\u2019s son. He wouldn\u2019t care anyway, because according to him, she\u2019s smokin\u2019 hot, though I have a feeling that\u2019s not the whole story. He can say what he wants, to save face, but I know Asher well enough to know that smokin\u2019 hot will only get a girl so far and then she\u2019ll have to have some substance. He doesn\u2019t have to worry. I won\u2019t call him out for failure to be a douche. There are enough douches in the world. I\u2019m glad my brother isn\u2019t one of them. He\u2019s got two AP classes this year, which is two more than I have, and he\u2019s taking the SATs in a few weeks, so he\u2019s been cramming like hell and I\u2019m invited to help him this weekend if I want to. I don\u2019t know what helping would entail, but I have a feeling it would be hindered by my silence, so he\u2019s on his own. During the fifteen minute ride, I get caught up on the last seven weeks in the uncomplicated world of Asher Ward. No wonder his name means blessed.</p><p>I sit through my therapy appointment, even though I don\u2019t say anything, because everyone cuts me more slack when I go. I\u2019m not sure what good inconsistent therapy sessions even do, but showing up apparently demonstrates that I\u2019m making an effort. I\u2019m not. The only effort I\u2019m making is to do just enough to be left alone.</p><p>I am an expert in all manners of therapy. The only thing I\u2019m not an expert in is getting them to work. My parents had me in therapy before I even left the hospital, which is the recommended course of action when the devil finds your fifteen year-old and the afterlife spits her back out.</p><p>I stayed in therapy long enough to know that nothing that happened to me was my fault. I didn\u2019t do anything to invite it or deserve it. But that just makes it worse. Maybe I don\u2019t blame myself for what happened, but when they tell you that something was completely and utterly random, they\u2019re also telling you something else. That nothing you do matters. It doesn\u2019t matter if you do everything right, if you dress the right way and act the right way and follow all the rules, because evil will find you anyway. Evil\u2019s resourceful that way.</p> <p>The day evil found me, I was wearing a pink silk blouse with pearl buttons and a white eyelet skirt that came all the way down to my knees and walking to school to record a Haydn sonata for my conservatory audition. The sad thing is that I didn\u2019t even need it. I\u2019d already recorded it once, along with a Chopin etude and a Bach prelude and fugue, but I wasn\u2019t happy with the sonata and I wanted to record it again. Maybe if I could have lived with that slight imperfection, I wouldn\u2019t be living with such a huge one now.</p><p>Either way, I still wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. I was out in the sunlight in the middle of the day, not lurking in the dark. I wasn\u2019t skipping school or sneaking out. I was going exactly where I was supposed to be going, exactly when I was supposed to be going there. He wasn\u2019t after me. He didn\u2019t even know who I was.</p><p>They tell you it was random to make you feel blameless. But all I hear them telling me is that I have no control; and if I have no control, then I\u2019m powerless. I would have preferred being blamed.</p><p>I\u2019ve done the support group thing, too, but I hated it even before I stopped talking. I never understood how hearing everyone else\u2019s shit stories was supposed to make me feel better about mine. Everyone sits around and laments the crap hands they\u2019ve been dealt. Maybe I\u2019m just not a sadist. It doesn\u2019t comfort me to see other people as annihilated as I am. There isn\u2019t any safety in these numbers. Just more misery and I have enough of my own.</p><p>Plus, support groups get a little antagonistic when you don\u2019t talk. It\u2019s like you\u2019re pilfering everyone else\u2019s pain, taking, but not offering anything in return. They regard me like I\u2019m some sort of thief. One time, a blonde girl named Esta\u200c\u2014\u200cwhich I couldn\u2019t find a meaning for unless you count the fact that it\u2019s the Spanish word for this\u200c\u2014\u200ctold me I needed to \u201cput up or shut up\u201d and I wasn\u2019t sure how to react to that, but it kind of would have been worth talking just to ask her what the hell she was smoking. Then I found out that she had been stabbed by her mom and making fun of her wasn\u2019t quite so funny anymore.</p><p>I got to hear about rapes and gunshot wounds and hate crimes, people who knew their attackers, people who didn\u2019t, people whose assailants were punished and those who weren\u2019t. There isn\u2019t any comfort in it. If eavesdropping on someone else\u2019s nightmares is supposed to make me feel better, I\u2019d rather stay feeling like shit. I don\u2019t think telling them about my horror story would do me any good. And besides, I\u2019m not even supposed to have a story to tell.</p><p>So that\u2019s what it was like every week. I\u2019d sit in a circle and a bunch of people who\u2019d been through as much shit as I had would look at me like I snuck into the club without paying the cover. And I\u2019d feel like screaming and telling them that I had paid it the same as everyone else in the room, I just didn\u2019t feel like waving around my receipt.</p><p>Today my therapist doesn\u2019t talk to me about blame. She talks to me about talking. I wish I could say that I listen, but I spend most of the time thinking about how to tweak my angel food cake recipe and proper kickboxing techniques.</p><p>On the way home, I get what I knew was coming.</p><p>\u201cMom still thinks you might come back.\u201d Asher won\u2019t look at me when he says it. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s talking about back home or just back. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even bother to make it sound like a question. Then it gets even better.</p><p>\u201cThey want you to talk to Detective Martin again.\u201d Of course Ash would be the designated bomb dropper. I know he hates being put in this position, but somehow Asher has become the path of least resistance to me. \u201cShe\u2019ll come to the house if you want, so you don\u2019t have to go to the station, but they want to show you some pictures. They know you don\u2019t remember anything, but they want you to look anyway, in case something jogs your memory.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window so I don\u2019t have to look at his face when I lie to him with my silence. I don\u2019t need my memory jogged. My memory jogs me. I remember everything.</p><p>Every detail.</p><p>Every night.</p><p>For the past 473 days.</p><p>On Saturday, I meet with Detective Martin. I look at the pictures. Check out the drawings. Shake my head. He isn\u2019t there. He never is. They have no idea what they\u2019re looking for. She gives us another business card. I\u2019m not sure how many we have now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should tell. I know I should. But he\u2019s mine. I don\u2019t want him getting the chance to walk away. I want him to pay and I want to be the one who decides how.</p><p>On Sunday morning, my dad makes pancakes for breakfast like we always used to. I come downstairs to the smell of bacon frying and I know that in two days you\u2019ll still be able to smell the lingering aroma of bacon grease in the house. I won\u2019t still be here in two days to smell it, but it will be here even if I\u2019m not.</p><p>Asher comes down wearing swim trunks and no shirt and is promptly sent back upstairs by my mother to get one. He groans at the request but goes anyway. He\u2019s on his way to the beach with the famous Addison Hartley who is picking him up in less than an hour. I\u2019m actually excited to meet the girl who has my brother trying to act like he\u2019s not acting like a lovesick fool. I\u2019m happy for him, because going to the beach with someone you\u2019re stupidly in love with is such an awesomely normal thing to do. He invites me to go with them, but I shake my head no for all the good it does me.</p><p>\u201cCome with us. It\u2019ll be fun,\u201d he tries to convince me. I\u2019m quite sure it would be fun, if it was only Asher and his girlfriend going. Even though I\u2019m freakishly pale, I still might have considered it if not for all of the other kids who I knew would be there. I may be gone, but around Brighton, I am never forgotten. I shake my head again.</p> <p>\u201cGo with him. All of your old friends will be there,\u201d my mother says hopefully. It\u2019s hard to see hope in your mother\u2019s face when you know you\u2019re going to kill it. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s more misguided about, thinking this is a selling point or thinking that I actually have old friends. The only old friends I had are probably spending their Sunday with a musical instrument, not running around half na**d on the beach.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing stopping you from going, Mil\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d my dad says, catching himself before finishing. Right Dad, nothing but the fact that I have to wear a shirt the whole time to hide the scars and field a thousand questions I wouldn\u2019t want to answer even if I did talk. Getting impaled with a railroad spike would be less painful.</p><p>If I had to decide who, out of all of us, this whole shit situation was the hardest on, I\u2019d say it was my father. My father is a quiet badass. Gentle, protective, and if need be, murderous to protect his children. Like all fathers should be. The problem is he didn\u2019t protect me. Because he couldn\u2019t. No one could. But I don\u2019t think he sees it that way.</p><p>\u201cYou have to rejoin the world sometime,\u201d he starts. I feel the no excuses lecture. Asher and I have never been allowed to make excuses about anything, even now. I have a feeling he\u2019s talking about more than going to the beach. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get a choice in what happened to you. Neither did we. But you have a choice in what happens now. We don\u2019t. You\u2019re the one in control and all we can do is sit on the sidelines and watch, even if you keep making the wrong calls over and over again.\u201d We\u2019re obviously veering into sports metaphor territory. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to force you to do anything you aren\u2019t ready to do. You\u2019ve had enough forced on you. But you have to make a decision about how long you\u2019re going to let this define your life.\u201d</p><p>Now I think my parents realize that they\u2019ve parented themselves into a corner with their insistence that Asher and I make our own choices growing up and that we stand behind them and live with the consequences. Because they can\u2019t take it back. Now, they\u2019re stuck letting me make all of my own decisions, wrong or not, and watching me live with them because that\u2019s what they taught me to do.</p> <p>It was fine when being the Brighton Piano Girl defined my life. When I was making the right choices. When all of my choices were influenced by what my parents wanted me to choose. I let their current steer me, let it smooth and shape me like a stone pushed along the sand until I was perfect. And as soon as I was, I was ripped out of the water and thrown and smashed into a thousand pieces that I can\u2019t put back together. I don\u2019t know where they go. And there are so many missing that the ones that are left don\u2019t fit together anymore.</p><p>I think I\u2019ll stay in pieces. I can shift them, rearrange, depending on the day, depending on what I need to be. I can change on a whim and be so many different girls and none of them has to be me.</p><p>We sit down at the table and eat pancakes made from a box mix. Even Asher doesn\u2019t say anything else. After breakfast I go to my room and look for more names to add to the walls. I see Addison arrive from my window, but I don\u2019t go downstairs. I never do get to meet her, but Asher\u2019s right, she does look smokin\u2019 hot.</p><p>I get in my car just after five on Sunday afternoon. Everyone walks me out. My mom reminds me to text her when I get back to Margot\u2019s so she knows I arrived safely. My dad hugs me and closes the door of my now very clean car which he made Asher help him wash yesterday. I lock the doors as soon as I\u2019m in, turn off the radio and leave.</p><p>Going home is like culture shock. Different house, different face, different clothes, different name. Same comforter. Sometimes I think I wouldn\u2019t mind wrapping Asher up in a box and taking him back to Margot\u2019s with me. But then he\u2019d see the way I am there. That I\u2019ve probably gotten worse instead of better and I\u2019d have to face the very disappointment and lost hopes I ran away from in the first place. Plus, once he did the requisite double-take and recognized me, he\u2019d probably beat the crap out of any guy who looked at me in all my Snow White meets Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood glory.</p><p>By the time I get back to Margot\u2019s, it will be after seven o\u2019clock. I planned it that way on purpose so I wouldn\u2019t have to decide whether or not to go to Drew\u2019s. I\u2019m starting to feel guilty about the fact that neither Josh nor I have made any move to tell him about the amount of time we spend together. It\u2019s not that I really mind Drew knowing; I think he\u2019s finally accepted the fact that there is not enough alcohol in the world to get me to have sex with him, so that\u2019s not the issue. The problem is that he would inevitably start to wonder how Josh and I spend so much time together with no talking involved, and even if his suspicions are unconfirmed, they\u2019re still suspicions I\u2019d rather avoid. Plus, if I\u2019m being honest, the hours I spend in that garage with Josh, apart from school and Margot and everything else, are mine. I just don\u2019t want to share it yet. Apparently Josh hasn\u2019t said anything, either.</p> <p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cNastya can\u2019t make it to dinner. She asked me to drop this off on my way to work.\u201d The blonde woman at the door hands me a really tall, elaborately iced cake. I can see the blue paisley pattern around the edge. The last time I saw that plate, it was on my front porch covered with cookies.</p><p>\u201cShe asked you?\u201d I say skeptically. Does she talk to other people and she\u2019s lying to me? I don\u2019t know why, but that bothers me. A lot.</p><p>\u201cShe wrote down this address under the words Drop off, Sunday and 5:45. At the bottom she tacked on the word please. It\u2019s the most communication I\u2019ve gotten from her in years.\u201d She sounds aggravated at having to explain herself to me.</p><p>\u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d I take it out of her hands and she looks at me like she\u2019s waiting for something.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cJosh Bennett.\u201d Who are you?</p> <p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m kind of dumbfounded by the request but I don\u2019t want to be rude. I look at her again. She\u2019s really thin and tan and blonde and doesn\u2019t remotely resemble any serial killers in my mind. She doesn\u2019t resemble Nastya, either, but I\u2019ve got to assume she\u2019s the aunt Drew talked about, so I push the door back and let her step inside. I really don\u2019t know what she wants from me, unless Nastya\u2019s messing with me in more ways than I imagine and this woman knows things I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMargot Travers. Nastya lives with me.\u201d She holds out her hand. I hold up the cake in response.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush because I have to be at work soon, and frankly, it\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d Okay. \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t have to drop the cake off, I would have been over here this weekend anyway to find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d I can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m more nervous or curious now, but I\u2019m definitely listening. \u201cThere\u2019s a tracker on Nastya\u2019s phone.\u201d She pauses for a second. I guess she\u2019s giving me a minute to react. I don\u2019t. \u201cI check it periodically, and a few weeks ago this address came up, so I started checking it more often and do you know what I found?\u201d Of course I do, and you know that I do. You just want to ask for dramatic effect and then you\u2019re going to tell me anyway. \u201cThis address came up again and again and again\u200c\u2014\u200cat nine o\u2019clock, ten o\u2019clock, eleven o\u2019clock. Sometimes midnight.\u201d Sounds about right. I don\u2019t confirm or deny. I\u2019ll let her keep talking until she asks me something outright.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you want to tell me?\u201d she asks expectantly.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you want to know?\u201d I feel like I\u2019m having a seventh-grade stare down with this woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asking her?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me as if to say yeah, right. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Every time she pauses, her eyes scan the room like she\u2019s looking for my p**n collection or the entrance to my hidden meth lab. I\u2019m getting a little insulted at the fact that this woman nearly pushes Nastya out the door with Drew, of all people, but she\u2019s here giving me the third-degree. Maybe because Drew shows up, knocks on the door and asks her to be a guest at a well-chaperoned dinner on a Sunday evening, while I let her covertly hole up in my garage, late at night, with no adult supervision anywhere.</p><p>\u201cThen why should I?\u201d I respond, because now I\u2019m just being a child. But then I realize what she\u2019s really asking, what she really wants to know. And it\u2019s not my first suspicion. Because this woman isn\u2019t trying to figure out if her niece is sneaking over here and ha**ng s*x with me. She wants to know if she\u2019s talking to me. I take a breath; because now I want this over, and if I give her some sort of answer, maybe it\u2019ll be enough to get her off my case. Plus, I\u2019m getting the feeling she\u2019s going to start issuing rules or threats and I don\u2019t really handle either of those well. I may not know if I want Nastya hanging around all the time or not, but I don\u2019t like the idea of someone else making that decision for me. I can give her an answer, but I\u2019m doing it for my benefit, not hers. \u201cShe\u2019s in my shop class. She\u2019s really behind everyone else so she comes over here at night when she goes running and watches me work.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me long enough to make me wonder how she\u2019s going to respond.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d She sounds disappointed. Her eyes narrow again. \u201cYour parents don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s here all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother them at all.\u201d It\u2019s not really a lie. Not really.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Nastya?\u201d I\u2019m greeted by Drew\u2019s dad almost as soon as I walk in the door for dinner. The comment brings his mom around the corner a second later. The music\u2019s already playing and I can tell it\u2019s Sarah\u2019s. I\u2019d rather listen to a circular saw but we\u2019re not allowed to insult anyone\u2019s music when it\u2019s their week.</p><p>\u201cNastya\u2019s not coming?\u201d Mrs. Leighton asks, taking the cake out of my hands and sounding genuinely disappointed. \u201cThen where did this come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer aunt dropped it off this afternoon and said she wanted you to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the sweetest thing!\u201d she exclaims, carrying it into the kitchen. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s another person on Earth who would refer to Nastya as the sweetest thing, and I wonder if she sees something the rest of us don\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dinner at Drew\u2019s ends up being just the five of us, like so many dinners I\u2019ve eaten at this table before.

She looks at me when she says it and I look away because she\u2019s pissing me off.</p><p>\u201cSarah, not everyone has such an easy life. Some people have problems and you need to learn to empathize, not judge.\u201d Mrs. Leighton is skewering her with the look that has kept all three of us in line for years, four of us if you count Mr. Leighton.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you invite her?\u201d Shit. I wonder if my voice sounds as pissed off as I think it does.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we really like her.\u201d She sounds surprised by the question. Her response is sincere, but it\u2019s the sincerity that pisses me off. Before I get a chance to respond, Sarah opens her bitchy mouth and saves me from myself, if only for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Sarah,\u201d Drew counters with the phrase that must leave his mouth a hundred times a day.</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d Mrs. Leighton lays her fork down next to her plate and it\u2019s obvious that it pains her not to slam it onto the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat? She can be a bitch but I can\u2019t tell her to shut up?\u201d Drew stands up and pushes his chair back from the table.</p> <p>\u201cSit down, Drew.\u201d The forced calm in his mother\u2019s voice is a warning and he sits. He\u2019s readying for his comeuppance, but I\u2019m not done yet.</p><p>\u201cHow can you like her? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d I should drop it. I know I should, but I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a novelty or a pet. Look at the troubled, misguided mute girl we\u2019ve taken in. Aren\u2019t we amazingly generous and understanding? I hate it and I don\u2019t want it coming from Drew\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how well you can really know a girl who can\u2019t talk,\u201d she says sympathetically.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t talk, I silently correct. Can, just won\u2019t. I know that one thing.</p><p>Mrs. Leighton\u2019s attention is on me now. She\u2019s trying to explain it for me as well as for herself. She wants to convince me, but she doesn\u2019t need to. I already know. The answer is you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t know her at all; at least not Nastya, because she won\u2019t give you anything, and what she gives you isn\u2019t real. She may talk to me, but I don\u2019t know her either.</p><p>\u201cSo how can you say you like her?\u201d I\u2019m not as angry now, but I want to know.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s obviously a nice girl. She has manners. She never comes to dinner empty-handed.\u201d I don\u2019t know how manners and nice are equal, but I keep my mouth shut because being mad at Sarah is one thing, but being mad at Drew\u2019s mom is something else. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever done anything to piss me off before. The feeling sucks. I don\u2019t even know where it comes from. \u201cClearly, there\u2019s something going on in her life and we can\u2019t judge\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what is it? You invite her because you feel sorry for her or because you\u2019re using her to teach Sarah how to be a better person?\u201d I had to cut her off. It was getting way too close to the point where the psychoanalysis was going to start and I didn\u2019t want to let it happen. I didn\u2019t want to hear it. It would feel too much like I was being psychoanalyzed, letting them tear me open and pick apart every action and choice and motivation, so they can feel superior and sane. I didn\u2019t want them to do it to her while she wasn\u2019t even here. Of course, I feel like I\u2019ve just ripped myself open for them, spared them the trouble and dumped out my feelings so they can lay them across the dining room table and poke around in them with a stick.</p><p>\u201cJosh.\u201d She says a lot with that word. Like I\u2019m being called out and judged and questioned and pitied. Everyone\u2019s looking at me. I can\u2019t blame them. I invited it by being the stupid bastard who couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. It\u2019s not even an outburst. I never even raised my voice. I don\u2019t even think my tone changed at all, but they still aren\u2019t used to it. It\u2019s the Josh Bennett equivalent of tattooing her name across my chest. Regrettable, moronic, and really f**king embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mrs. Leighton continues, and now I can tell she thinks I\u2019m deluding myself. But I\u2019m not the one taking in strays. I\u2019m not trying to save anyone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a side show,\u201d I cut her off again because I don\u2019t want Mrs. Leighton\u2019s apologies. She doesn\u2019t owe them to me. I should quit while I\u2019m ahead, but that would be smart, and I\u2019m not being smart tonight.</p><p>\u201cShe dresses like one.\u201d Obviously Sarah isn\u2019t being smart either.</p><p>\u201cI like the way she dresses.\u201d I don\u2019t know if Drew is trying to get everyone back on track by reminding us all what an idiot he is, or if he really is just an idiot.</p><p>\u201cLess work for you,\u201d she retorts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your problem Sarah?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s yours? My parents aren\u2019t allowed to be nice to her and I\u2019m not allowed to not be nice. You\u2019re the one with the issue.\u201d Sarah has no problem raising her voice. The worst part about it is that she\u2019s right. I am the one with the issue and I don\u2019t even know what the issue is.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how this whole dinner devolved into the mess we\u2019re in now, but I have a feeling I\u2019m to blame for it. I could have kept my mouth shut, listened to them play a nice game of Solve Sunshine and let it go. But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Mrs. Leighton manages to corner me at my truck before I can leave, and I wish she\u2019d just leave me alone like everyone else. Apparently I\u2019ve been claimed by this woman whether I like it or not.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you is dating that girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us is.\u201d Maybe Drew is, but I don\u2019t think so. At least dating wouldn\u2019t be the word for it, but I don\u2019t want to think about that so much. \u201cDrew, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d She looks knowingly at me.</p><p>\u201cThen why ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh.\u201d I wish she would stop saying my name like that. Soft and tentative, like she\u2019s licking broken glass. \u201cLook at the way she dresses, the way she covers her face with that make-up and the fact that she doesn\u2019t speak. She might be silent, but she is screaming for help.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m watching an episode of General Hospital.</p><p>\u201cSo why doesn\u2019t someone give it to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe nobody knows how. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to pretend nothing is wrong than to face the fact that everything is wrong, but you\u2019re powerless to do anything about it.\u201d I wonder if she\u2019s talking about me and she thinks she\u2019s being subtle.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this? Shouldn\u2019t you be talking to Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Her accusation is clear and I answer it.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I hate my left hand. I hate to look at it. I hate it when it stutters and trembles and reminds me that my identity is gone. But I look at it anyway, because it also reminds me that I\u2019m going to find the boy who took everything from me. I\u2019m going to kill the boy who killed me, and when I kill him, I\u2019m going to do it with my left hand.</p><p>Clay Whitaker is chasing me on my way to first period on Thursday, hair as disheveled as his clothes, looking every bit a refugee from the Island of Misfit Boys. His sketchbook is closed up and tucked under his arm the way it always is, like it\u2019s attached to him or something. I would still love to see what\u2019s in it. I wonder how many of those he goes through and how fast he fills them up. It can\u2019t be the same book all the time. Maybe he goes through as many sketchbooks as I do black and white composition books. His closet probably has a stack of them from floor to ceiling, and I bet if you flipped through them you wouldn\u2019t find the exact same picture on every page. Not like in my notebooks. His are probably like a photo album of memories, where he can look back and know exactly what place he was at in his mind when he drew the picture. Mine aren\u2019t like that. I can\u2019t flip the pages and read what I wrote and tell you what was happening in my life, in my mind, at that time. I can only tell you what happened on one particular day, and it\u2019s the one I\u2019m not supposed to remember.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nastya!\u201d He\u2019s panting when he reaches me, smiling through heavy breaths. I stop and step off to the side so we aren\u2019t standing in the middle of the hallway. I\u2019m curious because Clay will say hello to me if I run into him, but he never seeks me out.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask a favor, and I figured since you kind of owe me, you\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>Really? I\u2019m not worried about whatever favor he wants but I am trying to figure out what I owe him for. I narrow my eyes at him and his smile is still there.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you gotten into the English wing at lunchtime because a certain book has been propping the door open? A book which, by the way, is dented to hell and I\u2019m probably going to have to pay for, so you kind of owe me double.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll concede that. Come on. Bring it. I motion with my hand.</p><p>\u201cI want to draw you.\u201d Not what I was expecting but I hadn\u2019t really stopped to think about what I was expecting. It\u2019s not really an unusual request, considering that it\u2019s coming from Clay Whitaker, but I don\u2019t know why he wants me. I hope he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019d pose na**d for him because that\u2019s not happening. I tap on his sketchbook and motion for him to open it. I\u2019ve been dying to see what he does and he couldn\u2019t have handed me a more perfect excuse. If it\u2019s possible, his smile gets even wider, but now it\u2019s genuine, too. He\u2019s not trying to sell me something anymore, even though that\u2019s exactly what his drawings are going to do.</p><p>We\u2019ve been facing each other but he moves over to stand next to me, leaning his back against the wall so he\u2019s shoulder to shoulder with me. He drops his backpack to the ground and opens the sketchbook. The first drawing is of a woman, older, with a lined face and thin lips. Her eyes are sunken and it\u2019s horribly depressing. I look over to him and he\u2019s waiting for my reaction. I don\u2019t know what reaction to give him so I motion for him to turn the page. The next picture is of a man\u2019s face. He looks like an older version of Clay, and it must be his father, unless it\u2019s some sort of future self-portrait. Just like the first drawing, it\u2019s jarringly real. I swear I can look at the eyes and tell what they were thinking. It isn\u2019t just inspired; it\u2019s almost frightening. The next one is a woman with eyes I can tell are bloodshot even though the drawing is black and white and my reaction is almost visceral. I can feel it. I want to touch her and find out what\u2019s wrong. But it\u2019s nothing compared to the feeling I get when I see the page he flips to next.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at myself. The picture is me but not me. It\u2019s me he\u2019s never seen. My face looks younger and my eyes are clear. There isn\u2019t a trace of make up on me and my hair is smoothed back in a ponytail that is pulled over my right shoulder. This one I do touch. I can\u2019t help it. My hand just goes there. I pull it away as soon as my fingers meet the paper. I wish he hadn\u2019t shown this to me here. I can\u2019t look at any more. I close the book and shove it back at him.</p><p>Now I\u2019m not so certain that the second picture wasn\u2019t actually a future self-portrait after all. I\u2019m sure he could easily look at a face and age, not only the skin, but the person behind it. It\u2019s what he did to me in reverse. He regressed me. Took the age and the days and the years and everything that happened in them away and drew me the way I used to be.</p><p>When I turn to face him, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in my expression. It could be any of a thousand emotions I don\u2019t want to try to sort out right now in the hallway before first period. The bell is going to ring soon and the corridor is filling up around us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clay is staring at me. He\u2019s waiting and he\u2019s not smiling anymore. He must have been watching the entire time I was looking at the book, gauging my reactions while he showed me his soul. No matter how proud he may be, I know that showing me his work still has to be like ripping off his clothes, spinning around in front of me na**d and waiting for judgment. I used to feel the same way when I played anything I had composed.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>I pull a spiral notebook out of my backpack. The first of two pre-school warning bells just blasted through the hall and I have to get to class. Time and place? I write and hand it to him just as Yearbook Michelle comes running up and grabs his arm, pulling him away.</p><p>\u201cCome on! We\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d I don\u2019t think she even noticed that he was talking to me.</p> <p>\u201cFind me at lunch!\u201d he yells over his shoulder as I walk off in the opposite direction, haunted by my own face.</p><p>\u201cTo the right. Just a little. Back more. Forget it. The light in here sucks. Let\u2019s go back downstairs. The kitchen is the only room in this house with enough decent natural light.\u201d Clay picks up his sketchpad, charcoal pencils and some other art crap, and I follow him back down the stairs of the townhouse I\u2019ve spent the past three days in. He\u2019s obsessed. I can\u2019t blame him. I recognize it. I know the overwhelming need to create something. I watch him draw and hate him a little bit for it. I don\u2019t feel bad about it. I feel justified. I miss it. I want it back so badly that I would break my hand apart all over again just to give myself something else to feel. Sometimes the wanting almost kills me again.</p><p>It\u2019s a little bit devastating being surrounded by people who can do what you can\u2019t anymore. People who create. People whose souls don\u2019t live in their bodies anymore because they\u2019ve leached so much of themselves into their work. Josh. Clay. My mother. I want to steal from them to let myself live.</p><p>\u201cBack downstairs?\u201d Maddie Whitaker has been here every day that I\u2019ve come. She works doing data entry from home, so Clay says she\u2019s always around. He sees his dad on the weekends on the other side of town which is why he\u2019s been having me sit for him during the week.</p><p>\u201cCrap light,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s enough of an answer for her.</p> <p>I sit for the next hour, watching Clay, charcoal in hand, with his eyebrows pulled together the way they get when he\u2019s concentrating. He hasn\u2019t let me see anything he\u2019s done yet. I don\u2019t even know how many he\u2019s drawn. I thought I was agreeing to one picture, maybe two, but we seem to have gone beyond that. By like eighty.</p><p>He finally takes pity on me and lets me up to use the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHow many more?\u201d I write down on a pad of sticky notes I find on the kitchen counter, because I\u2019m stalling before I have to sit again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll know when I\u2019ve got them all, but I won\u2019t know how many that is until I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCryptic, much?\u201d I scribble back. Because if I\u2019m going to be spending this much time with him, I have to at least be able to communicate a little. Plus, Clay won\u2019t sell me out.</p><p>\u201cNot trying to be. Some people I can capture in one picture. For most, it\u2019s two or three. For you, it\u2019s more.\u201d</p> <p>Now he\u2019s got me. I\u2019m in. Why does it take so many pictures to capture one face?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to capture one face. I\u2019m trying to capture all the faces.\u201d He stops to see if I\u2019m getting this. \u201cMost people have more than one. You have more than most.\u201d</p><p>He tears apart faces and puts them back together whole, like I would a piece of music. I could play it a hundred ways, imbue it with a different emotion every time and try to find the truth of it. He does that with faces, except he\u2019s not putting the truth in, he\u2019s drawing it out. He\u2019s looking for the truth of me. I wonder if he\u2019ll find it, and if he does, maybe he can show me where it is again.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Josh</p><p>My router is acting up for the second night in a row. I thought I had it back in working order last night, but now it\u2019s pissing me off again. I wanted to finish this chair by the end of the week because I have three more projects waiting that all should have taken priority over this. But I wanted to build the chair and I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. So now I\u2019m behind and I\u2019ll be living out here for the next couple of weeks, trying to get back to even. I don\u2019t mind. There are worse places to be.</p><p>The quiet out here is strange. It shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019m used to the quiet, but it only took me two days without her, to feel it. It\u2019s unsettling. Years of working out here by myself undone by less than two months of her company. And now she hasn\u2019t been here for days. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing, because I obviously need a reality check. I try to work with the garage door down as much as possible, just so I know that I can. I\u2019m not going to let myself get used to anyone again. She can come here. She can sit in my garage, hand me tools, ask me questions. She can use me to get the talking out of her system. I can handle the company as long as I don\u2019t come to expect it too much. And I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know when she\u2019s coming back but I wonder how long I can keep the garage closed before I start to suffocate.</p><p>Nastya</p> <p>I\u2019ve been clocking more miles this week than I have for the past several. A lot of my running time has been being spent in a certain garage and I\u2019m trying to rein it in. But I miss him. It\u2019s not like going without seeing a friend for a few days. He\u2019s the be all and end all of my friends right now. I have Drew, and I seem to have acquired Clay somewhere along the way, but Josh is my escape. He\u2019s my hiding place.</p><p>It\u2019s been days since I\u2019ve been to Josh\u2019s house. I\u2019ve spent the whole week sitting in a chair at Clay\u2019s, feeling antsy and ridiculous and just wanting to get up and move. I hate the sitting still. When you spend months in a bed, letting your body heal and then sitting in a chair, trying to make your hand work, you get sick of it fast and you want to run away. So every day when I get done at Clay\u2019s, I have to run. It\u2019s the only thing that keeps the frayed edges of my sanity intact. And since Margot caved a few weeks back and let me get a portable punching bag, I have something to hit now and I spend a good amount of time doing that, too.</p><p>By Friday night, I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019ll be home, but my feet take me there anyway. I wonder if he missed me, too. I slow myself down before I reach the driveway. He\u2019s in the back, adjusting one of his saws and he\u2019s turned away from me. I look around for someplace to climb up on the counter, but there isn\u2019t one. Every inch of space on the workbench is occupied. Piles of wood scraps, random tools and boxes covering the whole thing. It\u2019s never this overrun in here. Josh is meticulous, which means this is on purpose and I wonder if it\u2019s a message. Maybe he realized how much he enjoyed not having me all over his space. He got reacquainted with his solitude and found that he\u2019d missed it.</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to walk out yet. If I\u2019m going to be rejected, I\u2019d like it to come complete with humiliation. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll come out from behind that stupid saw and say something to me, but he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s rushing to do so. Out of the corner of my eye, in front of the side door where the workbench ends, is the chair I\u2019d seen him working on last week. I recognize the legs on it, the design he had painstakingly routed on all four of them. He must have finished it this week and I wonder if he made it on order or if he did it for himself. It\u2019s exquisite, and every time I see something he\u2019s made, I hate him a little more for it. My jealousy is a living thing. Shifting, changing, growing. Like my rage and my mother\u2019s regret.</p><p>I run my hands along the arc of the backrest and kneel down to examine the legs. The armrests are wide and curved to match the lines of the back. I wonder if he\u2019s started another one yet, because it should be part of a matching set. My fingers are still tracing their way down the other side, and before I\u2019ve thought better of it, I slide into the seat, and that\u2019s when the perfection of it strikes me. Because this chair should not be comfortable, but I may never want to leave it. My arms are resting on the sides and I lean back and look up to find Josh watching me. It\u2019s unnerving the way he\u2019s staring, no matter how much I may have gotten used to him and I kind of wish he wasn\u2019t so damn good-looking because it makes it hard to look away.</p><p>The expression on his face is almost anxious but there\u2019s something like mischief in it as well. It\u2019s the same look Clay had when he showed me the picture he\u2019d drawn of me. He\u2019s waiting for a reaction, for approval. I look down at the chair I\u2019m sitting in and back up at him, but he\u2019s not looking at me anymore. He\u2019s gone back to adjusting the saw as if everything has returned to the way it should be and that\u2019s when it hits me. That he had done all of this on purpose. He made sure there was no place for me to sit on the counter so I\u2019d be forced to notice it. Because the chair was meant for me.</p><p>The realization is enough to propel my ass straight up and out of that chair. He looks up, jarred by the sudden movement and for a moment we just stare at one other. I must look like a crazed animal, ready to bolt like the first night I walked in here. I can say what I\u2019m thinking but I don\u2019t need to. He already knows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a chair.\u201d He\u2019s talking me down off a ledge.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it.\u201d I try to make it sound like he\u2019s the unreasonable one for giving it to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take it. Give it to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need someplace to sit. I\u2019m tired of you moving everything around and getting in my way whenever I\u2019m working. Now you have a place to sit. So sit.\u201d He motions me down into the chair with a tilt of his head and I sit and it feels more perfect than it did a few moments ago. He leans over me and places his hands on top of mine on the armrests and looks straight into my eyes, which flays me a little bit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chair. Stop overanalyzing it. I\u2019m not selling it and I\u2019m not giving it to someone else. I made it for you. It\u2019s yours.\u201d He pulls away and stands up straight. When his hands are gone from mine, I realize that it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever really touched me, and I wish he\u2019d put them back. \u201cBesides, it already has your name on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook underneath. I was going to put it on the back where you could actually see it but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>I slide down out of the chair and get as low as I can to the ground so I can twist my head around and see what he\u2019s talking about. And I do and it\u2019s unmistakable. There, on the underside of the seat, is an engraving of the sun.</p><p>I know at that moment what he\u2019s given me and it\u2019s not a chair. It\u2019s an invitation, a welcome, the knowledge that I am accepted here. He hasn\u2019t given me a place to sit. He\u2019s given me a place to belong.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Nastya</p><p>It amazes me how people are so afraid of what can happen in the dark, but they don\u2019t give a second thought about their safety during the day; as if the sun offers some sort of ultimate protection from all the evil in the world. It doesn\u2019t. All it does is whisper to you, lulling you with its warmth before it shoves you face down into the dirt. Daylight won\u2019t protect you from anything. Bad things happen all the time; they don\u2019t wait until after dinner.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been to Josh\u2019s house during the day. It looks different in the afternoon. I wouldn\u2019t be here now if my car battery hadn\u2019t been unjumpably dead when I left school today. I live close enough to the campus to walk, but I don\u2019t walk anywhere in the afternoon. Mornings I can deal with, but there\u2019s a period of hours in the afternoon when I hate being outside. Even nighttime doesn\u2019t bother me so much. The dark doesn\u2019t breed fear in me the way the daytime does. The afternoon sun has a way of following me, burning memories onto my back. Josh always offers me rides home from his house. He thinks it should make me nervous, running alone at night, and it does. I\u2019m not stupid enough to think I\u2019m ever safe outside, anywhere, at any time of day. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m more nervous during the daytime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So now I\u2019m here, on Josh Bennett\u2019s couch at 3:15 in the afternoon, watching General Hospital. Josh spent the last commercial break patiently filling me in on as much of the past decade\u2019s worth of storylines as he could in three and a half minutes while I ate as many Twizzlers as I could. When the commercials were over, he stopped abruptly and told me he\u2019d tell me the rest during the next break. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spent much time actually watching the television. Mostly I\u2019ve been looking at Josh and trying to figure out who the hell he is. I\u2019ve developed a theory that, perhaps, Josh is really twins and there are two of him, because I\u2019m convinced, from day to day, that he\u2019s not the same person. It\u2019s like that Christian Bale movie where the twin brothers share the same life and you never know which one you\u2019re with. That\u2019s how I feel with him.</p><p>I crumple up the empty cellophane wrapper and walk into the kitchen. \u201cWhere\u2019s your trash?\u201d With as much time as I spend at this house, I never actually come inside. We pretty much live in the garage.</p><p>\u201cUnder the sink,\u201d he says, not looking away from the TV. \u201cDo you ever eat anything other than sugar?\u201d</p><p>I mentally tally what I\u2019ve eaten today: two protein bars, two bags of peanut M&amp;Ms (but they were the small bags so it\u2019s really like eating only one), plus the recently consumed Twizzlers. \u201cSometimes,\u201d I answer. Really, I wouldn\u2019t even bother with the protein bars if I didn\u2019t need them after working out. When I lived with my parents, we actually sat down and ate meals, real ones, like the way we eat at Drew\u2019s on Sundays. Margot doesn\u2019t cook, plus we always have to eat early so she can get to work and I\u2019m usually not in the mood. Maybe when I\u2019m eighty I\u2019ll like eating dinner at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, but now, not so much.</p> <p>I sit back down on the couch next to him and we watch the rest of the show. By four o\u2019clock I know more than I ever cared to know about Quartermaines and Spencers. I shouldn\u2019t mock. While I was stuck recovering all those months, I watched my share of bad soap operas. And bad game shows. And bad talk shows. I was an expert in all things daytime television. I just didn\u2019t watch General Hospital. After today, I know enough that I can pretend like I did.</p><p>When it\u2019s over, we climb into Josh\u2019s truck so he can take me to buy a car battery. We have to stop back at the school parking lot on the way, because I know the make and model of my car but that\u2019s the extent of my knowledge. Apparently that\u2019s not enough information to tell me what kind of battery I need, so we have to detour back to campus. Josh looks at my car, writes something down and then takes my keys and pops the hood. I\u2019m still holding onto my backpack with all my books, so I jump out to throw it in my car so I won\u2019t have to keep carrying it. As soon as I do, I wish I wasn\u2019t so lazy, because that\u2019s when I see Tierney Lowell walking towards us in the parking lot. She\u2019s not the only one. There are quite a few students exiting the building and I realize that it\u2019s just after four and most of the practices and club meetings are finishing up. She\u2019s the one I notice though, because for some reason she seems to hate me. OK, most of the girls don\u2019t like me and I\u2019m an easy target because of the clothes. I get that. But she shoots daggers at me like she just caught me feeding chocolate to her dog. Normally, that\u2019s cool, because it\u2019s all easily ignorable and I can avoid her without much effort. However, right now, I\u2019m jumping out of Josh Bennett\u2019s truck and he\u2019s standing next to my car and in a minute we\u2019ll be leaving together and that\u2019s an act of exhibitionism I wasn\u2019t planning to put on just yet.</p><p>We get back in the truck immediately, with the shared, unspoken need to get out of there as quickly as possible. Once we\u2019ve driven away, I look out the window, scanning the cars around us. Josh\u2019s windows are tinted, but I still won\u2019t take any chances. When I feel safe enough that we\u2019re not being watched, I ask the question I\u2019ve been holding onto since we left his house.</p><p>\u201cYou watch General Hospital?\u201d I don\u2019t really need confirmation. I know for a fact that he watches it. He doesn\u2019t look at me but I see his lips turn up in the half-smile he gets when he\u2019s embarrassed about something, which is really just a real smile he\u2019s trying to drown.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. OK, he did answer my question, but what I really wanted to know was why or how or something that will explain it to me because come on. But if there\u2019s anything more surprising to me than the newfound knowledge that he\u2019s a closet soap opera addict, it\u2019s the fact that he actually keeps talking and offers me an explanation; one I didn\u2019t have to ask for. \u201cMy mom used to watch it. Religiously. Never missed an episode. My dad and I made fun of her all the time. When she died, I kept thinking that maybe she\u2019d come back, and when she did, I wanted to be able to tell her everything that had happened so she wouldn\u2019t have missed anything. So I watched it. Every day. After a while I realized she wasn\u2019t coming back but I was pot vested by that point. I just never stopped.\u201d He shrugs like he\u2019s accepted this fact; only I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the fact that his mother isn\u2019t coming back or that he watches General Hospital that he\u2019s accepting. Maybe he\u2019s not sure either.</p> <p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was eight which I guess is old enough to get it. I just didn\u2019t really want to... I don\u2019t know... My dad tried to make it make sense for me, but there really isn\u2019t a way to explain how a person you\u2019ve seen every day of your life just isn\u2019t anymore. Someone just hit delete and she\u2019s gone. I had a hard time grasping that I could come home one night and find that the person who was laughing and hugging me that morning just stopped existing. I didn\u2019t believe it was possible. I didn\u2019t want to believe it was possible... so, yeah, General Hospital.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look away from him once while he was telling that story. It\u2019s the first real thing he\u2019s ever told me. It makes me feel ashamed because I\u2019ve never told him anything real. Not even my name.</p><p>He turns and looks at me for a second with what is almost a look of apology on his face. Resignation, maybe? Then he shifts his attention back to the road and we pull into the mall parking lot a minute later. I have one of Josh Bennett\u2019s secrets now. He gave it to me. I wish I could give it back.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Josh</p> <p>Whenever someone knocks on my door, there\u2019s a part of me that still kind of expects them to be carrying some sort of food. In the days and weeks after my mom and my sister died, I got a crash course in grieving. I learned the way it works; some of it was about how I was expected to react, but most of it was about how other people were expected to react. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a written set of rules, but there might as well be, because everyone seems to do the same things. A lot of it has to do with food. My grandmother explained the psychology of this to me at one point but I didn\u2019t really listen because I didn\u2019t really care. People must know that just because you need to eat doesn\u2019t mean you want them coming by your house non-stop, using casserole dishes and coffee cakes as an excuse to eavesdrop on your grief.</p><p>I was indoctrinated into all of the pointless condolence rituals at age eight and I came to realize that they never really change. I could always count on an onslaught of food and sympathy that I had no use for.</p><p>Sometimes people will try to tell you some funny thing they remember, which usually isn\u2019t funny at all, just sad. Then you stare at each other uncomfortably until they finally get up to leave, and you thank them for coming, even though they just made you feel worse.</p><p>Then you get the people who just want an excuse to come by to see how ripped up your face looks from crying, see if you\u2019ve cracked yet so they can talk about it with the neighbors. Did you see poor Mark Bennett and the boy? What a tragedy. It\u2019s just so sad. Or something equally lame. But they brought you some food, so they\u2019re entitled.</p><p>Ten minutes later the doorbell rings again and we start all over. It goes on like this for days. Too many apologies and a crapload of food. Mostly lasagna.</p><p>Maybe some people find comfort in obligatory words and reheatable food; my dad and I just weren\u2019t those people. We thanked everybody anyway. Took their foil pans and condolences. Then we threw it all away and ordered pizza. I wonder if there is a person on Earth who is consoled by a casserole.</p><p>Then I think about Leigh, and I know that, sometimes, someone shows up at your door offering something better than words and food. Sometimes, somebody brings you something you really need, and it\u2019s not a f**king coffee cake.</p><p>The first time I met Leigh, she was standing on my front porch, holding the tell-tale foil-covered dish. My grandmother had died two days earlier and at that point I had about six of them on my counter and a couple more in the refrigerator. I was fifteen, and I think I visibly exhaled with disgust at the sight of it. But not at the sight of her. She was wearing a really short green sundress and she was seriously hot. Those are the only real details I recall. I recognized her from school, but she was two grades ahead of me and we never spoke. I didn\u2019t even know her name until that day.</p> <p>I took the dish from her, which was actually from her mom who knew my grandmother. I invited her in because I had learned that that\u2019s what you were supposed to do. My grandfather wasn\u2019t home so I did the grieving host thing. We went through the required conversation, making sure to hit all the main points and platitudes. After a few minutes of standing in the kitchen, vying for the title of most uncomfortable, she asked if anyone was home and if I wanted to go into my bedroom. I think it was her way of saying she was sorry and my way of saying thanks for the casserole.</p><p>That was the first time Leigh came over. But it wasn\u2019t the last. We never dated. Never hung out. She\u2019d come over and sneak into my room at night or we\u2019d end up in her car somewhere, but that was the extent of our involvement and it\u2019s been the extent for close to three years now. Even now that she\u2019s at college, we manage to keep up a regular schedule. Sometimes we talk but never about anything real.</p><p>Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it is wrong. Wrong or not, I don\u2019t feel bad about it. I was up to four deaths by the time she showed up, with only one more to go. I needed one normal thing and Leigh gave me that and it didn\u2019t cost me any emotions or feelings or commitment. I didn\u2019t have to love her. I like her, though I\u2019m not sure if that would have been a deal-breaker, either. I don\u2019t even think it mattered to her if I cared. We still employ a policy of equal-opportunity using, no questions asked. She\u2019s sweet and laidback and good-looking as hell. But if she walked away tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t miss her. People disappear all the time. I might not even notice.</p><p>It\u2019s not a coffee cake Nastya\u2019s carrying when she walks into my garage just after eight o\u2019clock. Though if it was, I\u2019m sure it would have been homemade, covered with cinnamon and unbelievably awesome. She is carrying two plastic grocery bags. She walks past me without a word and reaches up with one hand to awkwardly open the door to the inside of the house without letting go of the bag.</p><p>\u201cSunshine?\u201d She doesn\u2019t respond, so I follow her in and find her opening the freezer and shoving no fewer than four half-gallon containers of ice cream into it. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d she snaps.</p><p>\u201cYou get knocked up?\u201d</p><p>She whirls around on me. \u201cWhat?\u201d Guess not. I hold my hands up, palms out in surrender. She\u2019s obviously not in the mood.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just,\u201d I motion toward the open freezer, her hand still inside on one of the containers, \u201ca lot of ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, because I\u2019d have to be pregnant to want ice cream. Next thing you\u2019ll be saying that I must have my period because that\u2019s the only reason girls have for getting pissed, but of course since you\u2019re a guy, you won\u2019t actually say period, but something prickish like on the rag.\u201d She slams the freezer door shut. Now might be the moment to swear profusely that I had no intention of bringing up her period in any manner, much less one containing the word rag, but I feel safer keeping my mouth shut right about now and letting her play this out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With any other girl I could probably pull out the classic guy fail-safe of walking over and wrapping my arms around her and letting her put her head on my shoulder. It\u2019s cheap, but it works. Drew swears by it. But I\u2019m afraid that in this particular instance it would result in one of two things: a string of innovative new expletives or her knee in my balls. My money\u2019s on the knee.</p><p>\u201cI like ice cream. You never have any. Bad things happen when I go too long without ice cream,\u201d she says, sounding slightly calmer.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you got enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should open one of those now,\u201d I suggest.</p><p>So that\u2019s what we do. Except that we don\u2019t open one, we open all four of them and eat straight out of the containers at the crap coffee table in front of my couch. I keep this one in front of the couch because it\u2019s shit and I don\u2019t care what happens to it. I don\u2019t have to worry about coasters or Drew putting his shoes on it. I figure I\u2019ll keep it here until he leaves for college, or some girl finally kills him.</p><p>Nastya doesn\u2019t eat from the middle of the container like a normal person. A normal person who doesn\u2019t eat ice cream out of a bowl, that is. She waits until it starts melting and scrapes away the melted part from around the edge of the container. According to her, half-melted ice cream tastes better than fully-frozen ice cream. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s right because she makes me eat the more frozen stuff from the center and threatens me if I try to eat from the edges. We put a pretty big dent in every one of those containers and she\u2019s definitely more Sunshine and less Nasty afterward. I make a mental note for the next time she gets pissy that, in lieu of mood stabilizers, ice cream will do the trick.</p><p>We\u2019re both on a sugar high after all the ice cream and we end up back in the garage because I have a list of projects to finish. I figure she\u2019s going to go running because that\u2019s usually her M.O. when she\u2019s carb-loaded, but she doesn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cGive me something to do,\u201d she says, with just the barest hint of wariness.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d I ask, assessing her.</p><p>\u201cNothing with power tools or anything like that. Something I can do with my right hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to sand?\u201d I offer. \u201cIt sucks, but\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sand. Just show me what to do.\u201d</p><p>I grab a sheet of sandpaper and demonstrate how to attach it to the sanding block.</p><p>\u201cWe have to sand with the grain on this.\u201d I pick up her hands to show her how much pressure to use and they\u2019re so soft that I hate to put sandpaper anywhere near them.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I know when it\u2019s done,\u201d she asks, starting to work.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s rule was always that when you think you\u2019re done, you\u2019re probably halfway there.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head and looks at me like I\u2019m useless. \u201cSo, how do I know when it\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cJust show it to me when you think it\u2019s ready. You\u2019ll start to know after you\u2019ve done it a few times.\u201d</p><p>She keeps her eyes on me for just a second longer than she needs to before turning back to the wood. I know the questions are there. I saw them in her eyes as soon as I mentioned my father. How? When? What happened? But she doesn\u2019t ask. She just keeps sanding and I won\u2019t stop her. I despise sanding.</p><p>It\u2019s after midnight by the time we call it quits. I don\u2019t know how her hands even held up this long. She sanded the hell out of everything I gave her. I never did ask her what was wrong earlier.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Nastya</p> <p>When I get to his house at 7:40, Josh is in his driveway, leaning against the side of his truck. As soon as he sees me, he unlocks the doors and comes around to open mine.</p><p>\u201cAbout time, Sunshine,\u201d he says. \u201cI was about to give up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a field trip planned,\u201d I reply once I\u2019ve settled into the truck and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cI have to get to Home Depot before they close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait for me.\u201d He really didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like I was going to be sad to miss the weekly hardware store stock-up.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I knew you\u2019d be showing up sooner or later and my garage would be closed and you\u2019d feel abandoned and then I\u2019d feel guilty and I hate feeling guilty. So it was just easier to wait.\u201d One side of his mouth turns up.</p><p>\u201cYour life is so hard,\u201d I say dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou are the only person who would even think to say something like that to me.\u201d He sounds weirdly pleased.</p><p>\u201cForce field hasn\u2019t kept me out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I give him a pointed look because I\u2019m sure he can figure it out. He keeps staring at me, so finally I shrug and then throw in a sigh so he knows that I\u2019m exasperated at having to explain this to him.</p><p>\u201cAt school, no one comes near you. When I first saw you on the bench in the courtyard, I wondered if you were surrounded by some sort of force field. I kind of wanted to get one for myself. You can hide in plain sight. It\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForce field,\u201d he repeats, somewhat amused. \u201cMight as well be. People used to call it the dead zone,\u201d he adds, but he doesn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cMaybe you have special powers.\u201d I assume he\u2019s commenting on my ability to breach his force field, but I don\u2019t respond.</p><p>I don\u2019t have any special powers. I\u2019m certain of that, because I\u2019ve spent a lot of time lamenting my lack of them. I do have an uncanny capacity for bitterness and misdirected rage but I don\u2019t think that counts. I feel a little misled. I spent crapload of time over the past couple years reading books and watching movies, and in all of them, when you die and they bring you back to life, supernatural abilities are just part of the deal. Sorry you didn\u2019t win the grand prize of eternal peace, but you\u2019re not walking away empty handed! You may come back broken and wrong, but at least you get some cosmic consolation prize, like the ability to read minds or speak to the dead or smell lies. Something cool like that. I can\u2019t even manipulate the elements.</p><p>Of course if I were to take the books at their word, I\u2019d also have to believe that all teenage boys go around calling girls baby, because apparently that\u2019s the express train to romance. He was an ass**le a minute ago but then he drops the baby on you and it\u2019s all over. Uncontrollable swooning and relinquishment of all self-respect activated. Ooooh, he called me baby. My panties are wet and I luuuuuuuv him. Do real boys actually call girls baby? I don\u2019t have enough experience to know. I do know that if a guy ever called me baby, I\u2019d probably laugh in his face. Or choke him.</p><p>I follow Josh down another aisle. He\u2019s almost as comfortable here as he is in his garage. It\u2019s like he\u2019s being pulled around by an invisible string that leads him to everything he\u2019s looking for. He\u2019s on autopilot, not even thinking. He must spend half his life in this store.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the wood next time,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like dealing with it tonight. Plus, I think we\u2019re going to have to hit the lumber yard for what I need anyway.\u201d The we\u2019re part of that sentence sticks in my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d I ask, glancing down the aisle to make sure it\u2019s empty before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI have a job for one of the teachers at school. Then I have two Adirondack chairs to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sell everything you build?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it I give away. Some of it I sell. It\u2019s how I pay for the wood and the tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you haven\u2019t applied to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he says, putting two more cans of finish in the cart.</p><p>\u201cI heard Mrs. Leighton talking to you. You haven\u2019t applied yet. You don\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never really got into the whole school thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your parents want you to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We never really got that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the same thing I\u2019m doing now. Just more of it.\u201d</p><p>I get that. I used to think the exact same way, but he can actually do it.</p><p>\u201cYou can afford that?\u201d I ask. We\u2019re in front of a display of little drawers full of every size screw you can imagine and he\u2019s pulling them out without even looking.</p><p>\u201cI can afford just about anything I\u2019m willing to pay for.\u201d I\u2019m not sure exactly what he means by that, but the way he says it is bitter, and if there\u2019s something that makes him sound that way, I don\u2019t want to get into it.</p><p>We get up to the self-checkout and I start taking things out of the cart and handing them to him one at a time as he runs them over the scanner. It strikes me how utterly domestic this all seems. He could have come without me because I really haven\u2019t served any purpose here at all. I could have used the time to run which is probably what I should have been doing. It\u2019s what I would have done if I had shown up at his house and he wasn\u2019t there. I would have run myself into exhaustion. He\u2019s right about one thing and I wonder if he knew just how right he was and if that\u2019s why he waited. If I had gotten to his house and seen that closed garage, I would have felt abandoned and I may never have gone back.</p><p>When we get back to his house just after nine o\u2019clock, I help him carry the bags into the garage and watch him put everything away. He is all grace and fluid in this place; there isn\u2019t one wasted movement. Everything he does has purpose. I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable about watching. He watches me, too. We have an unspoken agreement. I let him watch me. He lets me watch him. We never call each other on it. It\u2019s a gift we give one another. No strings, no expectations, no reading between the lines. We\u2019re like mysteries to one another. Maybe if I can solve him and he can solve me, we can explain each other. Maybe that\u2019s what I need. Someone to explain me.</p><p>When everything has been put away, he closes the garage door and goes into the house, waiting for me to follow before he shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cDid you eat?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, before I came over. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I would have heated you up something if you were hungry. So, you actually cooked tonight?\u201d He regards me skeptically.</p><p>I snort. Because snorting is attractive. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you eat for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to ask if you\u2019re serious, do I? I don\u2019t know how you exercise so much with the way you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter has protein in it,\u201d I say, full of false indignation. \u201cBesides, I was messing with the recipe. I had to eat a bunch of them to see when I got it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d he asks, pulling a bottle of water out of the refrigerator and drinking half of it before handing it to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll bring you some and you can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat your cookies, but you let me feed you real food first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to cook for me?\u201d I almost choke on the water before passing the bottle back.</p><p>\u201cI cook anyway. What\u2019s the difference if you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He smiles as I walk around the counter and pick up the mp3 player that\u2019s sitting next to the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you listening to?\u201d I ask, turning it on.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I took it out for you. It just sits here. I thought you might want to use it when you run.\u201d</p><p>Oh. I flip it off without looking and put it back down. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t need one, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come? You\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever seen running without music. Doesn\u2019t it get boring?\u201d he asks. It\u2019s a valid question, but it doesn\u2019t get boring. It\u2019s never quiet enough to get boring and I certainly don\u2019t plan to stick shit in my ears like a written invitation for someone to jump me. I shrug, pushing it back further on the counter and turning away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot really. I heard you and my aunt had a nice chat,\u201d I say sarcastically, moving to the sofa. I kick my shoes off and tuck my feel underneath me.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if she\u2019d mention that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. Between the two of us we do a lot of shrugging. Maybe that\u2019s why I finally started talking to him. My shoulders just got tired.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d he asks, sinking down next to me.</p><p>\u201cShe said she wasn\u2019t stupid and that I shouldn\u2019t treat her like she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you not supposed to be here right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s okay. She just expects me to let her know where I am from now on. As long as I text her it\u2019s fine.\u201d It\u2019s true. Margot did sit me down and lecture me. She made sure I felt the full measure of my lack of consideration for her and that I understood that if anything happened to me, she would be the one dealing with the wrath of my mother; a five-foot three woman who could strike fear in a berserker. But God bless Margot, because she wasn\u2019t going to force me into a corner with rules and ultimatums, either, which was good, because I would have ignored them. Not because I wanted to rebel against her or because I didn\u2019t want anyone telling me what to do, but because I wasn\u2019t going to give up sitting in that garage.</p><p>\u201cLook Em,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not na\u00efve. I was young, too. I\u2019m thirty-two years old and I still have a list of stories I will never tell my mother, and if Charlotte was my mother, that list would be even longer, so believe me, I understand. But you also need to understand that you are my responsibility and beyond that I love you.\u201d I think I cringed at that part but she ignored me and kept going. \u201cYou\u2019ll be eighteen years old soon and I know exactly how futile it will be to forbid you to do anything, but I need you to respect me enough to let me know where you are and who you\u2019re with and what you\u2019re doing. If you do, we\u2019ll be fine. If you don\u2019t, I will not hesitate to throw you under the bus with your mother.\u201d</p> <p>She made sure to tack on that she knew I was a smart girl and that smart girls often do the stupidest things and then she hugged me and told me I could tell her anything and she wouldn\u2019t judge me. I think it was her version of a sex talk.</p><p>I hugged her back because it was my only way to say thank you to her for letting me keep him without a fight. She wasn\u2019t going to make it difficult for me to see him and I desperately needed something in my life that wasn\u2019t difficult.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you learn to cook?\u201d The legs are swinging from my kitchen counter, not my workbench, tonight. She eats here all the time now. Sometimes she helps. Sometimes she watches. She always talks.</p><p>I reach up and open the cabinet over the refrigerator where my mother stored all of her cookbooks. She looks up at the overfilled shelf. I really only use a few of the ones in the front, but the cabinet goes pretty far back and the books are in there three rows deep.</p> <p>\u201cYou learned to cook by reading cookbooks?\u201d She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that how most people do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot most seventeen year-old boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many seventeen year-old boys learn to cook at all.\u201d</p><p>No response to this one. I didn\u2019t say it to make her feel bad, but I think she does, because that quiet sets in. The quiet everyone thinks they should fill but they can\u2019t because they\u2019re busy trying to figure out what to say. So while they sit and think about it, the silence stretches out until there aren\u2019t any words left that wouldn\u2019t make everything more uncomfortable. All the ok things to say dissolved in the silence while they were busy thinking.</p><p>\u201cIf it sucks, can we order pizza?\u201d she asks. Silence can\u2019t win against her. It doesn\u2019t intimidate her at all. When you spend over a year not talking to another living person, I guess you learn to manipulate the voids.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t suck,\u201d I respond.</p><p>\u201cConfident, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she mocks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been cooking a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years, give or take.\u201d It was right around the time when my grandmother got too sick to do it anymore. About the same time I had to learn to use the washing machine and empty the vacuum cleaner.</p><p>\u201cSince you were fourteen? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got tired of eating dry cereal out of the box for dinner every night, so one day I pulled out the books and started reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t cook for shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bake.\u201d Damn can she bake. She brought those peanut butter cookies over last week covered in sugar with a criss-cross pattern across the top. As soon as I looked at them, I remembered that my mother used to make them, too, but I had completely forgotten. And it made me wonder how many other things about her I had forgotten.</p><p>\u201cNot the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn to cook if you wanted to. I\u2019ll even loan you a cookbook if you want,\u201d I say half-sarcastically. She doesn\u2019t seem too enthusiastic about that. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you. We can\u2019t all be awesome at everything like Josh Bennett.\u201d She makes me sound like a renowned jackass.</p><p>\u201cYou know how many meals awesome Josh Bennett effed up in the beginning?\u201d Now I\u2019m making myself sound like a renowned jackass.</p><p>\u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t quit eating cereal for the first few months. And even then, my grandfather and I ate a lot of dry, overcooked food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have eaten at Drew\u2019s house every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if I wanted to put up with Drew every night.\u201d I\u2019m not that much of a glutton for punishment, but she\u2019s right; I was always invited.</p><p>\u201cHe is your best friend. Not that I have any clue how that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in Little League together. When everybody started dying and everybody else started ignoring me, he didn\u2019t. He just kept coming back and coming back, even when I tried to get rid of him. Eventually I realized he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like Drew.\u201d</p><p>Sounds like you, too, Sunshine.</p><p>\u201cLittle league?\u201d she asks, smirking.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t last,\u201d I say. \u201cOnce I realized that I was more interested in figuring out how to make a bat than how to swing one, I quit.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s watching me chop vegetables, but I know she won\u2019t offer to help with anything involving hands and sharp knives.</p><p>\u201cI messed up everything I baked in the beginning, too,\u201d she tells me, switching back to our last conversation. I find that hard to believe. I imagine she came out of the birth canal holding a cupcake and a spatula.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fifteen.\u201d She looks down at her left hand, turning it over and staring. I assume she\u2019s done talking, because I\u2019m used to being answered with a bare minimum of information from her. Intentionally vague is about as good as it usually gets, but she surprises me and keeps going. \u201cMy hand got messed up and I had to do a lot of physical therapy. They suggested that I knead bread dough to build strength back. At some point, I figured that if I was going to spend so much time kneading the dough, I might as well bake the bread.\u201d She coughs out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstatement.\u201d She smiles unguardedly, and it\u2019s at war with everything I\u2019m used to from her. \u201cThe first time, I don\u2019t think it rose at all. It was just this flat, hard, disk-shaped thing. My dad ate it anyway and said it wasn\u2019t that bad. You should have seen his face trying to chew it. I don\u2019t know how he did it.\u201d She hasn\u2019t stopped smiling while she tells me this. I\u2019m watching the memory play across her face and I realize that I\u2019ve completely stopped chopping the vegetables and I\u2019m just staring at her. I force myself to start chopping again before she notices. \u201cI tried again and again and again. It was always one issue or another. I just couldn\u2019t get it right. It pissed the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you finally give up?\u201d I ask, and she looks at me as if the thought is outrageous.</p><p>\u201cThere was no way I was being brought down by a stupid loaf of bread. I went through so much flour. My mom had to start buying yeast in bulk. Once, I got so pissed, I threw the dough at the ceiling. I thought my mom was going to ban me from the kitchen when she found me on a step ladder, trying to clean it off with a bench scraper. But I finally did it. It took months, but I eventually ended up with a decent loaf of bread.\u201d She shrugs, looking back down at her palm and folding her fingers over. \u201cHand got stronger, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still bake it? Bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d She snorts as if this is the most absurd question I could ever ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass. Takes too much time and it\u2019s a bitch to get it to work with the humidity here. I just had to know that if I wanted to, I could. I like the stuff that\u2019s full of sugar better anyway.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her chin toward the cutting board in front of me. \u201cI think you chopped those into submission.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at the red peppers I\u2019ve annihilated while listening to her talk.</p><p>\u201cNot my fault that you\u2019re distractingly pretty.\u201d I have to take a minute to confirm to the pissed off part of my brain that still works that, yes, in fact, I did just say that. And I don\u2019t know if distractingly is even a word. If it is, it\u2019s a stupid one. Like me. Ignoring it and pretending it never happened seems like the best possible plan at the moment and I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll go with it, but she does the next best thing.</p><p>\u201cDrew says I\u2019m sexy as f**k,\u201d she shrugs blandly and lets me off the hook.</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d I smile, not meeting her eyes as I scrape together what\u2019s left of the red peppers. I pour oil into the bottom of a saut\u00e9 pan and line up the vegetables on the counter. \u201cTurn the front burner on to 8.\u201d I point at the stove and she reaches over to do it just as the front door opens, which shuts us both up.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s go\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d Drew stops mid-sentence when he sees Nastya. I don\u2019t know if the shock registering on his face is from the fact that she\u2019s here, sitting on the counter like she owns the place, or the fact that she\u2019s almost unrecognizable to him. She\u2019s wearing white denim shorts and a pink t-shirt and the make-up is long gone from her face, which you can actually see because her hair is pulled back and braided. She looks younger, like she always does like this, and running along her hairline, you can see the jagged scar that she\u2019s constantly trying to cover up. I\u2019m used to this Nastya, but I know Drew\u2019s never seen her looking even remotely like a real girl, and I\u2019ve never once mentioned it to him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if not telling him was a betrayal. If it was, I should feel guilty and there\u2019s a part of me that does. But I feel justified, too. Even if it is selfish. He can be pissed if he wants. It would still be worth it.</p><p>Nastya slides down from the counter and I think she\u2019s going to leave me to deal with explanations, but she doesn\u2019t. She steps across the kitchen, opens the upper cabinet where I keep the dishes, and pulls out another dinner plate. Then she grabs an extra set of silverware from the drawer and places them on the table. Drew walks to the table, pulls out a chair and lowers himself into it. He hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off her yet. Like he\u2019s trying to work out the truth of her. It\u2019s the optical illusion again. My eyes have adjusted to it, but he\u2019s still trying to find the focus.</p><p>\u201cSo, want to introduce me to your girlfriend?\u201d he asks, looking directly at me now. There\u2019s more curiosity than malice in the question. He might also be just a little bit impressed.</p><p>\u201cNot my girlfriend.\u201d I hand Nastya the trivets to put on the table with one hand and keep stirring with the other. I don\u2019t look at her face on purpose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d he reaches out and pulls Nastya onto his lap as she places the trivets on the table, \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cHow do you know there\u2019s not a God?\u201d Tierney Lowell spits out at Drew, twenty minutes in to a debate that\u2019s been raging since the fifth period bell rang. It started with a discussion about a short story we\u2019d read last week and somehow devolved into a full-scale back and forth on the existence of God.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know there is one?\u201d Drew retorts. He isn\u2019t even trying. This is laziness, or just apathy. I\u2019ve seen him practicing for debate, and this is nothing for him. He\u2019s just baiting Tierney for fun.</p><p>\u201cI never said I knew. Faith isn\u2019t about knowledge. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called faith, jackass. Thus, the expression, leap of faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Lowell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoron, mule, idiot, fool, Drew.\u201d Tierney tosses out. It\u2019s Ms. McAllister\u2019s rule. You use an unacceptable word, you have to come up with five to replace it. She lets the Drew part slide.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you turn all religious?\u201d Drew doesn\u2019t miss a beat. Everyone is paying attention, heads whipping back and forth like the audience at a tennis match. Immoral people debating the existence of God is always a crowd pleaser. Especially with palpable sexual tension thrown in. The only other sound in the room is the periodic slam of the stapler Sunshine is using in the corner. She\u2019s been collating papers since class started. Her back is turned but I can almost see her listening.</p> <p>\u201cI hate religion. I believe in God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieving in God is for weak people.\u201d Drew almost sounds bored, but it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s enjoying this.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a mystery why you don\u2019t.\u201d She leans back in her chair but Drew doesn\u2019t take the bait.</p><p>\u201cPeople believe in God because they don\u2019t believe in themselves. They need something else to depend on or to blame instead of taking responsibility for their own shit\u200c\u2014\u200ccrap, excrement, waste, mistakes, faults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rich coming from a person who takes responsibility for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never denied my actions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich makes you such a moral paragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorals?\u201d Drew chokes out the word which probably burns on his tongue. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the pot smoker calling the kettle black?\u201d Kevin Leonard and the other stoners in the room think this is the greatest thing they\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cDon\u2019t lecture me T. I take responsibility for everything I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make accusations, back it up, give me some support, otherwise your arguments mean nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in debate, Drew.\u201d She doesn\u2019t look cowed by him. She looks betrayed.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well be. Same rules. You want to say something, support it. Otherwise, don\u2019t throw it out there because you just make your argument weak. Kind of like people who believe in God.\u201d</p><p>Ms. McAllister changes the subject and effectively ends the discussion. It\u2019s surprising that she let it go on as long as she did. The conversation might be over but the glaring between Drew and Tierney continues until the end of class, and I wonder if they might start ripping each other\u2019s clothes off right here.</p><p>Nastya</p> <p>\u201cGo sit. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d Josh nudges me away from the sink after we\u2019ve cleared the dishes from dinner. I eat here more often than not now. It\u2019s the only time I ever consume an actual meal. He makes me real food and I keep him in desserts.</p><p>\u201cYou cooked. I can wash the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d He pulls the sponge out of my hands and turns off the tap while I go clear off the rest of the table and dump the dishes in the sink. We\u2019ve fallen into an oddly domestic pattern and it\u2019s kind of pathetic when you stop to think about why.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wash the dishes?\u201d I ask, disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you suck at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at it?\u201d Who sucks at washing dishes? It\u2019s not brain surgery. It\u2019s cleaning the food off of a pan.</p><p>\u201cYes. How can you not know this? I have to rewash the dishes every night after you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not.\u201d Does he?</p><p>He looks at me and I know it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re anal-retentive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I like to eat off clean dishes. I have issues,\u201d he deadpans.</p><p>I think of how low I\u2019ve sunk. I don\u2019t even have the ability to clean a dish properly. He cooks, he cleans up the dishes, he builds freaking furniture. I feel useless around here. The dryer buzzes and I figure I can do something.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go fold the clothes.\u201d I turn to head into the laundry room.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. Just sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fold clothes, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not folding my underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s weird.\u201d He reaches across me and pulls open a drawer full of dishtowels with a dripping wet hand. \u201cHere. Dry.\u201d He snaps the towel at my chest, splattering me with water in the process.</p><p>I grab it out of his hands. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just go get a pair of your boxer shorts and dry the dishes with those.\u201d Childishness is not below me.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I wear boxer shorts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hoping.\u201d The alternative is so unappealing.</p><p>He shrugs, handing me a plate. \u201cGo ahead. You\u2019re the one who has to eat off of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes you,\u201d I reply, because muttering under my breath, like a surly teenager, is cool.</p><p>I end up using the towel and Josh is right. He does wash the dishes better than I do. Mostly because I\u2019m lazy when it comes to any kind of cleaning but he doesn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cWhat was with Drew and Tierney today in English?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The God thing? Drew and Tierney always argue. Drew would argue the merits of celibacy if Tierney was against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It just seemed personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew likes to piss her off. He was just messing with her today. He could have argued her into the ground if he wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t. He\u2019ll destroy anyone in debate.\u201d It\u2019s impressive. If he feels like it, he\u2019ll verbally assault someone to the point where they can barely stand when it\u2019s over. He won every round at the tournament we attended a few weeks ago and he didn\u2019t even pull out the full arsenal of charm.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to. She has no chance up against him. It wasn\u2019t even worth his effort.\u201d It\u2019s true. That\u2019s just Drew. He just does it for fun until he gets bored. He\u2019s like a cat batting a lizard around until it\u2019s too maimed to play with anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy does McAllister let it go? It wasn\u2019t even what you were supposed to be discussing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how she gets to know everyone. She can figure you out a lot easier if she just lets you go and listens. Finds out how you think. Learns your strengths and weaknesses.\u201d It\u2019s like recon. I\u2019m impressed. But it\u2019s not the most efficient when you only have two people arguing.</p><p>\u201cNo one else even got involved,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo one else is stupid enough to want to debate the existence of God. It\u2019s an unwinnable argument.\u201d He finishes putting the last of the clean dishes back into the cabinets.</p><p>\u201cOn which side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers definitively. My expression must betray me because he asks, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just surprised. I didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m cursed and everyone around me dies?\u201d he asks unemotionally.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to give him affirmation, but it is what I was thinking.</p><p>\u201cI believe in God, Sunshine. I\u2019ve always believed that God exists,\u201d he says.</p><p>And what he says next isn\u2019t self-pity or angst or melodrama. It\u2019s truth.</p><p>\u201cI just know that he hates me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe what he says should floor me, but it doesn\u2019t even make me blink. Maybe I should jump in immediately and tell him that he shouldn\u2019t think that way. That, of course, God doesn\u2019t hate him. That it\u2019s a ridiculous thing to believe. Except, it\u2019s not. Nothing about it is ridiculous. When you watch every person you love systematically removed from your life until at seventeen years old there is no one left, how can you think anything else? It makes such perfect sense that the only thing that surprises me is that I didn\u2019t think of it myself.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cYou look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Sunshine is already in my garage at eight o\u2019clock, dressed to go to a party with Drew. She hates the parties, but he gets her to go every time.</p><p>Our routine has become, well, routine. We do homework, make dinner and then hang out in the garage. Sometimes she leaves for a while to run before she ends up back here sanding down wood or looking over my shoulder and asking a hundred questions about every single thing I\u2019m doing. She\u2019ll sand down anything and everything but she won\u2019t go near any of the power tools because she doesn\u2019t trust her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t think it works? I may not change them back.\u201d She looks down at the old worn out work boots she\u2019s borrowed from me. They are enormous on her feet and she has them pulled and laced as tightly as possible to hold them on. She walked in earlier in the most torturous black dress imaginable and open-toed shoes. I have too many tools going today, so she only got to stay if she changed the shoes. Part of me hoped she\u2019d choose the leaving option so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep looking at her in that dress and struggling to keep my dick in check, but she didn\u2019t put me out of my misery. Weeks ago, when I finally accepted the fact that she wasn\u2019t going away, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near her. I\u2019m not that self-destructive. But on days when she walks in wearing tight black dresses and my work boots, I wonder how long I can keep that promise.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you won\u2019t come?\u201d she asks. She always asks when she\u2019s going out with Drew. But I won\u2019t subject myself to that, even to be close to her. Drew pulls into the driveway and saves me from having to answer.</p><p>\u201cNice boots. I like it. Maybe I\u2019ll let you keep those on.\u201d</p><p>She flips him off but it means nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou should come,\u201d he says to me. \u201cI can hook you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHook yourself up. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we know.\u201d He looks at Nastya. \u201cI\u2019m good, too. I have my own personal Sunshine to keep me warm.\u201d</p><p>Something in me snaps with that. He goes out with her, he touches her, he says shit no one should be allowed to get away with to her. But he cannot call her Sunshine. I\u2019m nailing a board down over my anger so I don\u2019t blow up. They\u2019ll be out of here in a minute and it\u2019ll be over. I wish they\u2019d get out of here now.</p><p>\u201cCall me Sunshine again, and I will murder you, cocksucker.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know whose head spins faster, mine or Drew\u2019s, but I\u2019m the speechless one in this garage right now. Once I register the words, my shock has to compete with my amusement and I fight the smile because, obviously, she doesn\u2019t like him calling her Sunshine any more than I do.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure when she made the decision to speak to him, but I know it wasn\u2019t at this moment. I may not have figured out much about her but I have picked up on the fact that everything she does is a choice. She considers the repercussions for every action she takes. The girl does not understand the word spontaneous. She plans every breath.</p><p>\u201cYou talked? You talked! She talked!\u201d He looks at me for my reaction but there isn\u2019t one. I\u2019m surprised, but I\u2019m not shocked. I\u2019m still trying to stifle a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If it\u2019s at all possible, I think his eyes get wider.</p><p>\u201cYou f**ker! You knew!\u201d He\u2019s going back and forth between Sunshine and I, unable to decide who to look at. Neither of us is looking at him.</p><p>He\u2019s regaining his composure and I remember myself enough to walk over and close the garage. My house is all the way down at the end of the street, so nobody can really see in, but Drew is being obnoxiously loud right now and we don\u2019t need an audience.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Now he\u2019s pleased with himself but there\u2019s no reason for it. Drew can find a way to make anything his own personal triumph. Obviously his charms are so irresistible that he can make a not-quite-mute girl talk. Or maybe he just thinks he\u2019s figured something out.</p> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he asks, and I\u2019m not sure what he means until he motions between Nastya and I. \u201cYou two? How long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs two nothing. We talk that\u2019s it.\u201d I look across to where she\u2019s leaning against the work bench. She keeps glancing over at me. I can\u2019t tell if she wants me to know something or if there\u2019s something she wants from me. I feel a mixture of relief and resentment. I\u2019m glad to be done keeping this from Drew but I can\u2019t help feeling that I\u2019ve lost something irretrievable and that she\u2019s the one who gave it away without asking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? She hasn\u2019t talked to anyone since she\u2019s been here. Not one word. Except apparently to you. And that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to let you down.\u201d I think I\u2019m the one who\u2019s disappointed. I know that she\u2019s just a little bit less mine than she was a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even have an accent.\u201d He turns his attention back to Nastya.</p> <p>\u201cDisappointed?\u201d Her voice comes out like arsenic-laced honey. It sounds nothing like the one she uses with me.</p><p>\u201cExtremely. I thought it would be hot. I\u2019ve never had someone scream my name with an accent before. I was looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re vile.\u201d There\u2019s more amusement than malice there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting a while to say that to me, haven\u2019t you? Feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as I thought it would.\u201d She scrunches up her nose as she thinks about it and she looks unbearably cute. She\u2019s obviously done because she walks to the back of the garage to hit the button and open the door back up.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Drew calls before she can press it, as if he\u2019s just remembered something monumental. \u201cDid you just call me a cocksucker?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Her eyes light up for him and one side of her mouth quirks into the faintest hint of a smile. \u201cTrue story.\u201d</p><p>The mischief in his eyes matches hers and his smile is a mixture of pride and disbelief and I get why she chose to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the party, Sunshine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Nastya</p><p>The party at Jen Meadows\u2019 house is lame and we know when we get there that we probably won\u2019t stay. It\u2019s a relief, because even though it\u2019s inside, the noise at these things always gets to me. It\u2019s too hard to filter out the sounds and where they\u2019re coming from. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I can relax some indoors with people around, but given a choice, I\u2019d prefer the quiet.</p><p>Drew keeps me attached to his side more diligently than usual. Normally, he drapes his arm over my shoulders as we walk in, in a clich\u00e9d display of ownership, and then once that\u2019s established, I\u2019m released. He never lets me get far and I\u2019m never more than a couple feet from him, but tonight he doesn\u2019t want to let me go at all.</p><p>He keeps looking at me sideways and smiling like we\u2019re coconspirators in something. I should regret what I did, but I don\u2019t. Even though he did spend the whole ride over here trying to get me to tell him why I don\u2019t talk, until I finally explained to him, in vivid detail, the fate that would befall him if he asked again. He didn\u2019t. I think it had something to do with the love he has for his boy parts.</p> <p>His arm snakes around my waist and he backs me against a wall just in time for me to look over his shoulder and see Tierney Lowell walk in the door. Chris Jenkins has a cup in her hand and is talking in her ear before she makes it through the living room.</p><p>Drew slides his hand down my arm and laces his fingers through mine, pulling me towards the stairs in direct view of the rest of the room. I have two choices; I can stop him in front of everyone, which would consist of me standing still and refusing to budge while he tries to lead me up the stairs, or I can go with him. Option A is the one that will draw more attention. Drew and I disappearing upstairs to a bedroom at a party isn\u2019t going to raise any eyebrows. Apparently we\u2019ve been screwing for weeks. It doesn\u2019t bother me. Drew has had every opportunity to try to take advantage of me and he never has. Other than the arm around my shoulders and occasionally holding my hand, he doesn\u2019t touch me at all. No surreptitious feel-copping whatsoever. Drew keeps me around for some reason, but whatever it is, I\u2019m fairly certain it isn\u2019t sex.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want everyone to think we\u2019re together?\u201d I whisper when he pulls me through the door of an empty bedroom and shuts it behind me. He reaches down and turns the lock. The only light is coming in under the door and from a streetlamp outside the window. It\u2019s a guestroom with a bed that\u2019s obviously already been occupied once tonight. The music is still so loud that I don\u2019t have to worry about anyone hearing us but I keep my voice down anyway and Drew follows suit.</p><p>\u201cBecause we should be.\u201d He leans back against the door and closes his eyes. He\u2019s delivering a line but he doesn\u2019t mean a word of it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do together. You do one-offs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make an exception.\u201d He looks me up and down but his heart isn\u2019t in it and I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s bothering.</p><p>\u201cYou could, but if you did, it wouldn\u2019t be for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I kissed you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d probably let you, just to see what all the fuss is about. Then I\u2019d rip your lips off and feed them to you, which would be kind of hard because, you know, you\u2019d have no lips.\u201d</p><p>He nods, not looking at me. \u201cYou\u2019re scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But not because of the lip ripping thing, though that is compelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have a good reason to tank your reputation over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to tank anything. What do you think we\u2019re doing right now? Talking? You don\u2019t even speak, so that limits the options. Everyone downstairs knows I\u2019m screwing you right now.\u201d He pulls out his shirt and rumples his clothing.</p><p>\u201cAm I enjoying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best you\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he says hypnotically, like he\u2019s using Jedi mind tricks on me.</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly. So why not just do what we\u2019re doing anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could call your bluff, you know.\u201d He opens one eye to look at me.</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t.\u201d I might be a little disappointed if I wasn\u2019t so relieved. \u201cYou should at least tell me why. I showed you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I showed you mine, you\u2019d probably rip that off, too.\u201d He won\u2019t give me anything, even though there\u2019s obviously something there to give.</p><p>\u201cSo what was the point of the past couple months if you never had any intention of following through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople think I\u2019m hooking up with you, they won\u2019t expect me to be screwing everything else on two legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what you do?\u201d I never really bought the whole of his image, at least not to assume that it was all of him. But he was the one selling it. I was led to believe that if you look up moral turpitude \u2013 or maybe just man-whore\u200c\u2014\u200cthe definition is Drew Leighton. This is shattering that image.</p><p>\u201cI liked you so much better when you didn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Can\u2019t unring a bell. Don\u2019t know what you got \u2018til it\u2019s gone. Hindsight\u2019s a bitch. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and exhales, making sure I experience the full weight of his annoyance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do. If I stop, everyone will want to know why. Then they\u2019ll start speculating. Subterfuge is much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d never tell anyone the truth.\u201d He shrugs, and if Drew Leighton could do sheepish, I\u2019d say he was trying, but it\u2019s a little out of his depth. \u201cSorry. It didn\u2019t start out that way. If it makes you feel better, I really did plan to pull the same shit with you as always. If you would have gone for it, we\u2019d have hooked up the first possible opportunity and we would not be here right now. But you just seemed to take it all as a joke and it was a relief. I was relieved to not have to follow through on it and the more I chased you, the less you took me seriously. So the real question is why did you put up with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame reason as you. People smell your piss all over me, they assume I\u2019m off the table. Other than Ethan the Arrogant, I get left alone. Win-win.\u201d I don\u2019t really care what people say about me. I\u2019m fine with lies and rumors. It\u2019s the truth I don\u2019t want being told.</p><p>\u201cWhere does Josh fit into this?\u201d he asks, finally meeting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we?\u201d he probes.</p><p>\u201cJosh is screwing someone else.\u201d Add that to the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to have to give a crap about anyone ever again and he\u2019s kind of an impossible dream.</p><p>\u201cSo? Josh Bennett has a f**k buddy.\u201d He shrugs like he\u2019s just told me that Josh wears pants. It\u2019s the same tone he used when he dropped it on me the first time and it sucks just the same to hear it. \u201cHow do you think he\u2019s managed to keep his hands off of you this whole time? Doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d The look I give him says otherwise. \u201cDon\u2019t get all judgmental. He\u2019s a good guy, not a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is she to him?\u201d I try not to sound jealous or like I\u2019m fishing for information, but I am on both counts.</p><p>\u201cShe,\u201d he says, looking at my chest, because he is still Drew, before pulling his gaze up to my eyes, \u201cis a poor man\u2019s Sunshine.\u201d</p><p>I have a seriously hard time believing that, because Josh never comes anywhere near me.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even look at me sideways much less try to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He doesn\u2019t look at you sideways. He looks right at you and doesn\u2019t even try to hide it. The only thing I\u2019ve ever seen him drool over as much has four legs and is made of mahogany but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s planning to ask it out any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him do that, Drew. Not with me. He\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He won\u2019t,\u201d he pauses to look up at me from the floor. \u201cI think that beam\u2019s been cut, Nastya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeam\u2019s been cut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that time has passed, that ship has sailed, that cherry\u2019s been popped. I was just trying to put it in building terms but my frame of reference is limited. Didn\u2019t work, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Josh likes to keep his life free of unnecessary complications. I think you\u2019re safe for a while.\u201d He reaches up and tousles his hair purposefully.</p><p>\u201cHow long do we have to stay in here?\u201d I\u2019m done with the Josh conversation. Some things are better left alone and this is the definition of one of those things. I look at the tangled sheets on the bed and decide against it. I slide down the wall onto the floor next to Drew and cross my ankles. He pulls my head onto his shoulder, letting me lean against him.</p><p>\u201cAt least another twenty minutes.

I need to stop the bleeding, but sitting is taking priority because I think I might pass out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell, Josh?\u201d Nastya is picking up my hand and I want to tell her to stop because there\u2019s so much blood, but I just end up cursing again.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She\u2019s got pressure on the cut now and I\u2019m trying to reach up with my right arm to grab the towel that\u2019s on the counter. She shoves it away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s covered with grease and sawdust. Crap!\u201d she says as my blood starts running down her arm while her hand stays clamped over the gash. \u201cHold this!\u201d She grabs my right hand back and presses it over the blood-gushing split across my left palm.</p><p>I make the mistake of looking before she presses my hand down over it again, and I get seriously lightheaded. Blood is my kryptonite. Massive amounts of puke I can handle, but I can\u2019t do blood. Especially my own.</p><p>\u201cA lot of blood,\u201d I breathe out.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d she says, pressing her hand down on top of mine.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I manage, because I\u2019m right on this one. If I\u2019m sitting on the floor like a pu**y because of some blood, then I\u2019m going to insist that it\u2019s an awful lot of blood.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says emphatically, and there\u2019s no room left for discussion when she looks right in my eyes, forcing me to focus on her. \u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d</p><p>She keeps glancing around for something to stop the bleeding.</p><p>\u201cCan you get up?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Fuck. I\u2019m gonna pass out in front of her if she makes me stand right now. Before I can fully absorb the humiliation of that thought, she diverts my attention. By taking off her shirt. She has it off in one motion and is wrapping it around my hand before I can ask her what the hell she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s almost more impressive than the bra maneuver.</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be the one taking off my shirt?\u201d I ask to lighten the moment. At least for me. She doesn\u2019t seem at all affected.</p><p>\u201cIf I thought you could get it off before you lost another pint of blood, believe me, I would have gone that route.\u201d She pulls the shirt tight around my hand and holds it down. \u201cBesides, I have to focus, and looking at you shirtless might cause me to hyperventilate. Then we\u2019d both be passed out.\u201d Sarcastic smartass.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t passed out.\u201d Yet.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d she smiles, lifting my hand and checking out her work. \u201cNow at least you won\u2019t bleed all over the carpet. Inside,\u201d she commands, but I\u2019m too busy staring at her chest in a pink lace bra. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m more shocked by the fact that I\u2019m staring at her tits or by the fact that it\u2019s pink, not black, but at least it\u2019s got my mind off of the blood. And then, before I can even move to stand, my traitorous dick jerks. I\u2019m bleeding out in the middle of my garage. Ten seconds ago, my worst fear was that I would pass out in front of her. That\u2019s not my worst fear anymore. It does it again and I\u2019m in the midst of an undeniable hard-on. Now I try to think about the blood, but she\u2019s right in front of me, offering to help me up and it\u2019s far too late for that. She glances down. Of course she glances down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d She looks back to my face, and if I had any blood to spare, it would probably turn red. Fortunately, between my dick and my hand, all of my blood is spoken for right now. \u201cSeriously? Right now? At this moment? Seriously?\u201d She shakes her head and laughs and it\u2019s almost worth all of the embarrassment. \u201cIt must so suck to be a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault. You\u2019re the one who took off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get your ass into the house, I can put on another one.\u201d She\u2019s gently pulling on my upper arm.</p><p>I push myself up as slowly as possible. Thankfully the shirt is knotted tight enough around my hand that the bleeding is under control and I\u2019m able to make it inside without sacrificing what\u2019s left of my Y chromosome.</p> <p>A few minutes later, she comes out of my bedroom wearing one of my t-shirts, and it might almost be worse than seeing her in no shirt at all. She sets the first aid kit on the table in front of us.</p><p>\u201cIs this the only thing you have? I think I\u2019m going to need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuest bathroom. Under the sink.\u201d</p><p>Now we have a huge bottle of peroxide and extra gauze and she looks at me nervously before unwrapping the shirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t watch. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. But I think a paper cut might do you in, so just close your eyes or look over there or something.\u201d</p><p>I pick or something. I reach out with my good hand and lift up the hem of the t-shirt she\u2019s wearing and trace my thumb up one of the scars on her abdomen that I was too busy staring at her chest earlier to really study. Her breath hitches almost imperceptibly at the contact, before she swats my hand away and I drop the shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost so much blood that I\u2019m above hitting you. And if I hit you, it will hurt.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t doubt that for a second. \u201cWhat\u2019s it from? The scar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sunshine. What about the one by your hair?\u201d I\u2019ve wanted to ask about this one for ages. The other one, I just discovered tonight, along with a pink lace bra and a set of abs that is just insane.</p><p>\u201cCatfight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Quit talking. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to pass out as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you talk to me.\u201d I lean my head back and close my eyes while she starts on my hand.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anything other than blood. Tell me a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of story would you like?\u201d she cajoles me like a five-year old which is exactly what I\u2019m acting like right now. I blame blood loss.</p><p>\u201cThe real one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to hear about blood.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what that means, but I know it means something. It\u2019s just another piece of the puzzle she is. But the more she gives me, the more abstract she gets. It\u2019s like pieces to three different puzzles. You try to put them together but they never fit, and when you force them, the picture comes out all wrong.</p><p>She\u2019s got my hand unwrapped at this point, and I watch her face while she\u2019s cleaning it. She doesn\u2019t look bothered at all. Once some of the blood is gone, I can\u2019t help checking it out. The gash runs from the base of my thumb diagonally across my palm towards my wrist. It hurts like a bitch. She covers it with some antibiotic crap and wraps it with gauze because there aren\u2019t any bandages big enough to cover it.</p><p>She disappears into the kitchen and I hear her open the fridge and dig through the cabinets. When she comes back, she hands me a can of soda and a chocolate bar. In addition to the ice cream, she has taken to stashing candy here, too. I wonder how long it\u2019ll be before she has a shelf in the medicine cabinet and a drawer in my dresser. And once that happens, I wonder how long it\u2019ll be before she\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cAm I dying?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll live. Why?\u201d She\u2019s amused.</p><p>\u201cBecause giving up your sugar is like giving up your life\u2019s blood. I figure I must be dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it a transfusion. You\u2019re as pale as me right now. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the sight of blood. Unlike some people.\u201d She smirks at me.</p><p>\u201cI owe you a shirt. You didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were bleeding like a son of a bitch. I didn\u2019t have time to fight with yours. Besides, you know how many people have seen me without my clothes? Doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not touching that last part. I like thinking about her without her clothes, but I don\u2019t like thinking about anybody else seeing it. \u201cI thought you said it wasn\u2019t that much blood.\u201d</p><p>She tightens the gauze and puts my hand back on the table. \u201cRelatively speaking, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelative to what? Being shanked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably still get stitches.\u201d The look I give her tells her that is not happening. \u201cIt\u2019ll heal faster. Plus, you need to get it looked at to see if you sliced a tendon or something.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the sliced a tendon comment and I catch her smirk at me again. She\u2019s getting to do a lot of smirking at my expense tonight.</p><p>\u201cThe longer it takes to heal, the longer you won\u2019t be able to play with your tools,\u201d she sing-songs. I\u2019m not oblivious to the double entendre and I could probably make some lame comeback about still having my right hand, but she knows she\u2019s hitting home right now and I\u2019m listening. \u201cCompromise,\u201d she says, grabbing her phone and shooting off a text. \u201cMargot\u2019s off tonight. If she\u2019s home, you let her look.\u201d The phone beeps a few seconds later and she holds it up. Come on over.</p><p>An hour later, we\u2019re back at my house. My hand is treated and wrapped and I\u2019ve been sworn off tools for at least a week, depending on how it heals.</p><p>\u201cYour left hand sucks now, too.\u201d She picks up my bandaged hand and turns it over in hers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go crazy aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh probability.\u201d The thought of a week or more of not being able to work is more depressing than I want to admit.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even be able to wash the dishes.\u201d She\u2019s loving this.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll use paper plates,\u201d I respond dryly.</p><p>\u201cI sit with you for your therapy,\u201d she says, and it takes me a minute to realize what she\u2019s talking about. The garage, the tools, the wood, the work. My therapy. The thing that keeps me sane. \u201cWant to come along for mine?\u201d</p><p>Her therapy turns out to be nightly running. Not jogging. Not a leisurely stroll. Hard ass running. She\u2019s been kicking my ass for three days in a row like a tiny, porcelain drill instructor. It\u2019s miserable and exhausting. I\u2019ve thrown up every time. I wish I could say I hate it.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to keep up with her, at least not for any real distance. My legs are longer and I can take her in a sprint, but I have no stamina. She can go hard for miles, but the way she does it, nothing about it is for exercise. She runs like something is chasing her.</p><p>\u201cIt gets easier,\u201d she says, standing several feet away while I purge in the bushes at some unfortunate stranger\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I keep doing it,\u201d I respond, thinking I should start running with a bottle of mouthwash. Or at least gum.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to?\u201d Not surprised or curious. Disappointed.</p><p>I don\u2019t do well with disappointment. Especially not hers. If she wants me to run with her, I will. Maybe she\u2019ll eventually get tired of waiting for me to keep up and she\u2019ll send me home where I can hide in my garage. Running away is her thing. Hiding is mine.</p><p>When we get back to my house, I jump in the shower immediately and offer to drive her home when I get out. I have to yank myself out of the water because I could probably stay in there all night. Every part of my body aches.</p><p>When I get out to the family room, there\u2019s a note on the coffee table.</p><p>Had to run \u2013 no pun intended. Couldn\u2019t trust myself knowing you were wet and na**d in the next room. Didn\u2019t want to tempt fate. See you tomorrow.</p><p>P.S. I folded your laundry. Don\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t touch your panties. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the bottom, it\u2019s signed with a little drawing of the sun with a smiley face in it which has to be the most out of character thing I\u2019ve ever seen from her.</p><p>I head over to the utility room and there\u2019s a perfectly folded pile of my clean laundry on top of the washer. When I open the dryer door, there\u2019s nothing left in it but my abandoned boxer shorts.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Nastya</p> <p>\u201cIce cream.\u201d</p><p>I know those words. I like those words. I look up from the Physics textbook that has been my close companion for the past three hours. I will never pass this test. I should never have even signed up for the class. I was reaching from the beginning. Josh is standing next to me and leans over, shutting the book. I have a feeling this may have something to do with the frustrated barrage of profanity that left my mouth moments ago.</p><p>Academics have never been my forte. I\u2019m not very smart, a fact which I have no trouble proving to myself several times a day. Asher is the smart one. He checked off that box on the family rubric. Asher has baseball and school. I had the piano. Now I don\u2019t have anything.</p><p>\u201cYou need it. We\u2019re getting it. Now.\u201d Angry dad voice again.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow. Remember when you said that bad things happen when you don\u2019t get enough ice cream? Bad things are happening. You\u2019re all stressed out and cranky like a teenage boy who\u2019s not getting laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice analogy.\u201d Do they get cranky?</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s true. And nobody likes a cranky Sunshine. It goes against the laws of nature.\u201d He pulls my chair away from the table with me in it.</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound like a petulant four year-old.\u201d Petulant \u2013 sulky, crabby, peevish, moody, sullen. Picked that one up from Asher while he was studying for the SATs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like one. With a more colorful vocabulary. Get your ass in the truck. We\u2019re going.\u201d He grabs his keys and stands in the entryway, holding the door open and waiting.</p><p>We pull up to a strip mall a couple miles away at eight o\u2019clock and I follow him into an ice cream parlor that\u2019s tucked away in the back corner of the plaza. If you didn\u2019t know it was there, you\u2019d probably never find it. It\u2019s a Tuesday and it\u2019s mostly empty except for a family at a corner table with a little boy whose clothes seem to have seen more chocolate ice cream than his mouth. I haven\u2019t been in here before. I prefer to eat my ice cream out of the container at the kitchen counter where no one can watch me. Ice cream makes me happy. I like to concentrate on the joy.</p> <p>This place is a little pastel paradise. It\u2019s small and screams CUTE! at the top of its lungs from every direction. Six glass-top tables are scattered around the front of the shop. It must be a nightmare to keep them clean in a place full of melting sugar. The chairs have silver metal frames that match the table bases and padded vinyl seat cushions in pastel pink, yellow, blue and lavender. I look down at myself in black on black. I look like teenage Elvira walking into a Bonne Bell commercial.</p><p>There\u2019s a girl I don\u2019t recognize wiping down the tables in the front and a girl behind the counter that I do. She\u2019s a senior named Kara Matthews from my ex-music class. She stares at us when we walk in. Then she must realize that she\u2019s doing it, because she looks away, but it\u2019s pretty obvious what she\u2019s thinking. Nastya Kashnikov and Josh Bennett walk into an ice cream parlor together on a Tuesday night. It\u2019s like the beginning of a bad joke. Or the apocalypse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Josh asks, knowing I can\u2019t answer him here. I raise my eyebrows at him impatiently. He holds his hands out in surrender at the look I give him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be accused of being a chauvinist, but if you don\u2019t tell me want you want, I\u2019m just going to have to guess.\u201d There\u2019s mischief there and I don\u2019t trust him. I shrug. I\u2019m an excellent shrugger. It\u2019s rivaled only by my ability to nod.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I can do. I sit down, facing the front windows, so I don\u2019t have to look at Kara Matthews or let her look at me. I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m still in my school clothes. Josh walks back to the counter and I can hear his voice but I can\u2019t figure out what he\u2019s saying. I do hear Kara Matthews.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she laughs. I wonder what he\u2019s said, but he spoke too low for me to hear. The thought of Josh Bennett flirting with Kara Matthews is outside the realm of possibility for my imagination. I trace my fingers around the beveled edge of the glass table and try to predict what kind of concoction he\u2019s going to walk back with just to taunt me. Probably lime sorbet and peanut butter cup ice cream or some equally vile combination. The wait lasts forever. It shouldn\u2019t take this long to order ice cream and I almost cave and turn around when I hear him walking back to the table with the uneven footfalls I have memorized by now.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Josh says, coming around from behind with what can only be described as a trough of ice cream. He sets it down in front of me. He must have gotten every kind of ice cream they have. It reminds me of something my dad would do. Something so utterly ridiculous that I would have no choice but to be cheered up from whatever tragedy had befallen my young life. Back before I knew what real tragedy was. When the hard things were the fact that Megan Summers had better clothes or that I had messed up during a performance. Charles Ward was the master of cheer ups when I was little. Better than a barrel full of puppies. Maybe even better than melty ice cream.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what kind you wanted so I got them all.\u201d He\u2019s not lying. I look at the trough and I\u2019m fairly certain the only ice cream flavors not in there are the ones they haven\u2019t invented yet. He sits down across from me and leans his elbows on the table, unsuccessfully trying to stifle the shit-eating grin on his face.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a pen and talking here is out, so I grab my phone from my purse and text the boy sitting across the table from me. His phone beeps a second later and he pulls it out to read the two-word message I sent him.</p> <p>Where\u2019s yours?</p><p>And then he does something that shocks even me. Josh Bennett, king of the brooding stoics, laughs. Josh Bennett laughs and its one of the most natural, uninhibited, beautiful sounds I\u2019ve ever heard. I know Kara Matthews is watching us and people will talk tomorrow. But right now I can\u2019t even care. Josh Bennett laughs, and for one minute, everything is right in the world.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on vacation over Thanksgiving,\u201d my mother tells me on the phone when I get home from Josh\u2019s.</p><p>It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock and there were three messages from her, along with a text that simply read Please call. Ten o\u2019clock is never too late for my mother. Not anymore. She pores over pictures until all hours. Before the attack, I never remember her working through the nights like she does now. But after, it was all she seemed to do. My mother went through the most prolific period in her life while I was recovering. She\u2019d say she stayed up because she wanted to be awake if I woke up and needed anything, but I don\u2019t think she could sleep. It was easier to crawl into a computer full of her photographs than a bed full of her nightmares. I\u2019d sit up with her sometimes, because I couldn\u2019t sleep, either. I\u2019d watch her, amazed at just how much a person could accomplish fueled by tea and regret.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying in a beautiful house. We\u2019d like you to come.\u201d She waits for a reaction. She always waits. There\u2019s a hope my mother never loses that, one day, I\u2019ll fill that pause. She probably wouldn\u2019t even care what the words were at this point, just that they were there.</p><p>\u201cWe thought it would be fun to go skiing.\u201d Skiing? Seriously, Mom? With the hand? I don\u2019t want to go on vacation. I certainly don\u2019t want to go skiing. I\u2019d rather be hit in the face with a dodgeball. Repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cI already talked to Dr. Andrews. We can make an appointment to have your hand looked at again before we go. She thinks it should hold up fine as long as it isn\u2019t for too long of a period. If it starts to bother you, we can go in and sit by the fire and drink coffee.\u201d I hate coffee. I can\u2019t ski. I\u2019m from Florida. I have no sense of balance or coordination and a hand that likes to randomly lose its grip at inopportune times. Not to even mention the fact that it\u2019s so full of plates and screws that it will set off every metal detector in the airport.</p><p>My brother is the athlete. He must be in heaven. I don\u2019t want them not to go because of me, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue. They\u2019ll go whether I do or not. And I\u2019m not going. I\u2019ll be miserable and then everyone will be miserable and it\u2019ll be my fault. Again. I\u2019m tired of being responsible for other people\u2019s misery. I can\u2019t even put up with my own. My mom keeps talking. She\u2019s not afraid of being interrupted, but she wants to get all of her selling points made. Like the faster she gets them out, the more convincing they\u2019ll be.</p><p>\u201cThe house is big. It belongs to Mitch Miller, your father\u2019s boss, and he\u2019s not using it this year so he offered it to us. Addison is coming, too.\u201d Addison is coming? It fits. Morals were never the big issue with my mother, just excellence. Asher and I could probably screw half the country under her roof as long we didn\u2019t lose focus. I wonder if it would still apply to me now that I\u2019m not good at anything anymore. Knowing Asher, he probably isn\u2019t even sleeping with the girl yet, but it\u2019s an easy thing to judge my mother on so I use it.</p><p>I tap the phone three times which means I\u2019m hanging up.</p><p>\u201cPlease at least think about it. Margot\u2019s going to come, too, and I don\u2019t want you to be alone on Thanksgiving.\u201d I hang up before she can tell me that she loves me. Not because I don\u2019t want to hear that she says it, but because I don\u2019t want her to hear that I don\u2019t.</p><p>My life outside of school has become virtually unrecognizable, but almost nothing between the hours of 7:15 and 2:45 has changed. Josh and I barely acknowledge one another, Drew flings sex-bombs at me at every turn and I try to sidestep dress code violations. The rest of my time, I spend avoiding whatever it is that needs avoiding that day. Nasty looks from Tierney Lowell. Being propositioned by Ethan Hall. Everyone at lunch.</p><p>I\u2019m passing through the courtyard on my way to my favorite empty bathroom where I can get twenty-five minutes of uninterrupted angst before heading to shop. I look at Josh before I start across. He\u2019s already there. His third period is right off of it so he usually gets here first. I only let myself look at him now because he\u2019s far enough away that no one will notice. When I get closer, I always make sure to avert my eyes because I\u2019m afraid if I glance at him for even a second, the whole world will know everything that goes on in my head. I\u2019m just walking by, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see that he\u2019s looking down at his hands in the exact same position he was in the first time I saw him and I start wondering if he sits like that because he knows how amazing it makes his arms look.</p><p>\u201cSunshine.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so quiet that I almost don\u2019t hear it, and thankfully, no one else can, but I know it\u2019s real. He doesn\u2019t look up until I stop and stare at him, wondering what the hell he\u2019s thinking. Then he\u2019s staring back at me like he couldn\u2019t care less who sees.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to him so at least I\u2019m no longer standing in the middle of the courtyard. My back is to everyone else when I face him and narrow my eyes. What are you doing?</p><p>\u201cKara Matthews must have been on the phone half the night,\u201d he says flatly. I already know this. At this point I\u2019ve learned that Josh and I have been secretly screwing for weeks, but that now, he and Drew are just passing me back and forth. I guess he\u2019s heard it, too, but I don\u2019t have to answer to it. I just play dumb and walk away. I doubt Josh has to answer to it, either. I\u2019m surprised anyone even got close enough for him to hear what they were saying. Most of them are usually too terrified that they\u2019ll drop dead from being too near him, or worse, that they\u2019ll have to acknowledge that he exists. I don\u2019t know what this has to do with him calling me over in the middle of the courtyard. Giving them more ammunition is not usually his M.O. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSit,\u201d he repeats, and it\u2019s gentle. Not a command. Not a request. Just the only thing left to do. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to keep hiding in the bathroom. Hide here. There\u2019s a force field, you know.\u201d He lowers his voice when he says it, like he\u2019s telling me a secret and then just barely hints at a smile that no one but me would catch before he puts it away and sobers, adding quietly, \u201cNo one will bother you.\u201d</p><p>So I sit. He\u2019s on the backrest and I\u2019m on the seat. We don\u2019t touch. We don\u2019t speak. We aren\u2019t even at eye level with one another. And today, for the first time since I came to this school, the courtyard isn\u2019t nearly so horrible after all.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>Josh</p> <p>My grandfather died this morning. Nothing changed.</p><p>I thought, when he died, I would crack and cry and get drunk and throw shit because it was over, because he was the last one. But I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t break down. I didn\u2019t punch holes in the wall. I didn\u2019t start fights with every ass**le in school. I just kept going like nothing even happened. Because it was all so incredibly normal.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Sunshine asks when she climbs into my truck. I don\u2019t feel like being here. The garage doesn\u2019t offer me anything today. That workshop is the only thing in the world that I count on, and I don\u2019t want to think that it\u2019s powerless for me right now. I\u2019d rather just leave it for a little while so I don\u2019t have to be afraid that I\u2019ve lost that, too. I don\u2019t really know where we\u2019re going. I just want to go.</p><p>We drive for a long time. I haven\u2019t said anything since we got in the truck. I never even answered her question. Sunshine is good with silence. She leans her head against the window and looks outside and she just lets me drive.</p><p>We end up stretched out in the bed of the truck, staring up at the sky in the parking lot of a closed down car dealership.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t started counting yet. I wonder if it\u2019s just me or if it\u2019s like that for everybody; that every time someone dies you start counting how much time has passed since they\u2019ve been gone. First you count it in minutes, then in hours. You count in days, then weeks, then months. Then one day you realize that you aren\u2019t counting anymore, and you don\u2019t even know when you stopped. That\u2019s the moment they\u2019re gone.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather\u2019s dead,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIf we had a telescope, I could show you the Sea of Tranquility.\u201d She points up at the sky. \u201cSee? Up there on the moon. You can\u2019t really tell from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you have a picture of the moon in your bedroom?\u201d At this point I\u2019m an expert at going along with her tangents.</p><p>\u201cYou noticed that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only thing on the wall. I thought you were into astronomy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I keep it there to remind me that it\u2019s bullshit. I thought it sounded like this beautiful, peaceful place. Like where you\u2019d want to go when you die. Quiet and water everywhere. A place that would swallow you up and accept you no matter what. I had this whole image of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like a bad place to end up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be, if it were real. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a sea at all. It\u2019s just a big, dark shadow on the moon. The whole name is a lie. Doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>Her left hand is resting on her stomach, opening and closing. She does that all the time but I don\u2019t think she realizes it.</p><p>\u201cSo your warped fascination with names extends beyond people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all lies, really. Your name could mean to excel and you could be useless and crap at everything. You can put a name on anything, call it whatever you want, doesn\u2019t make it real. Doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d She sounds bitter. Or just disillusioned.</p><p>\u201cSo if they\u2019re all such meaningless crap, why are you so obsessed?\u201d I can\u2019t count how many mutilated newspapers she\u2019s left on my kitchen table once she\u2019s cut her way through the birth announcements. At first, I thought she was one of those girls who takes pre-naming her future children to the extreme, but apparently it\u2019s just some weird hobby.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s good when you find one that does mean something. Makes all the empty ones worthwhile.\u201d The faintest smile crosses her face and I wonder what she\u2019s thinking about, but she doesn\u2019t give me the chance to ask.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you think he is?\u201d she asks, still staring at the sky.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace good, I guess. I don\u2019t know.\u201d I wait and she does too. \u201cI asked him once if he was afraid. Of dying. Then I realized it was kind of a shit thing to ask someone who\u2019s dying, because if they weren\u2019t thinking about it before, they definitely would be after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He laughed. Said he wasn\u2019t afraid at all. But he was on a lot of drugs by then, so he wasn\u2019t all there. He told me he already knew where he was going because he\u2019d been there before.\u201d I stop because I think that\u2019s all of my grandfather\u2019s craziness that I want to share. He wasn\u2019t always like that. Just at the end, with the drugs and the pain. But then she\u2019s looking at me with the curiosity of a hundred questions in her eyes and I feel like I have to answer her. \u201cWhen he was like twenty, he was working construction and he fell and his heart stopped, so I guess he was technically dead for like a minute or something. He told the story a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would you think it was the drugs talking if you\u2019d heard it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he always said he didn\u2019t remember. Everyone asked him if there was a light and all that bullshit, but he always said he couldn\u2019t remember any of it once he woke up. Then the night before he left, he sat me down and said he had two things he wanted to give me\u200c\u2014\u200cone final piece of advice and his last secret. And that\u2019s when he told me that he always remembered it, where he went when he died. He said he remembered exactly what it was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said there wasn\u2019t really any form or sense to it. That it was like feeling without knowing. Like a fever dream. Like the dream of second chances. He said the only part of it that had definition was a porch swing in front of a red brick house, but he didn\u2019t know what it meant at the time so he didn\u2019t say anything about it to anyone. Then he showed me this old picture of him sitting with my grandmother on a porch swing in front of the red brick house she lived in when they met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s almost something like disappointment there and I wish I was allowed to reach over and touch her face or her hand or anything.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s sweet,\u201d I say, not meaning it. \u201cExcept he didn\u2019t actually meet her until three years after he had that accident; that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t get it at the time. But once he saw that swing and that house, then he knew. He knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to die. He was supposed to come back so he could meet her because his heaven was where she was, even if he didn\u2019t know it at the time. And that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t scared.\u201d I turn to see her watching the moon, the ghost of a smile playing on her lips where the disappointment was a minute ago. I look up at the sky to see what she sees and she moves closer and rests her head on my chest. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s only because she\u2019s cold or the metal truck bed is hard as hell. I don\u2019t question it; I just close my arm around her and pull her into me like I\u2019ve been doing it for years. \u201cLike I said. Lots of pain killers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it good advice?\u201d she asks on the drive home. Her head is resting against the window and she\u2019s watching the road go by.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your grandfather gave you one last piece of advice. Was it good advice?\u201d She\u2019s sitting up now and facing me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I laugh, when I think about it. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain it was the worst piece of advice ever. But I\u2019m going to blame that on the drugs, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you have to tell me. I have to know what qualifies as the worst advice ever.\u201d She twists her body towards me and tucks one of her legs under the other.</p><p>\u201cHe said,\u201d and I\u2019m almost embarrassed telling her this, \u201cthat every woman has one unforgiveable thing, one thing that she\u2019ll never be able to get past and for every woman it\u2019s different. Maybe it\u2019s being lied to, maybe it\u2019s being cheated on, whatever. He said the trick in relationships was to figure out what that unforgiveable thing was, and to not do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you. He also told me there was a raccoon in the kitchen that night. So...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the raccoon or the advice?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and tilts her head impatiently and I glance at her before turning back to the road.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. You\u2019re a girl. You\u2019re not one of those girls who wants to be called a woman, right? Even though you\u2019re almost eighteen? That just seems weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she says dryly.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s yours?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cMy advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your unforgiveable thing. Apparently you must have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought about it.\u201d She turns back to the window. \u201cI\u2019m guessing murder is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder is out. You\u2019d be dead, so the forgiveness would be a moot point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily, but we\u2019ll say so for the sake of argument. I guess I\u2019d go with loving me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving you too much would be unforgiveable? I\u2019m going to pull a McAllister on you and require supporting details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many obligations. People like to say love is unconditional, but it\u2019s not, and even if it was unconditional, it\u2019s still never free. There\u2019s always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won\u2019t be happy unless you are. You\u2019re supposed to be who they think you\u2019re supposed to be and feel how they think you\u2019re supposed to feel because they love you and when you can\u2019t give them what they want, they feel shitty, so you feel shitty, and everybody feels shitty. I just don\u2019t want that responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather no one loved you?\u201d I ask. I wish I wasn\u2019t driving so I could look at her for more than a second.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just talking. It\u2019s an unanswerable question.\u201d She pulls her foot out from under her and puts her head back down against the glass.</p><p>\u201cWorst advice ever,\u201d I say.</p><p>I\u2019m used to being alone, but tonight I feel more alone. Like I\u2019m not just alone in my house, I\u2019m alone in the world. And maybe that\u2019s its own blessing, because now, I never have to do this again.</p><p>Tonight when I climb into bed, I don\u2019t even bother to count.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I didn\u2019t stop talking immediately. I talked right up until the day I remembered everything that happened, over a year later. That was the day I went silent. It wasn\u2019t a ploy or a tactic. It wasn\u2019t psychosomatic. It was a choice. And I made it.</p><p>I just knew that suddenly I had answers. I had all the answers to all the questions, but I didn\u2019t want to say them. I didn\u2019t want to release them out into the world and make them real; I didn\u2019t want to admit that such things happened and that they happened to me. So I chose the silence and everything that came along with it because I wasn\u2019t a good enough liar to speak.</p><p>I always planned to tell the truth. I just wanted to give myself a little time. A chance to find the right thing to say and the courage to say it. I didn\u2019t take a vow of silence. I wasn\u2019t suddenly struck mute. I just didn\u2019t have the words. I still don\u2019t. I never found them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t feel any different when I wake up on my eighteenth birthday. I don\u2019t feel older or mature or free. I feel inadequate, if anything, because I know what I was supposed to be at eighteen and it\u2019s not what I am. My dad\u2019s brother, my Uncle Jim, got really down with himself when I was fourteen and he came to stay with us for a while to \u201cre-evaluate.\u201d My mom said that it just happens sometimes when you get older. You get halfway through with your life and you realize you haven\u2019t done the things you wanted to do or become what you\u2019d thought you\u2019d become and it\u2019s disheartening. I wonder if it\u2019s a special kind of disheartening when you get to that place at eighteen.</p><p>Margot\u2019s car isn\u2019t in the garage when I get home from school. Normally she\u2019s sleeping at this hour, either in bed or in a chair by the pool. I know she made sure she had the night off because Margot loves birthdays and she\u2019s been more excited than me about this one.</p><p>I kick off my shoes and toss my backpack on my bed and barely make it to the kitchen when the doorbell rings. Standing on the other side of the door are Margot, my mother, my father, Asher and Addison. My mother is holding a cake and her smile just barely falters before she catches it. I\u2019m in the doorway in my school clothes and make-up. My mother has never seen me like this. She\u2019s seen glimpses of it, but not the full effect all at once, and I think it devastates her a little. Margot looks like Margot, my brother looks resigned, my father barely looks and Addison doesn\u2019t know what to look like. I think she wonders what she\u2019s doing here as much as I do.</p><p>They\u2019ve done the Surprise! Happy Birthday! thing in the doorway, so I step out of the way and they come in\u200c\u2014\u200ccake, presents and all. My parents suggest going to a restaurant, but I don\u2019t want to go out. It\u2019s three-thirty and there\u2019s too much of a chance of running into people from school, so Margot calls for pizza and puts the cake in the refrigerator while everyone crashes in the family room to wait for the food.</p> <p>\u201cWe could probably still get you a ticket if you want to come with us for Thanksgiving,\u201d my mom throws out. It took exactly forty-three seconds from the time she got into the house to bringing it up.</p><p>\u201cThe house is sick. You should see it, Em. Three fireplaces. A balcony. Hot tub.\u201d Addison\u2019s face turns pink and my brother looks at her apologetically. Bringing up the hot tub in front of the parents is really an amateur move.</p><p>\u201cYou could bring someone, too, if you want.\u201d That comes out of left field. I wish she would stop trying. My mother\u2019s hope is a weapon. I see Margot watching me from the kitchen. I wonder what, if anything, she\u2019s told them about my extracurricular activities. \u201cMargot says you eat dinner with a boy\u2019s family every Sunday. What\u2019s his name?\u201d She turns to Margot.</p><p>\u201cDrew Leighton.\u201d Margot\u2019s still looking at me. No mention of Josh Bennett and I wonder why she\u2019s kept that to herself but told them about Drew.</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d my mother repeats. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Why don\u2019t you call him now? He can celebrate with us. We\u2019d love to meet him. You know him from school?\u201d</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in debate together,\u201d Margot answers for me.</p><p>\u201cAddison\u2019s on debate,\u201d Asher interjects, and maybe we can turn the conversation on her, because Drew Leighton is too close to Josh Bennett and my family isn\u2019t getting anywhere near Josh Bennett.</p><p>\u201cDebate Drew Leighton?\u201d It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard Addison\u2019s voice. It\u2019s all soft and feminine like her. She\u2019s sitting next to Asher, holding his hand, and it kind of pisses me off. \u201cI know him! He\u2019s\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d she cuts herself off before she continues and I smile at her. I can\u2019t help it. We both know what she was about to say. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good debater. Everyone knows him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Asher looks at her dubiously and then over at me and I know he plans to find out the truth of it later.</p><p>I nod and she stifles her own smile and continues in a more appropriate direction.</p> <p>\u201cHe came in third in state last year and everyone knows he\u2019s the biggest threat in extemp and LD. No one wants to go up against him this year.\u201d She sounds almost reverential. It\u2019s understandable when you\u2019ve seen Drew debate, and she obviously has, or at least she\u2019s aware enough of it. I\u2019m almost proud to hear someone talk about Drew for what he should be talked about, but it\u2019s a rare thing. I find myself smiling at her for real, and maybe I\u2019m not so pissed about Addison holding my brother\u2019s hand after all.</p><p>We eat pizza and everyone relaxes and I find myself missing my family and wondering if maybe I didn\u2019t exaggerate everything. Maybe it wasn\u2019t so forced and awkward. Then again, maybe it\u2019s just not awkward because I\u2019m watching from the outside right now. It may be my birthday that brought them here, but they\u2019re in their own element and I\u2019m just looking in. Even Addison has a place, in this picture, with my family. I\u2019m the outsider.</p><p>Asher goes on about school and baseball and homecoming. Margot talks about nurse shortages at work and how the schedule is starting to kill her a little bit. My dad doesn\u2019t say much. He just glances at me every once in a while and I try to work out what he\u2019s seeing when I look at his eyes, but they tell me nothing and I wonder if they\u2019re just a reflection of my own. Ever since the day I told him to stop calling me Milly, and then stopped telling him anything else at all, there\u2019s been very little between us. My mother still tries, but my father has lost all hope. Maybe he\u2019s the smart one. Though it doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. My father has shut down and it\u2019s worse than any anger or disappointment he could level at me. The man who was the source of all my smiles now can\u2019t even conjure one himself. I\u2019m a coward and a fraud and I murdered his spirit. There\u2019s something about knowing that I broke my father\u2019s heart that makes me hate myself a little more than I already do.</p><p>We get done with dinner but we all ate so much pizza that no one can even think about cake yet. Except maybe me. I can always think about cake.</p><p>My mother and Margot move a pile of presents from the counter to the table in front of me. There are way too many of them, but I wish there weren\u2019t any, because I don\u2019t want to feel grateful and there\u2019s nothing they can give me that I need anyway.</p><p>I open them all and feel like I\u2019m under a microscope where my every facial expression is being studied and it makes me want to scream, but I can\u2019t. So I just swallow it like dirt and blood.</p><p>The last present is the smallest box, and I should know to be scared by the anxious expression on my mother\u2019s face. Or maybe my father\u2019s face tells the real story, because he looks like he thinks this is a really bad idea and he\u2019s probably said as much to my mother a hundred times. I rip open the paper and I\u2019m holding a brand-new, jacked-up iPhone.</p><p>My mother starts extolling the virtues of the phone as if I don\u2019t know everything it can do, for example, reveal my exact whereabouts at any given moment. I don\u2019t need to listen to the sales spiel, but I\u2019m right back in the room when I hear the kicker.</p> <p>\u201cYou can keep the phone and we\u2019ll pay the bills. The only condition is that you call and talk to us on it at least once a week.\u201d</p><p>I smile. I can\u2019t help it. Up until two and a half minutes ago, I was genuinely enjoying this day. I had actually chastised myself for being upset that they had come and let myself think that maybe this would be a turning point. But it\u2019s not a turning point. It\u2019s an ambush.</p><p>My family has taken my birthday and turned it into an intervention. They all trade off explaining to me how my behavior is hurting them. I find out, in great detail, how my failure to speak affects each and every member of my family. I listen to all of it. They haven\u2019t tied me to the chair so I can\u2019t escape or enlisted the help of an objective third party to impart the proper amount of guilt while keeping us all focused on the problem at hand. Me. There\u2019s no reason I have to stay here and listen to this, but I do, until every one of them has spoken.</p><p>Except Addison. She just looks uncomfortable. I think they pulled a bait and switch on her, too, with the whole birthday party idea. She looks like she wants to bolt as much as I do, and I feel kind of sorry for her. I wonder if we could make a run for it together.</p><p>When they\u2019ve all finished. I smile. I love them and they love me and we all know this. I hug my brother. I nod to Addison and Margot. I kiss my mother and father on the cheek. I leave my awesome iPhone on the table and I walk out the door.</p><p>My mother\u2019s camera is still sitting on the counter, untouched. She didn\u2019t take one picture.</p><p>I walk into Josh\u2019s garage and climb up onto the workbench, crossing my ankles. Josh wanted to put another coat of finish on my chair, so it\u2019s out of commission right now. I thought it looked fine, but he kept pointing out why it didn\u2019t until I gave up and let him do it.</p><p>\u201cMy mother turned my birthday party into an intervention,\u201d I say. As soon as it\u2019s out of my mouth, I cringe, realizing that it\u2019s probably pretty crappy to complain about your parents to someone who doesn\u2019t have any. It\u2019s like bitching that your shoes are too tight to someone who\u2019s walking across broken glass barefoot.</p><p>That\u2019s the irony of Josh and I, and it shames me every time I think about it. He has no family. No one to love him. I\u2019m surrounded by love and I don\u2019t want any of it. I piss all over what he would thank God for, and if I needed more proof that I have no soul, then there it is.</p><p>\u201cWhen was your birthday?\u201d He looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cToday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday.\u201d He smiles, but it\u2019s sad.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d he says, walking over to put his drill on the charger before turning back around.</p><p>\u201cPeople who go around advertising their birthday are douchebags. It\u2019s a fact. You can look it up on Wikipedia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, intervention?\u201d He tilts his head.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of your drug problem. Should I hide the silver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavy drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you might beg to differ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I\u2019ve seen the ugly side of your drinking and I hope never to go there again.\u201d He comes around and climbs up on the workbench next to me. Close enough that his leg touches mine, and it\u2019s grounding. \u201cSo what are we intervening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d He looks at me skeptically when I answer. \u201cThey want me to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you spent every night in their garage they might rethink that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my Sunshine,\u201d he says, kicking my foot.</p><p>\u201cThey gave me an iPhone with the condition that I call and speak to them on it once a week.\u201d I brush the sawdust into a pile next to my leg and poke a hole in it so it looks like a volcano.</p><p>\u201cNot what you wanted, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for implants.\u201d</p><p>He nods thoughtfully. \u201cAlways helpful with the job search after college.\u201d</p><p>We sit for a minute without talking. My legs start swinging out of instinct and he reaches over and stills them with his hand, but he doesn\u2019t say anything and then finally\u200c\u2014\u200c</p><p>\u201cWas the cake at least good?\u201d He knows where my heart lies.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t even get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the real tragedy. Forget the intervention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the cake,\u201d he says, taking my hand and pulling me down from the counter before I can protest. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the wish.\u201d</p><p>He makes me wait while he goes back into the house, and a few minutes later we are driving away in his truck with a red plastic beach pail full of pennies on the seat between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s not even dark yet when he pulls into the parking garage of an outdoor shopping center. The bucket of pennies is so full that he has to struggle to get it out of the truck without spilling it. He picks up the handle with one hand and slides the other underneath for support so it won\u2019t snap off and then kicks the door shut with his foot. The sun is just starting to set and the plaza lights have kicked on. It\u2019s one of those high class places with stores no real person ever shops at and restaurants with overpriced food you\u2019d never want to eat anyway. But the fountain is amazing. Right in the middle of all of the pretense, it\u2019s an even more pretentious spectacle. Every few minutes, the spray pattern shifts and the lights change color from below. There\u2019s a walkway that forms a bridge across it and the fountain spray arcs overhead, splitting in two on either side so you can pass underneath it without getting wet. It feels like magic and I\u2019m a little girl. I wish I had my mother\u2019s camera.</p><p>I follow Josh halfway through the walkway where he stops and curses under his breath at the pennies when he sets them down at his feet. The fountain obscures us and I don\u2019t think anyone from school would be out here anyway, but I still worry about being seen, or more problematically, heard in public. It\u2019s one of the reasons I never go anywhere, but it\u2019s not the only one.</p><p>\u201cHave at it,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWishes. You only get one with a cake and even that you only get if you blow out all the candles, which is kind of shitty because it\u2019s your birthday and there shouldn\u2019t be a contingency on a wish. Pennies are a sure thing and you can have as many as you want.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at the pail. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can think of that many things to wish for.\u201d There\u2019s only one thing I really want.</p><p>\u201cSure you can. It\u2019s easy. Watch.\u201d He leans over and grabs a handful of pennies in his left hand and picks one up with his right. He thinks for a second and then tosses it into the fountain. \u201cSee? You don\u2019t even need good aim.\u201d He turns to me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I can smell the sawdust on him as he takes my left hand and pours a fistful of pennies into it. My hand stutters and he steadies it with his, for a moment, before letting go. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I look at the pennies and up to the fountain and wonder if there is such a thing as magic or miracles. Josh is watching me as I make the same wish I always do. It\u2019s the one that won\u2019t come true, but I wish it anyway, so maybe I haven\u2019t totally given up after all. I toss the penny into the air and watch it fall into the water while the lights below switch from pink to purple.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that!\u201d I say indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it won\u2019t come true.\u201d Do I really need to say this? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a given in wish situations.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the rule,\u201d I insist.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the rule with birthday cakes and shooting stars, not pennies in fountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says?\u201d I ask, sounding like a first grader.</p><p>\u201cMy mom.\u201d</p><p>That shuts me up quick. I look at the pennies and the fountain and anywhere but at him because I don\u2019t want to scare him away, and I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll say something else. Then he does, and I wish he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThen again, I doubt many of her wishes actually came true, so maybe she didn\u2019t know what she was talking about after all.\u201d</p><p>For just one moment, I see an eight year-old boy glued to a television set, waiting for his mother to come home.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she just made the wrong one,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou talk about your mom more than your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad was around longer. I remember him. I remember what he was like. I\u2019ve forgotten almost everything about my mom so I try to make myself think about her more. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid one day I\u2019ll wake up and I won\u2019t remember her at all.\u201d He tosses a penny into the fountain and I watch it sink. \u201cIf you asked me now about my sister, the only word I\u2019d be able to come up with is annoying. I remember that she bugged the hell out of me and that\u2019s about it. If I didn\u2019t have pictures, I don\u2019t even think I could tell you what she looked like.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s referring to the wishing or the confessions, but I go with the pennies. I don\u2019t even wish. I just throw one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The two easiest and emptiest words to say and I say them.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t remember my mom or because you asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. But mostly the asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever asks. Like they think they\u2019re doing me a favor. That if they don\u2019t bring it up, I won\u2019t have to think about it. I never stop thinking about it. Just because I don\u2019t talk about it, doesn\u2019t mean I forget. I don\u2019t talk about it because no one ever asks.\u201d He stops and looks at me again and I wonder if I\u2019m supposed to say something, but I don\u2019t want to, because if I say something, I\u2019m afraid I might say everything. He turns back to the fountain so his eyes aren\u2019t on me anymore, but I think he\u2019s still watching. \u201cI\u2019d ask you, you know. If I was allowed. I\u2019d ask you a thousand times until you\u2019d tell me. But you won\u2019t let me ask.\u201d</p><p>We manage to find the laughter in the evening again, and we wish ourselves through most of the bucket of pennies. At one point, a mother with two little girls passes through and Josh gives them each a handful of pennies and begs them to help us because we\u2019re running out of things to wish for. They take the affair very seriously as if each wish is so precious that they can\u2019t afford to waste it. They squeeze their eyes shut and concentrate, making sure they do it just right. And I wish for every one of their wishes to come true.</p><p>Towards the end, we start making mega-wishes and fortifying them with handfuls of pennies. One of those wishes results in the clasp of my bracelet coming undone, causing it to fly off into the fountain along with my wish-imbued pennies. Josh rolls up the bottoms of his jeans and pulls off his boots. I just have to take off my shoes because I\u2019m still in the skirt I wore to school and it\u2019s plenty short. We scan around, hoping there aren\u2019t any security guards in the area before we step in. Thankfully the water is shallow, because it\u2019s freakishly cold and my legs are ice the second I get in.</p><p>\u201cWhere did it go?\u201d he asks. I point off in the direction I threw the pennies. I don\u2019t think it could have gotten very far. We head off in that direction but it\u2019s impossible to see anything because the entire fountain floor is carpeted with coins. Half of them probably came from us. It\u2019s a tapestry of silver and copper and colored light. Every time I see something I think might be my bracelet, I have to reach down and submerge my arm into the water, which is what I\u2019m doing when Josh decides to push my leg with his foot just enough to knock me off balance and send me face first into the ice cold water. The splash is followed by laughter from him and a death glare from me. I plan to grab him and pull him in after me, but I don\u2019t have to, because he tries to step away from my grasp too quickly and falls in all on his own.</p><p>\u201cKarma\u2019s a bitch, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>His pants and half of his shirt are soaked, but he managed to keep his head out of the water unlike the drowned rat that is me. When he looks at me, he starts laughing all over again and I finally dissolve in it, too. \u201cDon\u2019t do the last name bullshit. I hate it,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNot really caring what you hate right now,\u201d I say, trying to force some venom into my voice, but it\u2019s hard when I\u2019m fighting what I am quite certain are the early stages of hypothermia. I feel like one of those insane polar bear people who jump in the freezing cold ocean every year and I mentally put that on my list of things I will never do.</p><p>\u201cScrew the bracelet. It\u2019s not worth it,\u201d I say, climbing out of the water with Josh right behind me. He doesn\u2019t argue.</p><p>We split up the rest of the pennies between the two little girls whose mother gives us a dirty look because I think she\u2019s had enough wishing for the night. Or maybe because we\u2019re soaking wet and just climbed out of the fountain. I pick up the empty pail and swing it back and forth between us while we walk to the parking garage, leaving the fountain, my bracelet, eighteen dollars in pennies and two giggling girls behind us. Josh reaches over to take the pail from me. He stops my hand and opens my fingers, retrieving the handle with his left hand and holding mine open with his right. His hand is no warmer than my own, but it feels good anyway, and I wait for him to let go, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>When we reach his truck in the parking garage, he tosses the bucket into the back and then reaches up and cradles my face in his hands the way he did that day on the Leightons\u2019 front porch.</p><p>\u201cBlack shit,\u201d he says, letting one side of his mouth turn up as he wipes the streaks away with his thumbs. Then, he moves away and opens my door. \u201cHappy birthday, Sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wished that my hand would work again,\u201d I tell him when he climbs in after me. It was my first wish and the only one that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI wished my mother was here tonight, which is stupid, because it\u2019s an impossible wish.\u201d He shrugs and turns to me, drowning the smile that cracks me every time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid to want to see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much that I wanted to see her again,\u201d he says, looking at me with the depth of more than seventeen years in his eyes. \u201cI wanted her to see you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cThere are clean towels in the guest bathroom. I\u2019m going to shower in the master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you have a big hot water heater, because I may never come out,\u201d Sunshine yells from the hall. She\u2019s still shivering because she has almost no body fat on her and I kind of feel like shit for the whole fountain thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put water on for tea. You want some?\u201d I call from the kitchen where I\u2019m filling the tea kettle.</p><p>\u201cYou drink hot tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not old. Or British. I can count on one finger the number of teenage boys who drink hot tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to make it for my grandfather. I got used to it. Shut up.\u201d I finish filling the kettle and put it on top of the stove before I head into the bathroom. \u201cYou want it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. Tea sucks. I\u2019ll be out in an hour. Maybe two.\u201d The bathroom door slams.</p><p>I\u2019m out of the shower ten minutes later and the water is still running in the guest bathroom so I guess she wasn\u2019t lying. I throw my wet clothes in the empty washer then head into the kitchen to turn the stove burner on. Maybe tea does suck, but I heat the water anyway. She won\u2019t turn down hot chocolate.</p><p>The doorbell rings and I figure it has to be Drew, because other than the girl using all the hot water in my bathroom, he\u2019s the only person who would come over here. He\u2019s got a key so I don\u2019t know why he doesn\u2019t just come in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I open the door, ready to hear about whatever minor irritation has sent him fleeing from his house this time, but it isn\u2019t Drew. It\u2019s a kid I\u2019ve never seen before and he\u2019s staring at me so intensely that I feel like he\u2019s checking me out. Not like he wants me, but like he wants to know who the hell I am, except that he\u2019s the one knocking on my door.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I finally ask because the kid isn\u2019t talking.</p><p>\u201cIs my sister here?\u201d Sister? \u201cMargot said she\u2019d probably be here. Nastya.\u201d He spits out her name like it tastes bad in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your sister?\u201d There\u2019s not much of a resemblance unless you really, really look. He actually looks a lot like Margot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. She left. Is she here?\u201d</p><p>I push back the door and let him in. The water in the shower is still running and there\u2019s no ignoring it. Damn it, Sunshine. He\u2019s not looking relieved and I can guess why as I stand in front of him in a t-shirt and sweatpants, still wet from the shower, while we listen to the water continue running two doors down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the shower,\u201d I say, because it\u2019s not like I can hide the fact. I need to warn her before she comes out. \u201cI\u2019ll go let her know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is my sister showering in your house?\u201d he demands before I can get away. He\u2019s pissed. I\u2019m getting the full over-protective brother treatment and I kind of respect him for it, but I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s talking to me, in my own house, like I\u2019m some sort of scumbag. It\u2019s the same thing Margot did when she came over. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly threatening and it\u2019s not as if Nastya comes across like some delicate flower.</p> <p>\u201cYour sister is eighteen years old. She can do more than shower here if she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister is emotionally stunted at fifteen.\u201d He levels his eyes at me. This is not really a conversation I anticipated having tonight. I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying she\u2019s immature?\u201d It\u2019s the only thing I can come up with. And I can\u2019t decide which side I\u2019m on anyway. Some days she seems older than anyone I\u2019ve ever met and others she\u2019s like a little girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying she\u2019s messed up.\u201d He exhales and he looks tired, like he\u2019s said this a thousand times before and he doesn\u2019t want to be here, saying it now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d I do agree. I just don\u2019t know why or how or anything that might matter.</p> <p>\u201cI know my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your sister.\u201d I know what she tells me. The fragments of a life she gives me glimpses of on the days she\u2019s feeling particularly generous, or maybe just reckless.</p><p>\u201cDid you even know today was her birthday?\u201d he asks. I don\u2019t answer. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. From the look on your face earlier, you didn\u2019t know she had a brother, either. You ever wonder what else you don\u2019t know?\u201d Always. \u201cShe\u2019s got issues and she doesn\u2019t need another one. Leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t appreciate being referred to as an issue.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s something you want me to know, why don\u2019t you tell me? Otherwise you can take the condescending attitude and get out of my house.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. He won\u2019t betray her, and as much as I want to know what the hell is going on, I can respect that. Still, I\u2019m not letting him make me the villain here. I want to like this kid, but he\u2019s starting to piss me off.</p> <p>\u201cYou like taking advantage of messed up girls? Is that your thing?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s yours? Pointless accusations and intimidation?\u201d</p><p>The water stops running and I\u2019m ready to bolt down the hall to intercept her before she comes out, but the door opens before I can get there. I didn\u2019t even have a chance to leave her a dry change of clothes. She comes out of the hallway, dripping wet with a towel wrapped around her and all the blood drains down from my brain and my stupid dick twitches because that\u2019s what it does when beautiful, wet, towel-clad girls come out of my shower. I wish I could enjoy the view because, seriously. But this isn\u2019t the time, and fortunately, my dick gets the message that her extremely pissed-off looking brother is standing next to me and stays down.</p><p>She opens her mouth but sees him before any words make it out. I don\u2019t know whose eyes are wider. Something unspoken goes on between the two of them. I can\u2019t tell if she looks frightened or ashamed, but it looks like she\u2019s gotten younger just seeing him. The tea kettle whistles and we\u2019re so on edge that I think we all might piss our pants right here. Except for Nastya, because right now, she\u2019s not wearing any. I look between the two of them and settle on her.</p><p>\u201cGot company, Sunshine. Anyone want tea?\u201d</p><p>Her brother eventually leaves once he accepts that she isn\u2019t going back with him. I wonder how much hell she\u2019s going to catch for that. Answering to people isn\u2019t something I ever have to worry about, so it never crosses my mind, but she has a family and I don\u2019t know how she gets away with just not going home, even if she is eighteen. She made a comment once that her parents are afraid to discipline her but she didn\u2019t elaborate. I wonder if they\u2019re scared of her, too. She spends most of her time here already, but how much of that information gets back to her parents is beyond me. If her family didn\u2019t think we were screwing before, they do now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping on the couch.\u201d I tell her when she pulls the pillow and blanket she\u2019s used before out of the linen closet.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Sorry.\u201d She puts them down and starts looking around for her keys.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just meant that the couch is seriously uncomfortable. You can take my bed. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not taking your bed. I don\u2019t mind the couch. I\u2019ve slept on it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know it sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than always going back to Margot\u2019s and being alone. I don\u2019t want you giving up your bed.\u201d She sits down on the couch and clutches the pillow in her lap.</p><p>\u201cSo sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes go wide and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of sleep with me. Just sleep. It\u2019s a king-size bed, you won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I doubt that.\u201d She looks around like she\u2019s trying to figure something out. \u201cHow is it possible that you only have one bed in this house, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a twin bed in Amanda\u2019s room but you can\u2019t find it anymore because I started storing everything in there and it\u2019s underneath a bunch of crap. I got rid of the one in my old room when they needed to bring in the hospital bed for my grandfather. So now I just have the one in the master.\u201d She doesn\u2019t look at me like she feels bad, just like she understands.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t really be that bad,\u201d she says, walking down to Amanda\u2019s room. The door is always closed and she\u2019s never gone in before, but she does now.</p><p>She steps inside to the almost non-existent pathway of visible carpet, and scans the room. There are boxes and piles of old clothing folded on the bed. A couple of random pieces of furniture I built, but wasn\u2019t happy with, are shoved here and there; things I would keep in the garage, but don\u2019t, because I need the space out there more than I need it here.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it is that bad,\u201d she laughs, before her eyes narrow with curiosity and I turn to see what she\u2019s looking at. \u201cYou have a piano,\u201d she says softly, stepping over to it. \u201cWhy is it in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda was taking lessons. I never did. I rolled it in here a couple years ago when I needed the space in the living room for one of the tables.\u201d</p><p>She runs her fingers along the top of the keys so lightly that I\u2019m not sure she even touches them at all. There\u2019s a reverence in the way she does it.</p><p>\u201cDo you play?\u201d I ask, because she\u2019s never mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. It takes her a second to look up at me because she\u2019s still staring at the keys. \u201cNot even a little.\u201d</p><p>When I crawl into bed with her later, it doesn\u2019t matter how huge the mattress is. I\u2019m not completely brain dead. I know that this is a monumentally bad idea with repercussions written all over it. But she\u2019s right. It\u2019s just nice not being alone. And the couch is hellishly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cIs it just me, or is this really strange?\u201d she finally asks after about twenty minutes of awkward silence, because neither of us is sleeping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t even need to do anything with her. Not that I don\u2019t want to, because I want to touch her more than I probably should. But it really isn\u2019t that. I just like her here.</p><p>She reaches over and finds my arm, just below my shoulder, and follows it until she reaches my hand. It reminds me of the way she touched the piano keys earlier and I can feel the trail her fingers leave all the way down my arm. There\u2019s a comfort that wasn\u2019t here a moment ago. Then, without a word, she curls up next to me and that\u2019s how we fall asleep. Her hand in mine. Together.</p><p>On Wednesday in art class, Clay Whitaker shows me the portfolio he\u2019s been working on and I want to hit him. He\u2019s always updating, adding, deleting, based on whatever competition he\u2019s entering it in or the college he\u2019s applying to, and then he\u2019ll show it to me, even though I never ask to see it and I don\u2019t know shit about art. I don\u2019t want to hit him for the portfolio itself, but for showing it to me here, in the middle of class, where it\u2019s nearly impossible to keep my face blank. I think it\u2019s a test. I look at Clay watching me, and I know it\u2019s a test.</p><p>Every last drawing is of Sunshine. He has her face from every angle. Every emotion I can imagine anyone ever feeling is in her eyes in these pictures. I forgive him for every minute he stole her from my garage.</p><p>\u201cDraw one for me.\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I can bitchslap them into submission.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to draw you?\u201d He\u2019s annoyed or disappointed. I haven\u2019t given him the reaction he was expecting.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to draw her. For me.\u201d</p><p>Clay looks a little more pleased with that.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, how?\u201d I sound pissed and I mean to, but it\u2019s me I\u2019m pissed at. I just spilled my guts all over the floor in art class and now he\u2019s going to kick them around a little bit for fun.</p><p>\u201cHow do you see her? If you want me to draw her for you, it should be how you see her. Not how I see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve drawn a hundred pictures of her. Just draw another one or give me one of those.\u201d I motion toward the portfolio.</p><p>\u201cWhen you look at her what do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king serious? Forget it.\u201d He can kiss my ass if he wants to start talking feelings with me.</p><p>\u201cYou obviously want it for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a picture to jack off to. What do you care?\u201d I keep drawing so I don\u2019t have to look at him, but I\u2019m mutilating the sketch I\u2019m working on. I\u2019ll have to start over, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cJoy, fear, frustration, longing, friendship, anger, need, despair, love, lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d I reply, because I\u2019m all in now whether I like it or not.</p><p>\u201cI can have it to you in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>True to his word, Clay walks into class two days later and hands me an oversized a cardboard folder and tells me not to open it until I get home. There\u2019s a part of me that almost hoped he had forgotten or that it was a bad dream and I had never really asked. Then he shows me another drawing he\u2019s added to his portfolio and now I know where Sunshine has been for the past two days.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed,\u201d I tell him, handing it back.</p><p>\u201cAm I the only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019s looking at me skeptically and I know this was a huge mistake, but it\u2019s one I can\u2019t take back now. \u201cI just wanted a picture. I wouldn\u2019t have asked if I knew you were going to be such a dick about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says, and for a moment, smug Clay is gone. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell her.\u201d</p><p>I accept this and we don\u2019t speak for a minute during which time my brain leaves my body and deserts me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cYou asking me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner at Drew\u2019s at six.\u201d I\u2019ve officially gone batshit crazy. Drew\u2019s parents are out of town this weekend, but his mom made a ton of food and insisted that we still do Sunday dinner. Then they decided to come home early, so Drew moved it to tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d Clay agrees. \u201cFirst the picture and now this? I will not be a victim in whatever self-destruction you have planned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can stalk the object of your obsession some more.\u201d I tilt my head toward his sketchbook. \u201cBring Yearbook Michelle if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize Drew will shit if Michelle and I show up at his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I\u2019ll take control any way I can get it now. I may not be able to prevent some random psychotic from finding me in some random location at some random time, but I can control what I do to him when he gets there.</p><p>I\u2019ve taken enough self-defense classes over the past two years to know that there were several things I could have done that day. I\u2019m no martial arts expert. Not even close. All I really know are a couple of difficult, but seriously awesome takedown maneuvers, along with some key dirty street-fighting moves; but even those may have been enough. I could have gouged his eyes or crushed his windpipe or boxed his ears or kneed him in the groin or employed the always classic gold standard\u200c\u2014\u200cscream and run like hell. I didn\u2019t do any of those things. Know what I did? I smiled and said hi. Because I was polite. And stupid.</p><p>Drew\u2019s driveway is empty when Josh and I pull up. Josh picks up the cupcake carrier\u200c\u2014\u200ca gift to me from Margot for no particular reason\u200c\u2014\u200cand carries it in to the house while I follow. I try not to smile, because I\u2019m used to seeing him carrying lumber, so a pink plastic cupcake carrier is something different entirely. Drew and Sarah are in the kitchen where Mrs. Leighton would usually be. I can smell dinner immediately. Italian.</p><p>\u201cJosh,\u201d Sarah bites out as soon as we walk in. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to reheat food no higher than three hundred-fifty degrees?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll heat faster at four-fifty,\u201d Drew argues.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll dry out,\u201d Sarah lilts in a sing-song voice. It seems like this argument has been going on for a while. She glances over at me and I get the disgusted look she seems to save just for me.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what it is, but yeah, it\u2019ll probably dry out,\u201d Josh says, moving around them to put the cupcakes on the counter. The kitchen is stifling from the heat coming off of both compartments in the double oven and I wonder if the meticulously-piped Swiss buttercream on those cupcakes can survive. My hand didn\u2019t freak out at all while I was doing it, so they look perfect.</p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Sarah says in Drew\u2019s face, triumphantly walking over to the oven to lower the temperature. I guess Josh\u2019s word holds when it comes to reheating food as well.</p><p>\u201cSuck it,\u201d Drew says.</p><p>\u201cYour girlfriend\u2019s here. Ask her.\u201d Sarah smiles overly sweetly at me before disappearing down the hall towards her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI hate her,\u201d Drew says, but he lets the girlfriend comment go.</p><p>I look around the kitchen at the number of bowls and dishes littering the countertop. Mrs. Leighton must have known it would end up being more than the four of us because she made enough food for an army.</p> <p>Within the next fifteen minutes, the doorbell rings four more times. Piper walks in first, dressed in an outfit she must have coordinated with Sarah. She says hi to Drew and Josh before she heads to Sarah\u2019s room without acknowledging me. Her arrival is followed by Damien Brooks and Chris Jenkins. Chris I know from hammer-wielding shop fame. He looks at me awkwardly and says hi. Ever since the hammer incident, he\u2019s tried to ignore me even more. I wasn\u2019t sure that was even possible, but he\u2019s been doing an admirable job. Damien I\u2019ve seen around but never met. He looks at my chest but doesn\u2019t say anything. Chris has a case of beer in each hand. Damien has a twelve pack in his left and a bottle of tequila in his right. Clearly Drew gave them a very different description of Sunday dinner, and now I get why he moved it up to Friday. Of course, I may also have been a little more creative with the invitation I issued to Tierney Lowell in the bathroom a few days ago. When the doorbell rings for the third time, I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s expecting her.</p><p>I was in the girls\u2019 restroom at the far end of the foreign language hallway on Wednesday. Tierney must have seen me and followed me in, because she obviously wasn\u2019t using the facilities. When I got done washing my hands, she handed me a paper towel with a gesture so full of menace that I had to respect her, because anyone who can make handing you a paper towel look like a threat, is impressive. Of course, she still hadn\u2019t stopped glaring at me, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude, so I glared back. It was so completely absurd that I wanted to laugh. It took a serious amount of throat clenching to keep from erupting, but I had invested myself in that particular stare-fest and I don\u2019t like to lose. She obviously had something to say, so I wished she would just get on with it, because she wasn\u2019t going to intimidate me no matter how many rumors I had heard about her: drug dealing, illegal abortions, knife wielding. I even heard she brings glass to the beach.</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe any of it and I was kind of hoping she would stop looking at me like I poisoned her grandmother. I really kind of like Tierney and I wish she\u2019d like me too, because to be honest, it would be nice to have a female friend to not talk to sometimes.</p><p>\u201cYou must know a lot of tricks for him to keep you around this long.\u201d Mystery solved. Drew. I\u2019d say, of course, like I should have gotten it all along, except I couldn\u2019t have known, because, even now, I\u2019m just not seeing it. If she and Drew had, in fact, hooked up like Josh said\u200c\u2014\u200cand with Drew anything is possible\u200c\u2014\u200cshe doesn\u2019t seem like the type who would be much for sticking around, either. I don\u2019t see Tierney Lowell being the kind of person who\u2019s going to let anyone, much less Drew Leighton, take advantage of her. I so wished I was more in the loop on things because I wanted the rest of that story. Badly.</p><p>Crap. I was going to have to write a note. It was rule breaking, but I chalked it up to absolute necessity; life-threateningly unavoidable, because otherwise my curiosity would kill me. I grabbed the notebook she was holding and pulled a pen out of my purse. I decided to jump off a cliff with this one and go for broke because there was only one reason this girl was cornering me in the bathroom, and it was pure, undiluted jealousy. Do you still love him? I wrote on the paper and shoved it at her, feeling seriously melodramatic.</p><p>She gaped at me, her eyes narrowing and her voice laced with forced venom, \u201cI never loved him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t laugh like it was the most absurd suggestion on Earth, so I grabbed the paper back and scribbled down the invitation. Bunch of us hanging out at Drew\u2019s Sunday at 6. That was a logistical note, so it was totally acceptable.</p><p>She read it and looked back at me with unveiled skepticism, clearly familiar with the Leighton family tradition. \u201cThey do Sunday dinner.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and pointed back down at the note again, hoping that would convince her. I knew she wasn\u2019t totally buying the fact that I wasn\u2019t trying to lure her into some plot involving pig\u2019s blood and public humiliation, but I could tell she was interested, too. I walked out wondering which part of her would win out.</p><p>Unlike everyone else so far, Tierney is the only one who waits to be let in. I wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d show; I shoved another note in her locker yesterday after Drew changed the plans, but I didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d even seen it. When Josh opens the door, she looks almost nervous, standing on the porch, wearing a short denim skirt and two purple spaghetti strap camisoles layered one on top of the other. She really is a pretty girl; she just always looks mad, but maybe that\u2019s just when she\u2019s looking at me.</p><p>\u201cTierney?\u201d Josh asks, because it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t know who she is, but he\u2019s certainly wondering why she\u2019s here. I watch to see how he reacts but it\u2019s Josh, and as usual, he gives nothing away. He could have opened the door to two hyenas ha**ng s*x and he wouldn\u2019t have changed his expression.</p><p>I would have pressed him for more details about Drew and Tierney the other day, but he gets weird when I ask questions about Drew, so I figured I\u2019d have to be patient and wait until tonight.</p><p>\u201cI was invited,\u201d she says, not wanting to look pathetic, like she just showed up at Drew\u2019s house hoping to see him because his parents were out of town and I feel kind of shitty for putting her in this position. Josh doesn\u2019t say anything else. He just opens the door further and lets her walk in. She catches me watching from the dining room but does nothing more than check out my outfit before heading back to the kitchen. Tierney knows exactly where she\u2019s going in this house.</p><p>I try to nonchalantly catch up with her before she gets to the kitchen. I want to see Drew\u2019s reaction. As soon as she walks through the doorless entryway, I hear Damien Brooks yell, \u201cT-Lo in the house!\u201d removing all doubt as to his immense douchery. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, sexy? Didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d She shifts her attention as Drew returns from putting the rest of the beer in the garage refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cTierney,\u201d Drew says, tamping down his initial surprise.</p><p>\u201cDrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we expecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour,\u201d she pauses and motions toward me, \u201cshe invited me.\u201d</p><p>I knew that was coming. Drew walks over and puts his arm around my waist and pulls me up against him. I\u2019m used to his possessive displays by now so I just go with it. Josh\u2019s eyes shift to Drew\u2019s hand around my waist before he walks away.</p><p>\u201cFunny, she didn\u2019t mention it,\u201d Drew says, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he thinks it\u2019s funny. His fingers tighten just slightly against the bare skin on my stomach where my shirt\u2019s ridden up. I push him away and flip him off, trying to play it off like this is just something we do, which I guess it kind of is, but he still needs to watch it and I make sure my expression tells him so.</p><p>\u201cLater, Nastypants. I promise.\u201d He\u2019s talking to me but he\u2019s still looking at Tierney. \u201cRight now I have a dinner to host!\u201d He claps his hands dramatically to get everyone\u2019s attention which he already has anyway. \u201cYou know the rules. Everybody helps!\u201d Within moments, this mish-mashed group of us, from preppy and prissy to slutty and scandalous, is doing just that. We are all pulling out dishes, pouring drinks, and making trips back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room. Damien Brooks is standing at the counter slicing loaves of garlic bread and Tierney Lowell is hovering over the dining room table making flawless napkin fans. It\u2019s surreal. Mrs. Leighton would be proud.</p><p>By the time Clay and Yearbook Michelle show up, no one is shockable anymore.</p><p>\u201cSomething you want to tell me?\u201d Josh whispers so only I can hear as we walk side by side into the dining room, carrying plates and silverware. Is he angry? I can\u2019t tell. I know I was out of line with the Tierney thing, but if anything, Drew is the one who should be upset about that. I don\u2019t answer, grateful for the fact that we\u2019re surrounded by other people so I don\u2019t have to respond. Who knows how this whole evening is going to turn out anyway? It\u2019s like The Breakfast Club in a powder keg in here and I\u2019m wondering who\u2019s going to light the match.</p><p>Turns out, dinner is amazing, at least the eating part. The food is so good and there\u2019s so damn much of it that most of us spend the entire time with our mouths full, which leaves little opportunity for conversation and that can only be a good thing. My first impression was that Mrs. Leighton had gone a little overboard with the amount of food she left, but watching how much teenage boys can put away is starting to make me wonder if there\u2019s enough. I\u2019ve seen Josh and Drew eat and I thought that was something, but they\u2019ve got nothing on Damien and Chris who are inhaling everything on the table. I almost feel like pushing my plate of half-eaten food over to them lest they walk away hungry. I\u2019m wondering if I can sneak into the kitchen unnoticed and hide half of the cupcakes now, because I\u2019m going to need the sugar to get through the rest of this night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josh</p><p>Everyone ends up on the couches in the family room once dinner has been cleaned up. The beer already has a good dent in it and the bottle of tequila that piece of shit Damien Brooks brought is looming over the coffee table like a bad omen.</p><p>Sarah drank two beers during dinner and she\u2019s already acting ridiculous. Two more and she\u2019ll be face first on the carpet. The good thing about Sarah drinking is that, when she does, she stops being such a bitch for a few minutes and I remember why I actually liked her once and why I hate how she\u2019s become.</p><p>I look around for Sunshine and see her coming out from the kitchen, passing Damien who grabs her arm for some reason to stop her. I don\u2019t even know what happens, except that about one point five seconds later, Damien is face first on the ground with her knee pressed into his back. Then, just as quickly, she\u2019s off him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the f**k was that?\u201d he whines, pushing himself up from the ground and acting like nothing hurts, but it\u2019s obvious that something does. I\u2019d think it was funny if I hadn\u2019t seen her face. But I did, and I know there\u2019s nothing funny about it. She\u2019s backed against the wall, and I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s terrified or enraged. I try to catch her eye to see if she\u2019s ok, but I think she\u2019s purposely not looking at me. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a way for me to get her out of here for a few minutes, but I don\u2019t even get a chance to come up with anything.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to teach me how to do that!\u201d Sarah\u2019s eyes go wide and she looks at Nastya for the first time with something other than disgust. It\u2019s pure awe. I\u2019m kind of in awe myself. Damien is bigger than all of us and everyone is bigger than Sunshine.</p><p>Tierney looks sideways at Drew. \u201cI\u2019d like to get in on that, too.\u201d</p><p>The next hour becomes an impromptu self-defense demonstration. All the furniture is pushed against the walls and we\u2019ve padded the floor down as well as possible.</p><p>I get to play the role of predator and get the crap kicked out of me while Sunshine points out every vulnerable spot on my body, from eyeballs to lower ribs to groin\u200c\u2014\u200cwhich I like the idea of having her hands on, but I won\u2019t even let her pretend to hurt\u200c\u2014\u200cto feet. There\u2019s no doubt that I got the shit end of the stick here. Thankfully, she doesn\u2019t really want to hurt me, but she does seem extremely serious about making sure they get what she\u2019s showing them to do. There\u2019s no question that she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a joke.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I might break you,\u201d I say when she makes me come at her again. Really I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s going to break me. She\u2019s freakishly strong.</p><p>She snatches a piece of paper from the counter, scribbles on it and shoves it at me. Her eyes are narrowed in challenge and I try not to smile.</p><p>You\u2019ll have to try harder than that to break me. Quit being a pu**y!!!!!</p><p>She\u2019s daring me because she thinks I\u2019m not really trying to hurt her. She\u2019s right; I\u2019m not. Every time, I plan to go at her full force, but I can\u2019t and I pull back some. She has to be mad if she\u2019s actually writing it down, so I try harder. Finally, I go at her like I really want to take her down. The only person who ends up down is me. She must have practiced this move a thousand times; I have no idea how she even did it. The sad part is, I think that time she pulled back for me.</p><p>Then, before everyone scatters, she picks up the paper and starts writing again. I think she\u2019s writing something to me, because it\u2019s odd for her to be writing at all. But when she\u2019s done, she hands it to Sarah and the other girls, then immediately turns away to start picking up the pillows off the floor.</p><p>We try to put the room back together, but it\u2019s a half-assed job. Once the couches are back in place, we figure it\u2019s good enough. Sarah lays Sunshine\u2019s note down on an end table when she goes back to the kitchen for another beer, and I finally get a look at it. She\u2019s written the name of the martial arts studio she goes to and a phone number and then underneath that, only a few words, written in all caps \u2013</p> <p>RUN FIRST AND RUN FAST.</p><p>Drew sits down on one end of the couch and pulls Nastya into the seat next to him. I settle on the other side of her. My leg presses up against hers when I sit, but she doesn\u2019t pull away and I don\u2019t either. I\u2019ve spent the last hour with her hands all over me; you would think that would be enough. But it\u2019s not even close to enough. It never is. Not like it matters, she\u2019ll probably be in Drew\u2019s lap by the end of the night anyway.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sarah slurs, putting another empty beer bottle on the counter and throwing herself onto the loveseat. \u201cLet\u2019s play truth or dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLame,\u201d Damien yells from the kitchen where he\u2019s opening every cabinet looking for shot glasses.</p><p>\u201cThat game sucks ass,\u201d Chris seconds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d play truth or dare,\u201d Drew says, running his fingers down Sunshine\u2019s arm and making me want to punch him.</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Sarah\u2019s already too far down the road to plastered to be skeptical.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if I were thirteen and a loser.\u201d</p> <p>Before Sarah can tell Drew to shut up, Tierney leans over the counter from the kitchen. \u201cAfraid of a game, Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear is coursing through my veins, T. Remind me again why you\u2019re here.\u201d He picks up Nastya\u2019s hand and kisses the back of it and then puts it down on his leg. I\u2019m hyperaware of every time he puts his hands on her and it\u2019s making me feel like some sort of obsessed stalker.</p><p>\u201cTo play truth or dare,\u201d she contends matter-of-factly, coming around the counter and grabbing the shot glasses from Damien\u2019s hands. She puts them on the table and fills them with tequila. \u201cEveryone plays. You cop out, you do a shot. Simple.\u201d She tops the last glass off and rights the bottle without losing a drop.</p><p>I\u2019d half expect Clay and Yearbook Michelle to be a little shell-shocked, but they look more amused than anything. I imagine if you\u2019re just a spectator here, this whole evening would be pretty damn entertaining.</p><p>\u201cOK, Drew. Truth or dare?\u201d We\u2019re four rounds in and this one comes from Chris. Things started getting ugly after the first round and the tension in this room is starting to wear on me. I\u2019m ready to go home.</p><p>Sunshine is three shots down and way past half-lit. She picked truth every time and wouldn\u2019t even write the answers to anything. They asked her how many guys she\u2019d had sex with, how old she was when she lost her virginity, and the strangest place she\u2019s ever had sex. She took the shot every time. By the last round, when Piper switched off the sex topic and got bold enough to ask why she doesn\u2019t talk, I stood up and took the shot for her.</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d Drew answers.</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take to get her to\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d Chris looks in Nastya\u2019s direction and cuts himself off.</p><p>\u201cTo what? Why ask the question if you can\u2019t even say it,\u201d Piper laughs mockingly.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s scared,\u201d Sarah giggles. \u201cHe knows she can kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a waste of a question anyway. Everyone knows she screwed him. Who cares when?\u201d Damien says.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Tierney counters. \u201cQuestion was asked. Answer it or shoot.\u201d</p><p>Drew looks at Nastya, and if I wasn\u2019t paying attention I might miss the exchange that goes on between the two of them, but I know that there was something unspoken happening that no one else picked up on. The whole thing bothers me and that bothers me even more.</p><p>\u201cTrevor Mason\u2019s party. Second week of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a couple months ago. Isn\u2019t that like a record Drew?\u201d Tierney asks, but she can\u2019t seem to force the malice she\u2019s going for into her tone.</p><p>Everyone is still talking, but I\u2019m not listening anymore. Trevor Mason\u2019s party is the one Drew got Sunshine so shit-faced at that she spent most of the night on my bathroom floor, and I got so scared that she had alcohol poisoning that I almost took her to the hospital. He f**ked her and I cleaned up her puke.</p><p>There\u2019s a part of me that wanted to believe that he had never touched her; at least not really touched her. But I didn\u2019t ask, because only a part of me believed that. The other part of me knew that there was still a possibility that it had happened, and if it had, I didn\u2019t want the confirmation.</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d I say, not giving a shit how pissed I sound. \u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew just went and you have to give him a choice anyway,\u201d Piper whines, but no one else gets on the rule-enforcing train because they all want to know what the hell this is about. Except for Drew and Nastya, who look like they want to tell me to shut the hell up. It would be good advice. Too bad I don\u2019t listen.</p><p>\u201cTruth, Drew.\u201d I haven\u2019t taken my eyes off of him and I can feel the tension rolling off of Nastya. She pulls her hand away from Drew and subtly presses her leg against mine, but I don\u2019t want any part of it.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Drew says.</p><p>\u201cDid you f**k her before or after the party?\u201d He knows exactly why I\u2019m asking.</p><p>\u201cPour the shot, T,\u201d he says, not looking away. Maybe I\u2019m an idiot for thinking he wouldn\u2019t screw her when she was that drunk.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d The voice breaks me out of the stand-off I\u2019ve got going on with Drew, and I freeze, watching Leigh walk in. None of us even heard the front door open. I start racking my brain. Was I supposed to meet her? Did I even know she was coming? All of a sudden this room is a hundred times smaller and I feel very trapped. There\u2019s something about having Leigh and Sunshine in a room together that makes me imagine two planets colliding. World-ending destruction. I reached my drama threshold hours ago. This is the reason I avoid this kind of crap.</p><p>Leigh smiles, completely clueless about what she\u2019s walking into. It was bad before she got here, and this is just worse. I stand, out of instinct, as she approaches me. I can see Drew pull Nastya into his lap and whisper something in her ear. Her eyes just barely shift, and I haven\u2019t forgotten that I want an answer from him before I leave here.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask, trying not to sound as annoyed as I am, because Leigh hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, but I really, really don\u2019t want her here.</p><p>\u201cI came down last minute,\u201d she explains. \u201cI stopped by your house but you weren\u2019t there. Home Depot is closed,\u201d she smiles knowingly at me, \u201cso I figured you had to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cover for the fact that you wanted to see me, Leigh, but subtlety is always appreciated.\u201d If Drew thinks he\u2019s lightening the mood, he\u2019s an idiot.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed at all, have you?\u201d She smiles at Drew.</p><p>\u201cYou have. I think your tits got bigger.\u201d He lifts his chin towards her and then switches gears before she can respond. \u201cToo bad you missed an awesome game of truth or dare. We just finished.\u201d Maybe he\u2019s not such an idiot. His survival skills are kicking in. Leigh walking in gave him an out and he\u2019s taking it.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t played truth or dare since I was in middle school,\u201d Leigh laughs, sitting on the couch with Drew and Nastya and pulling me down with her so that there\u2019s not an inch of space between us. Nastya\u2019s eyes keep darting to Leigh but she won\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cWish we could say the same,\u201d Damien groans.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to mind when you were daring Piper to jerk you off in the closet,\u201d Sarah spits back.</p><p>\u201cWhat-the-fuck-ever.\u201d Tierney lets out an exaggerated breath. \u201cThere\u2019s way too much drama in this room. Enough with the tequila; it\u2019s just making you people worse.\u201d She tosses a bag of weed onto the coffee table and turns to Drew. \u201cI need a two-liter soda bottle, something to cut through plastic, a screen and a pitcher of water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dali has nothing on the scene that unfolds next in the Leighton living room. People who were trying to sabotage one another thirty minutes ago are now collaborating on a bong-making scavenger hunt. They keep bringing things to Tierney for approval like she\u2019s their ant queen or something. She checks out the pile of stuff in front of her. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know where to get one,\u201d Sarah says.</p><p>Tierney leaves the room and disappears down the hall. When she comes back a few minutes later, she\u2019s holding a small, round screen in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBathroom faucet,\u201d she answers, kneeling down in front of the coffee table and setting to work on building a gravity bong.</p><p>Halfway through, Piper eyes Tierney\u2019s progress suspiciously. \u201cI\u2019m not putting my mouth on that thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll put your hands on Damien\u2019s dick, but you won\u2019t put your mouth on this?\u201d Tierney looks almost disgusted by the waste and we get treated to another exasperated exhalation. \u201cYour loss. You get a bigger hit, but whatever.\u201d She looks around and her eyes settle on Damien. \u201cHere.\u201d She throws some rolling papers at him and tells him to roll Piper a joint, but he doesn\u2019t get far before she pushes him away because he\u2019s destroying it.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t roll a joint, don\u2019t try,\u201d Tierney snaps.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s that hard,\u201d he says defensively, but he doesn\u2019t fight her when she repos the papers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an art, jackass. Get out of my way.\u201d Tierney proceeds to roll the tightest joint I\u2019ve ever seen. She\u2019s right about it being an art and she\u2019s more than talented. I suck at rolling joints, not that it\u2019s something I do all the time, but it might be nice to have the skill.</p><p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s gotta be able to do something with their hands,\u201d Drew says, idly running his fingers through Sunshine\u2019s hair while Tierney glowers at him before resuming bong construction.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to watch her and not be impressed. She\u2019s completely focused, as if this is a high-tech operation she\u2019s in charge of, and she has total respect for it. Clay hasn\u2019t left her side and is making her explain every part of the process. He kind of reminds me of Sunshine in my garage. Tierney talks him through every step, instructing him not only what she\u2019s doing but the science of it as well. It\u2019s like watching the illegal substance version of physics class.</p><p>I try to focus on watching their progress so I don\u2019t obsess over the fact that Leigh is running her fingers up and down my thigh, and Sunshine is sitting right next to her with a front row seat.</p><p>When Tierney gets done, she hands the bong to Clay and looks almost proud of him. \u201cYou go first. You worked for it.\u201d Then she turns to the rest of the room and tells us we better lighten up because she\u2019s sick of all the angst and she\u2019s not wasting good weed on ass**les.</p><p>Leigh leans over and whispers something in my ear about finding a bedroom and then we\u2019re up and walking down the hall before I know what\u2019s going on. I make the mistake of turning back around to fortify myself with the picture of Drew all over Sunshine on the couch, but when I do, she\u2019s watching me. Unflinching. Making sure I have to answer for what I\u2019m about to do. Drew looks from her to me and tightens his arm around her waist so that she looks away just before I\u2019m out of her line of vision.</p> <p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>Josh</p><p>I walk Leigh out and return to the family room, wishing I was drunk or high like everyone else here. Sarah and Piper are gone, which means they\u2019re probably passed out in her room. Through the sliding glass door, I can see Michelle lying on the grass, staring at the sky. Or sleeping. I can\u2019t tell from here. The gravity bong is abandoned on the coffee table and Damien and Chris are still half-baked, trying to kill each other on the Playstation. Across the room, Tierney is giving Clay a lesson on joint rolling, and I hear him say something about wanting to draw her, which she laughs hysterically at. Drew is on the couch, staring at her. He looks up when he hears me and I can see the disgust take over his face. I don\u2019t need his. I have enough of my own.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d He\u2019s making sure I know I\u2019m an ass**le.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m tired and I want to go home and my tolerance for Drew\u2019s bullshit was running dangerously low hours ago.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question,\u201d he continues. My fist is tightening with every word and I force myself to loosen my hand. \u201cDo you care where she is? Did you care when you were in my guest room screwing another girl?\u201d I can\u2019t believe he has the balls to say any of this to me. It\u2019s not like Sunshine and I are together and he obviously knows that better than anyone.</p><p>Tierney is completely blitzed and struggling for clarity while she watches this play out.</p> <p>\u201cNot here, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Outside then.\u201d He gets up and he\u2019s surprisingly sober and I realize I haven\u2019t seen him touch anything since dinner hours ago. He never did take the shot he made Tierney pour when he refused to tell me whether Sunshine was drunk or not when they had sex.</p><p>\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d I lean up against the side of my truck and shove my hands in my pockets because I need something to do with them.</p><p>\u201cI took her home,\u201d he says. \u201cNow answer mine.\u201d He\u2019s not f**king around. He\u2019s pissed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the question I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Answer mine first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I care where she is,\u201d I mock his tone.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you were doing in the bedroom with Leigh? Caring?\u201d The sarcastic condescension is getting on my nerves. I don\u2019t care if I deserve it or not.</p><p>\u201cI was ending it,\u201d I tell him, even though I don\u2019t owe him an explanation. And the whole time I was wondering what the hell I was doing. I sat on the bed and looked at her green eyes and blonde hair and the perfect body that was mine whenever I wanted it, no strings attached. It was simple, convenient, uncomplicated. And I didn\u2019t want it anymore. OK, I wanted it, but wanting it had never involved a choice before today.</p><p>I leaned over and kissed her, hoping it would make every other thought go away. I closed my eyes, and for the first time since I had been with Leigh, it wasn\u2019t her face I was picturing. I didn\u2019t see blonde hair and green eyes and simple and uncomplicated. I saw dark hair, dark eyes, dark, complicated, frustrating, messed up everything. And the moment I broke away and opened my eyes to look at the girl pulling my shirt up over my head, I knew what I would lose if I did this. There was never a price before, but now there was and it wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even upset. No drama. No questions or tears. Just the same as I would have been if it had been the other way around. Ending things with Leigh was just like everything else had always been with Leigh \u2013 easy.</p><p>Even when I walked her out, I kept thinking how simple it would be to change my mind and take it back. And then screw her in the backseat of her car so that it would make it impossible for me to ever take anything back again.</p><p>\u201cThat changes things.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really know what it changes for Drew. I know that I just gave up getting laid because I felt guilty about a girl I don\u2019t even have.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you slept with her?\u201d I ask and I still want to know if he waited until she was wasted, because if he did, I\u2019ll seriously hurt him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t.\u201d Not the answer I was expecting.</p><p>\u201cYou said you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t take the truth part of truth or dare literally.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t disagree.\u201d I think back to the look exchanged between the two of them. He was asking her for permission but I don\u2019t get why she gave it to him.</p><p>\u201cWe have an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak it,\u201d I tell him, even though I have no right.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re all over her all the time. You make her look like a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I hardly think I\u2019m the only thing making her look like a whore. Second, if she asks me to stop, I\u2019ll stop. Otherwise, why should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m asking you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and I have a mutually beneficial relationship. Kind of like you and Leigh but we don\u2019t have sex. It works. Why would I give that up?\u201d He\u2019s not hiding the subtext.</p><p>\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t mean anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s mine and I don\u2019t want you touching her.\u201d I\u2019m a five year-old fighting over a toy. I feel like an idiot as soon as I say it, but it\u2019s said and it\u2019s true. And I don\u2019t want it to be.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says arrogantly.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid Josh. The two of you have been eye-fucking each other since the beginning of school. I wasn\u2019t going to do anything with her and she was never going to do anything with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why all the bullshit tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to hear you say it.\u201d He smiles and heads back toward the house. I\u2019m too relieved to be pissed at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you and Tierney?\u201d I ask when he gets to the porch.</p><p>\u201cTrying not to screw each other. Trying not to kill each other. Same thing that\u2019s always with me and Tierney.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m at Sunshine\u2019s house at nine o\u2019clock the next morning. We\u2019re supposed to have plans, but after last night I\u2019m not sure if we still do. I wait in the driveway because Margot probably just went to bed and I don\u2019t want to knock and wake her up.</p><p>When the door opens, Nastya comes out wearing a pink, flowered sundress and flat white sandals and I wonder who she is today. She gets in the truck and shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cShut up. It was a birthday present,\u201d she says before I can even comment.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you had to wear it.\u201d But I\u2019m glad you did.</p><p>\u201cI figured I should get something out of the intervention since I didn\u2019t take the phone. Besides, I spend so much time doing your laundry that I haven\u2019t gotten to any of mine.\u201d She buckles her seat belt and we\u2019re off without a word about last night.</p><p>We hit three antique stores by noon and I still haven\u2019t found anything remotely like the console table I\u2019m looking for. If she\u2019s true to form, Sunshine will start complaining around store number five. That\u2019s where her antiquing patience tends to run out. Store number four is a high end one, two towns west of us, and I have to promise her ice cream after this one to get her to leave the truck.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to just find what you\u2019re looking for on the internet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d I ask. She\u2019s right. It would be much easier, but I like the looking.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in this?\u201d She pulls open the door and exaggeratedly drags her feet inside.</p><p>\u201cYou know you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you, and no one makes you do anything you don\u2019t want to do. If you didn\u2019t want to come, you wouldn\u2019t come. And if you didn\u2019t come, you wouldn\u2019t be here. So it follows that if you didn\u2019t want to come, you would not be here right now. But you are here, so by the transitive property of Sunshine, you want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d I say nonchalantly and one side of her mouth turns up in response.</p><p>\u201cIt was worth coming just to hear that many words leave your mouth at one time. That may never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo remind me again why you can\u2019t join modern society and use the internet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrug because it\u2019ll probably sound stupid. \u201cI like finding things no one else is looking for.

It\u2019s worth whatever you\u2019re willing to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you even afford any of it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sell that much furniture?\u201d She looks impressed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I do okay with selling the furniture but not even close to this well. I don\u2019t have enough time.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She doesn\u2019t ask anything else, but I tell her anyway, even though it\u2019s the thing I hate mentioning the most.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much is a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillions.\u201d I watch her face. Millions. It sounds absurd. I\u2019ve never told anyone before. The only people who know are the ones who have always known. It feels weird to even say it out loud. I don\u2019t talk about the money. I try not to even think about the money. I have a lawyer, two accountants and a financial adviser who worry about it for me. If they handed it all over to me tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it. I\u2019d probably end up hiding it under the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t have a problem getting emancipated,\u201d she says dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not lying.\u201d She studies my face and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t spend any of it.\u201d It\u2019s not a question.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad never wanted to touch it so I try not to as much as possible. I use what I have to for paying the bills because I can\u2019t make enough to live on while I\u2019m in school.\u201d I can\u2019t say I hate that it\u2019s there, because I do need it. But I hate what it means, and I\u2019ll never let myself be happy about it.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy anything with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought my truck last year when my dad\u2019s old one finally kicked it. And I bought an antique table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark one on the far wall of the living room near the sliding glass door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark one? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually you get all flowery and descriptive and talking about the curves of the wood and the symmetry of the lines and the marriage of form and function.\u201d She puts on a pretentious tone and waves her hand around in the air.</p> <p>\u201cI talk like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you talk about wood and furniture you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sound like a pompous ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the shoe fits.\u201d</p><p>She moves on to the back of the store where they keep the shelves with all of the ceramics and vases and lamps. \u201cI have to be home by five,\u201d she says, turning over the three-thousand dollar price tag on a hideous lamp with a base that looks like a harlequin. \u201cI need this,\u201d she adds sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWhy five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to meet Drew to do debate research. There\u2019s another tournament coming up. State possession of nuclear weapons. Exciting stuff.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought about Drew since this morning and I don\u2019t really want to bring him into this now; but knowing him, he\u2019s probably going to say something to her tonight and I have to do pre-emptive damage control.</p><p>\u201cAbout last night,\u201d I start, and I realize how clich\u00e9 that sounds. Now I know why. She doesn\u2019t stop her intense examination of an ugly ass vase but I know she\u2019s listening. She\u2019s always listening. \u201cI told Drew to keep his hands off of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d This must interest her more than the vase because she turns around.</p><p>\u201cBecause everyone talks shit about you because of it.\u201d And I\u2019m jealous, which is the real reason, because neither of us really cares about the crap people say. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my business so I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he agreed?\u201d She looks a combination of shocked and amused.</p><p>\u201cNot without persuasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of methods do you have that would work on Drew?\u201d she laughs.</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d I say, even though I\u2019m lying now. \u201cI told him you were mine.\u201d</p><p>No response, so I keep talking. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to act like you were an action figure or something.\u201d</p><p>I wait for some sort of reaction, but there is none. She turns the price tag around on a jewelry box so it\u2019s facing the right way and puts it back.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s Lara Croft, we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I smile, but it\u2019s weak. \u201cAnatomically correct, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she says, heading back up to the front of the store. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to buy me the three-thousand dollar clown lamp, we need to get going. You promised me ice cream.\u201d</p><p>After the ice cream, I drag her to one more hole in the wall antique store in the old part of town and then we head back. The iridescent painted cat she insisted I buy her is between us on the seat and I can\u2019t wait to get home because it\u2019s scaring the crap out of me. I think she saw the fear in my eyes when she picked it up at the store, and after that, there was no way she was walking out without it. I told her I\u2019d rather buy her a bracelet to replace the one she lost on her birthday, because I really did feel shitty about that, but she said no. She said it would be inappropriate, whatever that means. I guess nightmarish ceramic cats are acceptable because that\u2019s what she\u2019s got. Every time she looks at it she smiles and it\u2019s worth ten times what I paid for it.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d I say, just to have something to say while she\u2019s digging her keys out of her purse.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the cat.\u201d She smiles again, picking it up and holding it up to her face. \u201cI named him Voldemort.\u201d She puts it in her lap like it\u2019s a real cat and for a minute I\u2019m afraid it might actually bite her.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d I say, and I mean it, even if it sounds dumb.</p><p>She cradles the cat under her arm and reaches for the door handle, stopping to look at me before she jumps out.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d she says, her smile fading as her eyes lock onto mine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Josh\u2019s garage is open when I drive by on my way home from Drew\u2019s. He\u2019s on a stool hand sanding a piece of wood. He must be desperate to get whatever it is done, because he usually leaves the sanding for me.</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d he asks when I take the sandpaper out of his hand to check the grit before handing it back. I pull another sheet of it out of the cabinet and sit down next to him.</p><p>\u201cFor tonight.\u201d I hold a piece of wood up to him. \u201cWith or against?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the grain on all of these.\u201d He motions to the wood pieces between us on the work bench.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d I tilt my head toward the pile of cut wood while I attach the paper to a sanding block.</p><p>\u201cBookshelf. For Sarah\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>I nod and start working on one of the shelf pieces.</p><p>\u201cYou changed,\u201d he says, after a few minutes of listening to nothing but the lullaby of sandpaper on wood.</p><p>I look down at the jeans and black t-shirt I put on after he dropped me off and shrug.</p><p>\u201cProbably a good idea. Drew would never have been able to concentrate with you in that dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame him? I am distractingly pretty.\u201d I deadpan, just to get him off of the subject of Drew and me. It never ends well. Besides, the dress was for Josh, not Drew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to forget about that are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to?\u201d I have a list of things I\u2019d like to forget, but that isn\u2019t on it. I\u2019ve replayed it in my head a thousand times. Maybe because he didn\u2019t say beautiful, or stunning, or gorgeous or any crap like that. He said pretty, and pretty I might actually be able to believe.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever said and I\u2019d like you to,\u201d he half-snaps and it slingshots my mind back to the picture of him disappearing down the hall last night with one of the most beautiful girls I\u2019ve ever seen. Blonde, tan, all lit up and everything I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cConsider it forgotten.\u201d I finish sanding one side of the shelf I had been working on and place it back on the counter. I step off the stool and brush the dust off my pants and I can feel him watching. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I should go.\u201d I didn\u2019t stay here after last night and I\u2019m sure as hell not staying here tonight.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow?\u201d he says as I walk toward my car.</p><p>I wave over my shoulder, but I don\u2019t look back.</p><p>Josh</p><p>I\u2019m in her driveway before she can get her key in the door. I left my house as soon as she was off my street, because f**k if I can do this anymore.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>She opens the door and steps inside and I follow her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things if you don\u2019t mean them. I\u2019m not that pathetic that I need empty compliments.\u201d She locks the door behind me and throws her purse onto the front table along with a can of pepper spray and that baton key holder thing she always carries around.</p><p>\u201cI did mean it. It was just stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Even better. You\u2019re on a roll. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make this easy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the nicest thing anyone\u2019s said to me since I\u2019ve been here and you took it away. So, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>I know I did. I can tell. She can\u2019t cover the hurt in her expression, even though I know she\u2019s trying.</p><p>\u201cYou know I meant it. I am human. And male. And not remotely blind. Do you want me to say it again? You are distractingly, even-if-that-is-not-a-real-word, pretty. You are so pretty that I bullied Clay Whitaker into drawing me a picture of you so I could look at you when you aren\u2019t around. You are so pretty that one of these days I\u2019m going to lose a finger in my garage because I can\u2019t concentrate with you so close to me. You are so pretty that I wish you weren\u2019t so I wouldn\u2019t want to hit every guy at school who looks at you, especially my best friend.\u201d I stop to catch my breath. \u201cMore? I can keep going.\u201d I can keep going, but even as I say all of this, I know it\u2019s not quite true. She\u2019s not just distractingly pretty. She\u2019s the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen and I want to touch her so badly right now that it\u2019s almost impossible to keep my hands from reaching out and doing it.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Her eyes are searching mine like she doesn\u2019t quite believe me and they\u2019re so wide that I think I could walk right into them if she\u2019d let me. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my clothes at your house a hundred times. You never try to look. I sleep in your bed. You never come near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were waiting for permission?\u201d She looks at me like I\u2019m insane and I wonder if I am.</p><p>\u201cI said I was male. I didn\u2019t say I was an ass**le.\u201d The silence that used to be so comfortable is torture right now so I fill it. \u201cI\u2019m not Drew.\u201d</p><p>She picks up the baton thing and starts swinging it around and I realize that it\u2019s a weapon. Her keys are attached to one end of it and they\u2019re spinning so fast that they\u2019re nothing but a blur. I want to reach out and still it, but I think if it hit me it would seriously hurt. \u201cDrew\u2019s not really an ass**le; he just plays one on TV,\u201d she says, shaking her head and wincing. \u201cSorry. That wasn\u2019t even remotely funny.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot even a little,\u201d I smile. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. He\u2019s really not an ass**le.\u201d I don\u2019t know why it makes me happy that she sees that about him, but it does.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we talking about Drew?\u201d Good question, Sunshine. Because it\u2019s easy. Because if we stop, we\u2019re going to have to deal with what we\u2019re doing here and neither of us knows how. We suck at this.</p><p>\u201cWill you have dinner with me tomorrow night?\u201d I spit the words out before I can talk myself out of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. We always have dinner together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Just us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to Drew\u2019s?\u201d She looks confused.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I definitely do not want to go to Drew\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Are you still pissed about the sex thing? He said he told you it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to ask you out and you\u2019re making it really impossible.\u201d</p> <p>She stops spinning the baton. \u201cWhy would you ask me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what people do? Go on dates?\u201d People still do that, right? Leigh never expected movies and dinner first, so I really don\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been on a date.\u201d And it\u2019s swinging again.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. Never really had a chance. My life hasn\u2019t exactly been what you\u2019d classify as normal. How many dates have you been on?\u201d Her defensiveness is kicking in.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d My life hasn\u2019t been quite normal, either. \u201cGuess we\u2019re both freaks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we established that a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s pretend. One night. We\u2019ll go out and pretend we\u2019re normal.\u201d We never even left the foyer, so I\u2019m still right next to the door, but I\u2019m not ready to open it yet. She looks scared. Like she thinks this is a very bad idea and any second now she\u2019s going to say so. I put my hands on either side of her face so she has to look at me. \u201cOne night,\u201d I repeat, not giving her a chance to formulate an excuse. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow.\u201d I press my lips to her forehead, even though that\u2019s not where I want them at all.</p><p>\u201cAre you still with her?\u201d she whispers, and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think to tell her. Actually, I can, because I\u2019ve never discussed Leigh with her. Not once. I wonder if it\u2019s been in her head this whole conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNot even just for\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d she stops and looks uncomfortable and I kind of want to laugh because some of the conversations she has with Drew would make a p**n star blush, but she can\u2019t spit this out. Looking at her now, I\u2019m forced to admit to the vulnerability that she\u2019s always been hiding behind every sexual innuendo and under every tight black dress.</p><p>\u201cNot for anything. I promise.\u201d I trace my thumb under her bottom lip and back away before I let myself kiss her, because I\u2019ve been waiting to kiss her for months and I don\u2019t want to do it standing in the foyer while she has a weapon in her hand and we just got done talking about Leigh.</p><p>She nods and looks embarrassed for asking, but she shouldn\u2019t be. I would have needed to know if it was the other way around.</p><p>\u201cSo, tomorrow. You and me. Normal. All right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She smiles, but it\u2019s not even a real smile, just the vague idea of one.</p><p>I turn toward the door, but she stops me.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to wear?\u201d</p><p>I shrug because I don\u2019t even know where we\u2019re going yet.</p><p>\u201cWear something normal.\u201d</p><p>I pull up to my house just in time to see Clay Whitaker walking back to his car in my driveway. He looks nervous when he sees me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. I didn\u2019t even know he knew where I lived.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me what you thought of the picture.\u201d Nice try, Clay, but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.</p><p>\u201cPicture was perfect, Clay. You know it was. What do you want? Because you don\u2019t do subtle well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you have me draw it?\u201d</p><p>I feel like every single person I know wants a confession from me tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to walk in that house right now and give you your damn picture back so I never have to hear a f**king word about it again.\u201d I start toward the front porch and the motion sensors kick the lights on.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see her face.\u201d He\u2019s not talking about the picture anymore. He\u2019s talking about at Drew\u2019s when I walked away with Leigh and he\u2019s wrong. I did see her face and it was awful and it would be nice if everyone would let me forget it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about that girl that makes everyone think they have some sort of ownership or obligation to protect her?\u201d Me, included. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed she should probably be the one protecting all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew and I maybe. Not sure about you.\u201d He\u2019s kicking an invisible rock back and forth with his foot and I start looking around for one of my own.</p><p>\u201cFine, Clay. Tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d He\u2019s shocked. So am I. \u201cYou do realize that g*y teenage boys and straight teenage girls are not interchangeable, right? Same strategies don\u2019t really work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d I\u2019m trying to figure out how I got to the point where I\u2019m standing in my driveway, asking Clay Whitaker for advice. How is it that with everything that\u2019s happened in my life, this girl is going to be the thing that undoes me?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done this before?\u201d he asks with more than a little disbelief.</p><p>I look at him like the insulting idiot that he is, especially in light of what he thinks I was doing last night with Leigh. \u201cI\u2019ve done that before. I just haven\u2019t done this before.\u201d I motion back and forth between myself and the direction of Nastya\u2019s house even though he probably has no idea what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never just gone out with a girl?\u201d He laughs but I\u2019m not seeing the humor and I make sure my expression tells him so. \u201cOK, not funny. Seriously, why don\u2019t you just ask Drew for advice?\u201d He considers that for a moment. \u201cScratch that. Never mind.\u201d He walks over and leans up against the door of his car. \u201cOkay, then. What does she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning and ice cream. And hitting things. And names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the whole sweat and adrenaline rush from the running might be nice for foreplay but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to play well on a first date. You\u2019d be better off going with ice cream. Very chaste. Like her.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being serious.\u201d He stops and I can tell he\u2019s trying to decide something. \u201cHow do you know so much about her anyway? She doesn\u2019t even talk.\u201d It\u2019s almost like what I said to Mrs. Leighton, but Clay\u2019s intentions are different.</p><p>\u201cAlready did the ice cream thing.\u201d I ignore his question.</p><p>\u201cThen it looks like you\u2019re down to hitting things.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Is it sad to be going on a first date at eighteen years old? I thought about texting Josh to cancel at least six times today. At one point I finally did text him that I couldn\u2019t go because I had nothing to wear. He texted me right back \u2013</p><p>Nothing sounds good c u at 4</p><p>So now I\u2019m stuck. The only thing that makes me feel better is that Josh seems to be as socially inept as me. Except that he talks. So I guess he gets the edge. But still. I really need him. I don\u2019t want to mess this up. It\u2019s bad enough that my brain is a cesspool; I can\u2019t imagine the hellhole my heart would be if he wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>Since wearing nothing isn\u2019t really a viable option, I\u2019m back to square one. I have absolutely no idea what to wear. My fashion sense isn\u2019t lacking. It\u2019s nonexistent. I went from recital clothes to recovery clothes to repulsive clothes. I\u2019ve never done normal. I don\u2019t even know what that is. This is where the female friend thing would come in. I would have sucked it up and written a note asking Margot to help me, but the whole idea was kind of last minute and she had plans this afternoon so she\u2019s not even home. Which means my closet and I are on our own.</p><p>My closet is of no use to me. It may actually be laughing at me. It\u2019s true. I hear it. Other than the sundress I wore yesterday, I\u2019m out of options in the normal department. I look at my clothes. Black, black, some more black. I don\u2019t want to wear any of it. I don\u2019t want to look like Nastya Kashnikov tonight. I don\u2019t want to be a Russian whore. I don\u2019t want to look like Emilia, either. Maybe for tonight I could just be someone else. Some third girl I haven\u2019t met yet.</p><p>I realize with a craptastic amount of horror that I am going to have to go to the mall. I throw on one of the eight variations of tight black t-shirts I own and a pair of jeans and head out.</p><p>Only I don\u2019t end up at the mall. I end up at Drew\u2019s. The God that I have recently come to think might hate me is smiling on me today because Sarah isn\u2019t home. But then neither is Drew. Mrs. Leighton opens the door. I look at her stomach which seems to have grown exponentially since the last time I saw her.</p><p>\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d she says and she\u2019s the only person on Earth I don\u2019t have the urge to smack for calling me sweetie. She lets me in after explaining that Drew and Sarah went out on a friend\u2019s boat with Mr. Leighton. She pours lemonade and we sit at the breakfast bar and stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she says after a few minutes, and I\u2019d gotten so accustomed to the quiet that I almost fall off the stool. She grabs for my hand and I yank it back out of instinct before I can think about it. I feel like a fool but she ignores it. \u201cI just wanted you to feel the baby kick,\u201d she says reaching for my hand and letting me meet her halfway. She places it on her stomach and it\u2019s the weirdest feeling in the world. I almost expect an alien to burst through her abdomen at any moment.</p><p>\u201cFeel it?\u201d she looks at me expectantly. I pull my hand back. I can\u2019t help but see the hurt on her face but I\u2019m too afraid I might start crying and I can\u2019t keep my hand there anymore. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI just get a little excited. You\u2019d think the third time around it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but it never gets old. It\u2019s my favorite part.\u201d It would probably be mine, too, but I won\u2019t ever get to find out. Maybe I never would have wanted one anyway, but the deciding would have been nice. The piece of shit who took my hand took that, too.</p><p>All I wanted was to figure out what to wear on a date I probably shouldn\u2019t even be going on and I don\u2019t know how I ended up with my hand on Mrs. Leighton\u2019s stomach, feeling her baby kick and fighting back tears.</p><p>Mrs. Leighton doesn\u2019t do well with the silence. She\u2019s a space filler. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just found out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pad of paper and a pen next to the phone on the counter. I pick it up and write.</p><p>Name?</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter Jack\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>I smile because I know that one. Pure, unsullied I scrawl and hand it to her.</p><p>She returns the smile. \u201cDrew said you had a thing with names. What does mine mean? Lexie, well, Alexa, really. Do you know?\u201d</p><p>Defender I scribble and underneath You. Then, before she asks, I give her Drew\u2019s \u2013 masculine, manly and Sarah\u2019s \u2013 princess. She rolls her eyes and laughs. \u201cSelf-fulfilling prophecies, you think?\u201d The quiet returns and then she asks, \u201cWhat about Josh?\u201d I think there\u2019s more to that question than she\u2019s letting on but she\u2019s testing the waters.</p><p>Salvation, I write. She looks at the word and nods. And for a minute she looks as sad as I feel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat fits, I think.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what she means so I put down the pen. I\u2019ve written too much for one day already.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou came over?\u201d</p><p>I think about asking her for help with the dress situation. She could help me. She would help me. But I can\u2019t ask for it. I shake my head and climb off the stool. I still have time to make it to the mall and pull something together.</p> <p>She walks me to the door but doesn\u2019t open it. When she turns, her eyes are soft like her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, people always think it\u2019s the girls who are desperate to change the boys, to make them a better person, to be the thing they need.\u201d She\u2019s looking at me like I must understand what she\u2019s talking about, but maybe I\u2019m just dense because I have no freaking clue.</p><p>\u201cJosh may seem like a very old man sometimes. But at the end of the day, he\u2019s still a teenage boy and he wants what all teenage boys want.\u201d She stops when I narrow my eyes at her and then laughs. \u201cNot that. Get your mind out of the gutter. No. To be the hero. To save the girl. To save you.\u201d She pauses to heighten the effect of the fact that she\u2019s casting me as the damsel in distress in this particular scenario. \u201cBut for Josh, he doesn\u2019t just want that, he needs it. He needs to be able to fix things and make it all better; to believe that you\u2019re okay so that he can believe that he\u2019s okay. And if he can\u2019t,\u201d she raises her eyebrows and leaves the thought hanging in the air like a guilt trip and I really don\u2019t know the point of this speech. Anyone who wants to save me is going to need a time machine because that dream is dead. No one was there to save me last time and if I end up needing to be saved from anything else, I\u2019ll do it myself, thank you very much.</p><p>I turn to leave and she opens up the door. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to give her a pass due to pregnancy hormones and then\u200c\u2014\u200c</p><p>\u201cI think you and I both know it\u2019s Josh who needs saving. Have a good time tonight.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to be freaking kidding me.</p><p>Josh knocks on the door at exactly four o\u2019clock. I still don\u2019t know why we\u2019re leaving so early. We can\u2019t be having dinner at this hour because Josh hates eating early as much as I do. He\u2019s dressed in a dark blue polo shirt and belted khaki pants. He looks exactly like he does when he goes to dinner on Sundays. It pisses me off how easy it must be for guys to get dressed. He seems to have no trouble pulling off normal and looking entirely too beautiful doing it.</p><p>I try not to look as uneasy as I feel while he stands in the entryway, taking me in. I ended up in a pale blue sleeveless dress with a dark-blue Greek-inspired design running in a band around the very bottom. It\u2019s definitely not on the cutting-edge of awesome, but it\u2019s simple. I thought it looked good and it felt like what I thought normal should feel like. I twisted all of my hair back in a loose knot at the nape of my neck. I know the scar at my hairline is probably all sorts of obvious but he\u2019s seen it so many times already, I just don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou look different,\u201d he says, repeating the same words he used the first night I ended up at his house, and I smile because it\u2019s exactly how I\u2019d like to look tonight. \u201cAnd distractingly pretty,\u201d he adds softly, his lips turning up just slightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me where we\u2019re going now?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s been driving me crazy all day. I hate not knowing things. I\u2019m a planner and a control freak, which is hard for a person who usually has very little control over anything.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says simply, taking my hand and helping me into the truck.</p> <p>And then we drive. And we drive. And we drive.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Josh. What the hell?\u201d No wonder he picked me up so early. We\u2019re on a freaking road trip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that four times since we left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because seriously, Josh. What the hell? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes. Relax. I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunshine? We\u2019re here.\u201d I open my eyes and look at the clock on the dashboard. 6:10. Seriously, Josh. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I ask, trying to figure out what the point of this two hour drive was.</p><p>\u201cDinner.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re in a parking lot. I look out the window and see the sign for an Italian restaurant I know far too well and I know that this is not happening. Through the glass on the side of the building I can see a man in a suit playing the piano but it\u2019s not him I\u2019m seeing anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d Josh asks.</p><p>Me, in an alternate universe, I think.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Brighton?\u201d I ask, trying to control the near hysteria in my voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019s wary now. I think I\u2019m scaring him a little, which is fine, because he\u2019s scaring me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we in Brighton?\u201d I force some calm into my demeanor because freaking out isn\u2019t going to get me anywhere right now, and when I say anywhere, I mean the hell out of Brighton.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have reservations.\u201d His voice is tentative. He\u2019s eyeing me like at any moment I might completely lose my mind.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou like Italian food and I looked at the ratings for like fifty places in a two-hour radius and this was the best one, plus I was able to get us in. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He\u2019s confused and I can\u2019t blame him for it.</p><p>\u201cJosh, there are like five hundred Italian restaurants at home. You could have taken me to any of them. Why did we drive two hours to have dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to talk to you. He says it like it\u2019s the most obvious answer in the world. He drove us two hours away for dinner, to a place where no one would know us, so that we could have a conversation. I want to laugh and cry and hug the living crap out of him. I kiss him instead. As soon as my lips are on his, his hand is at the back of my neck and he\u2019s pulling me against his chest like he\u2019s been waiting for this forever and he\u2019s not going to let me get away. But I don\u2019t want to get away; and if the steering wheel wasn\u2019t there, I would climb into his lap just to be closer to him.</p><p>Then he shifts just slightly and I\u2019m not kissing him anymore. He\u2019s kissing me. And when he does, part of me is lost. But it\u2019s the part that\u2019s twisted and mangled and wrong, and for just that moment, with his hands in my hair and his lips on my mouth, I can pretend that it never existed.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were pissed,\u201d he says when I pull away. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but not at you.\u201d My hands are still wrapped around his upper arms and I really don\u2019t want to let go.</p><p>\u201cAt what, then?\u201d he asks, brushing the hair that came loose out of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cEverything else.\u201d</p><p>He did all of this so that we would be able to go out and actually talk to one another and he brought me to the one place where we can\u2019t do that. He\u2019s just staring at me now like he doesn\u2019t know what that means and he\u2019s not sure where we go from here. I\u2019d like to just go home and sit in his garage where everything is comfortable and I can sand down wood and watch piles of sawdust grow around my feet and feel like I\u2019m okay for however long I stay there.</p><p>There\u2019s something in the way he\u2019s looking at me that freaks me out, but I can\u2019t look away. He leans in again and I don\u2019t move at all until I feel his lips on mine. There\u2019s a reverence in the way he kisses me that frightens me, because it\u2019s the most wonderful thing I\u2019ve ever felt.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that for a really long time, I just wanted to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the first night you walked into my garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t,\u201d I confess.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had just thrown up. I think it would have ruined the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to this moment which is now full of romance.\u201d He smiles and I let go of his arms and sit back, trying to figure out what to say.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go in?\u201d he asks finally.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks, and I feel terrible for taking this away from him. Just another thing that I can add to the list of disappointments I\u2019ve leveled at people I care about. I don\u2019t want Josh Bennett\u2019s disappointment, too. I don\u2019t think I can handle it. But I don\u2019t have a choice right now. There\u2019s no amount of disappointment that can get me in that restaurant. I look at Josh and wish I could just kiss him again instead of having to answer, but I know I\u2019m not getting out of this one.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p><p>Our attempt at normalcy ends up being bad pizza at a hole-in-the-wall we found somewhere on the road between Brighton and home, and there\u2019s nothing about it that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s not even extraordinary. It\u2019s perfect and I want it to stay perfect, but nothing ever does. People like Josh Bennett and I don\u2019t get perfect. Most of the time, we don\u2019t even get remotely tolerable. And that\u2019s why it scares me. Because, even if there was such a thing to begin with, perfect never lasts.</p><p>We pull in to Margot\u2019s driveway just before eleven and I look at Josh because I don\u2019t know why he brought me here instead of back to his house.</p><p>\u201cI had a good time tonight,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be saying that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Is there a rule?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I concede. \u201cI had a good time, too. It was fun. All things considered.\u201d I still feel bad for ruining his plans.</p><p>\u201cNo things considered,\u201d he says gently, lifting his hand to my cheek before leaning over to kiss me. Just once. And it isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s soft and warm and true and real. \u201cIt was fun. Nothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>Nothing else matters. If I had a penny right now, I\u2019d wish that were true; I want to believe it more than I\u2019ve ever wanted to believe anything.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you bringing me back here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shrugs sheepishly. \u201cI thought it would be kind of presumptuous to expect you to sleep with me on the first date.\u201d</p><p>I yawn before he even finishes speaking. \u201cIf all you\u2019re expecting is sleep, then I\u2019m a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he smiles, \u201cfar be it from me to turn down a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he backs his truck out of the driveway, and we go home.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>Nastya</p><p>My first therapist\u2019s name was Maggie Reynolds. She talked to me like a kindergarten teacher would. Soft and patient and unthreatening. Coddling. It made me want to smack her in the face and I really wasn\u2019t a smack someone in the face kind of person at that time. Not like I am now, when pretty much everybody makes me want to smack them in the face.</p><p>Every time I asked her why I couldn\u2019t remember what happened, she told me it was natural. Because, isn\u2019t everything? She said it was my brain\u2019s way of protecting me from something I wasn\u2019t ready to face yet. That my mind would never give me more stress than I could handle, and that when I was strong enough, I would remember. We just had to be patient. But it\u2019s hard to be patient when no one else is.</p><p>Everyone might have agreed that it was natural to forget, but it didn\u2019t mean they would stop asking. The question was always the same, from the police, from my family, from my therapists. Do you remember anything? The answer was always the same, too. No. I don\u2019t remember anything. Not one single thing about what happened that day.</p><p>Then one day I guess my mind decided I was ready, because that was the day I remembered everything and then I stopped answering the questions altogether. I think maybe my brain made a mistake about how strong I was, but it didn\u2019t let me send the memories back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I never even had one nightmare until after my memory returned. Once the vision of what had happened was back in my head, it wouldn\u2019t be ignored. It came at me with a vengeance, night after night, like it was making up for lost time. I would wake up sweating and shaking in a state of remembered terror, and I couldn\u2019t tell anyone why.</p><p>So I wrote. I spit every detail out of my head and onto paper so that the memory wouldn\u2019t have any hold over me. I felt like a criminal. Like I was perpetrating some crime by not telling, and every night I was waiting for the nightmares to call me on it, to turn me in. So I took away their leverage. I confessed myself. Every night into the notebooks. The words were the sacrifice I offered up daily in exchange for dreamless sleep. They have never failed me.</p><p>It\u2019s the second night this week that Josh and I are headed to the Leightons\u2019 for dinner. We spent Thanksgiving here, also. I think we both would have been happy to have stayed at his house and ordered pizza and worked in the garage like the antisocialites that we are, but you don\u2019t say no to Mrs. Leighton. It wasn\u2019t a request. It was a requirement. And it was nothing like Sunday dinner. It was grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles and strays like Josh and I. We hid in Drew\u2019s room for the most part, because Josh hates hugging ambushes as much as I do, and these people were huggers. All of them.</p><p>When we got to the table, with the china and the centerpiece and the napkin swans, I took a picture with my phone and sent it to my mom so she would know I wasn\u2019t alone. I don\u2019t know if it made her feel better. Seeing a table covered with food and surrounded by somebody else\u2019s family might not have been the type of comfort I was trying to send.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t have school at all this week, so aside from Thanksgiving, we\u2019ve had the past nine days to do nothing but build. The weather\u2019s been beautiful and the humidity is low, so I\u2019ve been in the driveway finishing. We\u2019ve finally found something I\u2019m better at than Josh, and he doesn\u2019t care, because the only thing he likes less than sanding, is finishing.</p><p>Other than Drew\u2019s house, we haven\u2019t gone anywhere except the grocery store and the hardware store. We work on furniture most of the day, come in at three o\u2019clock for Josh\u2019s GH fix, cook dinner, build some more, go running and sleep. It\u2019s been a perfect week. I hate that it\u2019s already Sunday.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s turn for music tonight.\u201d Mrs. Leighton has a tray full of twice-baked potatoes balancing on one hand and a water pitcher in the other.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it Drew\u2019s turn?\u201d Sarah asks, putting the last of the silverware on the table.</p><p>\u201cNice try. Drew\u2019s got next week. It\u2019s mine.\u201d Mr. Leighton laughs maniacally to taunt her and I smile because it reminds me of something my dad would do. He opens a cabinet full of CDs and scans through them before pulling one out and turning on the stereo.</p> <p>It takes me three notes to recognize the Haydn sonata he\u2019s put on. It\u2019s the one I know by heart. The one I practiced a thousand times to play for my audition that day at school. The one that became the theme song for my murder, instead. That\u2019s what we\u2019re listening to over Sunday dinner. The soundtrack to my death.</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard it since that day, since the last time I played it before I left my house that afternoon, since I heard myself humming it while I walked to school. I don\u2019t hear it now. I also don\u2019t do anything hopelessly dramatic like drop dishes or freak out and run from the room. I stop breathing instead.</p><p>I\u2019m walking and humming and practicing every note in my head. I\u2019m not nervous because it\u2019s just a recording and if I mess up I can re-do it as many times as I want until I\u2019m happy. Nick Kerrigan is recording it for me in the music lab and he likes me and he\u2019ll stay as long as I need. He told me. I like him too so that works for me. I\u2019m checking out my hands because I want them to look good and I don\u2019t want my nails chipped and then there\u2019s a boy in front of me. He smiles but he looks wrong. Wrong in his eyes. But I smile and say hi and walk past him. And then his hand is on my arm so tight that it hurts and I turn but I can\u2019t say anything because he hits me in the face and then I\u2019m face down on the ground and he\u2019s dragging me somewhere. Then I\u2019m not on the ground anymore because he yanks me up by my hair. He says it\u2019s my fault. He calls me a Russian whore and tells me to stand up but I don\u2019t know why because he just knocks me down again. There\u2019s blood and dirt in my mouth and I don\u2019t remember how to scream anymore. I don\u2019t even remember how to breathe. I wonder if I\u2019m Russian but I don\u2019t think so and I don\u2019t know why this boy hates me. He\u2019s pulled my hair so hard so many times that it\u2019s ripped part of my scalp off and the blood runs into one of my eyes and I can\u2019t see out of it anymore. He must be tired of picking me up because he just leaves me on the ground and starts kicking me instead. I don\u2019t know how many times in my stomach and my chest. A couple of times between my legs. I think I hear my ribs cracking. I don\u2019t know how long he kicks me. Maybe forever. I don\u2019t feel any of it anymore. Nothing even hurts. I can still see out of my left eye. On the ground, I can\u2019t tell how far away, is one of my pearl buttons. The sun is hitting it and it looks like it\u2019s changing colors and it\u2019s so beautiful and I want to hold it. If I can reach it everything will be ok. I think he\u2019s still kicking and my hand reaches out for it but I can\u2019t get there. Everything stops except his breathing. I see his boots next to my hand. Then I can\u2019t see anything anymore because everything is black and I can\u2019t feel my body. The last thing I hear is the sound of the bones in my hand being crushed and then there isn\u2019t anything anymore.</p><p>\u201cNastya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNastya?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know that name.</p> <p>When I open my eyes, I can see again. I\u2019m on Drew Leighton\u2019s white brocade sofa and there\u2019s no blood anywhere and nothing hurts except my soul. I can see the coffee table Josh Bennett made. I can see Josh Bennett, sitting on the floor next to the couch, holding my hand and staring at me. I can see all of the questions he isn\u2019t asking. Everyone here looks scared, even Sarah, and I wonder if I look scared, too. Because I have no idea what just happened.</p><p>Mrs. Leighton makes me drink water, even though I try to refuse, because I\u2019m freaked out, not dehydrated. Apparently I stopped breathing long enough that I passed out and she wants to call my aunt. I shake my head and look at Josh, imploring him with every please I can force into my eyes. He says he\u2019ll take me home and I hope he\u2019s talking about his home because that\u2019s where I want to be, even if I don\u2019t like the look on his face. The look people give you when they\u2019re afraid that one wrong word will cause you to break. But if I didn\u2019t break before, I\u2019m sure as hell not doing it on the white brocade sofa at Drew Leighton\u2019s house.</p><p>I have remembered what happened to me every day for nearly two years. I\u2019ve seen it in nightmares. I\u2019ve written it in notebooks every night for hundreds of days. But I have never relived it until now. I know that I\u2019m safe here. But I know what dirt and blood taste like, too.</p><p>I\u2019m sleeping at Josh\u2019s again, because somewhere along the line, that became the norm. The more time I spend here, the more I hate being at Margot\u2019s by myself. I make sure she always knows where I am, and even if she doesn\u2019t like it, I think she understands, or maybe I just need to believe that she does. I feel more at home at Josh\u2019s than anywhere else in the world, and right now, I need a home.</p><p>I have to hide in the bathroom to write my three and a half pages, even though tonight I feel like I already did. I write them anyway and then slip the composition book into my backpack, behind my trig book, like it\u2019s homework.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, when I climb into bed in the dark, because even in pitch black silence, I can see and hear and feel the question all around me.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me sometime,\u201d he says softly as if someone in the house might hear us.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have to tell you tonight,\u201d I whisper back.</p> <p>He takes my left hand like he knows it holds all my secrets and he thinks maybe he can learn them just by holding it.</p><p>\u201cYou were awake, but it was like you weren\u2019t even there.\u201d He pulls me against him and kisses the scar on my forehead, keeping his arm wrapped tightly around me, pulling my head onto his chest and pressing my body to his. \u201cIt scared the hell out of me and you won\u2019t tell me why it happened.\u201d</p><p>I have to tell him something, so I tell him what I know is true.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I just forget how to breathe.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cDamn, your girlfriend can bake.\u201d Drew shoves yet another cookie in his mouth. He\u2019s eating them as fast as Sunshine can pull them out of the oven.</p><p>\u201cNot my girlfriend,\u201d I say, because, according to her, she\u2019s not, and that\u2019s fine because I hate the term anyway. Saying girlfriend, somehow puts us in an official relationship, and if she is an official part of my life, she will probably officially be gone very soon. So if she doesn\u2019t want to be called my girlfriend, I\u2019m fine with that.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Drew counters, \u201cyour wife.\u201d He walks up to her and pulls a cookie off the tray, burning his fingers in the process. \u201cNo wonder you always smell like brown sugar and,\u201d he stops, picking up a bottle off of the counter and reading the label, \u201cpure vanilla extract.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. She does smell like brown sugar and vanilla, but I thought I was the only one who noticed.</p><p>He flips the cap open on the bottle and inhales it. \u201cSeriously, they should sell this as perfume.\u201d Sunshine is just staring at him with a slightly disgusted look on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou smell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it sound so creepy. It\u2019s not like I sneak into your room and watch you sleep.\u201d He walks over and slaps me on the back. \u201cJosh does that.\u201d</p><p>Sunshine throws an oven mitt at him and he pretends to be wounded. \u201cWatch it woman. Since you\u2019re not taken, I can throw you down on the floor and make love to you right now.\u201d</p><p>She gags loudly and Drew looks mock offended. \u201cThe idea of ha**ng s*x with me is that distasteful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the idea of ha**ng s*x with you is, as always, the pinnacle of dreams. It\u2019s the make love part that\u2019s repulsive. I hate that expression. I could be sixty years old, and I\u2019d still rather say f**k, than make love. Ichth,\u201d she shudders.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, confidence restored. \u201cThen since you\u2019re not taken, I can throw you down on the floor and f**k you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d I say. \u201cEither screw each other and get it over with or quit acting like you\u2019re going to.\u201d I turn the TV off because I can\u2019t hear it anyway and toss the remote on the couch. I sound like a jealous bastard. I am a jealous bastard. Just because I know there\u2019s nothing going on between them, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t piss me off.</p><p>\u201cAre those our only two options?\u201d Drew asks. \u201cBecause I know which one I\u2019m going with.\u201d</p><p>Sunshine shoves another cookie in Drew\u2019s mouth and tells him to quit while he\u2019s ahead.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve gained like ten pounds since I met you. How do you eat all this shit and not get fat?\u201d he asks, wiping crumbs off of his hands.</p><p>\u201cI run,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>Drew looks repulsed. \u201cWell I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she smiles. \u201cYou have enough testosterone to keep your metabolism going for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue story,\u201d he says cockily.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of true stories and testosterone, is anyone ever going to tell me what the deal is with Tierney Lowell?\u201d Sunshine asks.</p><p>Drew stiffens. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She arches one eyebrow at him and he groans exaggeratedly like a kid who just had his video games taken away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. But only because I\u2019m fragile and you scare me.\u201d</p><p>Drew moves over on the couch so she can sit next to him, but she sits down in my lap instead, and I really have no problem with the fact that she\u2019s not my girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an age old story,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cBoy meets girl. Boy asks girl to touch him inappropriately. Girl dazzles boy with her impressive knowledge and proper use of profanity. Boy and girl end up in detention together. Love blossoms. In secret. For four months.\u201d</p><p>Sunshine looks at me for confirmation. \u201cTrue story,\u201d I deadpan. I always knew they had hooked up, but I thought it was a one-time deal. I actually just found out the rest of the story. He didn\u2019t tell me until I laid into him the week after the infamous truth or dare dinner. But I remember there was something up with Drew during that time period and now it just makes sense.</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing. That\u2019s all you\u2019re getting.\u201d He turns the TV back on.</p><p>\u201cYou suck,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cSo do you, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I didn\u2019t find that nearly as funny as the two of them.</p> <p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Drew and I have spent the past three hours at his dining room table with dueling laptops, pulling up research and precedents for the most boring argument ever on term limits. I guess it\u2019s better than gas taxes which we could have gotten stuck with. The county tournament is in two weeks. I don\u2019t have to compete, but I have to attend, and my grade comes from doing prep work.</p><p>So far I\u2019ve gotten away with being designated as Drew\u2019s researcher. No one else really has researchers, but I\u2019m there, and I can\u2019t compete for myself so he gets to use me. If he wasn\u2019t so good it never would have flown, but he performs. When Drew does well, the team does well, and when the team does well, Mr. Trent looks good, so he\u2019ll give Drew just about anything he asks for. Which works for me, because it keeps me out of the claws of Ethan Hall, who still thinks asking me for blow jobs in the guidance office, while pretending to harmlessly flirt, is romantic.</p><p>I hand Drew the printouts and my notes and we split up the rest of the work so we can finish it tonight. I haven\u2019t quit badgering him about Tierney yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you guys at least be friends? Wouldn\u2019t that be better than nothing?\u201d I\u2019m not an expert on relationships. Not any of them. Not familial, not romantic, not friendly. Relationships require communication, which is not really my thing, so it\u2019s a weak subject for me. I just don\u2019t get why he has to act like he hates her when he so obviously doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it would not be better than nothing. It would absolutely be worse than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a cop-out. Guys always say that because it\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd girls always want to change the rules in the middle of the game. You can\u2019t change the rules and think everyone else is just going to keep playing. I know what her hair smells like, but I can\u2019t get close enough to her to press my face into it. I know how soft her skin is on every part of her body, but I can\u2019t touch it. I know what she tastes like, but I can\u2019t kiss her. I\u2019m not allowed anymore; so why should I torture myself with being around her, just so I can say we\u2019re still friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that makes sense, and if you\u2019d stop to think about it for one minute, you\u2019d realize it. If you and Josh were suddenly not together, do you think you could still hang out with him all the time? Be in his house, but not touch him? Act happy for him when he\u2019s going out with some other girl and she\u2019s going to know all of the things about him that you know, but that all of a sudden you\u2019re not supposed to know anymore? You couldn\u2019t do it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh isn\u2019t in love with me and I\u2019m not in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSell it to someone who\u2019s buying, Sunshine. Have you seen the way he looks at you?\u201d I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at me but I don\u2019t know what it means. \u201cLike you\u2019re a seventeenth-century, hand-carved table in mint condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he looks at me like I\u2019m furniture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. See? You know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody likes a smartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallacy. Everybody likes a smart ass. Especially you.\u201d He fixes his eyes on mine, and it\u2019s obvious he won\u2019t be done proving his theories until I concede. \u201cFriends is bullshit and you\u2019ll know it, too, when it happens to you. When the two of you break up, you\u2019ll know exactly what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe-can\u2019t-break-up-if-we-aren\u2019t-together.\u201d I enunciate every word in my most exasperated voice, but it doesn\u2019t deter him.</p><p>\u201cSemantics. It\u2019s going to happen and everyone,\u201d he gestures around the room to the audience that isn\u2019t there, \u201cknows it but you. One day, you\u2019re going to get drunk and screw the shit out of each other and then you\u2019re going to realize how incredibly, stupidly in love you are, or maybe vice-versa, knowing you two. Could happen. But anyway, you\u2019ll be together. And then one day, you won\u2019t. And when that day comes, I can promise you, you won\u2019t be friends. You\u2019ll hate each other before you\u2019ll ever just be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to love me.\u201d Why I say this out loud is beyond me, but it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t want the obligations and the expectations. I don\u2019t want to be the source of disappointment in another person\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to love you either so I guess you\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>Talking about Josh is starting to feel like a very bad idea. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be talking about Tierney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be talking about government term limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll accept your impossible friendship theory if you tell me what happened. Maybe if I know how it ended, I\u2019ll agree with you.\u201d I actually am starting to agree with him, but I\u2019m not telling him yet. I want the story.</p><p>\u201cI was an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a given. Quit stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got together. Together, together,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cNot just my version of together. Tierney didn\u2019t want anyone to know because she refused to have people thinking she was another name on a very long and undistinguished list. She said she was better than that. And she was better than that. She never would have hooked up with me if it was nothing. But dickhead Trevor Mason kept giving me shit, so I told him. Except I didn\u2019t tell him we were together. I just told him we were screwing. She got pissed. Broke up with me. Everybody acted like she was a loser for thinking I gave a crap about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give a crap about her?\u201d</p><p>He nails me with a look that says that I know the answer and he\u2019s not saying it. I think the word love might sear his tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t even have anything in common. What\u2019s the attraction? And please refrain from listing body parts or anything involving the word oral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Tierney. She gives me shit, but she won\u2019t take mine. She makes me laugh, but she laughs more. She argues with me about everything, even when she knows she\u2019ll never win. Plus, she\u2019s hot as hell and she can\u2019t stand me. Is there anything else that could possibly make her more attractive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re giving a speech. Bottom line it, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re annoying,\u201d he groans, but that\u2019s what he always does when he\u2019s going to answer anyway. \u201cListen, I know what I look like and I know how smart I am. Shut up. Don\u2019t look at me like that. I know it and you know it. But I know I\u2019m a pretty shit human being, too,\u201d he says, sounding momentarily sincere. \u201cTierney made me feel like I wasn\u2019t completely worthless as a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you treat her like she\u2019s worthless. You hurt her feelings all the time. I know she\u2019s all hard-core and everything, but you do know she has feelings, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know she has feelings. Do you know how smart that girl is? No. Nobody does, because she doesn\u2019t want you to know. She doesn\u2019t want you to know she\u2019s funny and sweet either \u2013 yes, I used the word sweet and if you ever mention it again there will be consequences.\u201d He shoots me the look-into-my-eyes-and-feel-my-wrath glare before continuing. \u201cYou know who knows those things? I do. So, yes, Nastya, I know she has feelings and I know how to hurt every one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what you do? You feel guilty for hurting her so you make up for it by hurting her more? You\u2019re the definition of a jackhole. Why wouldn\u2019t you have just apologized to her right after it happened? Told people the truth?\u201d I close the laptop and push it aside.</p><p>\u201cBecause she was so pissed. She broke up with me and said I was everything she ever knew I was and that people were right, that she was pathetic for believing anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was it?\u201d</p><p>Apparently that wasn\u2019t even close to it. He proceeds to tell me that the night Tierney laid all of that on him, he went to a party and had sex with Kara Matthews.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you do that?\u201d Nothing Drew does should surprise me at this point; but this does.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was depressed and pissed and I lost her because I was a prick so I figured I might as well act like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, for someone who thinks he\u2019s such an awesome debater, your logic is seriously flawed. You hadn\u2019t lost her. You didn\u2019t lose her until you screwed Kara Matthews. It was a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I am an awesome debater. Second of all, it was not a test. She broke up with me for real. She hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it was a test.\u201d How is it that an inexperienced, social loser like me can grasp this and Drew Leighton cannot? \u201cShe handed you a golden opportunity to prove her wrong. Instead, you stuck your dick in Kara Matthews and proved that Tierney meant absolutely nothing and that every bad thing she ever thought about you was true.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t pretend not to know why I adore Drew Leighton. He\u2019s as f**ked up and emotionally stunted as I am, just in a different way. But, right now, I kind of hate him for being so astronomically clueless. I walk over and wrap my arms around him and put my head on his shoulder, because I know what self-loathing looks like and if I want there to be hope for me, I need there to be hope for him.</p><p>\u201cYou really are an ass**le,\u201d I say.</p><p>He sighs and rests his chin on the top of my head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I end up staying long enough that Mr. and Mrs. Leighton and Sarah get home and I\u2019m roped into having dinner with them, which isn\u2019t such a dreadful thought now that Sarah is not my mortal enemy anymore.</p><p>Sometime after the dinner party from hell, Sarah decided she didn\u2019t completely despise me. That whole night may have been the definition of a bad idea, but if one good thing came out of it, it\u2019s that somehow the tension between she and I has dissipated. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re swapping sex stories and bra shopping together, but still. If I knew that teaching her how to knock a guy on the ground would endear her to me, I would have done it months ago. Nevertheless, things have gotten easier, maybe almost nice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d look a lot better without all that make-up,\u201d she tells me, and I think it\u2019s her idea of a compliment. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d look better, or just different, but I\u2019m not ready to give it up. \u201cIf you looked normal you could have more friends. You know, even with the not talking. People are kind of scared of you.\u201d</p><p>Good. That\u2019s the plan. The conversation is pretty one-sided, but it\u2019s better than being scowled at, insulted and generally treated like a pariah, which is what I\u2019m used to from Sarah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot everybody can be as socially blessed as you, Sarah,\u201d Drew chimes in. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift being related to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a curse,\u201d she says and it\u2019s genuine.</p><p>\u201cRight. As if you\u2019d have half as many friends or go on half as many dates if I weren\u2019t your brother.\u201d I think Drew is joking but it sets her off, and when I hear what she says, I don\u2019t blame her. I feel sorry for her instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right! That\u2019s the f**king problem, Drew! Girls all want to be friends with me because they think it\u2019s a free pass to you. Guys want to go out with me because they figure I\u2019m a cheap slut like you. You want to take credit for my social life? Go ahead. You are responsible for it.\u201d She pauses because she\u2019s so worked up and I can tell Drew is wishing he never said anything because he didn\u2019t see this coming at all. I don\u2019t even want to be in the room anymore. I wonder if anybody here has an invisibility cloak I could borrow, because that would be awesome.</p> <p>\u201cI hate being your sister!\u201d Sarah hisses. \u201cI would do anything to not be related to you!\u201d</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t say anything else. No cocky comebacks. No derision. He just walks out and leaves me with Sarah, who starts to cry. I\u2019m seriously hoping they have some ice cream here, because without words, it\u2019s pretty much the only thing I\u2019ve got to work with.</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d she says through tears, and I know that she doesn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t tell her that.</p><p>Later that night, we push all the furniture to the side of the room again and offer to give Mr. and Mrs. Leighton a demonstration of Sarah\u2019s up and coming self-defense skills. I drag Drew back into the room and offer him up as an assailant and then refresh Sarah\u2019s memory on how to cause him bodily harm. And Drew lets her do it as many times as she needs to, even when she doesn\u2019t pull back enough and it\u2019s really starting to hurt. Then the last time he comes at her from behind, he whispers I\u2019m sorry before wrapping his arms around her. There\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s hoping she\u2019ll press her arms up and out before dropping straight down out of his grasp, driving her elbow back into him and then running like I taught her, but I\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t when he apologizes again and she turns in his arms and hugs him back.</p><p>Just as he loosens up, she stomps on his instep for real, then mock knees him in the groin and Mrs. Leighton applauds.</p> <p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>Nastya</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re destroying your hands,\u201d Josh tells me, picking them up and turning them over to look at my palms. I pull them back, but I can\u2019t help smiling because it\u2019s a compliment. It\u2019s even better than being called distractingly pretty.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d I tell him, examining them myself. \u201cMeans they\u2019re doing something.\u201d I may not be able to use them the way I\u2019d like\u200c\u2014\u200cunless one-handed piano playing becomes all the rage, I\u2019m SOL\u200c\u2014\u200cbut at least I can do something. Josh hates sanding. It\u2019s his least favorite thing to do, because according to him, it\u2019s boring. He keeps trying to get me to use a belt sander when it\u2019s feasible but there\u2019s just no satisfaction in that. I like sanding because it\u2019s mindless and repetitive and it lets me think. I can smooth out all the rough edges. And at the end of the night, I can look at what I\u2019ve done and see a pile of sawdust and feel like I\u2019ve accomplished something. When I look at my hands, I don\u2019t see scrapes and scratches; I don\u2019t see injuries; I see healing.</p><p>I think I\u2019m still smiling at my hands like an idiot, and when I look back up he\u2019s watching me with something like respect and that look is definitely better than being called distractingly pretty.</p><p>\u201cThey used to be soft, but the sandpaper is killing them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re turning into my hands.\u201d I wonder if he thinks that\u2019s an insult. His hands are miracles. I can watch them for hours, transforming wood into something it never dreamed of being.</p> <p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t touch you then and you won\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be rash,\u201d he jokes, picking them up again and running his thumb along one of the scars on my left hand. The plastic surgeons worked miracles, but they still couldn\u2019t get it perfect. You can still see all the wrong about it when you look. \u201cI just like your hands,\u201d he continues, not taking his eyes off them. \u201cSometimes I think they\u2019re the only real thing about you.\u201d</p><p>He says things like that a lot. Like he\u2019s reminding me that just because he doesn\u2019t ask the questions, it doesn\u2019t mean he forgets they exist.</p><p>\u201cYou want to test that theory?\u201d I ask, smiling at him. He keeps his grip on my hands and pulls me back toward the wall.</p><p>\u201cNot with the garage door open.\u201d</p><p>I spend half of Saturday morning sitting cross-legged on a flatbed at Home Depot with Josh pushing me up and down the lumber aisles, telling me about how every kind of wood varies. I learn which to use for furniture, which are better for floors, which are the best for finishing and so on. Finally he kicks me off the flatbed and I have to walk because he needs it to actually put wood on. I might complain about having to get up if it didn\u2019t mean that I get to spend the next twenty minutes watching him load up lumber, and complaining about that would be wrong on so many levels. It\u2019s worth the standing any day.</p><p>When we get home, we plan to spend the afternoon finishing, but it starts to pour and we can\u2019t work with the garage closed and the finish will get cloudy anyway from the humidity. At this point, I could tell you this myself without any prompting. Between Josh and shop class, I\u2019m getting quite an education.</p><p>We spend the afternoon in the kitchen and I figure if he can teach me about lumber, I can teach him how to bake a decent cookie. I scold him for packing the flour into a measuring cup, and he keeps doing it just to annoy me until I take it away and do it myself.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I have to learn how to make them when I have you here to do it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I say, pushing a bag of brown sugar and another measuring cup at him since he wants to pack things so badly, \u201cone day I may not be here, and then you\u2019ll be cookieless and sad.\u201d As soon as the words are out of my mouth, I regret them. I mentally kick the thought in the groin, and when it doubles over, I knee it in the face so it will never rear its ugly head again. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too late for that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says gently, with just a whisper of a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not that sensitive about it. Everyone just assumes I am. Don\u2019t be everyone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you angry about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t angry. I didn\u2019t say I was okay with it. I understand all the crap people say. It\u2019s natural. It\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s a part of life. Still doesn\u2019t make it okay that someone can just disappear like they never existed. But being pissed all the time doesn\u2019t make it okay, either. I know. I used to be pissed all the time. It gets old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you I\u2019d be the angriest person in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you already are.\u201d</p><p>There isn\u2019t any point in arguing with that, so I step over to show him how hard to pack down the brown sugar, but I still feel shitty.</p><p>\u201cAfter we\u2019re done with this, maybe you can help me move the coffee table over from the wall. I think I\u2019m going to get rid of the piece of crap in front of the couch,\u201d he says, changing the subject and letting me off the hook.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to move the love of your life into the middle of the room where Drew can violate it with his shoes any time he likes?\u201d This is genuinely surprising because I know how Josh feels about that table.</p><p>\u201cSince when did it become the love of my life?\u201d He sounds bemused.</p><p>\u201cYou talk about it like it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThat table makes me want to be a better man. Jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019ll kill Drew not to be able to put his feet on it. Unless you\u2019ve decided to allow that.\u201d</p><p>He looks mildly horrified. I think he\u2019s imagining it happening.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s fine where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d I inform him, \u201cone day, I\u2019m going to get tired of sharing your affection with that coffee table and I\u2019m going to make you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d he mimics me, \u201cI would chop that table up and use it for firewood before I would ever choose anything over you.\u201d It\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say, but he nails me with those eyes, making sure I know he\u2019s serious and I wish he wouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a waste.\u201d I take the bag of brown sugar he\u2019s still holding and put it back so I can have an excuse to turn away, because I\u2019m not in the mood for serious, and for some reason, this conversation keeps veering back toward places I don\u2019t want to go. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have a fireplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it impossible to say anything nice to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot impossible. Just difficult,\u201d I say lightly, hoping he\u2019ll change his tone, too. I figure maybe I can distract him and I lift myself up on my tiptoes to kiss him. I can tell he knows what I\u2019m doing and he hesitates just a second before lifting his hand to the back of my neck and leaning into me; his mouth moving against mine, soft and searching, coaxing out my secrets. I pull away and walk over to turn on the mixer, hoping the noise of it will effectively kill any conversation.</p><p>\u201cTell me where you got the scar.\u201d It comes out of nowhere and from everywhere.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper. He can\u2019t hear it over the mixer, but he knows I said it. The worst thing is that there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s starting to want to tell him, and that scares the living crap out of me. Josh makes me feel safe and safe is something I never thought I\u2019d feel again.</p><p>He pulls me back against him and holds me there. I can feel the warmth of his fingers imprinting the skin at my waist. His mouth is next to my ear, and for just one second I expect him to call me a Russian whore.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know which one you\u2019re asking about,\u201d I say and I\u2019m thankful not to have to see his face. There\u2019s something in the way he says please that won\u2019t let me laugh this off or lie to him. There\u2019s a desperation in it that I don\u2019t want to acknowledge.</p><p>\u201cAny. Just one. Just something. Tell me something true.\u201d His arms are solid, wrapping around me, pressing my back against his chest, and it feels more like truth than anything has in such a long time. But I still have nothing to give him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that is anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live here anymore?\u201d Margot asks me one afternoon when I get back from school. I wish I could say it\u2019s not a valid question, but I\u2019m at Josh\u2019s more often than not. I come home in the mornings before she gets back from work just so I can shower and change for school. Sometimes not even that. Little by little, my clothes seem to be making it to his house, also.</p><p>I can shrug or shake my head or play dumb and act like I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, but I owe her more than that. There\u2019s a part of me that almost opens my mouth, but I just can\u2019t make myself do it. If I say something, I\u2019ll have to say everything and that isn\u2019t happening today. I pull some notebook paper out of one of my school folders and write.</p><p>If I say no will you make me come back?</p><p>\u201cSit, Em.\u201d She pulls out a chair at the kitchen table and I do the same, keeping the pencil and paper in my hand.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re an adult now,\u201d she puts the word adult in air quotes and I want to shake my head at her and beg her not to make me lose respect. \u201cBut you\u2019re not all grown up,\u201d she continues. She\u2019s not telling me anything I don\u2019t know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Point? I write and turn the paper towards her. I\u2019m not trying to give her attitude, actually. I just want to know if I\u2019m going to be fighting to keep the one thing that\u2019s been keeping me sane. And, really, it\u2019s not even as much Josh as it is that garage.</p><p>\u201cDoes it help? Being there?\u201d</p><p>My instinct is to say that nothing helps, because that\u2019s always my instinct, but it\u2019s not true this time. Everything about being there helps. It\u2019s a place to be and something to do and a person who doesn\u2019t compare me to Emilia. I don\u2019t just nod. I write yes on the paper.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pretend to like it. But you\u2019re alone here all the time and I don\u2019t like that, either.\u201d She hesitates and I don\u2019t know if I should write something or just see if she says anything else. And she does. \u201cAre you sleeping with him?\u201d</p> <p>Well, yes, I am, in fact, sleeping with him, but I\u2019d put money on the fact that that\u2019s not what she\u2019s asking. I shake my head, no, because it\u2019s true, even though I\u2019m not sure for how long.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s disappointed or relieved or just skeptical.</p><p>Really</p><p>\u201cI still want to know where you are.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I don\u2019t blame her for that and it doesn\u2019t matter anyway, because I know she can track my phone. It\u2019s just courtesy and courtesy I can do.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s really cute,\u201d she smiles, her face full of mischief.</p><p>And I nod to that, too.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cHow many miles did you run?\u201d I ask when she walks back into the garage just after ten and strips the can of pepper spray from her waist and the heart monitor off her wrist.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t track it. Just ran,\u201d she pants while the sweat drips down her face. She grabs a bottle of water and comes up next to me, looking over my shoulder. \u201cHow far did you get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlmost done. I was about to quit. It\u2019ll be ready to finish tomorrow, if it\u2019s not raining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help when I get done at Clay\u2019s.\u201d She\u2019s been at Clay\u2019s at least twice a week for a month. He\u2019s doing some sort of freaky layered montage thing. I don\u2019t get it. I like the ones where I can just see her face.</p><p>\u201cTell him he\u2019s monopolizing you and I\u2019m starting to get jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him know,\u201d she smiles. \u201cHe\u2019s got that competition next month and I can\u2019t sit this weekend so I said I\u2019d do it after school.\u201d Between researching with Drew, sitting for Clay, running, school and building with me she never stops for a second. She just signed up for some Krav Maga class, too, whatever that is. She\u2019s not good with down time.</p><p>\u201cIs that the one you\u2019re going to with him?\u201d</p><p>She nods, tilting back the rest of the bottle of water. \u201cIt\u2019s at some art gallery in Ridgemont. They use it every year for the state competition and they display all the finalists\u2019 work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill going home this weekend?\u201d I wish she wasn\u2019t because I\u2019m used to her now. I realized how much it sucks to cook alone and eat alone and watch TV alone and generally be alone.</p><p>\u201cI said I would.\u201d</p> <p>She never sounds happy about going home and I have absolutely no clue why, except that it has something to do with all the scars she has and the stories she won\u2019t tell me. Whenever she comes back from there, it\u2019s like she\u2019s out of focus for a few days, like a hologram that keeps blurring in and out. She\u2019s always been like that, like music and lyrics to two different songs. It\u2019s just worse after she\u2019s been back to Brighton.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk to anyone in your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019s getting the where-are-you-going-with-this tone in her voice that I\u2019m so familiar with now.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t tell them what they want to hear. If I talk to them, I\u2019ll have to lie and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d It\u2019s more information than she\u2019s ever given me before and it\u2019s still not enough. It doesn\u2019t tell me crap.</p><p>\u201cYou stopped talking just so you wouldn\u2019t have to lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to. I just wanted a day and then I just wanted one more day and then one more after that and that turned into a week, which turned into a month and you get the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just let you stop? They didn\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey cared, but it\u2019s not like they could do anything about it. What were they going to do? Shake me? Yell at me and insist? Ground me? I never left the house anyway. They didn\u2019t really have a lot of options. Plus, according to my impressive collection of therapists, it was a very natural response, whatever that means.\u201d Natural response to what, Sunshine? Please keep talking. But she doesn\u2019t. Just another random piece in a puzzle made of all the wrong pieces.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t lying have been easier than silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m crap at it. I don\u2019t believe in doing something if you can\u2019t excel at it.\u201d She\u2019s back to sarcasm and we\u2019re effectively done with this conversation. I know how it works and I wonder how long I\u2019ll let her get away with it.</p><p>I start cleaning up and she walks over to crash in the chair while she waits, finally noticing the bag I put there earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want my ass on your counters but you\u2019re putting crap on my chair,\u201d she jokes, picking it up to put it on the ground next to her.</p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>She looks in the bag and pulls out the shoe box, then narrows her eyes at me. I watch because I want to see her face when she opens the box. I know it\u2019s a stupid present, probably not the thing girls want to get. I\u2019m not really an expert on the whole thing.</p><p>And then maybe I am, because her face lights up when she sees them.</p><p>\u201cYou bought me boots?\u201d she says, like I just gave her diamonds.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to give you anything for your birthday. I hope they fit. I looked at your shoes one day and they said seven so that\u2019s what I got.\u201d I shove my hands in my pockets.</p><p>She\u2019s already taking off her running shoes and trying them on.</p><p>\u201cSteel-toed?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd black.\u201d She smiles and I love that smile more because I think I put it there.</p><p>\u201cAnd black,\u201d I confirm, though I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wrap them,\u201d she scolds.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t call me on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d she laughs and I could listen to it forever. She stands and examines the boots on her feet. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can get around the good stuff in shop.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fades. \u201cI can\u2019t use any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can use some of it,\u201d I say, because I want the smile back and because it\u2019s true. She can do more than she thinks she can. For some reason, she just won\u2019t try. \u201cAnd I can be your other hand when you need it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s walking around the garage and flexing her feet to break them in and I realize that there really is nothing sexier than this girl in black work boots. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to bring them to school to change into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that,\u201d she says, and I get the smile back tenfold. \u201cI\u2019m wearing these to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did okay?\u201d I ask, just because I want to hear her say it.</p><p>\u201cAlmost better than the pennies.\u201d She pushes herself up on her toes and kisses me and she\u2019s salty and sweaty and awesome.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kiss me for the pennies,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was allowed.\u201d</p><p>She refuses to go inside once she\u2019s got those boots, so we spend another hour in the garage, where she helps me start measuring and marking for a side table she designed for a shop assignment. It\u2019s a really cool design with Queen-Anne-style legs. I wish she could build the whole thing herself but the hand does make some of it impossible and she doesn\u2019t have the expertise for all of it yet, anyway. I\u2019ve been at this for ten years and I still have trouble with a lot things. I do walk her through every step, though. She yells at me if I do something without explaining, because even if she can\u2019t do it herself, she wants to at least know how.</p><p>I don\u2019t get nearly as much done as I used to out here, but I think it might be worth it, because there\u2019s something seriously hot about her bossing me around in my garage with a hammer in her hand. I haven\u2019t been bossed around in a while and she\u2019s really cute when she\u2019s determined and pissed, so I don\u2019t mind so much.</p><p>I\u2019ve lived and breathed sawdust for as long as I can remember. I think she does now, too.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>Josh</p><p>Expected. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve become and it\u2019s scarier than anything else.</p><p>We\u2019re in the courtyard at lunch every day. We don\u2019t touch each other or laugh, and of course, we don\u2019t talk, but we\u2019re together. No one bothers us. Other than an occasional visit from Clay, the force field stays intact.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to finish reading the story Ms. McAllister assigned, because there\u2019s a quiz fifth hour today and I haven\u2019t gotten through it yet. She leans over to see what I\u2019m reading and tilts her head just enough so that it just barely grazes my shoulder and even the slightest contact from her makes me feel home. It\u2019s instinctual. I turn toward her and kiss her hair before I realize what I\u2019ve done in a courtyard full of people. For us, it\u2019s a version of PDA on par with ripping each other\u2019s clothes off and performing a live sex show right here.</p><p>I wait for the world to implode, or at least for the looks and comments to start, but there\u2019s nothing. No distinguishable change in the atmosphere at all. And I wonder if the impossible has happened. That this, us, she and I, we have become normal. As soon as the word enters my mind, I know it\u2019s the wrong one. We haven\u2019t become normal, we\u2019ve become expected. And not just by everyone at school. I\u2019ve come to expect us, too. I expect her. I expect her here. I expect her at home. I expect her in my life.</p><p>And it\u2019s terrifying.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>Nastya</p><p>\u201cI like to talk, so I\u2019m just going to imagine our conversation here,\u201d Clay says while he\u2019s drawing me on his back porch after school. I smile and he yells at me to put my face back, which isn\u2019t easy, because Clay yelling at me is even funnier.</p><p>\u201cNormally you\u2019d hit all the g*y questions first because that\u2019s what people like to do,\u201d he says while he draws, and I don\u2019t know how he can concentrate on both things at once. I\u2019m a one thing at a time type of person which is why I have so much trouble keeping my mouth shut. Silence takes a serious amount of discipline. Because when you can talk but you just don\u2019t, part of your mind is constantly occupied with concentrating on making sure you don\u2019t open your mouth. Some days I wonder if it would be easier if I physically couldn\u2019t speak because then I wouldn\u2019t have to think about it all the time.</p><p>\u201cFirst question is always the classic Did you always know you were g*y? That\u2019s a good one,\u201d he says, looking at me without really looking. \u201cAnswer? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really think so, because I didn\u2019t really know what g*y was \u2018til I was like ten. So I\u2019m not sure. When I knew, I knew and I didn\u2019t really try to figure it out but people always ask that one.\u201d</p><p>He picks up a gray squishy eraser thing and rubs it against the paper.</p><p>\u201cNext one is usually Have you ever been with a girl, and if you haven\u2019t, then how can you be sure you\u2019re g*y? Answer? Not telling. None of your business. Next.\u201d He puts the eraser down and looks at the picture like he\u2019s not happy with something.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the one I don\u2019t mind answering. Were your parents pissed?\u201d The eraser is back again. \u201cNot really. I don\u2019t think they were pissed. They didn\u2019t tell me if they were. Disappointed? Maybe. But if so, they didn\u2019t outright say that either. I got the It may not be the path we would have chosen for you, but we just want you to be happy speech. It\u2019s a classic. I think it\u2019s on a website or something so parents can just print it off and read it, because both of them said the exact same thing, like they coordinated it or something. They haven\u2019t been together since I was two, so I had to do the coming out thing twice with them. I think Janice, my dad\u2019s wife, was a little freaked out, but I didn\u2019t care what she thought so much. And she\u2019s been cool since.\u201d Damn, this boy can talk. I don\u2019t think he took a breath once. I wonder if I should be embarrassed that I wanted to ask him every one of those questions, and if I talked, I probably would have by now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clay is looking happier with the picture now. His face is relaxed. When he\u2019s frustrated, his face tenses and he twists the bottom of his shirt around. I spend a lot of time staring at him, too. Not much else to do.</p><p>\u201cBut enough about me. Let\u2019s talk about you. What first? I bet your classic is why don\u2019t you talk? I\u2019m right aren\u2019t I? But I\u2019m going to skip that one. I think there are far more interesting questions to ask.\u201d</p><p>He asks his questions. Lots of them. But he doesn\u2019t get any answers from me so he comes up with his own. He takes pleasure in telling me how the world is coming to an end because Josh Bennett lets me sit with him at lunch and has been seen not only having unsolicited conversations with people but also, gasp, smiling. And that thought makes me smile, which Clay seems to appreciate.</p><p>According to Clay, the prevailing explanation for my foray into the Josh Bennett Dead Zone is that I must already be dead. That one amuses me because they think it\u2019s funny, but I think it\u2019s kind of true. Other people are sure I\u2019m in a cult and I\u2019m brainwashing him. That theory is my favorite. I\u2019ll have to let Josh know.</p> <p>\u201cAt least you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that shitdick Ethan after today,\u201d Clay continues.</p><p>I look at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear about that?\u201d His eyes are wide but I don\u2019t know why, because he knows no one really speaks to me. \u201cThis afternoon, Ethan was walking down the hall and bragging about you blowing him in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. This isn\u2019t anything new. Ethan spews this crap all the time, especially since he\u2019s figured out that I don\u2019t dispute it. The only three people I care about know it\u2019s not true, and I have a feeling that everyone who knows Ethan, knows it\u2019s not true also. Clay must see my lack of shock and it makes him almost giddy at the fact that he gets to tell me the rest of this story.</p><p>\u201cYeah, ok, not a big deal, right? But this time he did it with Josh walking behind him. It was awesome. Michelle and I had a front row seat. Josh nailed Ethan to the wall and Ethan\u2019s like \u2018You don\u2019t scare me, Bennett.\u2019 and Josh is like \u2018Good. Then you won\u2019t run the next time you see me coming, because if you ever say her name again, I\u2019ll make it possible for you to suck your own dick.\u2019 The best part was that Josh never even raised his voice. Just flat, scary freaking calm. Then he let Ethan go and walked away like nothing happened.\u201d He raises his eyebrows at me. \u201cSee? Awesome.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s so awesome. I know how much Josh hates to call attention to himself and I wish he didn\u2019t think he had to do it for me.</p><p>Clay finishes the drawing, and when he starts cleaning up, I go grab my stuff. At this point, I\u2019ve paid my debt for his door-holding ten times over. I figure he owes me something now. When he\u2019s done, I pull the photograph I\u2019ve been holding for days out of my backpack and hand it to him. Then I grab a sheet of paper and a pen and ask for what I want.</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I didn\u2019t remember what actually happened to me until over a year after it did. For days, then weeks, then months, I knew what everyone else knew. I knew that I left home to walk to school to record my last audition piece. I had gone home to change and get ready first, before heading back to campus. I agonized over every aspect of my appearance that day, especially my hands. I meticulously painted my nails to perfection. I wore a pale pink blouse with pearl buttons and a white eyelet skirt and everyone knew what I was wearing because they found me in it, even if the buttons were torn off.</p><p>I knew exactly where I was found in a heavily wooded section of the preserve that separated the park I cut through that day from the subdivision behind it. I knew that they didn\u2019t find me until late that night because a thunderstorm had rolled in, making the search nearly impossible. By that time, the Amber Alert had been running all over the state for hours. My name, my picture, my description. Everywhere. Even after they found me, the morbid curiosity didn\u2019t stop. People never can get enough of tragic stories about pretty little girls. I was good entertainment for a while, especially during the will she or won\u2019t she period, when they didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d live.</p> <p>I knew that when they got me to the hospital I was taken into surgery immediately and my heart stopped on the table for ninety-six seconds before they were able to restart it again.</p><p>I knew what had happened to me by piecing together an extensive list of injuries. For months, that\u2019s what I felt like. A list of injuries. A sum total of hurts. My entire body was made of pain.</p><p>One day I overheard one of my many doctors talking to a police detective when he didn\u2019t know I could hear. Have you caught that monster yet? he asked. The detective told him that they hadn\u2019t. You should string him up when you get him. He ruined that poor girl. I guessed he was right, because that was exactly how I felt, and when you hear your doctor saying that you\u2019re ruined, you figure he knows what he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u201cDid you always sleep with a shirt on? Before me?\u201d I ask Josh when we get into bed. Asher hates sleeping in a shirt. He insists that all guys hate sleeping in clothes but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. Josh always sleeps in a t-shirt and boxer shorts, which is usually what I\u2019m sleeping in, too. Josh won\u2019t let me fold his underwear, but apparently he doesn\u2019t have a problem with my wearing them.</p><p>\u201cBefore you, I didn\u2019t sleep with anything on,\u201d he says, and I can hear the smile in his voice, even if I can\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel my face get hot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a good trade off.\u201d</p><p>His hand finds its way up to my cheek. He leans down and kisses me and his lips are an invitation I\u2019m going to have to accept sooner or later. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you better, I\u2019d think you were blushing.\u201d</p> <p>But the fact is that he doesn\u2019t know me better. He doesn\u2019t really know me at all.</p><p>For the first time in weeks, we\u2019re not spending half the night in the garage. It\u2019s still early, but I tell him I\u2019m tired and I want to go to bed. I\u2019m not tired. I\u2019m just hoping he\u2019ll follow me. After about fifteen minutes, I hear him come out of the shower and then he climbs in next to me. He kisses the side of my head and says good night and then laces his fingers through my mine like he always does; like he\u2019s reminding me that he\u2019s still here, or maybe vice-versa.</p><p>I slide my hand under the fabric of his t-shirt, up his stomach until it\u2019s flat against the skin on his chest and I can feel his heart beating against my palm. I can just hear his breath hitch because he didn\u2019t see it coming. He\u2019s warm and solid and I want to touch every part of him. I should stop this, because I know where it\u2019s going. But I\u2019m the one who started it, and really, I just don\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cSunshine.\u201d It\u2019s all he says.</p><p>He rests his hand on top of mine through the fabric of his shirt. \u201cYou can take it off if you want to,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather take off yours,\u201d he jokes.</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m not joking. I feel him tense just slightly under my hand, but he doesn\u2019t move to do anything, and we lay there for a minute, just breathing and trying to read each other\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>It isn\u2019t like I\u2019ve never touched him and he\u2019s never touched me. Just never everywhere at once. I\u2019m in one of his t-shirts, like always, and he pulls it up over my head and I let him because that\u2019s what I want. I want him to touch me. Here. Now. Everywhere. Always.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could see you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t,\u201d I admit. Too many scars. I can blame them even if they aren\u2019t the real reason.</p><p>I\u2019m more at peace with Josh than anywhere else in the world and I want to run away before I ruin us both. But then his shirt is off, too, and his body is pressed against mine so that there\u2019s no space between us. He pushes my hair away, muttering something about \u201cstupid hair always in your face,\u201d but he keeps his hand tangled in it, and then he kisses me, and that\u2019s what we do for a long time.</p><p>Somehow he leaves my body just enough to reach his nightstand to get a condom which I think about telling him he doesn\u2019t need. Then he\u2019s leaning over me and kissing me again and I let myself focus on just that. Because it\u2019s real. It\u2019s true. One, real, amazing, true thing. And then his knee slips between mine gently pushing them apart and a moment later I can feel the pressure of him. I know the exact moment when he realizes\u200c\u2014\u200crealizes one of the thousand things I never told him. Because he stops right there. Suddenly eerily still. He\u2019s not kissing me anymore. He\u2019s staring at me and his face is so close to mine that I think he can read my mind.</p><p>I know he\u2019s going to say something, but I don\u2019t want him to, because it will make me tell him things. He\u2019ll make me feel safe and safe is something I should never feel again.</p><p>There are a thousand words in his eyes but all he says is, \u201cSunshine?\u201d It\u2019s not my name. It\u2019s a question. Or maybe it\u2019s more than one, but I don\u2019t let him say anything else.</p><p>I reach around him, though I\u2019m not sure this will even work, and I tilt my h*ps up and shove him towards me. And, for just a second, there\u2019s tearing and burning, and then it\u2019s done. I squeeze my eyes shut because pain is familiar and grounding and I\u2019d rather give myself to that. I\u2019m used to pain and this really isn\u2019t so bad. It\u2019s the look on his face that I\u2019m not used to \u2013 awe, confusion, wonder and please, please, please don\u2019t let it be love.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He\u2019s inside me but he still doesn\u2019t move. His hands are on either side of my face and he looks like he\u2019s scared of me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, but I don\u2019t know if it comes out. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m okay. It shouldn\u2019t be possible to be this close to another person. To let them crawl inside you.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>Josh</p><p>When it\u2019s over, we\u2019re both shaking, and for a moment I\u2019m confused and comforted and loved and then I\u2019m lost. I don\u2019t know what happened. Just that it did. And she\u2019s here, but she\u2019s not. And I want to be happy, but I can\u2019t, because she\u2019s crying underneath me. At first, it\u2019s just soft and barely there and I hardly recognize what\u2019s happening because I\u2019ve never seen her cry. Then her body starts racking with it and it\u2019s so jagged and wrong. There\u2019s still barely any sound coming out, but it\u2019s the shaking that\u2019s almost worse and it steals every undeserved ounce of joy I felt just the moment before.</p><p>I need to get away from here. I wish she would stop crying, because I don\u2019t think I can take it for one more second and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s loud or melodramatic. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just heartbreaking.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I did, so I just hold her and whisper I\u2019m sorry, because I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019m sorry. Again and again and again against her hair. I don\u2019t know how many times I say it or for how long, just that I can\u2019t stop. But she doesn\u2019t stop crying and I know that it\u2019s not enough.</p><p>She\u2019s gone in the morning and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s gone from the bed or the house or from everything.</p><p>She isn\u2019t at school. I called her phone three times, even though I\u2019m not supposed to, but she didn\u2019t answer. I didn\u2019t expect her to. I wanted to text her but I couldn\u2019t think of any words that wouldn\u2019t sound desperate.</p><p>When I get home, she\u2019s waiting in my garage. She\u2019s on the counter where she used to sit and her chair is empty on the other side.</p><p>I hit the button and the automatic door lowers, bringing all of the dread of this moment down with it. I walk into the house, because I don\u2019t want to do this in my garage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s Nastya today. The hair, make-up, clothes, everything black like it is for school, except today, it\u2019s for me. I shake my head. Nothing about her is real. I\u2019ve had her sitting in front of me for months and I didn\u2019t see her, I didn\u2019t hear her. I didn\u2019t know her any better than everyone else. I feel like I\u2019ve failed somehow. Failed me, failed her, failed us.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything and she doesn\u2019t say anything. I start wondering if we may never speak again and then my mouth opens.</p><p>\u201cDid I lose you?\u201d It\u2019s not what I expected to ask, but I want the answer. Her face doesn\u2019t change and I realize that I had forgotten what that blank expression even looked like on her.</p><p>\u201cI lost you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d I answer, but the word barely comes out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me.\u201d Her tone is flat and she has this weird calm about her that makes me want to scream.</p><p>I want to tell her that I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like not to want her, that maybe there isn\u2019t anything else I do want. I want to ask her who the hell she is to tell me what I do and don\u2019t want. But nothing will come out of my mouth and maybe she thinks that means I\u2019m agreeing with her.</p><p>\u201cSo this is over?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left?\u201d This is where she finally looks in my eyes and I know it\u2019s because she means it.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d I say, because I\u2019m not ready to say there\u2019s nothing left.</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d She\u2019s playing dumb and it insults us both.</p><p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk?\u201d I think my voice goes up an octave because I can\u2019t believe this and I feel a decade\u2019s worth of resolve shatter. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask? Is that what you want? You want me to start asking questions? Now? I\u2019m allowed? Because I don\u2019t think you want that, but hey, let\u2019s go for it. What the f**k happened to your hand?\u201d</p><p>She flinches. Maybe because of the question. Maybe because I\u2019m yelling now.</p> <p>\u201cNo? Not that one? No good? Then how about what the hell happened last night?\u201d I want this answer more than I ever wanted the other one.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond which isn\u2019t even the slightest bit shocking, but I don\u2019t need her to, because I\u2019m on a tear and I have no intention of stopping.</p><p>\u201cTell me! You\u2019re the one who came over here and insinuated yourself into every part of my life and then you wait until I have every last thread of my existence wrapped around you and then you leave. Why? What is that about? Was it a joke? Were you bored? Thought it would be fun to f**k with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I don\u2019t even know what that means. \u201cBecause you were a virgin?\u201d It sounds stupid and I realize how much I hate that word. Maybe I\u2019m stupid. Actually, I am stupid for ever assuming I knew anything about this girl. But she walks around with this guttermouth spewing innuendos like she\u2019s talking about baking cookies and then I\u2019m the prick for not realizing she\u2019s never done it before. Somehow, I\u2019m to blame for everything here and I don\u2019t even know what I did.</p><p>\u201cWhy then? Why did you sleep with me?\u201d I hate the desperation in my voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew you wanted to.\u201d Straight. Cold. Matter-of-fact. Empty. She knows it\u2019s a lie.</p><p>\u201cBullshit, Sunshine.\u201d There\u2019s no controlling my voice now. I am beyond pissed. \u201cYou lost your virginity because I wanted you to? Don\u2019t you dare put this on me. I never would have done that to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to me. I did it to you. I used you.\u201d The dead calm in her voice is infuriating.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I\u2019m shaking now because I\u2019m so angry.</p><p>\u201cIt was the last thing about me that wasn\u2019t ruined. I just wanted to finish it.\u201d She\u2019s drawing circles on the floor with her toes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting. That\u2019s what I\u2019m worth to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you used me to ruin you?\u201d I\u2019m forcing calm into my voice but I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m getting it from. Maybe the ice coming off of her is starting to reach me. \u201cThat makes a lot of f**king sense.\u201d I laugh and it\u2019s bitter. I walk across the room and my fist is through my bedroom door. The wood splinters into my hand. I see her cringe for a second before she remembers herself. Then the nothing expression returns and all that\u2019s left is Nastya.</p><p>\u201cSo what, then? Did I? Did I ruin you?\u201d</p><p>She nods. And I laugh again because it\u2019s the only sound that will come out.</p><p>\u201cFucking amazing.\u201d I can\u2019t stop the laughing and I think I might be crazy. I throw my hands up because I\u2019m done. \u201cCongratulations, then. You wanted to be ruined? Well, you did yourself one better because you wrecked me, too, Sunshine. Now we\u2019re both worth shit.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move. Just stares at the ground. Her hands are fists like mine.</p><p>I sit down because I think my knees are shaking now, too. I bend over and press my palms against my eyes. I can\u2019t see her, but I know she\u2019s still there.</p><p>\u201cGet the f**k out of my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to love me,\u201d she whispers, almost like she\u2019s saying it to herself.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Nastya. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She walks out and shuts the door silently behind her. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said her name.</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Nastya. The word sounds like broken glass coming out of his mouth. Sleeping with Josh isn\u2019t what ruins me. This is what ruins me. His voice. His face. His horror at this whole f**ked up situation. He looked at me like he couldn\u2019t believe I was doing this and I can\u2019t blame him because I couldn\u2019t believe it either. But I did it anyway, because that\u2019s what I do.</p><p>CHAPTER 47</p><p>Nastya</p><p>Everything is hell now and I deserve it, but I can handle pain if it\u2019s pain of my own choosing.</p><p>Drew tiptoes around me now and I avoid him. I won\u2019t put him in the middle of this. He belongs to Josh. I spend most of my time with Clay. Or alone. Being alone would be easier if I liked myself. But, right now, I don\u2019t. Not even a little.</p><p>Fourth and fifth periods are the worst, because that\u2019s when I have to see him and I can\u2019t pretend that he never existed, like I try to every other moment of the day. As if that might help. As if anything might help. I could pretend that I don\u2019t watch him, that I have enough resolve and self-respect not to let him catch me staring, but I don\u2019t have the discipline. Every day I say I won\u2019t look, but I do. The only good thing about it is that he never catches me looking. Because he\u2019s never looking at me. And he shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve him.</p><p>The world should be full of Josh Bennetts. But it\u2019s not. I had the only one.</p><p>And I threw him away.</p><p>One day Margot sits down at the kitchen table with me while I pretend to concentrate on reading a poem I haven\u2019t comprehended a word of. My homework is getting done more these days. I can\u2019t even tell you how many miles I run.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t escaped me that apparently you live here again,\u201d she says.</p><p>I keep staring at the poem like the words will suddenly swim up from the paper and make their way into my brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask you if you wanted to talk about it.\u201d She just barely smiles and she\u2019s trying, but it\u2019s pointless. Because everything is pointless right now. I\u2019m pointless.</p><p>I even start going home on the weekends so no one will expect me at Sunday dinner. And maybe that\u2019s the only thing I do that\u2019s worth a damn.</p><p>No one asks me why I keep coming back all of a sudden. They just let me come.</p><p>I get another birthday present one weekend when I get home. Since I didn\u2019t take the phone, my mother gives me a camera. It\u2019s simpler, not as crazy as hers, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the camera she\u2019s giving me, anyway. She\u2019s giving me part of her. Trying to replace part of me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea or a bad idea but I\u2019m starting to get tired of judging and second guessing everyone\u2019s motives, because I\u2019m starting to grasp the real problem and I know that it\u2019s me. I don\u2019t have Josh anymore. I\u2019ve kind of lost Drew. I need my mother. I want the warmth of that unconditional love so much that I\u2019m willing to ignore the price, and for the first time in almost three years, maybe I can admit that, even if it\u2019s only in my head.</p><p>We don\u2019t talk yet, but maybe.</p><p>My mother shows me how to use the camera and we wander around taking pictures of nothing and everything. She doesn\u2019t even drill me about format and composition. Sometimes my hand will stutter and ruin one but we ignore it.</p><p>On Sundays, I work on teaching my dad how to make pancakes from scratch instead of a mix, because it\u2019s really just baking in a pan and it\u2019s something I can do.</p><p>Nothing is perfect. It\u2019s not even good yet, but maybe.</p><p>I miss him today. I miss him every day. I went to Home Depot tonight just to walk through the lumber aisle and try to breathe.</p><p>I\u2019m back to hiding in the bathrooms at lunch. Clay props the door open for me again, but we pretend it doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>My hands are turning soft again.</p><p>Josh will be eighteen next week.</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d I ask when Mrs. Leighton hands me the last present on the table. We\u2019ve eaten dinner and done the whole cake thing. I skipped the wishing. Nothing in me wants to be here.</p><p>\u201cIt was on the porch this afternoon. It had a piece of paper taped on it, but all it said was your name. No card.\u201d</p><p>I rip open the paper and now I want to disappear so I can be alone in this moment. I want to be allowed to see this without anyone seeing me.</p><p>The frame I\u2019m holding in my hands is a simple black gallery frame. It\u2019s nothing special. The picture in the frame is what throws me, knocks me on the ground and kicks me around a little bit.</p><p>When I pull off the rest of the wrapping paper a photograph that had been stuck in the front of the frame falls to the floor. Drew picks it up and looks at it before handing it to me and I can tell he wants to keep holding it.</p><p>I recognize the picture. It was in a photo album on the bookshelf in my living room. It\u2019s my mother with Amanda on her lap and they aren\u2019t looking at the camera. They\u2019re smiling at each other, but you can still see their faces. They\u2019re both beautiful and I realize that I forgot that they were; like everything else I\u2019ve lost to forgetting, because there\u2019s nobody left to remind me.</p><p>There are photographs all over my house. Everywhere. I didn\u2019t put all of the people I loved away. They all still hang on the walls, mostly because they always have. I didn\u2019t put them there, but I didn\u2019t take them down, either. I left them where they were like nothing happened. But not this picture. This one has been tucked away in an album for years. I love this picture. I forgot that I did. And I can see this one. Not like the ones on the walls that I\u2019ve walked by every day, so many times that they stopped registering a long time ago.</p><p>The picture in the frame is a perfectly rendered charcoal drawing, just like the photograph, only bigger. Even though it\u2019s black and white, I watch my mother\u2019s eyes crinkle with her smile and I see my sister breathe, and for a moment, I think they\u2019re alive. It\u2019s Clay\u2019s work. There isn\u2019t a question. And there\u2019s only one person who could have given him that photograph. But she isn\u2019t here, either, because she left me, too.</p><p>She has no right to do this. To make it harder for me to hate her, because I need to hate her right now more than I need anything.</p><p>\u201cI forgot how hot your mom was,\u201d Drew says, because he detests uncomfortable situations and his way of dissolving the tension is to remind us that he\u2019s an ass. And I love him for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mrs. Leighton smacks Drew\u2019s arm. His father comes around and smacks his head and then pulls Mrs. Leighton to him and kisses her hair.</p><p>And I go home alone.</p><p>It\u2019s been five weeks since she walked out of my house. I started counting the second the door closed. I wonder when I\u2019ll stop.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s Corinthos having killed now?\u201d Drew walks in after school and crashes on the other end of the couch. I switch the TV off because I\u2019m not watching it anyway and I really just don\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he asks, after waiting through the requisite fifteen seconds of silence, which is the maximum Drew can stand. \u201cAre you ever going to tell me what happened between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, because it\u2019s true. Because it\u2019s the last thing I want to talk about. Because I might actually cry if I do, and honestly, because I really don\u2019t know what the hell happened. \u201cI\u2019m probably not.\u201d</p><p>Drew nods and doesn\u2019t argue. I know she\u2019s been avoiding him, too, even in debate. \u201cI miss having her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it,\u201d I say and I turn the TV back on.</p><p>CHAPTER 48</p> <p>Nastya</p><p>I turn away from the mirror to catch Drew walking into the girls\u2019 bathroom in the back corner of the drama department. The drama teachers have planning this period and I\u2019ve learned that this bathroom is almost always empty. So it\u2019s my favorite.</p><p>\u201cI assume we\u2019re alone,\u201d he says, turning and locking the door. \u201cYou know this is like the fourth bathroom I\u2019ve looked for you in. I was starting to fear for my safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Drew?\u201d I whisper and it\u2019s barely audible because I don\u2019t care if he locked the door and no one\u2019s around.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d he says, like this is a valid excuse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou miss me, too. Admit it, Nastypants.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I miss the crap out of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, anyway? Nastypants? You make me sound like I shit myself.\u201d</p><p>He looks down at my jeans as if he\u2019s considering this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to drag you out of your social abyss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to ask me for a favor, so get on with it, because I don\u2019t like talking here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your bodyguard services this Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, and no again. And wait. Hold on a second. No.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I say please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d He\u2019s trying to give me the look, but he and I are so far past the look that it\u2019s ridiculous. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me to get you through one night. Just tell everyone you\u2019re meeting me after. They\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will buy that after you and Josh. No one\u2019s going to believe I\u2019d do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I wouldn\u2019t do and everybody knows it. The only person in the world I wouldn\u2019t screw over is Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about it, so stop bringing up his name and trying to insinuate him into this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is in this conversation whether I say his name or not.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up in surrender at the glare I shoot him. I will not talk about Josh.</p><p>\u201cFine. All I have to say is that I thought I had self-destructive tendencies but you two make me look well-adjusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s the opposite of alright, but I\u2019m also pretty sure that you knew that when you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not playing this game. You\u2019re the one who made the rules. Not going to talk about Josh.\u201d He makes himself comfortable on the bathroom counter like we\u2019re in his kitchen at home. \u201cNow, subject at hand. They don\u2019t need to think that I\u2019m with you. I just need you to come and keep me in line. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll end up walking through the house, asking every single person if they\u2019ve seen her. And then I\u2019ll probably say shitty things about her just to have an excuse to say her name or get her attention.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say her name now but it\u2019s no secret who he\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou have to save me from myself. And save yourself from utter boredom and solitude in the process. Win-win.\u201d</p><p>There isn\u2019t any win for me in this situation. I\u2019d rather staple my lips to my tongue than go to a party tonight. I climb up next to him on the counter and let out all the air in my lungs and he does the same.</p><p>\u201cI should just go back to the way I was before,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to be so awesome and she made me suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, do it. Start tonight. You won\u2019t have any problem finding some girl willing to accompany you on the road back to soulless debauchery.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond, because he and I both know what he lost on that path already, and he hasn\u2019t forgiven himself for it. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s another solution but I try to offer him one.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there another girl you can ask out? For real? Try to have a normal relationship? You messed everything up with Tierney, but you could actually try to learn from that and do it right this time.\u201d It\u2019s an asinine suggestion. If he told me to learn from my mistakes with Josh and put that knowledge to use with someone else, I\u2019d dislocate his jaw. But it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to go with right now. \u201cWhat about Tessa Walter?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cCrazy eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacy Singleton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaughs too loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey Lake?\u201d</p><p>This time he glares at me like I\u2019ve just suggested he date the Antichrist.</p><p>\u201cShe says supposably.\u201d If Drew Leighton were a woman, this would be his unforgivable thing.</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you just try again with Tierney?\u201d She\u2019s the only one he really wants. I could name every girl in this school and he would find the flaw in every last one of them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask her to forgive me. I wouldn\u2019t respect her if she did. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t deserve it either. I\u2019m not enough of a hypocrite to argue.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just skip it? You don\u2019t have to go. You never even drink at these parties. Why would you want to hang out with a bunch of drunk ass**les for no reason?\u201d It\u2019s true. It took me a while to pick up on it, but once I did, I never stopped noticing. Drew gets a drink as soon as he walks in and he carries it around the whole night, so everyone assumes he\u2019s drinking, but he never is.</p><p>\u201cYou noticed that, huh?\u201d He\u2019s almost impressed. \u201cYou\u2019re the first one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a reason.\u201d I\u2019m expecting him to say something about having to drive, but that\u2019s not what I get.</p><p>\u201cKara Matthews,\u201d he answers, like this explains everything, but he knows it doesn\u2019t and I wait for him to give me the rest. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember doing it. Tierney ripped me to shreds for hours that day and she was right. She was right about everything she said about me, except the fact that I didn\u2019t care about her. But everything else she nailed me on. I got so lit that night that I would have screwed anyone at that party. I shit all over Tierney and everything and I don\u2019t even remember doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think if you weren\u2019t so drunk you wouldn\u2019t have done it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replies honestly. \u201cI probably would have. But at least I\u2019d know. If I was going to mess everything up, at least it would have been a conscious choice.\u201d</p><p>It makes perfect sense to me. He may not revel in the pain he caused himself but at least he could say that he chose it. That\u2019s not the only thing that haunts him, though. There\u2019s a question there, too. The slim, slight possibility that, just maybe, he wouldn\u2019t have done it. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t been so wasted things might have turned out differently, and he would be with Tierney right now, not in a girls\u2019 bathroom being haunted by dead possibilities.</p><p>He shrugs in resignation. \u201cI figure the next time I want to completely destroy all chance of happiness, at least I\u2019ll remember doing it.\u201d It\u2019ll make the self-loathing that much easier.</p><p>I could say that I have no idea why I agreed to this, but it would be a lie. I miss Drew, too. And I\u2019m sick of myself. I\u2019d rather drink flat beer and hang out with people who don\u2019t like me. No one at that party will hate me as much as I hate myself, so it\u2019ll be an improvement.</p><p>It\u2019s crowded already when we get to Kevin Leonard\u2019s house. The music is blaring and I wonder how long this can possibly last before the neighbors call the police. I hope they do, so I can leave, because I already regret it. I don\u2019t mind all of the people. I actually do better with crowds and numbers but the noise makes me edgy. I need the quiet to hear what\u2019s coming.</p><p>I follow Drew through the house, my fingers threaded through his belt loops so I don\u2019t lose him. He wants me on him tonight, I\u2019m on him.</p><p>Damien Brooks finds us first and I can\u2019t stand him but he\u2019s at least familiar.</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d He\u2019s already drunk. One word and it\u2019s evident. \u201cDamn. I know you had her first but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d go back there after Bennett. Man, you\u2019ve got balls.\u201d He\u2019s laughing and congratulatory. Drew\u2019s laughing, too. I\u2019m not even in the room. Oh, wait. I am, but you wouldn\u2019t know it the way they\u2019re talking. Good thing I don\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Then Damien\u2019s eyes go wide like he\u2019s just discovered the atom or the concept of self-pleasure. \u201cHave you guys been sharing her this whole time?\u201d</p><p>Maybe I do give a shit. At least a little. Because I\u2019m not listening to this anymore. I grab Drew\u2019s hand and start to pull away. I think he\u2019s had enough, too, because he doesn\u2019t fight me.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Tierney. The sniper I\u2019m being used as a human shield against. I actually really like her and I wish I wasn\u2019t the person being tasked with keeping Drew away from her. I don\u2019t blame her for wanting to hate Drew, but it doesn\u2019t mean she does. All of a sudden I wish they could just get their shit together, but my hypocrisy slaps me in the face before I can think any more on the subject.</p><p>We make it to the kitchen at the back of the house where Kevin Leonard is manning a keg with a crowd surrounding it. They start chanting Drew\u2019s name like he\u2019s their god, and I guess if I was a teenage boy with no game, he\u2019d be mine, too. It takes no time before we have cups full of warm beer and are fighting our way back out of the kitchen.</p><p>An hour and four and a half crap beers later, I\u2019m leaning against a wall while Drew talks to a girl in a very tiny, very sparkly top, who has no problem shamelessly flirting with him in front of me. True to form, Drew is still carrying around the same half-full cup of beer he\u2019s had since we walked in. I\u2019m not completely trashed, but I\u2019m tired and I want to go home. I\u2019m tipsy enough that my brain isn\u2019t bombarding me with a diatribe on how idiotic I am. Instead it\u2019s whispering that calling Josh wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Drunk dialing the perfect, incredible, wonderful boy I pissed all over might even be enough to win me a gold medal in selfishness. I don\u2019t get to fully explore that thought, though, because I\u2019m back on duty.</p><p>Tierney starts walking in our direction and sparkly tank top girl walks away. Tierney\u2019s like that. No one really f**ks with her and I want to hug her and tell her I think she\u2019s sooooo awesome and maybe I\u2019m a little drunker than I thought. I didn\u2019t eat today which might account for that. Rookie mistake.</p><p>I step over to put my half full beer on a really ugly end table (I notice these things now); I don\u2019t need to drink any more. Once I can pull Drew away from Tierney, I will have fulfilled my responsibilities and I can get him to take me home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I turn around, Drew isn\u2019t there. And neither is Tierney.</p><p>I start pushing my way through the throng of people, looking for either of them. I figure one will lead to the other, but it\u2019s not like I can walk around yelling their names and asking if anyone has seen them. I\u2019m staying against the wall, out of the center of the chaos, when Kevin Leonard finds me.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying the party?\u201d</p><p>Huh? Is he expecting an answer? I give him a stupid thumbs-up and try to keep walking. Drew Leighton so owes me something for this. I start mentally making a list of what I want. There\u2019s only one thing on it, so far, but I think it\u2019s out of his control.</p> <p>\u201cWanna have sex with me?\u201d Kevin asks. This was not the one thing on my list. I try to walk around him and his monstrous ego. He\u2019s obviously plastered and I\u2019m getting more sober by the minute. I really want to go home and I want to kick Drew\u2019s ass. I\u2019m not sure which of those things I want more right now and Kevin Leonard is still talking.</p><p>\u201cWe can go to my room. I blocked off the upstairs. No one will know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll know, jackass. And I\u2019ll spend the rest of my days trying to block it from my memory.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby.\u201d Guess that\u2019s my answer. Real boys do call girls baby. Too bad I don\u2019t feel like laughing and I don\u2019t have time to choke him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Does he think I\u2019m looking for manners now? Well, since you said please, I may have to reconsider my previous hell no stance on screwing you. I was just waiting for the good breeding to kick in. I shake my head as definitively as I can and keep moving. Mercifully, he gives up and doesn\u2019t follow me.</p> <p>He did give me an idea, though, because if I can\u2019t find Drew in the next ten minutes, I\u2019m not waiting around to be propositioned again. I\u2019ll find another way home.</p><p>The next ten minutes are as fruitless as the last. I even give it another ten, just for shits and giggles, before I finally concede defeat. I walk the downstairs, and at least a few people have started to filter out so it\u2019s not as jam-packed, but the music is still tattooing itself on my eardrums and splitting my brain. I shoot off a text to Drew asking where he is but I don\u2019t get any response. I send him another one telling him I\u2019m sneaking upstairs to try to find a ride. I still don\u2019t get an answer.</p><p>I hang around the bottom of the stairs for a few minutes, and when Kara Matthews starts doing a beer bong in the kitchen, I use the distraction to duck under Kevin\u2019s makeshift barricade and sneak upstairs so I can use my phone.</p><p>I may be a little shitty right now, but even with a few beers in me, I never forget to watch my back. No one follows me and I turn down the hall to the left and slip into one of the bedrooms. I stay against the wall until I can feel the light switch. The room is empty. The music is still blaring and I can just make out the muted chanting of Kara\u2019s name. I take out my phone, knowing there are only two people I can really call. Josh is the one I want to call but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s allowed anymore. There\u2019s Clay, who I\u2019d have to text, but I could have done that from downstairs. I came up here for one reason and it\u2019s because I wanted to call Josh.</p><p>I dial and wait but there isn\u2019t any answer. It doesn\u2019t go straight to voicemail. It just rings. When the recording finally kicks in, I hang up. It\u2019s too pathetic to think about leaving him a message. I flip the keyboard open to shoot Clay a text and see if he can pick me up, but before I can get the first word out, the door opens.</p><p>And Kevin Leonard is there.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d change your mind,\u201d he slurs, and I wonder how much he struggled to get it out. I\u2019m about to shake my head again but he\u2019s right in front of me now. And I\u2019m not running away or saying no or pushing him. Because, really, I just don\u2019t care. If I want to ruin myself, then this is my chance. Josh is gone, like everything that was taken from me and everything I\u2019ve thrown away since. There is no Josh Bennett for me anymore. There really isn\u2019t anything.</p><p>That\u2019s the only moment I have to think before his tongue is in my mouth and he tastes like piss beer and I probably do, too, and everything about this is disgusting, but I deserve it. He\u2019s grabbing my chest through my dress with one hand and running the other up my thigh. My arms are limp at my sides and I close my eyes and just let him do it. He starts pulling my underwear down and then stops to get rid of my dress. He pulls it part of the way up and I can feel the cold air on my inner thighs and against my stomach, reminding me that I should be used and thrown away, too.</p><p>Then his hand is between my legs and I gag into his mouth when I feel his fingers. And maybe I\u2019ve finally had enough and I won\u2019t choose this pain.</p><p>I break away from his mouth and his hand and I pull my dress down. If there is such a thing as rock bottom, it\u2019s where I am right now. I can lie to myself. I can lie to Josh. But it\u2019s just that. A lie. I didn\u2019t destroy any part of me when I slept with him, even if I did destroy everything after. I knew that it wasn\u2019t true when I said it and I know it now. I don\u2019t regret one minute I ever spent with Josh. What I regret is every single second after. I regret ripping his heart out. I regret sending us both straight to hell.</p><p>If I let Kevin Leonard do this, if I let myself do this, then this, here, now, will be what destroys the last good thing about me. This will be my unforgivable thing. I will never come back from it because there will be absolutely nothing left in me worth loving. And for once in my stupid, pissed on life, I can\u2019t do it. Or, more importantly, maybe I won\u2019t.</p><p>I push my hand against his chest. Not violently. Just decisively. I shake my head at him. No. I try to look apologetic. I feel guilty. Am I supposed to feel bad in this situation? I don\u2019t really know the rules. I yank my dress down as far as it will go, but it doesn\u2019t feel like enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k, Nastya?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head again. I mouth the words I can\u2019t because I need to make sure he understands. He understands, but he doesn\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to blueball me up here at my own f**king party?\u201d I don\u2019t even have a chance to bend over and pull my underwear back up before he grabs me and kisses me again and I don\u2019t need an invitation. I stomp on his foot and grab for the door, but my hands are shaking and it\u2019s locked and I can\u2019t make my fingers work fast enough. I get the lock flipped but I don\u2019t have enough time to turn the doorknob. I should have gone at him harder but I didn\u2019t think I needed to. I just wanted to let him know it wasn\u2019t happening and give myself enough of a window to make it to the door and get out. But it\u2019s not enough. His hand wraps around my arm, turning me to face him and I grab his pinky finger and bend it back. I\u2019m not in a position to take him down and I just want to get away. That\u2019s all. I hear his finger crack and his other hand immediately swings up and punches me. It\u2019s such a knee-jerk reaction, I\u2019m not sure he even realizes what he\u2019s done. I catch the full force of his fist against my cheek and my balance is off, so the impact spins me face first into the corner of the nightstand next to the bed. I can feel the blood running down from the corner of my eye and I swipe it away. From this position, I flip over and try to buy myself a second by kicking him but he grabs my ankle and drags me away from the door. My underwear has worked its way down to my knees, the panic is starting to push bile into my throat and I feel myself stop breathing.</p><p>I\u2019m panicking like this is a nightmare. He\u2019s laughing like it\u2019s a game.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You came up here and made me think you were going to screw me. You could at least suck my dick.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even sound angry. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to convince me.</p><p>If I had any bad feelings about fighting dirty, they\u2019re gone now. The shit part is that I\u2019ve never been as good at defending myself from the ground and nothing is as easy as it was when I was practicing in a controlled situation. Nothing. Plus, the beer isn\u2019t helping, no matter how sober I suddenly feel.</p><p>I don\u2019t have the kubotan. It\u2019s in my purse under the seat in Drew\u2019s car, right next to my can of pepper spray because I didn\u2019t have anywhere to clip it on my dress. I figured I was going to be stapled to Drew\u2019s side the entire night, anyway, so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need it. Maybe the operative words there are didn\u2019t think.</p><p>The fact is, I don\u2019t want to use either of those things on Kevin Leonard. I just want to get out of this. I feel like I\u2019ve set off a string of explosions and now I\u2019m trying to outrun them.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t surprise me that putting myself in this stupid-ass situation is what it takes for me to finally decide not to completely incinerate what\u2019s left of my life. I\u2019m such a f**king idiot. Maybe karma is just trying to give me what I said I wanted, but never really did. To wreck myself once and for all.</p><p>I can feel my cheek burning where he hit me and the blood from the gash is running into my eye and I\u2019m trying to focus because I\u2019m afraid at any moment I\u2019m going to leave this room and be back in the trees, with dirt and blood in my mouth. And then I\u2019ll lose all control. I\u2019ll stop fighting completely. Kevin Leonard will be able to do whatever he wants, and I\u2019ll let him because I won\u2019t even be here anymore.</p><p>The focusing is almost impossible when my brain is split between staying awake in this room and trying to fight him off. He\u2019s over me, pinning my arms and legs to the floor and pushing his mouth on me again. He has every one of my limbs is immobilized. I can\u2019t even shift. I lean into him to give me just enough leeway to tilt my head back and head-butt him because that\u2019s the only option I really have. I\u2019m aiming for the bridge of his nose but my position is off and my forehead cracks against his instead. It\u2019s a mistake but he\u2019s so drunk that it\u2019s enough. My head is screaming at me from the impact as his sweaty body falls on top of mine, crushing me with the weight of every bad decision I\u2019ve made over the past three years.</p><p>\u201cDude! Forget it.\u201d There\u2019s saliva running down the side of his mouth.</p><p>The fight has gone out of him and I think it finally hits him, in his drunken stupor, what\u2019s going on, because he looks at me like he\u2019s just now seeing me bleeding from the head on the floor in this room with him. He leans back and I haven\u2019t even had a moment to turn my body and free myself when the door abruptly opens and I\u2019m looking up from the floor, underneath Kevin Leonard\u2019s body, at Drew Leighton\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k, Leighton?\u201d Kevin spits out. There\u2019s more embarrassment than venom in it, but I\u2019m not excusing him any more than I\u2019m excusing myself. He\u2019s still struggling to push himself off of me and I use the distraction to twist my hip and get the rest of the way free.</p><p>For a minute, or maybe just a second, Drew is frozen. There are so many emotions on his face that I can\u2019t sort them all now. Confusion, disgust, anger, guilt, fear, horror. I wonder how bad my face is to make his look like that.</p><p>Kevin is barely standing now and I\u2019m dizzily getting to my feet, my head still reeling from smashing into his. Before I even register what\u2019s happening, Drew\u2019s fist is in Kevin\u2019s face and he\u2019s down again. I look at Drew and he\u2019s shaking. There is something so wrong with the sight of Drew Leighton hitting someone. Drew Leighton is supposed to be sunny and irreverent and free of every care in the world. There isn\u2019t even a glimmer of violence in him. I wish he hadn\u2019t done it. I wish he hadn\u2019t seen this, because as crazy as I know it sounds, I feel like he\u2019s just lost his innocence.</p><p>Drew is standing in front of me, knuckles bleeding, with a look of such sheer despondence that I feel like I should comfort him. But I can\u2019t. Now that this is over, my adrenaline is starting to drop and I want to get away from here, because I smell like Kevin Leonard and I\u2019m starting to shake, too.</p><p>I lean against the wall to steady myself. Drew curses under his breath, pulling his sleeve over his wrist and trying to wipe the blood away from my eye. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d he whispers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My look tells him I can and that I don\u2019t appreciate the question. I don\u2019t say anything. We turn toward the door and I realize that my underwear is still at my ankles. I stop and just stand there, looking down at them. Drew turns to find out why I\u2019ve stopped, his eyes following mine to my feet, and all of his muscles tense when he sees why I\u2019m not coming. He stifles another curse as I bend over to pull them up because I can\u2019t look at his face right now.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me, okay?\u201d His words are strained and he sounds like he\u2019s in pain. He takes my hand so tightly, I think he might crush it and pulls me behind him so I\u2019m blocked from view. I catch Tierney Lowell watching in the hall before I turn away. I drag my hair down around my face and lean into Drew\u2019s back like I\u2019m wasted, just until we can get through everybody and out the door. And maybe wasted is exactly what I am.</p><p>My face is bleeding and swollen but I don\u2019t even care. For the first time in forever, I make a choice not to shit all over my life and I can\u2019t even like myself for it because I made it five minutes too late.</p><p>At least no one can tell me it was random.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Drew waits until we\u2019ve gotten in his car and driven away from the house to ask. I\u2019ve hated that question for years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say. \u201cYour hand.\u201d My eyes go to his split knuckles which are straining even more with his iron grip on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about my hand,\u201d he bites out at me and I instinctively recoil because I\u2019ve never heard him raise his voice. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He pulls into the parking lot of a convenience store and parks the car. This whole situation is f**ked up and he says so at least three or four times.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He sounds like he doesn\u2019t really want the answer.</p><p>\u201cJust a stupid situation that got out of hand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d His tone is sharp.</p><p>\u201cAre you pissed at me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s my fault you were in that room in the first place. I finally bothered to look at my phone and got your text. I thought I\u2019d find you sitting up there and waiting, not on the floor with Kevin Leonard on top of you.\u201d He takes a breath and lets it out watching the lighted R on the store sign flicker in and out. \u201cJosh is going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh isn\u2019t going to care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know that isn\u2019t true, so don\u2019t say it. I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with you about it tonight.\u201d There is so much weight in his voice that I feel it physically pressing on me.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew what I did to Josh, you would hate me, too. He won\u2019t care and I won\u2019t blame him for not caring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know what you did to Josh. I have no idea what went on there because neither of you will tell me. I do know that whatever it was will not be enough to stop him from giving a shit about someone hurting you.\u201d</p><p>I flip down the visor and check the bruise on my face and the cut on my eye in the mirror. It\u2019s really not so bad, but my cheek and my forehead are already starting to swell and I know it\u2019ll all look worse tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cHis pants were still on.\u201d He\u2019s tracing the logo on the steering wheel now.</p><p>I nod, even though he\u2019s not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cSo, he didn\u2019t\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer. I don\u2019t want to talk about Kevin Leonard anymore. \u201cDid anybody else see?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Tierney did, but she was looking for us so\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d he cuts himself off. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else was paying attention.\u201d</p><p>We sit there, pretending to be mesmerized by the flashing lottery sign.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Tierney?\u201d I ask, ignoring the unspoken apology.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shakes his head and turns the key in the ignition. \u201cWe need to get ice on your face.\u201d</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re going. He doesn\u2019t ask where I want to go. He takes me where I need to go and maybe where he needs to go, too. He takes me to Josh\u2019s house.</p><p>The garage is closed when we get there, but Drew and I both have a key to the house. He turns his in the lock and pushes the door back for me. I walk inside and Drew follows. When we step into the dark of the foyer, it takes us a minute to process what we\u2019re hearing. And then I wish on a thousand pennies that we didn\u2019t have that key.</p><p>CHAPTER 49</p><p>Josh</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Drew? It\u2019s two in the morning.\u201d I look at his car in the driveway and it\u2019s empty. At first, I suspected he was bringing Sunshine back here because she was drunk, but there\u2019s no one in the car. \u201cYou already drop Nastya off?\u201d I ask while he follows me into the family room. Calling her Nastya sounds wrong, but I don\u2019t feel right saying Sunshine out loud anymore.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Weren\u2019t you supposed to be home an hour ago?\u201d I still don\u2019t get why he\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cSarah\u2019s covering for me.\u201d Drew looks away like he doesn\u2019t want to tell me something and it pisses me off because I\u2019m sure it has something to do with Nastya getting shit-faced again at one of the parties he\u2019s always making her go to and I\u2019m getting sick of it. When he turns back to me, though, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m mistaken.</p><p>Everything I see in his face is wrong. The look he has now is so empty of everything I associate with Drew that it wakes me up all at once.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d He doesn\u2019t answer and I have to ask him again. \u201cWhat happened, Drew?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d His eyes are red and he looks like shit.</p><p>\u201cIn a second, I\u2019m getting in the car and driving over there if you don\u2019t start giving me some answers that make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it makes sense, Josh.\u201d He shifts from defeated to pissed and when he glares at me, I think he\u2019s talking about more than Sunshine.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like her with the cryptic bullshit. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she was. Her face is messed up, but she seems all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her face?\u201d My words are slow and my voice comes out lower than I expect it to.</p><p>\u201cKevin Leonard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKevin Leonard?\u201d I feel like smashing Drew\u2019s face into the wall, at least until I can get to Kevin Leonard, and I don\u2019t even know what happened yet. \u201cWhat did he do to her?\u201d The words are forced. I\u2019m struggling to control my anger long enough to find out what this is about, but I don\u2019t know how long I can do it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Hit her. I think he was taking her clothes off. She really didn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d Drew runs his hand through his hair again and I notice that his knuckles are bleeding and there\u2019s blood on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHow did she end up with him in the first place? Weren\u2019t you with her the whole time? Isn\u2019t that why you talked her into going with you?\u201d</p><p>Drew studies the torn knuckles on his right hand but doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell were you? You drag her to these parties, you get her drunk and then you leave her alone?\u201d I make sure the accusation is clear.</p><p>His head whips up and everything about him goes on the defensive.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not helpless, Josh. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, she kind of does whatever she wants. I didn\u2019t drag her anywhere and I haven\u2019t gotten her drunk since the first night. She gets drunk all on her own now.\u201d He\u2019s trying to justify it to himself but I can tell it isn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cShe hates being alone at those things. She wouldn\u2019t have walked away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d Guilt. He did ditch her. \u201cShe texted me, but I didn\u2019t hear it. She went upstairs where it was quiet so she could call you to get a ride. When I got up there, she was on the floor and he was on top of her.\u201d He tells me her face was bruised and bleeding, and when he gets to the part about her underwear around her ankles, he can\u2019t keep talking because he\u2019s trying not to cry, and if I weren\u2019t so disgusted with everyone in the world, I might actually be crying, too.</p><p>\u201cYou left her alone.\u201d I want to kill him. I want to blame him so I don\u2019t have to blame myself. I can\u2019t even think about the phone call.</p><p>\u201cYes, Josh! That\u2019s exactly what I did! I guilt-tripped her into coming with me and then I left her alone because I\u2019m selfish and that\u2019s what I do. You don\u2019t think I know? Trust me, I know. I don\u2019t need you to remind me that I\u2019m a prick. I\u2019ve been reminded all f**king night, by her face and the blood and\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d he runs his hand back through his hair as his voice cracks again and I really hope he doesn\u2019t lose his shit because I can\u2019t see that. Not on top of everything else. Because, right now, I\u2019m seeing her face and the blood, too, and I don\u2019t want to lose mine, either. \u201cJust trust me,\u201d he says, \u201cI know. Okay? I know.\u201d</p><p>His back is leaning against my kitchen counter and I\u2019m leaning against the wall across from him. Neither of us says anything for what seems like an hour even though it\u2019s probably less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He shakes his head wearily. \u201cThe f**ked up part is that she didn\u2019t even seem surprised. It was like she just expected it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring her here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He levels his eyes at me and pauses to let this sink in, because in the shock of absorbing what happened to Sunshine, I\u2019ve all but forgotten what I was doing while she was alone in a bedroom with Kevin Leonard. \u201cThink real hard, Josh. We drove straight to your house about two hours ago. The garage was closed and the lights were off so I thought you were asleep and I used my key. We walked into the house and guess what we heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came in with you.\u201d It\u2019s not a question. It\u2019s a hand grenade.</p><p>\u201cI thought seeing you was the only thing that would help her.\u201d The bitter-laced sarcasm is dripping from his voice and I\u2019m not sure which one of us he despises more at this moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d I ask, but it\u2019s quiet because I really don\u2019t want to know. All I\u2019ve thought about since the day she walked out of here was the day she would walk back in. And tonight she did.</p><p>\u201cNothing. She hasn\u2019t said a word to me since we walked into your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see her.\u201d I don\u2019t want to see her. I don\u2019t want to face that she knows what I did. I don\u2019t want to face that I know what I did. But I need to see her. I need to see that she\u2019s still here and still ok, even if she hates me. Her hurt might kill me but I can survive her hate.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s absolute.</p><p>\u201cWho the f**k are you to say I can\u2019t see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the f**k are you to say you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that she looked like hell when we walked into your house and she looked worse when we walked out.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick. Not figuratively sick. Sick like I might throw up right now. My face must tell him something, because his tone loses a little of its edge. Or maybe he\u2019s just tired of this whole shit night. \u201cJosh, even if I did think it was okay, which I don\u2019t, because right now I think you\u2019re acting like me and I don\u2019t like you very much. But even if I did say you could see her, it\u2019s not up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t see you,\u201d he confirms. He won\u2019t offer me hope, and for the first time tonight, I feel grateful. \u201cAre you ever going to tell me what happened between you two?\u201d He hasn\u2019t stopped asking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Are you going to tell me what you were doing f**king Leigh?\u201d His tone is as cold as his expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been f**king Leigh for years.\u201d It\u2019s true. It\u2019s like second nature. Technically, nothing I did tonight was wrong. I didn\u2019t take advantage of anyone. I didn\u2019t cheat. I didn\u2019t leave Nastya alone with a drunk ass**le. I can make all of the arguments that I want, to Drew, to Sunshine, to myself, but knowing how \u201cnot wrong\u201d I was doesn\u2019t make me feel like any less of a prick.</p><p>I can even tell you why I did it. For the same reason I did it the first time and every time after. It was comforting and it made me feel normal. Leigh showed up, walked in and said hi, and like always, it was the easiest, most natural thing in the world. She sat on the couch and we watched television until she leaned over and kissed me and I let her because there wasn\u2019t a price to be paid or a choice to be made anymore. Sunshine had made that choice for me.</p> <p>Leigh picked up my hand and led me back to my room and I went. For one night, I just wanted to pretend that there wasn\u2019t anyone to miss.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love her.\u201d It\u2019s an accusation, and if there was any humor at all in this situation, I would laugh, because I have no idea how Drew Leighton says this with a straight face. I want to hit him for it, and for so many other things, but there\u2019s a part of me that knows that I just don\u2019t need one more thing to be pissed at myself about tonight. Maybe I should hit him just to get him to hit me back, because that\u2019s what I deserve. I want him to hit me. I want him to beat my face in so I don\u2019t have to feel anything but that pain. The other is so much worse.</p><p>I walk to the opposite side of the room to put some distance between us, but he follows, sinking down onto the couch and sighing like this has been the longest night of his life. And I know that it probably has been, but I don\u2019t have any sympathy to offer him.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really news, Drew. Why don\u2019t you just say whatever bullshit you want to say to me and then get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we just established that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Leigh. Nastya. You love Nastya.\u201d I hate that word and it sounds all wrong coming from Drew\u2019s mouth. Drew, who makes a career of mocking it, of destroying girls for hoping for it. Drew, who has no right to judge me, but is sitting on my couch, with his feet on my coffee table, doing just that. Yet I don\u2019t deny what he says. I should deny it; deny it all night until I\u2019ve convinced even myself that it could not possibly be true. That I couldn\u2019t really be so self-destructive as to fall in love with any girl, much less a girl who is cracked in a thousand places and who will leave me as soon as she\u2019s put back together again. But I guess the ability to think rationally has left me because I don\u2019t deny it at all. It\u2019s late. I\u2019m tired and scared and hurt and so incredibly sorry and I just can\u2019t think straight anymore tonight.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d I say finally, looking at Drew as if this might be an excuse for my behavior. As if it could make any of this less horrible. The words taste like the regret that is filling me up and spilling out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cJosh,\u201d he says, and when he does, all of the irreverence and sarcasm, all of the judgment and condescension are gone from his voice and I hate him already for what he is going to say next.</p><p>\u201cEverybody knows that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 50</p> <p>Nastya</p><p>It\u2019s a little after two o\u2019clock in the morning. It\u2019s late, but it feels later; like this whole night has been so epic that nothing in the world is recognizable anymore. Drew left fifteen minutes ago, saying he\u2019d be back in a half-hour. He didn\u2019t mention where he was going, but he didn\u2019t need to. We both knew where he would end up.</p><p>I showered, and I\u2019m trying to keep ice on my face, but really, I just want to go to bed, even if I won\u2019t sleep. I wonder if there are words I can write that will erase the images burned into my brain tonight; that will keep them from coming to find me. Not the ones with Kevin Leonard. The ones with Josh and that girl. The pictures I didn\u2019t even see. Pictures that are working like acid now, burning their way through every good memory and leaving only one behind. I already threw up once tonight at the thought of it, but as soon as the image invades my mind, my stomach convulses again and I\u2019m back in the bathroom, hung over the toilet and retching. But nothing comes up. There isn\u2019t anything left in me.</p><p>I flip the TV on downstairs and there\u2019s a knock on the door so soft that I almost miss it. I gave Drew my key to let himself back in, so I know it isn\u2019t him, but I have no idea who else would be here. I tip-toe to the door and look through the peephole to find Tierney Lowell on my front porch.</p><p>I have to take a minute to decide whether to open the door. Finally, I turn the deadbolt and face her. She\u2019s still dressed from the party and she looks like she\u2019s been crying. I wonder if anyone came out of this night unscathed.</p><p>\u201cMan, your face,\u201d she says almost immediately. \u201cSorry.\u201d She winces and her discomfort at standing here with me is undeniable. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wake anyone up.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I push the door back and motion for her to come in. We stare at each other for a minute. I know why she\u2019s here, but I\u2019m waiting for her to ask. I wonder how she knew where I lived. Maybe Clay. She\u2019s been talking to him since they bonded over the art and science of bong construction. Her eyes move around the room, but she won\u2019t find what she\u2019s looking for.</p><p>\u201cIs Drew here?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d There\u2019s no attempt to hide her disappointment. She takes a breath and her voice is sincere. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to start making people put a quarter in a jar every time they ask me that. I don\u2019t even know what okay means.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to see if he was alright,\u201d she explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever hit anybody before.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think so, either.</p><p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d There\u2019s no concealing the concern in her voice or the fact that she knows Drew well enough to realize that this is a valid question.</p><p>I don\u2019t nod or shake my head or even shrug. She has to ask him for that answer. I don\u2019t have it.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you,\u201d she says, reconciled.</p><p>I do nod for this, because I believe he does, but not the way she thinks. I need to write a note to explain it to her because she deserves to know, but before the conversation can go any further, there\u2019s a key in the lock and Drew walks in. He stops dead when he sees Tierney and if I could take a picture of the expression that passes between them, I would, and then I\u2019d shove it in both of their faces so they could never deny it again.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d She looks from Drew to me with misguided resignation before turning to leave.</p><p>I walk over to Drew and squeeze his hand, tilting my head toward the door, and he follows her out onto the porch.</p><p>Josh</p><p>Less than an hour after Drew leaves, I\u2019m in her driveway. It\u2019s three-thirty in the morning. Margot gets home at six and I wonder how Sunshine is going to explain her face. I grab my phone out of the cup holder and shove it in my pocket. I still haven\u2019t looked at it. I don\u2019t want to see her name on the display and all of the what-ifs lit up behind it. I can\u2019t face the reminder that if I had heard the phone, if I had picked it up, none of this would be happening.</p><p>I pass Tierney Lowell\u2019s car leaving as I pull in. Drew is standing on the porch. I walk straight past him and open the door so he won\u2019t have a chance to remind me that I\u2019m not allowed to be here.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have time to prepare, because as soon as I walk in, she\u2019s there, standing in the kitchen. I\u2019ve tried not to look at her for weeks. Seeing her, now, eviscerates me, rips me to pieces and sews me back together all wrong. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the cut by her eye or the bruise on her cheek or the expression on her face that does it, but I know that it\u2019s done because everything inside me hurts.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Drew says from behind me, but I don\u2019t turn away because I can\u2019t stop looking at her.</p><p>\u201cJust give us a minute.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking or telling.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, Josh,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not forceful, just defeated.</p><p>He\u2019s right. I should leave. She shouldn\u2019t have to deal with me on top of everything else. But I\u2019m selfish. I want her to tell me she\u2019s okay, even if I know that she\u2019s not. I\u2019ll take lies right now if she\u2019ll give them to me.</p><p>\u201cI just need one minute.\u201d I\u2019m talking to Drew, but I\u2019m looking at her. My voice is soft, but my tone isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not going anywhere.</p><p>She nods to Drew, but he doesn\u2019t look convinced. He figures, if he didn\u2019t keep Kevin Leonard away from her tonight, at least he can save her from having to deal with me.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Drew,\u201d she says gently. \u201cIf your mom wakes up she\u2019s going to be pissed. I\u2019m good. I promise.\u201d It\u2019s such a lie, but it\u2019s so natural; it\u2019s like she\u2019s been telling it for years.</p><p>Drew still doesn\u2019t look happy, but he concedes. He walks over and hugs her just long enough to whisper I\u2019m sorry in her ear and then he leaves.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d It\u2019s a stupid question, asking a girl whose face is half swollen if it hurts, but it\u2019s the first thing I can think to ask. She lifts the ice back up to her cheek and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>We both stand there, looking at each other across the kitchen, with all the things we\u2019ve done to hurt each other littering the path between us.</p><p>She puts the ice down and pulls a foil-covered plate off of the top of the refrigerator. She removes the foil and puts the plate of sugar cookies on the table and tells me to sit.</p><p>\u201cI know you said you were sick of them, but...\u201d</p><p>I did tell her I was sick of them. It was over a month ago. She made like twelve batches in a week\u2019s time because she said she couldn\u2019t get the right balance between chewy and crunchy and I said she was crazy because they all seemed exactly the same to me. I finally told her that until she made me something with chocolate in it, I would not be tasting another sugar cookie.</p><p>\u201cDid you finally get it right?\u201d I have no clue what the point of this conversation is, but she\u2019s my tangent girl and I\u2019ll follow her if this is where she wants to go.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She shrugs like it\u2019s really no big deal, even though we both know it was driving her crazy. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She pushes the plate toward me. Her face is beat up. I just had sex with Leigh. We\u2019re sitting at her table, in the middle of the night, and she\u2019s making me critique her cookies.</p><p>\u201cThey taste,\u201d I say, trying not to talk with my mouth full, \u201cexactly like the last eight hundred you made me try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they taste the same,\u201d she says, undeterred, \u201cbut are they too crunchy?\u201d</p><p>I exhale slowly, putting the cookie down on the table.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to talk about cookies.\u201d I nod robotically, picking up a napkin and twisting it around in my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The words should have come from my mouth, but they didn\u2019t. They came from hers. I know she knows what I did tonight. All I can think is Don\u2019t apologize to me. Please don\u2019t apologize to me. Yesterday it would have been a blessing. Today it\u2019s a curse.</p><p>I want to tell her I\u2019m sorry, too, but they\u2019re shit words and I\u2019m a shit person.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I hurt you,\u201d she repeats as if I need to hear it again and this time she throws the so in for good measure. Just to twist the knife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be apologizing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even believe that just came out of her mouth. It\u2019s worse than the apology.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? Everything that happened tonight was wrong. Everything! Every single thing!\u201d I don\u2019t plan to raise my voice, but it happens, and maybe that\u2019s a good thing, because it sets her off, too.</p><p>\u201cI know, Josh! What do you want me to say? That my heart broke a thousand times when I walked into your house tonight? That I came home and threw up, not because of what happened at that stupid party, but because I can\u2019t stop thinking about what you were doing with that girl? Is that what you want to hear? Because it\u2019s true!\u201d</p> <p>I know it\u2019s true. I know because the pain is all over her face and in her eyes and in her voice. I know because now it\u2019s making me as sick as she is and I can\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s done like everything else.</p><p>She gets up from the table and crosses the room and I feel every inch of the space between us. \u201cAnd you know what the worst part is?\u201d she continues. \u201cThe worst part is that I\u2019m not even allowed to be angry about it, because it\u2019s my fault. Is that what you need me to say? That I know it\u2019s all my fault? That none of this would have happened in the first place if I wasn\u2019t determined to destroy myself and everyone around me? Fine. It\u2019s all my fault! Everything is my fault and no one knows it more than me. We\u2019re all in hell and I\u2019m the one who put us here. I know and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a minute because it\u2019s the first real feeling I\u2019ve seen in her in forever. She\u2019s been an emotional black hole for weeks, but all of a sudden, the dead, flat calm is gone and she\u2019s as angry and frustrated and heartbroken as I am.</p><p>I stand up and take a step towards her. She looks at me like she doesn\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing. There\u2019s a mixture of fear and confusion on her face and her eyes dart past me like those of a cornered animal looking for an opening to run. For just one second, she stops hiding the vulnerability that I always try to pretend doesn\u2019t exist. I should walk away and leave it alone, but I don\u2019t want to be in a room with her and not get to touch her one more time before everything goes back to shit again tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to walk over to you,\u201d I say, taking one step at a time in her direction like I\u2019m talking down a jumper. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my arms around you and I\u2019m going to hold you,\u201d I pause before taking the last step, \u201cand you\u2019re going to let me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asks, like it\u2019s the most insane thing she\u2019s ever heard and maybe, after tonight, it is.</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in front of her now and she doesn\u2019t back away, so I do what I said I would and put my arms around her. I feel her body soften, just slightly, against mine, but she doesn\u2019t move her arms or reciprocate. She doesn\u2019t forgive me and that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t know if I forgive her, either.</p><p>When she does move, it\u2019s to bring her hand up to my chest and gently push me away. I lift my hand to her face, wishing I could erase the bruises and the hurt; but I stop just short of letting my fingers graze her skin and drop my hand back to my side. I wish she\u2019d just let it go here, let me walk away without another word, but it never happens that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take it back if I could. I never should have hurt you.\u201d She keeps going back to that, and it\u2019s useless, because we can\u2019t undo anything at this point.</p><p>\u201cI never should have let you,\u201d I say. It\u2019s true and I knew it from the beginning. I shouldn\u2019t have let her hurt me. I should never have cared enough to make that possible. I even did what she wanted. I never told her that I loved her; but it didn\u2019t change anything. I loved her every day and I\u2019m the one who suffered for it.</p> <p>\u201cI had to leave.\u201d There\u2019s pleading in her voice, begging me to understand something I don\u2019t. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the truth and I know you want it. I would end up disappointing you, being the thing that\u2019s never enough, just like with everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving is the only thing you could have done to disappoint me.\u201d I would have lived every day without the truth, to keep her, even if it was wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d she says, and the regret of so much more than the past few weeks is etched on her face. She\u2019s accepting it. We can both be as sorry as we want, but too much has happened that we can\u2019t take back. Some things you just have to learn to live with. We both learned that lesson a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to beat the shit out of Kevin Leonard,\u201d I say finally, because I can do that one thing, even if it isn\u2019t nearly enough.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d There\u2019s determination in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good enough reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the only good reason.\u201d I may not be allowed to love her, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll let anyone hurt her. Maybe that\u2019s ironic since I\u2019m the one who hurt her the most tonight.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the reason for that. It\u2019s over and I want to forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you taking this so lightly? He could have raped you and you act like nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing did happen. Believe me, I\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d She shrugs and it\u2019s maddening.</p><p>\u201cWorse than being raped?\u201d I look at her incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWorse than almost being raped.\u201d</p><p>I drag my hand down my face in frustration.</p><p>\u201cEnough with the cryptic, Sunshine! I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m sick of this!\u201d I\u2019m losing it all over again. I\u2019ve done more yelling since I\u2019ve known this girl than I have in the past ten years and I can\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cYou say things like that all the time that make absolutely no sense! Like you want me to know something, but you won\u2019t tell me, so I\u2019m just supposed to pick up random clues and figure it out. Guess what? I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t figure it out. I can\u2019t figure you out and I\u2019m getting sick of trying.\u201d</p><p>I guess we didn\u2019t have to wait until tomorrow for everything to go to shit again. It\u2019s happening right now.</p><p>My hands are in my hair and I can\u2019t stop walking around the room because I have so much pent-up aggression and I don\u2019t know where to put it. Now I understand the running. I think I could run out of this room right now and not stop for miles. I take a breath and start again because I can\u2019t seem to stop talking, either.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that something happened, or more likely, someone happened who f**ked up your hand and did a job on the rest of you in the process, and I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one asked you to.\u201d The words are fierce and bitter. Her eyes turn almost feral. \u201cEveryone wants to fix me. My parents want to fix me. My brother wants to fix me. My therapists want to fix me. You\u2019re supposed to be the person who doesn\u2019t want to fix me.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both exasperated now. We\u2019re both angry, and for some reason, it\u2019s a relief. It makes me feel like, maybe, I\u2019m not the only one in the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fix you. I want to fix this.\u201d I throw my arms out but I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m referring to. Her? Me? The whole f**ked-up world?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>What is the difference? I don\u2019t know. Maybe there isn\u2019t one. Maybe I do want to fix her. If I do, is that wrong? Does that make me the ass**le in this scenario?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer, because it\u2019s the only thing I do know. I sit back down at the table and drop my head into my hands.</p><p>The emotions in this room are bouncing all over the place and I can\u2019t keep up. It\u2019s after four o\u2019clock in the morning and I feel like my entire body has been wrung out and I\u2019m just done.</p><p>\u201cI thought there was something wrong with you, too.\u201d Her voice is calmer and she sounds apologetic, like she thinks she\u2019s insulting me. But she isn\u2019t. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t care that I was wrong, because you just understood what it was like. I figured if I didn\u2019t ask you, you wouldn\u2019t ask me, and we could just pretend not to care what happened before. I guess it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d She half shrugs like she\u2019s known this all along, but she\u2019s finally coming to terms with it. \u201cI just wanted one person who would look at me and not want to see someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho looks at you like that?\u201d I lift my head up and lower my hands so I can see her face, and I can\u2019t imagine anyone looking at this girl and wanting to see anything but her.</p><p>\u201cEveryone who loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it they want to see?</p><p>\u201cA dead girl.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 51</p><p>Nastya</p><p>On Tuesday during fifth hour, Ms. McAllister continues the poetry unit. We covered the same lesson earlier in my class and now I just get to listen in and try not to stare too much at the beautiful, priceless boy in the back row whose heart I stomped all over. I don\u2019t even know how long we ended up talking on Saturday morning. I know that we didn\u2019t resolve anything. There wasn\u2019t anything left to resolve. We had already put everything through the shredder and it was just gone.</p><p>I walk through the aisles, passing out a list of discussion questions on the poem Renascence by Edna St. Vincent Millay. I pass Ethan Hall\u2019s desk and he checks out my face again. I\u2019ve been able to do a good job covering it, but you can still make out the bruise.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re beating your girlfriends now?\u201d he directs at Drew. A hint of smug satisfaction crosses his face like he\u2019s telling me I got what I deserved for rejecting him. Maybe I did get what I deserved, but it wasn\u2019t for anything I did to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s your thing,\u201d Drew replies, unfazed.</p><p>\u201cShe did it in kickboxing.\u201d</p><p>I turn to catch Tierney Lowell glaring at Ethan. She\u2019s the only other person aside from Drew, Josh and I who knows what happened with Kevin. I\u2019m not surprised to hear her chime in. It\u2019s Drew she\u2019s defending, even if she won\u2019t admit it. I nod almost imperceptibly in thanks to her, because if he won\u2019t acknowledge it, I will.</p><p>When I pass Kevin Leonard\u2019s desk, he reaches out to grab my hand and say something. He looks embarrassed, but before he can touch me or open his mouth, Josh kicks the back of his chair. Hard. Kevin drops his hand and looks down at the paper in front of him, muttering sorry under his breath, which I get the feeling is directed at Josh, not me.</p><p>Josh slides the handout across his desk when I place it there, but he makes no move to acknowledge me at all. I don\u2019t even exist. I\u2019d trade my hand all over again to take back everything I did and hear him call me Sunshine.</p><p>\u201cWho can explain what the poem is about?\u201d Ms. McAllister asks to get started. She places the leftover handouts on top of a beautiful handmade oak podium that magically appeared in her room a week ago. It\u2019s a mystery where it came from.</p><p>\u201cTrees,\u201d someone calls out.</p><p>\u201cThere are trees in the poem. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t poems supposed to be short?\u201d Trevor Mason asks. \u201cBecause this one was like a hundred pages long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHyperbole, Mr. Mason,\u201d Ms. McAllister replies.</p><p>\u201cHyperbo-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExaggeration, you tool,\u201d Tierney shoots at him and then rolls her eyes, looking up to the ceiling before exhaling in defeat. \u201cI\u2019ll just take the detention.\u201d</p><p>Ms. McAllister walks to her desk and fills out a detention slip.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the tool now?\u201d Drew says, smirking at Tierney. He lifts his head to catch the glare of Ms. McAllister who\u2019s still at her desk, pad of detention slips in hand. Then he glances back to Tierney. \u201cYeah, I know.

He hasn\u2019t raised his eyes from the paper on his desk and I feel him looking at me without looking when he uses his grandfather\u2019s words. \u201cThe narrator doesn\u2019t respect the beauty of life and the world around her, so it crushes her into the ground and once she\u2019s dead, she realizes everything she took for granted and didn\u2019t see right in front of her while she was alive. She\u2019s begging for another chance to live again so she can appreciate it this time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve turned away from Josh to look at Ms. McAllister. She\u2019s watching him with an expression of pride and endearment which reminds me of the way I\u2019ve seen Mrs. Leighton look at him. But I don\u2019t think Ms. McAllister\u2019s expression is as much about his answer as it is about the fact that he answered in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAnd does she get that chance?\u201d she asks Josh while I desperately focus on the poster of literary terms on the wall and wait for absolution. When it comes, I barely hear it.</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>Josh</p> <p>It\u2019s Wednesday before I see her again outside of school, and even there she hardly looks at me. Nothing has really changed except that, before last weekend, I felt more like a victim in all of this and, now, not so much.</p><p>It\u2019s already eleven. I\u2019ve been in my garage for hours, but I haven\u2019t done much of anything. I reorganized the same tool chest twice and now I\u2019m sweeping up sawdust. I don\u2019t have the energy to do anything worthwhile, but I have a list that\u2019s just getting longer and I have to get started at some point. I\u2019ve had more time over the last six weeks than I\u2019ve had in months, and I haven\u2019t accomplished crap.</p><p>I go inside, make another cup of coffee and carry it back out, resolving to start the initial cutting for the matching end table I promised I\u2019d make Mrs. Leighton. And maybe I\u2019m more tired than I thought, because when I open the door, the first thing I see is a set of pale white legs capped with black steel-toed boots swinging from the workbench.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re an addict. Caffeine\u2019s a bitch to break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I won\u2019t break it then.\u201d</p><p>She nods and I want to ask her why she\u2019s here but I\u2019m glad she is, and for a few minutes, I want to pretend that everything is back to the way it used to be. Maybe that\u2019s what she wants, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll stunt your growth, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you were worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly about some parts,\u201d she smirks.</p><p>I smile for a minute, but it\u2019s weak, and I realize that I don\u2019t want to joke with her. Especially not like that. It makes me think of everything that happened that night and everything that\u2019s gone wrong since, and as much as I want to pretend everything is the way it was before, I\u2019m just not a good enough liar.</p><p>\u201cHelps keep me awake,\u201d I answer, not taking the bait.</p><p>\u201cWhy not just sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t been sleeping well,\u201d I say honestly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because of the caffeine. Vicious cycle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drink it. Do you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d she says faintly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d This conversation is so civilized, it\u2019s twisted.</p><p>She hops off the counter and walks over to me. The bruise on her face has faded, but it\u2019s not covered with make-up now, like it is at school, and I can still see it. I have to fight the urge to run my fingers over it and then run to Kevin Leonard\u2019s house and give him four more just like it.</p><p>\u201cHere. Let me try it again.\u201d She reaches for the cup in my hand.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to try it, you should at least put some shit in it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds appetizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drink it black. You won\u2019t. Your taste buds are opposed to anything that isn\u2019t sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it, jackass.\u201d I let go of the cup and she takes a mouthful while I watch her face contort at the bitterness. \u201cStill gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get used to it,\u201d I shrug, taking the coffee back from her. She relinquishes it and shudders as if she\u2019s trying to expel the taste from her mouth. I have to try not to smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d She scrunches up her nose and goes back to sitting on the counter. Her legs start swinging again and I know how easy it would be to stay in this place and forget everything that\u2019s happened. But we\u2019ll always end up back where we were, because nothing\u2019s been resolved, and I\u2019m not the one with the answers. Maybe, for once, I need to stop letting her dictate everything just because I want to keep her. I can\u2019t forget what she did and I can\u2019t expect her to forgive what I did and I don\u2019t know where we go from here.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d I say, watching her write her name in the dust on the counter next to her. \u201cWe can\u2019t act like nothing happened... just pretend that it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t,\u201d she says, lifting her eyes to mine with something I might actually believe is hope, \u201cbut, maybe.\u201d</p><p>She ends up staying for the next two hours. She measures and marks the wood for me and I cut. We don\u2019t talk about us or Kevin Leonard or Leigh or lost hands or lost people or long agos. We talk about furniture and tools and recipes and art competitions and debate. It\u2019s familiar and comfortable. There\u2019s something still hanging over us that we can\u2019t ignore forever, even if we do ignore it tonight. But, maybe.</p><p>It\u2019s after one in the morning when I drive her home since she ran to my house. We sit in the truck, staring at her front door, because things shifted just a little bit in the other direction tonight, and neither of us is ready to let go of it yet. I reach my hand over and lay it, palm up, on the seat between us and she doesn\u2019t hesitate. She lays her left hand on mine and I close my fingers over it.</p><p>CHAPTER 52</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how long we sit in Josh\u2019s truck, holding hands, surrounded by darkness and unspoken regrets. But it\u2019s long enough to know that there are no stories or secrets in the world worth holding onto more than his hand.</p><p>CHAPTER 53</p><p>Nastya</p><p>I think a lot about all the little things that happened the day I was attacked and how any one of them might have changed everything. I wonder how many thousands of variables played a part in him finding me that day and if there are as many at work in my finding him.</p><p>Clay picks me up at eight in the morning, wearing a long-sleeved button down shirt and dress pants, and not even remotely resembling the artfully unkempt mess I\u2019m used to seeing. I doubt I look much like what he\u2019s used to seeing either. I look more like Emilia today than I have in months. I don\u2019t know if it feels right, but it doesn\u2019t feel as wrong as it used to.</p><p>I look Clay up and down and c**k my head to the side in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d he says, opening the car door for me. I\u2019m not even sure why he\u2019s bringing me. He said he wanted me to see what I sat on my ass so long for; but I\u2019ve seen it all already. I doubt it will look much different hanging on a wall.</p><p>The gallery opening is at nine and all of the finalists have to be registered and checked in for interviews by ten. The drive is just over an hour, so we\u2019re good. Clay\u2019s interview is at eleven, which gives me time to wander through the exhibits and check out his competition, though I can\u2019t even imagine how Clay Whitaker could ever have any.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Clay hooks an mp3 player up to the car stereo and hands it to me. \u201cI figured we\u2019d need music since we\u2019ve exhausted all the good conversation topics. You can DJ.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really want to DJ. I just want to lean my head against the window and close my eyes and pretend I\u2019m on my way to an Italian restaurant in Brighton. I turn it on and flip to the first playlist and click on it. As long as it\u2019s not classical music or depressing love songs, we should be good.</p><p>I didn\u2019t go back to Josh\u2019s again after Wednesday night. When I let go of his hand and left his truck, I promised myself that the next time I stepped foot in his garage I would answer any question he wanted to ask, and I want to keep that promise.</p><p>I spend most of the drive trying to line the right words up in my head, rearranging them a hundred times, then finding new ones and starting all over again. When we pull into the gallery an hour later, my cheeks are wet and I don\u2019t even remember when I started crying.</p><p>We get Clay checked in and then find the room where they\u2019re showing his work. It\u2019s one of the bigger rooms and there are three artists sharing it. Clay\u2019s pictures are hung on the largest wall. I recognize most of them. Some are from his college portfolio. Some are the ones he\u2019s done of me. But it\u2019s hard to concentrate on any of them, because on the center of the wall I\u2019m staring at, is something else entirely.</p><p>And it\u2019s overwhelming.</p><p>The centerpiece of the display is a sixteen picture mosaic. On each separate drawing is a part of my face and he\u2019s pieced them together like a puzzle. It\u2019s obvious that this is the reason I\u2019m here. He hadn\u2019t shown it to me. I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d done it. It makes me want to run from the room.</p><p>A couple of people come in and comment on the drawings and ask questions to Clay and the two girls, named Sophie and Miranda, whose work is also on display here. I mostly try to face the wall and pretend I\u2019m studying one of Sophie\u2019s paintings until Clay gets called for his interview.</p><p>Once he\u2019s gone, I venture out into the rest of the displays. I figure I can start at the rear of the gallery because most people haven\u2019t made their way there yet and it\u2019s quieter. I wander toward the back corner of the building into one of the smaller rooms.</p><p>For a moment, I don\u2019t know where I am. And for the third time in my life the world shifts under my feet and I just try to stay standing.</p><p>Because he\u2019s here.</p><p>It\u2019s his face. And it\u2019s not a nightmare. It\u2019s not a memory. He\u2019s here and real and looking at me. And I\u2019m looking back. I\u2019m standing in the middle of a moment that I\u2019ve dreaded and hoped for since the day I remembered what he did to me.</p><p>The name on the wall next to the paintings is Aidan Richter, the school is the one in the next town over from Brighton and the face in front of me belongs to the boy who killed me.</p><p>Everything in me turns on and shuts down at the same time. I am weak and strong. I am terrified and brave. I am lost and found. I am here and gone.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to stop breathing again.</p><p>He\u2019s older, like I am, but there is no mistaking it. I know his face like I know every one of the scars he gave me.</p><p>I want to run. I want to cry. I want to scream. I want to faint. I want to hurt him, break him, kill him. I want to ask him why as if there could ever possibly be a reason.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d It\u2019s a whisper and a scream.</p><p>I ask it, and not just in my head. That\u2019s the word I choose out of all of the thousands I could say to him. I ask the unanswerable question. Except that maybe it\u2019s not unanswerable. Maybe he\u2019s the only person in the world who can tell me.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know which why I\u2019m asking. Why did you do it? Why was it me? Why are you here? Why am I here? Why?</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me like he\u2019s scared and it\u2019s the only thing that could possibly make me happy at this moment. Good. Lots of people are scared of me. Girls at school. My parents. Even, sometimes, Josh Bennett. But this boy is the only one whose fear I want. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to remember.\u201d There isn\u2019t one thing about his voice that is the same. It\u2019s him, but not him. There isn\u2019t any rage or darkness gripping him. It\u2019s the same boy but not the same voice, not the same eyes, not the same madness.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to?\u201d My brain is wringing out the words, trying to find the meaning of them. But there isn\u2019t any. \u201cHow do you not mean to do what you did? You hit me in the face over and over again. You dragged me around by my hair and ripped it out of my head. You kicked me so hard and so many times that there wasn\u2019t a way to fix everything you broke. You murdered my hand. The bones were sticking out. All over the place. Do you remember it?\u201d The last question is nothing more than a pathetic, strangled whisper.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word is almost an apology.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I don\u2019t remember what my hand looked like, either. I\u2019ve only seen the pictures nobody wanted to show me. But he\u2019s the one who did it. He should have to remember.</p><p>\u201cNot all of it. Pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPieces? You did this to me and you don\u2019t even have the decency to remember?\u201d I don\u2019t know where the word even comes from. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking to the boy who beat me to death about decency. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking to him at all. I\u2019m supposed to be killing him.</p><p>\u201cMy brother killed himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I\u2019m sorry? I said I\u2019m sorry to this boy. I\u2019m walking to school and smiling and saying hi all over again. No. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not. I forgive myself because it was automatic. I didn\u2019t mean it. I gave him the words but I won\u2019t give him sympathy. He\u2019s looking at me like he can\u2019t believe I said it either. I think I\u2019m insane. I don\u2019t know if this twisted conversation is real, but it must be because I don\u2019t think I could imagine this.</p><p>\u201cI got home that day and I found him. Found his body.\u201d He\u2019s talking like he\u2019s rehearsed these words a thousand times in his head and he\u2019s just been waiting for the moment to say them.</p><p>And so he does.</p><p>He gives me the mythical why. He tells me the story. At least what he remembers of it and I think how ironic it is that I\u2019m not supposed to remember, but I do, and the boy who is supposed to have all the answers has a mind full of blanks. But he spills everything in a mad rush like he\u2019s been holding onto it for years and he wants to get it out before I stop him.</p><p>He tells me about his brother. About the girl his brother was in love with who went to the same school as me. The girl who broke up with his brother and who Aidan blamed for the suicide, even though he knows, now, that she wasn\u2019t the reason. The Russian girl. The Russian whore. The girl he went looking for that day. The girl he saw when he saw me. Just because I was there.</p><p>And then he says the words. And it isn\u2019t possible for me to hate this boy more, but I do.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>My head wants to explode. This is not the way this is supposed to happen. He\u2019s not supposed to be apologizing. He\u2019s supposed to be evil and I\u2019m supposed to hurt him.</p><p>My hands are fists without a purpose. I don\u2019t know where my breath comes from, just that it still comes. I can\u2019t hear any more of this. Because he\u2019s stealing my rage and it\u2019s the only thing I have. He can\u2019t take that, too. He can\u2019t make me not hate him. I\u2019ll have nothing left.</p><p>He starts talking about his parents putting him in therapy after the suicide and about the guilt he lives under because he never told anybody about what he did to me. How he kept waiting to get caught and waiting to get caught but no one ever came for him. And he thought that he was being given a second chance; that I didn\u2019t die and he thought I was okay and it was some sort of new beginning. It was. Just to a shittier story.</p><p>Words. So many words. I don\u2019t need to know why he turned evil, just that he was. There is absolutely no part of me that wants to listen to him talk about his guilt and his therapy and his art and his healing. He doesn\u2019t get to feel better. He doesn\u2019t get to forgive himself. I won\u2019t give him permission.</p><p>And yet I don\u2019t think he does forgive himself. There is so much remorse and pain and self-loathing in his expression that I ache for him because I know what it feels like; and I hate myself for the aching.</p><p>He stops talking. I listened to every word he said and it\u2019s my turn now. My turn to tell him everything I\u2019ve needed to tell him since the day I remembered what he did to me. My turn to make him listen. But I don\u2019t get the chance. Clay walks in before I can figure out which of the thousand words in my head I\u2019m going to say first.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Clay looks at me. \u201cDid you make it all the way through already?\u201d</p> <p>He turns to Aidan Richter who looks haunted and stares at me like I\u2019m a specter. Some spirit from the past, come to claim what\u2019s owed.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Clay says, and walks over to offer his hand. I want to grab it away and scream not to touch him. I know what those hands have done and I don\u2019t want them anywhere near Clay\u2019s. \u201cClay Whitaker. You\u2019re work?\u201d</p><p>Clay glances around at the walls which I\u2019ve only now started to notice. This boy\u2019s art is so different from Clay\u2019s. There\u2019s nothing remotely similar at all. But it\u2019s amazing and I want to slap myself for thinking so. I despise him for the ability to create it.</p><p>And then I see it. And there are no words that exist to describe the hatred I feel for him. The painting. On the far side of one wall, all the way to the end, like a period or an afterthought. But it\u2019s not a painting. It\u2019s a memory that didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>I don\u2019t know anything about art so I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s watercolor or acrylic or that it\u2019s on canvas or anything art related at all. I can tell you that it\u2019s a painting of a hand, my hand, turned up and opened to the world and that it reaches into my body and rips out everything that\u2019s left. Because in the palm, right in the center, is the pearl button I never reached.</p><p>Aidan Richter is gone and I\u2019m still waiting.</p><p>I need to find him. He got to say everything and I said nothing. I won\u2019t let him absolve his guilt at my expense. He doesn\u2019t get to use me for that, too. He doesn\u2019t get to make me question everything I\u2019ve believed for nearly three years and then walk away without listening to me.</p><p>I want my turn to scream at him. To ask him if he knows that he\u2019s a murderer. If he knows that, even though I lived, it doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t kill me. Just because they brought me back, it doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t dead. Just because they restarted it, it doesn\u2019t mean my heart didn\u2019t stop. It doesn\u2019t change anything he did. He killed the Brighton Piano Girl even if he didn\u2019t kill Emilia Ward. And I want to tell him. I want him to know what I know. I want him to hurt. I\u2019m frantic with unsaid words.</p><p>Maybe no one found him before, but I know who he is now. I know his name. I can find him like he found me.</p><p>And when I do, it won\u2019t be random.</p><p>CHAPTER 54</p><p>Josh</p><p>When I get to Sunday dinner I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll be there. With everything that happened last weekend, she skipped it and I don\u2019t blame her. I would have skipped it, too, if I wasn\u2019t desperate for even the slightest chance of seeing her.</p><p>My house is too quiet and my garage is too empty so I came over here early. Dinner isn\u2019t ready, so Drew and I end up in his room because I don\u2019t feel like standing around being polite and making small talk. But I have nothing to talk to Drew about, either, and we just end up sitting here in stupid silence.</p><p>Maybe I should have stayed home. Sunshine never came back after we talked on Wednesday. I thought it was a turning point but maybe I was just deluding myself again.</p><p>\u201cTell me what the hell happened between you two,\u201d Drew finally demands. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say nothing. And don\u2019t say you don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve gotten every evasive answer there is from both of you and I\u2019m calling bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I look up at Drew and stop him before he can interrupt. \u201cThat\u2019s the absolute truth, whether you like it or not. I have no f**king idea. Everything was fine. Everything was good. And then it wasn\u2019t. All I know is that, for like five minutes, I think I was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething had to have happened, Josh.\u201d</p><p>Something most definitely did happen. I wage an internal battle over whether to ask him the question that\u2019s in my head. I\u2019ve always wondered how much she talks to Drew, how much goes on between them that I don\u2019t know about.</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you she was a virgin?</p><p>\u201cWhat? No way.\u201d He looks at me incredulously. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I nod. He clearly didn\u2019t know any more than I did. I feel like I\u2019m betraying her by telling him. But I have to tell someone. I have to try to understand. I feel like I\u2019m drowning.</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible? She\u2019s a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened.\u201d He sobers. It\u2019s not even a question.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would that break you up?\u201d he asks, confused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get any of it. She said she was ruined and she was using me to ruin what was left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head. I have no answers. I asked her the same thing and she never gave me any.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about her has made sense since the day she got here. She just wanted to pretend it didn\u2019t matter. I did, too.\u201d It\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever said to anyone about her and when I hear it come out of my mouth I know how it sounds.</p><p>\u201cYou know she loves you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you that?\u201d I hate the hope in my voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d I don\u2019t want him taking pity on me with false hope. She either said it or she didn\u2019t. And she didn\u2019t. Then again, neither did I.</p><p>\u201cJosh\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t get a chance to finish because his mom calls us in for dinner, and I walk out before he can say anything else.</p><p>When we get to the kitchen, Mrs. Leighton hugs me and Drew walks away to pull a playlist up on the computer because it\u2019s his turn tonight. Everything is like normal.</p><p>And Sunshine isn\u2019t anywhere.</p><p>We\u2019re just about to bring the food to the table when Mr. Leighton calls out from the family room where he always watches the news before dinner. Mrs. Leighton yells back that it\u2019s time to eat and he needs to shut the TV off, but he calls her in again, and she must recognize something in his tone because she doesn\u2019t question it this time. She just goes, and we all follow.</p><p>And this is the moment before. The moment when everything is still familiar and understandable. The moment before everything shifts. I\u2019ve had a few of these moments in my life. The moment I walk from the kitchen to the family room is one of them; the moment before I see the face on the television in the Leighton living room at Sunday dinner.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know why he called us in here until I follow everyone\u2019s eyes to the television screen. And then I know everything. I can\u2019t even hear what they\u2019re saying because the picture is screaming at me so loudly that it drowns out everything else. Mr. Leighton rewinds the DVR and turns it up, but I still barely process the words.</p><p>High school student Aidan Richter was arrested this afternoon after confessing to the brutal 2009 beating and attempted murder of, then fifteen year-old, Emilia Ward, affectionately referred to by locals as the Brighton Piano Girl. The crime had gone unsolved for nearly three years until Richter, himself only sixteen at the time of the attack, arrived with his parents and attorney and surrendered himself into police custody earlier today. No other details have been released and so far no comment has been made by either family. A press conference is scheduled to take place at 9:30 tomorrow morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s uncanny,\u201d Mr. Leighton says. But it\u2019s not and he knows it. There\u2019s nothing uncanny about it. It\u2019s like tumblers in a lock falling into place. Everything clicks.</p><p>brutal... beating... attempted murder... Emilia... Piano Girl</p><p>He pauses the TV on a split-screen of a picture of the girl I have been looking at across my garage for months. Younger. No make-up. No black clothes. Smiling. Even with the dark hair and dark eyes, there is nothing dark about her. She\u2019s all light. Like sunshine.</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing that on the news when it happened. It was a terrible story. It looks just like her,\u201d Mrs. Leighton says, and I wonder if she can\u2019t make herself believe it, or if she honestly doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cIt is her.\u201d</p><p>We all turn, and standing in the entrance to the room is Sunshine\u2019s brother.</p><p>\u201cI knocked, but no one answered the door,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s not really talking to us. He\u2019s staring at the TV. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The Leightons look at him like he\u2019s a crazy person who just barged into their house. Their faces are carved in disbelief, but there\u2019s already so much shock in the room right now that it\u2019s hard to figure out the source of it.</p><p>\u201cAsher, Nastya\u2019s brother,\u201d I say, answering a question no one asked and hearing how wrong that name sounds coming out of my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cEmilia\u2019s brother,\u201d he corrects. \u201cWhere is she? I need to bring her home.\u201d I know the home he\u2019s talking about isn\u2019t Margot\u2019s. He\u2019s taking her home to Brighton. He doesn\u2019t sound angry. Just tired. Like he\u2019s been living under all of this for such a long time and he just wants it to be over.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot said she would be here. She said to try your house first,\u201d he looks at me, \u201cand if she wasn\u2019t there she\u2019d be here for dinner.\u201d There\u2019s an uneasiness in his voice that matches his expression.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come tonight,\u201d Mrs. Leighton says gently, and then turns her eyes, full of sympathy and questions, on me.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just track her phone?\u201d I ask bitterly. Mostly because I can tell he\u2019s edgy and nervous and worried and he\u2019s making me all of those things, too.</p><p>\u201cShe left her phone on her bed,\u201d he answers, like he\u2019s starting to understand that she didn\u2019t just forget it. She doesn\u2019t want to be found.</p> <p>Asher tells us what\u2019s happened since this afternoon in Brighton. As soon as her parents got the call from the police, he got in the car to pick her up so she wouldn\u2019t have to drive alone. In the meantime, they kept calling, trying to get hold of her, figuring they could get to her before it hit the news here. But no one\u2019s been able to reach her.</p><p>Within minutes we\u2019re all on our phones as if we actually believe it will do any good. There really isn\u2019t anybody to call, but it makes us feel like we\u2019re doing something, even if it is useless. If she left, and she didn\u2019t bring her phone, she did it for a reason, and that reason is that she doesn\u2019t want us knowing where she is.</p><p>The story on the news has changed, but we all keep looking at the television like there\u2019s something there. Like suddenly it\u2019s going to give us an answer. Maybe we just don\u2019t want to look at each other and see our own confusion reflected on someone else\u2019s face. I\u2019m not confused. I actually feel like I understand something for the first time in months. Maybe I understand everything.</p><p>Asher walks out of the room to make a phone call and once he does, Drew looks at me. I can tell it\u2019s been killing him to wait. \u201cDid she tell you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I should be able to say yes to that question. I should have made sure of that. I should have cared enough to make her tell me. Her secrets were an open secret between us and I allowed it. There was never a question that she wasn\u2019t telling me things. Things. How f**ked up is that? Things. All things. Everything. But I knew that once she told me, I could never unhear it, and I was happier being ignorant.</p><p>I shake my head and everyone\u2019s eyes are on me.</p><p>\u201cHow could she tell him? She doesn\u2019t talk,\u201d Sarah says.</p><p>Drew and I look at each other; and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s secret and what isn\u2019t anymore.</p> <p>My phone rings and I grab it without looking at the caller ID, hoping it\u2019s her.</p><p>\u201cDid you know this?\u201d Clay asks, without even saying hello.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t have the energy to snap at him. Everyone assumes I should have known about this. I should have. But I didn\u2019t know anything.</p><p>\u201cIt is her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asks, waiting for confirmation he doesn\u2019t need.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her with him yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAidan Richter. On the news. The kid who confessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her with him?\u201d How is that possible?</p><p>\u201cAt the art competition. He was one of the finalists. When I got out of my interview, she was in the room with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Standing there staring at each other. It was weird, but I just thought maybe he tried to talk to her and she didn\u2019t answer and it freaked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d The concern in his voice is genuine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. No one knows where she is.\u201d I don\u2019t even know how I get the words out without my voice breaking.</p><p>Asher walks back in while I\u2019m still on the phone. \u201cMy parents called the credit card company.\u201d</p><p>I tell Clay to get over here and I hang up so I can hear what Asher is saying.</p><p>He tells us she used the card at a gas station on the northbound side of the turnpike just outside of Brighton earlier today. He\u2019s going over to pick up some things from Margot\u2019s and then he\u2019s heading back there. It\u2019s beyond me what\u2019s so important that he has to pick it up before he goes looking for his sister but I\u2019m not in a position to put down people who love her. I said I loved her and look what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to interrupt him, because I\u2019m trying to formulate my own thoughts before I dropkick her brother with them.</p><p>\u201cShe was with him yesterday.\u201d My stomach twists when I say it. I\u2019m afraid there are answers there I don\u2019t want to think about yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I don\u2019t know who says it. Maybe everybody.</p><p>\u201cAidan Richter. The kid who confessed. Clay said he saw them together at the art gallery. He was there.\u201d I force it out in one pained breath.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Clay?\u201d That wouldn\u2019t have been my first question if I was Asher, but I answer it, just now realizing how little her family really knows about her life here.</p><p>\u201cHe draws pictures of her. She went with him to a state competition yesterday. He said he found them in a room together, and when he saw the news today, he remembered him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know anything else?\u201d Asher asks, anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told him to get over here.\u201d</p><p>Clay pulls up and he\u2019s barely in the door before we bombard him with questions. He tells us what he knows, which isn\u2019t much. He was meeting with the judges while she looked around at the exhibits. When he found her after his interview, she was in a room with the Richter kid and they were staring at each other. He didn\u2019t hear anything so he has no idea if they were speaking or not. Then Richter got called in for his interview and they didn\u2019t see him again. Clay drove her home at the end of the day and that was it.</p><p>\u201cShe was fine on the way home. She seemed fine. Not like she talks. She was upset in the morning on the way there, but in the afternoon, nothing unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was she upset? I ask, because it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She looked out the window the whole time and when we got there she was crying. She\u2019s been a mess ever since whatever happened between you two.\u201d He looks at me but it\u2019s almost apologetic, like he didn\u2019t want to call either of us out, but he had to. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said anything if this didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was crying?\u201d Asher looks like he doesn\u2019t understand. I guess she doesn\u2019t cry in front of him, either.</p><p>\u201cNot like sobbing,\u201d Clay clarifies. \u201cJust tears. I didn\u2019t even know until I looked at her. I wasn\u2019t going to call her on it. Who knows what goes on in her head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d Asher says, and if it\u2019s possible, he looks more devastated than before.</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew your sister.\u201d I say, throwing his words back at him because now I\u2019m getting scared and it\u2019s making me a dick.</p><p>\u201cNobody knows my sister,\u201d he says. And there isn\u2019t any argument for that.</p><p>We work out what we do and don\u2019t know at this point. We know a lot of things, just not the one thing we want to know. Where she is.</p><p>Basically what it comes down to is that no one has seen her since nine o\u2019clock this morning and there\u2019s been no trace of her since she used her credit card at a gas station just after eleven right outside Brighton. There\u2019s nothing after that. But she\u2019s eighteen and she hasn\u2019t even been missing for twelve hours so no one\u2019s going to look for her except us.</p><p>Asher has his parents on the phone the second we\u2019ve sorted out Clay\u2019s story. While Asher talks to his mother, his father is calling the police station to let them know what happened between Sunshine and Aidan Richter yesterday. We\u2019re all wondering the same thing. The thing that no one is saying. If she went to Brighton, she went looking for him before he ever confessed. And if she was in Brighton at eleven o\u2019clock and he turned himself in at three-thirty\u200c\u2014\u200cwhat happened in between?</p><p>Asher leaves, planning to stop at Margot\u2019s to pick up whatever it was he promised to bring his parents from his sister\u2019s room. Then he\u2019s heading straight back to Brighton. Margot\u2019s staying at her place on the off chance that Sunshine heads back this way.</p><p>Everyone knows I\u2019m going, and Drew says he is, too. Asher gives us the address and the phone number to his parents\u2019 house and tells us he\u2019ll let them know we\u2019re coming. We decide to take our own cars in case we need to separate when we get there.</p><p>A few minutes later, I climb into my truck alone and head to Brighton. I spend the entire drive bargaining with everything I will ever have. I don\u2019t know how many times I say please. Please give her back to me. Please not again. Just please. My phone doesn\u2019t ring. It\u2019s the longest two hours of my life.</p><p>The room is full of controlled chaos. It reminds me of the day my mother and sister died. Phones ringing off the hook. Frantic calm. Poorly concealed fear. They\u2019re like zombie people. Empty. Haunted and endlessly waiting for something. I know what it looks like. These people were probably normal once. I think about how easily this could be the Leightons if it had been Sarah. How every normal family is one tragedy away from complete implosion.</p><p>There are photographs all over the room of a girl I should know, but don\u2019t. A girl in pastel dresses, with ribbons in her hair, smiling and playing the piano in more pictures than I can count. I feel like I\u2019m mourning all over again, but this time it\u2019s for a girl I\u2019ve never met.</p><p>Her parents are both on cell phones. The land line keeps ringing, but nobody answers it because the reporters keep calling. Finally, her father rips the cord out of the wall and then it\u2019s quiet. But not really.</p><p>Drew and I sit on the far side of the room. Separated physically and emotionally from the rest of the family. The rest of the family. Whether or not they acknowledge me, I am in that category, also. She made sure of it, no matter how much I\u2019d like to say otherwise. She\u2019s gone now, too. It fits.</p><p>Asher walks in not long after we arrive. He\u2019s carrying a stack of black and white composition books; the kind Ms. McAllister makes us use for creative writing. He puts them on the coffee table in the middle of the room. It\u2019s a hideous coffee table. I could make a better one. I think about offering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can only see the front of the book on the top of the pile. Chemistry is written in red marker on the cover. It\u2019s Sunshine\u2019s handwriting and seeing it breaks me a little.</p><p>Her mother steps toward the stack of books like it\u2019s a bomb. \u201cIs this them?\u201d</p><p>Asher nods. He\u2019s pale and looks older than he did the first time I met him. Everyone here looks older than they should. Like they\u2019ve seen too many horrible things and now they\u2019re just tired. I wonder if I look like that, too.</p><p>Nastya/Emilia/Sunshine. I don\u2019t know what to call her. Her mother picks up the book on top and opens it, flipping through the first few pages. \u201cIt\u2019s just chemistry notes,\u201d she says, relieved, but confused.</p> <p>\u201cKeep going, Mom.\u201d Asher sounds like he\u2019s delivering a death blow.</p><p>A moment later her face contorts in the most wretched expression and her hand goes to her mouth and I look away because just seeing it feels like an invasion. She looks exactly like Sunshine. Drew doesn\u2019t look away. He just stares at her. He looks older, too. I think it might have happened, just now, when he saw the look on this woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt took her all of these to write this?\u201d she asks to no one in particular. Her husband, Sunshine\u2019s father, the man who\u2019s been standing behind her the whole time takes the book out of her hands and she shakes her head at him. Not like she doesn\u2019t understand something, but like she\u2019s telling him no. She doesn\u2019t want him to look. It\u2019s like someone telling you not to look at a dead body, because if you look at it, you won\u2019t ever be able to not see it again. It will always be in your head and you won\u2019t ever close your eyes without the image being there. That\u2019s how she looks when she shakes her head at him. Like she\u2019s seen the body and she doesn\u2019t want him seeing it, too.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Asher says. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same thing. In all of them. It just repeats like it\u2019s on a loop. Over and over and over again.\u201d His voice breaks on the third over and he starts to cry but no one consoles him. They don\u2019t have any comfort to offer.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and a girl walks in. She doesn\u2019t say anything. She just walks straight over to Asher who doesn\u2019t move until she reaches him. Then he wraps his arms around her and folds her up until she\u2019s almost gone and I miss Sunshine.</p> <p>The mood in this room is so familiar. No one feels anything but everyone keeps moving because there are so many things to do. But right now no one seems to know what they are.</p><p>The police said Aidan Richter is admitting to seeing her yesterday, but continues to deny having any contact with her today. No one knows whether or not it\u2019s true. There\u2019s nothing to go on. No place to even begin.</p><p>Finally they decide that Asher and Addison and Mr. Ward will take separate cars and go looking for her, even though they have no idea where to start. Asher was right. Nobody knows his sister, at least not the sister he has now.</p><p>Her mother is staying here to man the phone. They don\u2019t know what to tell Drew and me to do. We don\u2019t really know the area and we have no idea where she would go. We\u2019re just useless and waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou can wait in Emilia\u2019s room if you want,\u201d her mother offers. Everyone in this house calls her Emilia and it sounds more right than Nastya ever did.</p><p>Her room is insane and I feel like I\u2019ve walked into her mind. There are no walls. You can\u2019t see them. Every inch of space is covered with newspaper clippings, computer printouts, and handwritten notes on scraps of paper. They almost seem to move, to shimmer; swimming in and out of my vision like an optical illusion. Like her. I want to close my eyes but I can\u2019t. I just turn in a circle waiting for it to stop, but it goes on forever. I think I might run from the room but now this is in my head, too. Like whatever dead body is hiding downstairs in those books.</p> <p>We step in and get closer because you can\u2019t read any of it unless you\u2019re almost on top of them. Names. They\u2019re all names and origins and meanings. Some of them are from the newspaper, like the ones I\u2019ve seen her cutting out at my house. Some were obviously printed off of the internet. Others she\u2019s written herself.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we stare at the walls before Drew speaks. \u201cWhere\u2019s Nastya?\u201d</p><p>I look at him. I don\u2019t know. How would I know? But he\u2019s looking at the walls, not me. He\u2019s searching for her name. I start looking, too, but it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>\u201cYour name means salvation,\u201d he says at one point, looking at a handwritten scrap of paper taped up next to the window.</p><p>Salvation. Such a load of shit.</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you that?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I never asked. I never asked a lot of things. \u201cThis is pointless. We could look it up faster,\u201d I say, needing to look away.</p><p>Drew pulls out his phone and finds a baby name site on the internet. He types Nastya in, and a second later, we have our answer.</p> <p>\u201cRebirth,\u201d he says. \u201cResurrection. Russian origin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why she picked it. The resurrection part. I guess the Russian, too.\u201d Her mother is standing in the doorway. She\u2019s pulled her hair back and it makes the dark circles under her eyes more noticeable.</p><p>\u201cWhy resurrection?\u201d Drew asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause she died,\u201d her mother says, looking so much like Sunshine that it unnerves me. \u201cAnd she came back.\u201d</p><p>Her mother tells us what happened that day. I don\u2019t know if we want to hear it, but she needs to tell it, so we listen. She talks about the things we didn\u2019t hear on the news and the little they know of Aidan Richter. She tells us about the part that came after. The not remembering. Then, later, the not talking. The surgeries and the physical therapy. Wanting to go back to school where no one would know who she was. The Russian name her mother didn\u2019t understand until now.</p><p>Then she talks about before. We hear story after story about a girl and a piano and a whole community who took ownership of her. Her eyes light up at the memory of it. But that\u2019s what it is\u200c\u2014\u200ca memory. Like Sunshine said. I know what she\u2019s seeing. A dead girl.</p><p>And as I listen to these stories, in this shrine of a house, I start to understand why she left.</p><p>I feel like I learn more in one evening about the girl who has practically lived at my house for months than I have since the moment I met her. And I don\u2019t want to know any of it.</p><p>Her mother thanks us but I don\u2019t know why and then she leaves to make more phone calls. I think she just needs something to do.</p><p>Drew lies back in Sunshine\u2019s bed, staring at the ceiling. I sit on the floor and lean against the wall. Every time I move I can hear paper crinkling against my back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says, eventually.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t understand what?\u201d I ask. There are so many possible answers to that question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why he didn\u2019t rape her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k kind of a question is that?\u201d I practically growl at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a dick. I\u2019m serious,\u201d he says, and I can tell he is being serious and it\u2019s uncomfortable for him. All of this is uncomfortable for him. In the last few weeks, Drew has had to handle more emotionally-charged, disturbing situations than he has in his whole life and he\u2019s not equipped for it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize to him, because I am, for more than just biting his head off. He was going to have to start growing up at some point, but I feel bad that it had to be like this.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it. Gorgeous girl, alone, why doesn\u2019t he rape her? Why does he just beat the shit out of her and leave her there. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it make sense if he had raped her?\u201d I ask, because nothing about what happened to her makes sense.</p><p>\u201cNo. I guess I just want to understand why he did it. I want there to be a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much pain, rage, grief. Too much reality.\u201d There are so many things that can break you if there\u2019s nothing to hold you together.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not an excuse,\u201d I reply. \u201cYou asked for a reason. It\u2019s a reason. Just not a good one.\u201d</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s still struggling to understand, to make this fit into his view of the world; but it never will. And it shouldn\u2019t. It has no place in the world, no matter how often it happens.</p><p>I feel the clock cursing me with every minute that passes and I force myself not to look at it because I don\u2019t want to count them. I don\u2019t even know how long the silence persists before I have to say what\u2019s in my head because I don\u2019t want it in there anymore.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to have to do this again... I can\u2019t do this again. It was done. It was everybody. All of them... gone... and then her. Why? What did I do that was so wrong? Why even give her to me, just to take her away?\u201d I know Drew wants to tell me not to let my mind go there, but he can\u2019t even make himself say the words. It\u2019s the only place left for my mind to go. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I never should have thought it was okay to love her.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cIt is okay, Josh. She\u2019s okay.\u201d He wants to believe it, but he doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s worse than if he\u2019d said nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo one is ever okay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s well after midnight, but no one is sleeping. We\u2019re on our third pot of coffee. I\u2019ve made the last two, which is only right, since I\u2019ve been the one drinking most of it.</p><p>Asher and Addison and Mr. Ward got back an hour ago. None of them said a word, but they didn\u2019t need to. If they had found anything, it would have spoken for itself. The quiet in this room is like a vise that just keeps tightening on us, little by little, until we\u2019re all suffocating from it. The piano hovers in the corner like a ghost and I can\u2019t look at it, because now I know what it means, and it\u2019s haunting me, too.</p><p>Drew and I are at the dining room table. Mr. and Mrs. Ward are on one couch far enough away from each other that there\u2019s no danger of them touching. Addison is stretched out on the other couch with her head resting on Asher\u2019s lap, his hand mindlessly running through her hair.</p><p>The back door opens and it\u2019s a bomb detonating into the room. Everyone turns at once. And she\u2019s there.</p><p>No one moves. No one jumps up and runs to her or shrieks with joy. Everyone just stares, like we\u2019re all trying to make sure she\u2019s really here. She looks at all of us, her eyes passing over every battered face in the room, until she reaches mine. And then there\u2019s nothing else. I can\u2019t move, but she does. And then she\u2019s right in front of me and all at once her mother says Emilia and Asher says Em and her father says Milly and Drew says Nastya and I say Sunshine and then she shatters.</p><p>All the pieces of all the girls go flying and I\u2019m holding the one who\u2019s left.</p><p>My arms are wrapped around her, but I don\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t think anything. I don\u2019t even know if I breathe. I\u2019m so afraid that I am not going to be able to hold her together. I\u2019ve seen her cry once before but it was nothing like this. She is gone, disappeared into some otherworldly oblivion of pain. The sound. It\u2019s raw and primal and horrifying and I don\u2019t want to hear it. Her hand is pressed between my chest and her mouth, trying to stifle it, but it\u2019s not working. She won\u2019t stop shaking, always the shaking, and I\u2019m begging in my head for her to stop. I can feel everyone in the room watching, but I can\u2019t think about them right now.</p><p>She\u2019s still standing, but she\u2019s not. All of her weight is on me. All of it. The weight of her body and her secrets and her tears and her pain and her regret and her loss and I feel like I\u2019m going to break, too, because it\u2019s too much. I don\u2019t want to know any of this. Now I understand why she spent so much time running. I want to run away, too. I want to drop her and fling the door open and not look back, because I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m not strong enough, not brave enough, not comforting enough. I\u2019m not enough. I\u2019m no one\u2019s salvation. Not even my own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I\u2019m here and so is she and I can\u2019t let go. Maybe I don\u2019t need to save her forever. Maybe I can just save her right now, in this moment, and if I can do that, maybe it will save me and maybe that can be enough. I tighten my arms as if I can still the shaking with that alone. The crying has turned silent. Her face is buried against my chest. I\u2019m watching the light reflect off her hair on top of her head and I focus on that, because I can\u2019t look around me and see all of those faces asking me for answers I don\u2019t have.</p><p>Gradually, she calms. Her breathing slows and her body settles into mine and it steadies. Then I feel her take her own weight back, for just a moment, before she pulls away from me.</p><p>I loosen my arms and let her go, but my eyes stay on her. Her face goes blank, the way it was the first time I saw her and I see every emotion being put away. It\u2019s like watching a video of an explosion played backwards, every piece of debris being sucked back into place, like nothing ever happened.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid to look away. Afraid she\u2019ll fall apart again. Afraid she\u2019ll disappear. Afraid. I never should have left my garage. I never should have let her in it.</p> <p>Then she sees the pile of notebooks on the table and everything about her goes still. Her eyes won\u2019t leave them. They are a question and an answer all at once.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d her mother asks, finally. Confused. Betrayed. Relieved. \u201cYou didn\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>I look at the faces of the people who love her, who haven\u2019t heard her voice in nearly two years. No one expects a response. But they get one.</p><p>\u201cI remember everything,\u201d she whispers, and it\u2019s a confession and a curse.</p><p>The only other noise in the room is the sharp intake of her mother\u2019s breath at the sound of Sunshine\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cSince when?\u201d her father asks.</p><p>She pulls her eyes away from the notebooks to face him when she answers.</p><p>\u201cSince the day I stopped talking.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, everyone eventually sleeps; scattered across the house on beds and floors and sofas. I end up on the twin bed in Sunshine\u2019s room, with her body curled up against mine, and I don\u2019t care how small the bed is, because she will never be close enough.</p><p>No one made any attempt to stop me when I climbed in with her. I think they all knew they couldn\u2019t prevent it. There was nothing in this house or on this earth that was going to keep me from being next to her.</p><p>Drew is on a makeshift bed on the floor because I don\u2019t think he wanted to be far away from her, either.</p> <p>I listen to her breathing; the soft intake of air reminding me that she\u2019s here, her body pressed against mine, the way we\u2019ve slept so many nights that I\u2019ve lost count.</p><p>Sometime during the night, her mother comes in and looks at us on the bed together. Her expression is one of acceptance, if not understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call her?\u201d she asks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her real question.</p><p>\u201cSunshine,\u201d I say, and she smiles like she believes it\u2019s perfect and she may be the only person other than me who would think so.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she to you?\u201d she whispers. The real question and I know the answer even if don\u2019t know how to say it.</p><p>Drew\u2019s muffled voice rises up from the floor before I can respond.</p><p>\u201cFamily,\u201d he says.</p><p>And he\u2019s right.</p> <p>CHAPTER 55</p><p>Emilia</p><p>My parents leave the next morning for the news conference, and Asher goes to school, even though they told him he could skip today.</p><p>I walk Drew to his car and I think I could hug him forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss my Nastypants,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cThere will never come a day when I won\u2019t be your Nastypants.\u201d I smile and let go. \u201cTell Tierney to give you another chance. If you screw up this time, I\u2019ll take you down myself.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s gone; and it\u2019s just me and Josh Bennett and all of the unasked questions.</p><p>I hand him one of the notebooks because it\u2019s the only way he\u2019ll know, and he looks at it like it\u2019s a viper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to know what\u2019s in those books,\u201d he says, and he won\u2019t take it out of my hands.</p><p>I tell him that I don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s in them either. But I do know and I need him to know too. So he reads it and his face tenses along with every other muscle in his body and I can tell he\u2019s trying not to cry. And when I show him the pictures, he shoves his fist against his mouth and I think he wants to hit something, but there\u2019s nothing here to hit. When he gets to the one of my hand, the one with the bones coming through the skin in so many places it\u2019s hard to believe they ever put it back together again, he throws up. And I don\u2019t blame him.</p><p>I show him videos of me playing the piano and photo albums full of pictures and introduce him to the me he never met; but we don\u2019t say very much.</p><p>\u201cYou were really good,\u201d he says, his voice faint as it breaks the silence.</p><p>\u201cI was f**king amazing,\u201d I try to joke, but it just comes out sad.</p><p>\u201cYou still are,\u201d he responds with quiet conviction, piercing me with his eyes the way he does when he wants to make sure I\u2019m listening. \u201cEvery way that matters.\u201d</p><p>The silence returns and we sit on the couch, photo albums on our laps, staring at the wasted piano in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could have saved you,\u201d he says, finally. And this is what it always comes back to. Salvation. Him saving me. Me saving him. Impossibilities, because there is no such thing, and it\u2019s not what we ever needed from each other anyway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d I echo his words from my birthday. \u201cBecause it\u2019s an impossible wish.\u201d I pick up his hand and he laces his fingers through mine, holding on tighter than he needs to. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have saved me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have liked to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Leighton told me you needed to be saved, too. But I can\u2019t do that either,\u201d I confess, and he looks at me skeptically because I never did tell him about that conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to save me and I can\u2019t save you,\u201d I say, because I need him to hear me say it, but also because I need to hear me say it.</p><p>He closes the photo album and lays it down on the coffee table and cringes, because I\u2019ve found that\u2019s what he does every time he looks at that coffee table. And then he turns and puts his hands on either side of my face and kisses me with a reverence I may never understand. And maybe I\u2019m a liar and I do need it, because being kissed by Josh Bennett is kind of like being saved. It\u2019s a promise and a memory of the future and a book of better stories.</p><p>When he stops, I\u2019m still here, and he\u2019s still looking at me like he can\u2019t believe I am, and I want to keep that look forever.</p><p>\u201cEmilia,\u201d he says, and when he does, it warms me to my soul. \u201cEvery day you save me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 56</p><p>Josh</p><p>I say goodbye to her in her driveway two days after I got here. Two days after I learned the truth. Two days after I got her back. Two days to wrap my mind around losing her again.</p><p>I was planning on leaving tomorrow, but I know I have to leave today.</p><p>We\u2019re both leaning against the side of my truck, looking at the ground like it holds the secrets of the universe. Her hand is in a fist and she\u2019s tracing circles again with her foot and I hate it because it reminds me of things I don\u2019t want to think about.</p><p>She told her parents that she was considering coming back with me, and they didn\u2019t like it, but they know her well enough to realize that telling her not to wouldn\u2019t accomplish much. And yet that\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do.</p><p>I take both of her hands and pull her in front of me because I want to face her when I say everything I have to say. And maybe it\u2019s a mistake, because when I look at her now, I think, for just one second, that God doesn\u2019t hate me so much after all. But then I look again and all I can see is the goodbye all around us and I need to touch her one more time. If there has to be a last time I kiss her, I want to know that it\u2019s the last time. I trace the line of the scar by her hair. I don\u2019t know who moves first, but her lips are on mine and my hands are in her hair and we kiss each other with the regret and desperation of so many days I can\u2019t count them. Her body is crushed against mine and I hold her there so tightly it\u2019s as if I\u2019m trying to absorb her through sheer force of will.</p><p>But I can\u2019t; and when we stop, I rest my forehead against hers and start to say goodbye.</p><p>I know that if I don\u2019t talk now, I may never talk, and I\u2019ll just stay here until tomorrow and let her convince herself to come with me. And I\u2019ll convince myself that it\u2019s okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving today,\u201d I tell her and I wait.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d she asks so softly it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t want me to hear it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019s honest, even if it goes against everything I\u2019m going to say to her next. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She nods like she\u2019s thought about it, too, and she knows it\u2019s true. But, like me, I don\u2019t think she wants to admit it.</p><p>She made me look at those pictures and read those books and now I know everything that she knows. But I don\u2019t know how to help her. I don\u2019t understand how she lived with that in her head every day and still held onto any thread of sanity.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay here and try to, I don\u2019t know, get better. Get better sounds stupid.\u201d It does sound stupid, but I don\u2019t know what won\u2019t sound stupid. Get well? Heal? Fix things? It\u2019s like she has a broken leg. Or she\u2019s a handyman. And I\u2019m a shit for thinking it, but there\u2019s a part of me that knows that when she does get well, heal, fix things, she may not want me anymore. She may be so changed that we won\u2019t even know each other, if we ever did. And when that goodbye comes, it won\u2019t be temporary.</p><p>If none of this had ever happened, she would be still be here in Brighton where she belongs \u2013 the beautiful, talented, unattainable girl. And I\u2019m a bastard, because I know the truth of her now, but I don\u2019t know how to regret it. Because to regret it would mean to regret that I ever met her and I can\u2019t make myself do that.</p><p>Part of us has always known that we were together because we were damaged. We had that life experience bond that neither of us ever wanted. And maybe when she\u2019s not so damaged anymore, I won\u2019t be enough for her. Maybe she\u2019ll want someone whose life isn\u2019t as tragic as hers. And that won\u2019t be me.</p><p>When I think about it, I want to rewind and go back to where I just said yes and leave it there. Yes, come with me. We\u2019ll play house and bake cookies and build chairs and life will be perfect. But I\u2019ve started now; I\u2019m in this and I can finish it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say this and it probably won\u2019t sound good or eloquent or whatever and I\u2019m probably going to ramble, but just let me say it, okay? Will you listen?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are soft on me. Her lips just barely turn up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve listened to every word I\u2019ve ever said. Even the ones I didn\u2019t say. I\u2019ll listen to anything, Josh.\u201d It\u2019s like a razor that slices through whatever is left holding me, and I just go.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day you\u2019ll come back. Maybe you never will and that\u2019ll suck, but you can\u2019t keep doing this. The blame and the self-loathing and the bullshit. I can\u2019t watch that. It makes me hate you for hating yourself. I don\u2019t want to lose you. But I\u2019d rather lose you if it means you\u2019ll be happy. I think if you come back with me today, you\u2019ll never be okay. And I\u2019ll never be okay if you aren\u2019t. I need to know that there\u2019s a way for people like us to end up okay. I need to know that there even is such a thing as okay, or maybe not just okay, maybe even good, and it\u2019s out there and we just haven\u2019t found it yet. There\u2019s got to be a happier ending than this, here. There\u2019s got to be a better story. Because we deserve one. You deserve one. Even if it doesn\u2019t end with you coming back to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last part chokes me. Steals my air and burns my eyes. I\u2019m kicking myself when I say it. I tell myself to shut up and keep her. Grab her and kiss her and tell her everything will be okay because I\u2019ll make it okay, good, even. Tell her that there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with her. Lie to her with every pretty lie I have. But I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019ve done goodbyes before, and I can do this one, too. Somehow this one hurts worse than the others; because this one I could prevent if I wanted to, since I\u2019m the one saying it. This goodbye comes with a choice the way none of the others ever did. And as much as I\u2019m telling her to stay here, as much as I know she needs to stay here, I still want her to choose to come with me. To say f**k sanity and healing and closure. To say that I am the only thing she needs to be well and whole and alive. But we both know that\u2019s not true. She\u2019s going to say goodbye to me today and I have to let her and neither of us knows if she\u2019s ever going to come back.</p><p>I\u2019ve been trying to leave for twenty minutes, but neither of us knows how to say goodbye. Even now, I know that all of the words I\u2019ve given her today haven\u2019t been enough, because I haven\u2019t said the one thing that needs to be said the most. And if I want to leave here without regrets, I need to know that there are no more unsaid words left to haunt me.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I catch her as she walks away, taking her hand and turning it over in mine, tracing the scars like I\u2019ve done so many times before. She\u2019s searching my face and I can almost feel her eyes reaching into mine, wondering what more there could possibly be to say.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to say it\u200c\u2014\u200cafter all this time, I\u2019m not even sure that I can\u200c\u2014\u200cbut I have to break her last rule, because if she knows nothing else, I need her to know this one thing.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Sunshine,\u201d I tell her, before I lose my nerve. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a shit whether you want me to or not.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 57</p><p>Emilia</p><p>I never realized that grief and self-pity weren\u2019t the same thing. I thought grieving was what I was doing all this time I had been feeling sorry for myself, but it wasn\u2019t. So for the first time in nearly three years, I let myself grieve.</p><p>Josh let me go. Or maybe I let him go. I\u2019m not sure it matters. He left the day after Drew. He told me he loved me, but he wouldn\u2019t let me say it back, because he didn\u2019t want to hear it if I was lost to him. Then he kissed the palm of my left hand and gave it back to me and he got in his truck and he left.</p> <p>I think the goodbye was harder on him, because he\u2019s used to losing people who die, but he\u2019s not used to losing people who walk away; and that\u2019s what I was doing. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to stay. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to go back at all. All I know is that it\u2019s time.</p><p>It\u2019s time for a lot of things, even if I can\u2019t make them happen all at once. And I\u2019d like to, because patience has never been my thing.</p><p>I crawl into my mother\u2019s arms in a silent apology because I don\u2019t know the words that will ever be enough. And when I speak, I tell her what I know is true: that I hate myself, that I am so very not okay, that I am afraid I\u2019ll feel like this forever and I don\u2019t know what to do. And then I tell her to make the phone call. I\u2019ll go.</p><p>I go to therapy nearly every day in the beginning. And I talk. And I talk. And I talk. And then I talk some more. And then I cry. And when I\u2019m done crying, my parents come, and then my brother, and we try to find a way to crawl out of this hole together.</p><p>We finally found a therapist for me who doesn\u2019t have a lot of patience, either, and has no tolerance for my crap. I kind of love her. Because let\u2019s face it, when it comes to therapy, I don\u2019t need a kindergarten teacher; I need a drill sergeant. She gives me homework which I actually do, and if and when I leave, we have a schedule for phone and weekend appointments. I know there really isn\u2019t an end in sight for me with the therapy. At least not for a while.</p><p>I even tried the group thing again, but only once, because I still don\u2019t like it. I still don\u2019t feel better just for knowing that shitty things happen to other people, too, and so I don\u2019t do that again. And I don\u2019t feel bad about it.</p> <p>Yesterday, I sat down at the piano, but I didn\u2019t touch the keys. I think I\u2019d like to keep that coffin closed. I\u2019d like to remember that the last piece of music I played was beautiful and perfect, even if it wasn\u2019t. I won\u2019t even try to act like it doesn\u2019t still kill me; my lying skills haven\u2019t improved enough for that. I mourn it every day and I wonder if I\u2019ll ever stop.</p><p>The nightmares haven\u2019t come back, but I expect them every night. All the secrets and stories are spit out of my head now. Everyone knows everything, so I guess the memories have nothing to hold over me anymore. I still itch for the notebooks like a sleeping pill before bed every night, but they\u2019re gone now. My father helped me build a fire in the fire pit in the backyard and he and my mother and Asher and I all took turns throwing them in until the smoke was burning our eyes and we could blame the tears on it. I\u2019ll never forget the words, but I won\u2019t write them down again either.</p><p>I don\u2019t have the camera my mother gave me here, but we use hers, and we take more pictures than we will ever need and we try to make new memories. We spread the proofs out over the kitchen table and I show her my favorite one and she shows me hers and we print them and start a new wall together.</p><p>Aidan Richter is being held, but none of the lawyers will let me talk to him, even though he\u2019s confessed. And maybe there really isn\u2019t anything left to say. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the why of Aidan Richter. About the why of what happened that day. How he came home. How he found his brother\u2019s body. How reality became so unbearable in that moment that his mind just shattered. They say he had a psychotic break. I know that\u2019s the defense, but I don\u2019t want to hear it. I don\u2019t want to get it. Because I can\u2019t excuse it. I can\u2019t forgive it. I won\u2019t. But my hate will never be as clearly defined again, either. Aidan Richter wasn\u2019t prepared for the shit life threw at him any more than I was. He just broke in a very different way. I feel like everything I\u2019ve spent the past three years believing isn\u2019t quite as true as I thought it was. Like the glass I\u2019ve been looking through is coated in the dust of my own perception and I haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s real. Because before it was black and white, evil and not. And that\u2019s the most confusing part \u2013 figuring out what\u2019s true.</p><p>For the nearly two years since I remembered, I\u2019ve had a picture of evil in my head and it had his face. I spent that time planning to hurt him and feeling justified, like it was owed to me. But when I came back to Brighton for him, I wasn\u2019t sure I could do it. So I sat in the dirt. Under the trees. In the place where he beat me. And I waited. I waited for the words. I waited for the courage. I waited to decide. But I waited too long; and he took that from me too.</p><p>I never did see him again after that day in the gallery. I never did get to make him listen. I\u2019ll be allowed to speak at his sentencing, whenever that is. I haven\u2019t decided if I will. I know there are still things to say, but I don\u2019t know what they are anymore, and there are days when I miss the silence.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder whatever became of the real Russian girl who I was supposed to be that day. I wonder if she heard about what happened and if she knows what part she played in it simply by existing.</p><p>One afternoon Josh calls, and in the understatement of the century, I tell him that I\u2019m tired of being angry.</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t be,\u201d he says, as if this is the most logical thing on earth. And maybe it is.</p><p>\u201cBut if I\u2019m not angry then isn\u2019t it the same as saying it\u2019s okay? Doesn\u2019t it mean I\u2019m condoning it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It means you\u2019re accepting it.\u201d He takes a breath and exhales. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you that you shouldn\u2019t be pissed. You should be furious. You\u2019re entitled to every ounce of anger you have.\u201d He stops speaking for a moment and when he starts again I can hear the tension in his voice. \u201cYou have no idea how much I want to kill him for what he did to you, and if he hadn\u2019t been arrested, I don\u2019t know that there is anything that would have stopped me from doing it, so don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t believe your hatred is justified. But you have a choice now and I\u2019d rather you choose to be happy. And I know that that sounds stupid. Maybe it sounds like the most impossible thing in the world, but it\u2019s still what I want. He took the f**king piano, Sunshine. He didn\u2019t take everything. Look at your left hand. It\u2019s probably clenched in a fist right now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need to look. It is. He knows it.</p><p>\u201cNow open it up and let it go.\u201d</p><p>And I do.</p><p>I think about the day I died and about the story Josh\u2019s grandfather told and three days later I write a letter to the court for whenever they want to read it.</p><p>My name is Emilia Ward.</p><p>I have a list of nevers I started when I was fifteen. I will never be the Brighton Piano Girl again. I will never carry a child. I will never walk down the street in the middle of the afternoon without wondering if someone is waiting to kill me. I will never get back the months of my life that I spent in rehabilitation and in and out of hospitals, instead of in recitals and in and out of school. I will never get back the years I spent hating every last person in the world, including myself. I will never not know the meaning of the word pain.</p><p>I understand pain. I understand rage. Aidan Richter gave me the gift of that understanding. He understands it, too. I spent the past three years despising the person who did this to me; the person who stole my life and took my identity. I learned to despise myself in the process. I spent the last three years fortifying my rage, while he spent the last three years healing his.</p><p>I will never forget what he did to me. I will never forgive it. I will never stop hating him. Please don\u2019t ask me to. I wish I could say that I am a big enough person; but I\u2019m not. I will never stop mourning what he stole from me. But I can\u2019t steal it back from him and I don\u2019t want to anymore. I think maybe I can believe in spite of Aidan Richter; or maybe I can believe because of him. If he can heal his life, then maybe I can, too.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell you what I believe is the appropriate punishment for him. I just don\u2019t know. But I would like to believe in the dream of second chances. For both of us.</p><p>Nothing is perfect. It\u2019s not even good yet. But maybe.</p><p>And after five weeks, I go home.</p><p>CHAPTER 58</p><p>Emilia</p><p>I haven\u2019t gotten better. I\u2019m not even close to okay. The only thing I\u2019ve done is to decide to get better. But I think that may just be enough.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to see the magic in everyday miracles now: the fact that my heart still beats, that I can lift my feet off of the earth to walk and that there is something in me worthy of love. I know that bad things still happen. And sometimes I still ask myself why I am alive; but now, when I ask, I have an answer.</p><p>I get back on a Sunday morning and that evening I walk into dinner at the Leighton house, unexpected, but always welcome. I can tell the music is Sarah\u2019s and it makes me smile because I still hate it, but not her. Everyone is laughing and helping and sniping, and other than the fact that Tierney Lowell is setting the table, everything is the same.</p><p>Seeing Josh is my homecoming. I didn\u2019t tell him I was coming back. He doesn\u2019t say anything when he sees me, and neither do I, because the fact that I\u2019m here is an answer. We just look at each other and speak in the silence like we always have and no one interrupts the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHi\u200c\u2014\u200c\u201d Mrs. Leighton says, her eyes wide, when I walk into the kitchen without a stitch of black on me, carrying the same chocolate cake I brought the first time I had dinner here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmilia,\u201d I fill the pause, because everyone is still trying to figure out what to call me. Except maybe Josh, who\u2019s always known.</p><p>\u201cEmilia,\u201d she says, and hugs me. \u201cYou have a beautiful voice.\u201d</p><p>And maybe some things aren\u2019t the same.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me something,\u201d Josh says, a month after I\u2019ve gotten back. I\u2019m in the chair in his garage and I\u2019m doing homework, not woodworking, because I may never catch up. I could go inside and study in the air conditioning, but I love this place. And being out here, breathing sawdust in Josh Bennett\u2019s garage with him, is worth any amount of sweat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve answered everything, Josh. I don\u2019t think there are any questions left to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d he says, laying down a screwdriver and coming over to lean against the workbench opposite me. He pushes his boots out far enough so that they just touch mine.</p><p>I close the book and try not to smile at him, because I know what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s the question I\u2019ve been waiting for him to ask since the day I got lost and ended up at his house in the middle of the night, before he even knew what the question was.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see when you died?\u201d He has that tentative half smile, like he\u2019s almost embarrassed by what he\u2019s saying. \u201cBecause I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t the Sea of Tranquility.\u201d</p><p>And when I look at him, I\u2019m not so sure it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d His voice drops just slightly and he loses even the suggestion of a smile.</p><p>He\u2019s watching me like he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s allowed to ask the question, and he\u2019s not even sure he wants the answer. I can almost see his grandfather\u2019s words and Josh\u2019s doubts about them swimming in his head. On every side of me are the lights and the tools and the wood and the boots and the boy I want to see forever. And if my Sea of Tranquility were real, it would be this place, here, with him.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything right away, because I just want one minute to look at his face before I give him my last secret.</p><p>And then I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYour garage.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
