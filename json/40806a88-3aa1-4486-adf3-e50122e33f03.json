Where else would a smart man warm himself on a frigid, wind-blown afternoon? Certainly not at home, by his own fire.</p><p>No, Tom Concannon was a smart man, Maggie thought, and wouldn\u2019t be at home.</p><p>Her father would be at the pub, among friends and laughter. He was a man who loved to laugh, and to cry and to spin improbable dreams. A foolish man some might call him. But not Maggie, never Maggie.</p> <p>As she steered her racketing lorry around the last curve that led into the village of Kilmihil, she saw not a soul on the street. No wonder, as it was well past time for lunch and not a day for strolling with winter racing in from the Atlantic like a hound from icy Hades. The west coast of Ireland shivered under it and dreamed of spring.</p><p>She saw her father\u2019s battered Fiat, among other vehicles she recognized. Tim O\u2019Malley\u2019s had a good crowd this day. She parked as close as she could to the front entrance of the pub, which was nestled in a line of several shops.</p><p>As she walked down the street the wind knocked her back, made her huddle inside the fleece-lined jacket and pull the black wool cap down lower on her head. Color whipped into her cheeks like a blush. There was a smell of damp under the cold, like a nasty threat. There would be ice, thought the farmer\u2019s daughter, before nightfall.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember a more bitter January, or one that seemed so hell-bent on blowing its frosty breath over County Clare. The little garden in front of the shop she hurried by had paid dearly. What was left of it was blackened by the wind and frost and lay pitifully on the soggy ground.</p><p>She was sorry for it, but the news she held inside her was so fearfully bright, she wondered the flowers didn\u2019t rise up and bloom away into spring.</p> <p>There was plenty of warmth in O\u2019Malley\u2019s. She felt it nuzzle her the moment she opened the door. She could smell the peat burning in the fire, its red-hot heart smoldering cheerfully, and the stew O\u2019Malley\u2019s wife, Deirdre, had served at lunch. And tobacco, beer, the filmy layer that frying chips left in the air.</p><p>She spotted Murphy first, sitting at one of the tiny tables, his boots stretched out as he eased a tune out of an Irish accordion that matched the sweetness of his voice. The other patrons of the pub were listening, dreaming a bit over their beer and porter. The tune was sad, as the best of Ireland was, melancholy and lovely as a lover\u2019s tears. It was a song that bore her name, and spoke of growing old.</p><p>Murphy saw her, smiled a little. His black hair fell untidily over his brow, so that he tossed his head to clear it away. Tim O\u2019Malley stood behind the bar, a barrel of a man whose apron barely stretched across the girth of him. He had a wide, creased face and eyes that disappeared into folds of flesh when he laughed.</p><p>He was polishing glasses. When he saw Maggie, he continued his task, knowing she would do what was polite and wait to order until the song was finished.</p><p>She saw David Ryan, puffing on one of the American cigarettes his brother sent him every month from Boston, and tidy Mrs. Logan, knitting with pink wool while her foot tapped to the tune. There was old Johnny Conroy, grinning toothlessly, his gnarled hand holding the equally twisted one of his wife of fifty years. They sat together like newlyweds, lost in Murphy\u2019s song.</p><p>The television over the bar was silent, but its picture was bright and glossy with a British soap opera. People in gorgeous clothes and shining hair argued around a massive table lit with silver-based candles and elegant crystal.</p> <p>Its glittery story was more, much more than a country away from the little pub with its scarred bar and smoke-dark walls.</p><p>Maggie\u2019s scorn for the shining characters squabbling in their wealthy room was quick and automatic as a knee jerk. So was the swift tug of envy.</p><p>If she ever had such wealth, she thought\u2014though, of course, she didn\u2019t care one way or the other\u2014she would certainly know what to do with it.</p><p>Then she saw him, sitting in the corner by himself. Not separate, not at all. He was as much a part of the room as the chair he sat on. He had an arm slung over the back of that chair, while the other hand held a cup she knew would hold strong tea laced with Irish.</p><p>An unpredictable man he might be, full of starts and stops and quick turns, but she knew him. Of all the men she had known, she had loved no one with the full thrust of her heart as she loved Tom Concannon.</p><p>She said nothing, crossed to him, sat and rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>Love for him rose up in her, a fire that warmed down to the bone but never burned. His arm came from around the chair and wrapped her closer. His lips brushed across her temple.</p><p>When the song was done, she took his hand in hers and kissed it. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know I was thinking of you, Maggie, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be I was thinking of you.\u201d She sat back to smile at him. He was a small man, but toughly built. Like a runt bull, he often said of himself with one of his rolling laughs. There were lines around his eyes that deepened and fanned out when he grinned. They made him, in Maggie\u2019s eyes, all the more handsome. His hair had once been gloriously red and full. It had thinned a bit with time, and the gray streaked through the fire like smoke. He was, to Maggie, the most dashing man in the world.</p><p>He was her father.</p><p>\u201cDa,\u201d she said. \u201cI have news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I can see it all over your face.\u201d</p><p>Winking, he pulled off her cap so that her hair fell wildly red to her shoulders. He\u2019d always liked to look at it, to watch it flash and sizzle. He could still remember when he\u2019d held her the first time, her face screwed up with the rage of life, her tiny fists bunched and flailing. And her hair shining like a new coin.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been disappointed not to have a son, had been humbled to have been given the gift of a daughter.</p><p>\u201cBring me girl a drink, Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have tea,\u201d she called out. \u201cIt\u2019s wicked cold.\u201d Now that she was here, she wanted the pleasure of drawing the news out, savoring it. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re in here singing tunes and drinking, Murphy? Who\u2019s keeping your cows warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach other,\u201d he shot back. \u201cAnd if this weather keeps up, I\u2019ll have more calves come spring than I can handle, as cattle do what the rest of the world does on a long winter night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sit by the fire with a good book, do they?\u201d Maggie said, and had the room echoing with laughter. It was no secret, and only a slight embarrassment to Murphy, that his love of reading was well-known. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow, I\u2019ve tried to interest them in the joys of literature, but those cows, they\u2019d rather watch the television.\u201d He tapped his empty glass. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here for the quiet, what with your furnace roaring like thunder day and night. Why aren\u2019t you home, playing with your glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa.\u201d When Murphy walked to the bar, Maggie took her father\u2019s hand again. \u201cI needed to tell you first. You know I took some pieces to McGuinness\u2019s shop in Ennis this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d He took out his pipe, tapped it. \u201cYou should have told me you were going. I\u2019d have kept you company on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do it alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy little hermit,\u201d he said, and flicked a finger down her nose.</p><p>\u201cDa, he bought them.\u201d Her eyes, as green as her father\u2019s, sparkled. \u201cHe bought four of them, and that\u2019s all I took in. Paid me for them then and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say, Maggie, you don\u2019t say!\u201d He leaped up, dragging her with him, and spun her around the room. \u201cListen to this, ladies and gentlemen. My daughter, my own Margaret Mary, has sold her glass in Ennis.\u201d</p><p>There was quick, spontaneous applause and a barrage of questions.</p><p>\u201cAt McGuinness\u2019s,\u201d she said, firing answers back. \u201cFour pieces, and he\u2019ll look at more. Two vases, a bowl, and a...I supposed you could call the last a paperweight.\u201d She laughed when Tim set whiskeys on the counter for her and her father.</p> <p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d She lifted her glass and toasted. \u201cTo Tom Concannon, who believed in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Maggie.\u201d Her father shook his head and there were tears in his eyes. \u201cTo you. All to you.\u201d He clicked glasses and sent the whiskey streaming down his throat. \u201cFire up that squeeze box, Murphy. I want to dance with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Murphy obliged with a jig. With the sounds of shouts and clapping hands, Tom led his daughter around the floor. Deirdre came out from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. Her face was flushed from cooking as she pulled her husband into the dance. From jig to reel and reel to hornpipe, Maggie whirled from partner to partner until her legs ached.</p><p>As others came into the pub, drawn either by the music or the prospect of company, the news was spread. By nightfall, she knew, everyone within twenty kilometers would have heard of it.</p><p>It was the kind of fame she had hoped for. It was her secret that she wished for more.</p><p>\u201cOh, enough.\u201d She sank into her chair and drained her cold tea. \u201cMy heart\u2019s about to burst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo is mine. With pride for you.\u201d Tom\u2019s smile remained bright, but his eyes dimmed a little. \u201cWe should go tell your mother, Maggie. And your sister, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Brianna this evening.\u201d Her own mood shifted at the mention of her mother.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He reached down, brushed his hand over her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s your day, Maggie Mae, nothing will spoil it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, \u2019tis our day. For I never would have blown the first bubble of glass without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll share it, just us two for a little while.\u201d He felt smothered for a minute, dizzy and hot. He thought he felt a little click behind his eyes before it cleared. Air, he thought. He needed a bit of air. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a drive. I want to smell the sea, Maggie. Will you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d She rose immediately. \u201cBut it\u2019s freezing out, and the wind\u2019s the devil. Are you sure you want to go to the cliffs today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a need to.\u201d He reached for his coat, then tossing a muffler around his throat, turned to the pub. All the dark, smoky colors seemed to whirl in his eyes. He thought, ruefully, that he was a little drunk. Then again, it was the day for it. \u201cWe\u2019re having us a party. Tomorrow night it\u2019ll be. With fine food, fine drink and fine music, to celebrate my daughter\u2019s success. I\u2019ll expect every one of me friends there.\u201d</p><p>Maggie waited until they were out in the cold. \u201cA party? Da, you know she\u2019ll not have it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still the master of my own house.\u201d His chin, very like his daughter\u2019s, jutted out. \u201cA party there will be, Maggie. I\u2019ll deal with your mother. Would you drive now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d There was no arguing, she knew, once Tom Concannon had made up his mind. She was grateful for that, or she would never have been able to travel to Venice and apprentice herself in a glass house. Never have been able to take what she\u2019d learned, and what she\u2019d dreamed, and build her own studio. She knew her mother had made Tom pay miserably for the money it had cost. But he had stood firm.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re working on now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a kind of a bottle. And I want it to be very tall, very slim. Tapered you see, from bottom to top, then it should flare out. A bit like a lily. And the color should be very delicate, like the inside of a peach.\u201d</p><p>She could see it, clear as the hand she used to describe it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely things you see in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see them there.\u201d She shot him a smile. \u201cThe hard work is making them real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make them real.\u201d He patted her hand and fell into silence.</p><p>Maggie took the twisting, narrow road toward the sea. Away toward the west, the clouds were flying in, their sails whipped by the wind and darkened with storm. Clearer patches were swallowed up, then fought their way free to glow gem bright amid the pewter.</p><p>She saw a bowl, wide and deep, swirled with those warring colors, and began to fashion it in her head.</p><p>The road twisted, then straightened, as she threaded the rattling lorry through hedgerows yellowed with winter and taller than a man. A roadside shrine to Mary stood at the outskirts of a village. The Virgin\u2019s face was serene in the cold, her arms spread in generous welcome, foolishly bright plastic flowers at her feet.</p><p>A sigh from her father had Maggie glancing over. He seemed a bit pale to her, a little drawn around the eyes. \u201cYou look tired, Da. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to take you back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He took out his pipe, tapped it absently against his palm. \u201cI want to watch the sea. There\u2019s a storm brewing, Maggie Mae. We\u2019ll have a show from the cliffs at Loop Head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will at that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Past the village the road narrowed alarmingly again until she was threading the lorry along like cotton through the eye of a needle. A man, bundled tight against the cold, trudged toward them, his faithful dog following stoically at his heels. Both man and dog stepped off the road into the hedges as the lorry eased by, inches from the toe of the man\u2019s boots. He nodded to Maggie and Tom in greeting.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019ve been thinking, Da?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could sell a few more pieces\u2014just a few more mind\u2014I could have another furnace. I want to work with more color, you see. If I could build another furnace, I could have more melts going. The firebrick\u2019s not so costly, really. But I\u2019ll need more than two hundred.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve a bit put by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not again.\u201d On this she was firm. \u201cI love you for it, but this I\u2019ll do on my own.\u201d</p><p>He took immediate umbrage and scowled at his pipe. \u201cWhat\u2019s a father for, I\u2019d like to know, if not to give to his children? You\u2019ll not have fancy clothes or pretty baubles, so if it\u2019s firebrick you want, then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I will,\u201d she shot back. \u201cBut I\u2019ll buy it myself. I\u2019ve a need to do this myself. It\u2019s not the money I want. It\u2019s the faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve paid me back tenfold already.\u201d He sat back, drawing the window down a crack so that the wind whistled through as he lit his pipe. \u201cI\u2019m a rich man, Maggie. I have two lovely daughters, each of them a jewel. And though a man could ask for no more than that, I\u2019ve a good solid house and friends to count on.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie noticed he didn\u2019t include her mother in his treasures. \u201cAnd always the pot at the end of the rainbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways that.\u201d He fell silent again, brooding. They passed old stone cabins, roofless and deserted on the verge of gray-green fields that stretched on, endless and impossibly beautiful in the gloomy light. And here a church, standing against the wind that was unbroken now, was blocked only by a few twisted and leafless trees.</p><p>It should have been a sad and lonely sight, but Tom found it beautiful. He didn\u2019t share Maggie\u2019s love of solitude, but when he looked out on a sight like this, with lowered sky and empty land meeting with barely a sight of man between, he understood it.</p><p>Through the whistling crack of the window, he could smell the sea. Once he\u2019d dreamed of crossing it.</p><p>Once he\u2019d dreamed of many things.</p><p>He had always searched for that pot of gold, and knew the failure to find it was his. He\u2019d been a farmer by birth, but never by inclination. Now he\u2019d lost all but a few acres of land, enough only for the flowers and vegetables his daughter Brianna grew so skillfully. Enough only to remind him that he had failed.</p> <p>Too many schemes, he thought now as another sigh fetched up in his chest. His wife, Maeve, was right about that. He\u2019d always been full of schemes, but never had the sense or the luck to make them work.</p><p>They chugged past another huddle of houses and a building whose owner boasted it was the last pub until New York. Tom\u2019s spirits lifted at the sight, as they always did.</p><p>\u201cShall we sail over to New York, Maggie, and have a pint?\u201d he said, as he always did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy the first round.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. A feeling of urgency came over him as she pulled the lorry to the end of the road, where it gave way to grass and rock, and at last to the windswept sea that spanned to America.</p><p>They stepped into a roar of sound that was wind and water lashing furiously against the teeth and fists of black rock. With their arms linked, they staggered like drunks, then laughing, began to walk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s madness to come here on such a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, a fine madness. Feel the air, Maggie! Feel it. It wants to blow us from here to Dublin Town. Do you remember when we went to Dublin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe saw a juggler tossing colored balls. I loved it so much you learned how yourself.\u201d</p><p>His laugh boomed out like the sea itself. \u201cOh, the apples I bruised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had pies and cobblers for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought I could make a pound or two with my new skill and took me up to Galway to the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd spent every penny you made on presents for me and Brianna.\u201d</p><p>His color was back, she noted, and his eyes were shining. She went willingly with him across the uneven grass into the gnashing teeth of the wind. There they stood on the edge of the powerful Atlantic with its warrior waves striking at the merciless rock. Water crashed, then whipped away again, leaving dozens of waterfalls tumbling through crevices. Overhead, gulls cried and wheeled, cried and wheeled, the sound echoing on and on against the thunder of the waves.</p><p>The spray plumed high, white as snow at the base, clear as crystal in the beads that scattered in the icy air. No boat bobbed on the rugged surface of the sea today. The fierce whitecaps rode the sea alone.</p><p>She wondered if her father came here so often because the merging of sea and stone symbolized marriage as much as war to his eyes. And his marriage had been forever a battle, the constant bitterness and anger of his wife\u2019s lashing forever at his heart, and gradually, oh so gradually, wearing it away.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you stay with her, Da?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He pulled his attention back from the sea and the sky.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you stay with her?\u201d Maggie repeated. \u201cBrie and I are grown now. Why do you stay where you\u2019re not happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my wife,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cWhy should that be an answer?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhy should it be an end? There\u2019s no love between you, no liking, if it comes to that. She\u2019s made your life hell as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hard on her.\u201d This, too, was on his head, he thought. For loving the child so much that he\u2019d been helpless not to accept her unconditional love for him. A love, he knew, that had left no room for understanding the disappointments of the woman who had borne her. \u201cWhat\u2019s between your mother and me is as much my doing as hers. A marriage is a delicate thing, Maggie, a balance of two hearts and two hopes. Sometimes the weight\u2019s just too heavy on the one side, and the other can\u2019t lift to it. You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019ve a marriage of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never marry.\u201d She said in fiercely, like a vow before God. \u201cI\u2019ll never give anyone the right to make me so unhappy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Don\u2019t.\u201d He squeezed her hard, worried. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more precious than marriage and family. Nothing in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s so, how can it be such a prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d The weakness came over him again, and all at once he felt the cold deep in his bones. \u201cWe haven\u2019t given you a good example, your mother and I, and I\u2019m sorry for it. More than I can tell you. But I know this, Maggie, my girl. When you love with all you are, it isn\u2019t unhappiness alone you risk. It\u2019s heaven, too.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her face into his coat, drew comfort from the scent of him. She couldn\u2019t tell him that she knew, had known for years, that it hadn\u2019t been heaven for him. And that he would never have bolted the door to that marital prison behind him if it hadn\u2019t been for her.</p> <p>\u201cDid you love her, ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And it was as hot as one of your furnaces. You came from that, Maggie Mae. Born in fire you were, like one of your finest and boldest statues. However much that fire cooled, it burned once. Maybe if it hadn\u2019t flared so bright, so hard, we could have made it last.\u201d</p><p>Something in his tone made her look up again, study his face. \u201cThere was someone else.\u201d</p><p>Like a honeyed blade, the memory was painful and sweet. Tom looked to sea again, as if he could gaze across it and find the woman he\u2019d let go. \u201cAye, there was once. But it wasn\u2019t to be. Had no right to be. I\u2019ll tell you this, when love comes, when the arrow strikes the heart, there\u2019s no stopping it. And even bleeding is a pleasure. So don\u2019t say never to me, Maggie. I want for you what I couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say it to him, but she thought it. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-three, Da, and Brie\u2019s but a year behind me. I know what the church says, but I\u2019m damned if I believe there\u2019s a God in heaven who finds joy in punishing a man for the whole of his life for a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMistake.\u201d His brows lowered, Tom stuck his pipe in his teeth. \u201cMy marriage has not been a mistake, Margaret Mary, and you\u2019ll not say so now, nor ever again. You and Brie came from it. A mistake\u2014no, a miracle. I was past forty when you were born, without a thought in my head to starting a family. I think of what my life would have been like without the two of you. Where would I be now? A man near seventy, alone. Alone.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands and his eyes were fierce on hers. \u201cI thank God every day I found your mother, and that between us we made something I can leave behind. Of all the things I\u2019ve done, and not done, you and Brianna are my first and truest joys. Now there\u2019ll be no more talk of mistakes or unhappiness, do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Da.\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cI know it. Too much, I think, but I can\u2019t regret it.\u201d The sense of urgency came on him again, like a wind whispering to hurry. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019d ask of you, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He studied her face, his fingers molding it as if he suddenly had a need to memorize every feature\u2014the sharp stubborn chin, the soft curve of cheek, the eyes as green and restless as the sea that clashed beneath them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strong one, Maggie. Tough and strong, with a true heart beneath the steel. God knows you\u2019re smart. I can\u2019t begin to understand the things you know, or how you know them. You\u2019re my bright star, Maggie, the way Brie\u2019s my cool rose. I want you, the both of you, to follow where your dreams lead you. I want that more than I can say. And when you chase them down, you\u2019ll chase them as much for me as for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The roar of the sea dimmed in his ears, as did the light in his eyes. For a moment Maggie\u2019s face blurred and faded.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Alarmed, she clutched at him. He\u2019d gone gray as the sky, and suddenly looked horribly old. \u201cAre you ill, Da? Let me get you back into the lorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was vital, for reasons he didn\u2019t know, that he stand here, just here at the farthest tip of his country, and finish what he\u2019d begun. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just a twinge is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freezing.\u201d Indeed, his wiry body felt like little more than a bag of icy bones in her hands.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d His voice was sharp. \u201cDon\u2019t let anything stop you from going where you need to go, from doing what you need to do. Make your mark on the world, and make it deep so it lasts. But don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa!\u201d Panic bubbled inside her as he staggered, fell to his knees. \u201cOh God, Da, what is it? Your heart?\u201d</p><p>No, not his heart, he thought through a haze of bleary pain. For he could hear that beating hard and fast in his own ears. But he felt something inside him breaking, bursting and slipping away. \u201cDon\u2019t harden yourself, Maggie. Promise me. You\u2019ll never lose what\u2019s inside you. You\u2019ll take care of your sister. And your mother. You\u2019ll promise me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get up.\u201d She dragged at him, fighting off fear. The thrash of the sea sounded now like a storm breaking, a nightmare storm that would sweep them both off the cliff and onto the spearing rocks. \u201cDo you hear me, Da? You\u2019ve got to get up now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I promise. I swear it before God, I\u2019ll see to both of them, always.\u201d Her teeth were chattering; stinging tears already ran down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI need a priest,\u201d he gasped out.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you need only to get out of this cold.\u201d But she knew it was a lie as she said it. He was slipping away from her; no more how tightly she held his body, what was inside him was slipping away. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me like this. Not like this.\u201d Desperate, she scanned the fields, the beaten paths where people walked year after year to stand as they had stood. But there was nothing, no one, so she bit back a scream for help. \u201cTry, Da, come and try now to get up. We\u2019ll get you to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>He rested his head on her shoulder and sighed. There was no pain now, only numbness. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he said. Then he whispered another name, a stranger\u2019s name, and that was all.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d As if to protect him from the wind he no longer felt, she wrapped her arms tight around him, rocking, rocking, rocking as she sobbed.</p><p>And the wind trumpeted down to the sea and brought with it the first needles of icy rain.</p><p>Chapter Two </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THOMAS Concannon\u2019s wake would be talked about for years. There was fine food and fine music, as he\u2019d planned for his daughter\u2019s celebration party. The house where he\u2019d lived out his last years was crowded with people.</p><p>Tom hadn\u2019t been a rich man, some would say, but he was a man who\u2019d been wealthy in friends.</p><p>They came from the village, and the village beyond that. From the farms and shops and cottages. They brought food, as neighbors do for such occasions, and the kitchen was quickly stocked with breads and meats and cakes. They drank to his life and serenaded his passing.</p><p>The fires burned warm to stave off the gale that rattled the windows and the chill of mourning.</p> <p>But Maggie was sure she\u2019d never be warm again. She sat near the fire in the tidy parlor while the company filled the house around her. In the flames she saw the cliffs, the boiling sea\u2014and herself, alone, holding her dying father.</p><p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she turned and saw Murphy crouched in front of her. He pressed a steaming mug into her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly whiskey, with a bit of tea to warm it up.\u201d His eyes were kind and grieving. \u201cDrink it down now. There\u2019s a girl. Won\u2019t you eat a little? It would do you good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, but did as he asked and drank. She\u2019d have sworn she felt each fiery drop slide down her throat. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken him out there, Murphy. I should have seen he was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense, and you know it. He looked fine and fit when he left the pub. Why, he\u2019d been dancing, hadn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Dancing, she thought. She\u2019d danced with her father on the day he died. Would she, someday, find comfort in that? \u201cBut if we hadn\u2019t been so far away. So alone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor told you plain, Maggie. It would have made no difference. The aneurysm killed him, and it was mercifully quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it was quick.\u201d Her hand trembled, so she drank again. It was the time afterward that had been slow. The dreadful time when she had driven his body away from the sea, with her breath wheezing in her throat and her hands frozen on the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man so proud as he was of you.\u201d Murphy hesitated, looked down at his hands. \u201cHe was like a second father to me, Maggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that.\u201d She reached out, brushed Murphy\u2019s hair off his brow. \u201cSo did he.\u201d</p><p>So now he\u2019d lost a father twice, Murphy thought. And for the second time felt the weight of grief and responsibility.</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you, to make sure you know, that if there\u2019s anything, anything a\u2019tall you\u2019re needing, or your family needs, you\u2019ve only to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good of you to say so, and to mean it.\u201d</p><p>He looked up again; his eyes, that wild Celtic blue, met hers. \u201cI know it was hard when he had to sell the land. And hard that I was the one to buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maggie set the mug aside and laid her hands over his. \u201cThe land wasn\u2019t important to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have blamed a saint for buying it,\u201d Maggie said briskly. \u201cEven though the money it brought put food in her mouth. I tell you it was easier that it was you. Brie and I don\u2019t begrudge you a blade of grass, that\u2019s the truth, Murphy.\u201d She made herself smile at him, because they both needed it. \u201cYou\u2019ve done what he couldn\u2019t, and what he simply didn\u2019t want to do. You\u2019ve made the land grow. Let\u2019s not hear any more talk like that.\u201d</p> <p>She looked around then, as if she\u2019d just walked out of an empty room into a full one. Someone was playing the flute, and O\u2019Malley\u2019s daughter, heavy with her first child, was singing a light, dreamy air. There was a trill of laughter from across the room, lively and free. A baby was crying. Men were huddled here and there, talking of Tom, and of the weather, of Jack Marley\u2019s sick roan mare and the Donovans\u2019 leaking cottage roof.</p><p>The women talked of Tom as well, and of the weather, of children and of weddings and wakes.</p><p>She saw an old woman, an elderly and distant cousin, in worn shoes and mended stockings, spinning a story for a group of wide-eyed youngsters while she knitted a sweater.</p><p>\u201cHe loved having people around, you know.\u201d The pain was there, throbbing like a wound in her voice. \u201cHe would have filled the house with them daily if he could. It was always a wonder to him that I preferred to be on my own.\u201d She drew in a breath and hoped her voice was casual. \u201cDid you ever hear him speak of someone named Amanda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda?\u201d Murphy frowned and considered. \u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I probably mistook it.\u201d She shrugged it away. Surely her father\u2019s dying words hadn\u2019t been a strange woman\u2019s name. \u201cI should go help Brie in the kitchen. Thanks for the drink, Murphy. And for the rest.\u201d She kissed him and rose.</p><p>There was no easy way to get through the room, of course. She had to stop again and again, to hear words of comfort, or a quick story about her father, or in the case of Tim O\u2019Malley, to offer comfort herself.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I\u2019ll miss him,\u201d Tim said, unabashedly wiping his eyes. \u201cNever had a friend as dear to me, and never will again. He joked about opening a pub of his own, you know. Giving me a bit of competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She also knew it hadn\u2019t been a joke, but another dream.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to be a poet,\u201d someone else put in while Maggie hugged Tim and patted his back. \u201cSaid he\u2019d only lacked the words to be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had the heart of a poet,\u201d Tim said brokenly. \u201cThe heart and soul of one, to be sure. A finer man never walked this earth than Tom Concannon.\u201d</p><p>Maggie had words with the priest about funeral services set for the next morning, and finally slipped into the kitchen.</p><p>It was as crowded as the rest of the house, with women busily serving food or making it. The sounds and smells were of life here\u2014kettles singing, soups simmering, a ham baking. Children wandered underfoot, so that women\u2014with that uncanny maternal grace they seemed to be born with\u2014dodged around them or scooped them up as needs demanded.</p><p>The wolfhound puppy that Tom had given Brianna on her last birthday snored contentedly under the kitchen table. Brianna herself was at the stove, her face composed, her hands competent. Maggie could see the subtle signs of grief in the quiet eyes and the soft, unsmiling mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a plate.\u201d One of the neighbor women spotted Maggie and began to heap food together. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll eat or answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only came in to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll help by eating some of this food. Enough for an army it is. You know your father once sold me a rooster. Claimed it was the finest c**k in the county and would keep me hens happy for years to come. He had a way with him, Tom did, that made you believe what he was saying even though you knew it for nonsense.\u201d She piled great portions of food on the plate as she spoke, taking time out to pat a child out of the way without breaking rhythm. \u201cWell, a terrible, mean bird he turned out to be, and never crew once in his miserable life.\u201d</p><p>Maggie smiled a bit and said what was expected of her, though she knew the tale well. \u201cAnd what did you do with the rooster Da sold you, Mrs. Mayo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wrung the cursed cock\u2019s neck and boiled him into stew. Gave your father a bowl of it, too, I did. Said he\u2019d never tasted better in his whole life.\u201d She laughed heartily and pressed the plate on Maggie.</p><p>\u201cAnd was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe meat was stringy and tough as old leather. But Tom ate every drop. Bless him.\u201d</p><p>So Maggie ate, because there was nothing she could do but live and go on. She listened to the stories and told some of her own. When the sun went down and the kitchen slowly emptied, she sat down and held the puppy in her lap.</p><p>\u201cHe was loved,\u201d Maggie said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was.\u201d Brianna stood beside the stove, a cloth in her hand and a dazed look in her eyes. There was no one left to feed or tend to, nothing to keep her mind and her hands busy. Grief swarmed into her heart like angry bees. To hold it off awhile longer, she began to put away the dishes.</p><p>She was slim, almost willowy, with a cool, controlled way of moving. If there had been money and means, she might have been a dancer. Her hair, rosy gold and thick, was neatly coiled at the nape of her neck. A white apron covered her plain black dress.</p><p>In contrast, Maggie\u2019s hair was a fiery tangle around her face. She wore a skirt she\u2019d forgotten to press and a sweater that needed mending.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t clear for tomorrow.\u201d Brianna had forgotten the dishes in her hands and stared out the window at the blustery night.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t. But people will come, just the same, as they did today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have them back here after. There\u2019s so much food. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do with all of it....\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cDid she ever come out of her room?\u201d</p><p>Brianna stood still for a moment, then began slowly to stack plates. \u201cShe\u2019s not well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, don\u2019t. Her husband\u2019s dead and everyone who knew him came here today. She can\u2019t even stir herself to pretend it matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters to her.\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice tightened. She didn\u2019t think she could bear an argument now, not when her heart was swelling up like a tumor in her chest. \u201cShe lived with him more than twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd little else she did with him. Why do you defend her? Even now.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s hand pressed a plate so hard she wondered it didn\u2019t snap in two. Her voice remained perfectly calm, perfectly reasonable. \u201cI\u2019m defending no one, only saying what\u2019s true. Can\u2019t we keep peace? At least until we\u2019ve buried him, can\u2019t we keep peace in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been peace in this house.\u201d Maeve spoke from the doorway. Her face wasn\u2019t ravaged by tears, but it was cold and hard and unforgiving. \u201cHe saw to that. He saw to it just as he\u2019s seeing to it now. Even dead, he\u2019s making my life a hardship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak of him.\u201d The fury Maggie had held back all day broke through, a jagged rock through fragile glass. She shoved away from the table, sending the dog racing for cover. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare to speak ill of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak how I choose.\u201d Maeve\u2019s hand clutched at the shawl she wore, drew it tight to her throat. It was wool, and she\u2019d always wanted silk. \u201cHe gave me nothing but grief while he lived. Now he\u2019s dead and has given me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no tears in your eyes, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t. I\u2019ll neither live nor die a hypocrite, but speak God\u2019s own truth. He\u2019ll go to the devil for what\u2019s he\u2019s done to me this day.\u201d Her eyes, bitter and blue, shifted from Maggie to Brianna. \u201cAnd as God won\u2019t forgive him, neither will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know God\u2019s mind now?\u201d Maggie demanded. \u201cHas all your prayerbook reading and rosary clacking given you a line straight to the Lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not blaspheme.\u201d Maeve\u2019s cheeks reddened with temper. \u201cYou\u2019ll not blaspheme in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak how I choose.\u201d Maggie echoed her mother\u2019s words with a tight smile. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you Tom Concannon needed none of your stingy forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Though her insides were trembling, Brianna laid a steadying hand on Maggie\u2019s shoulder. She took a long, careful breath to be certain her voice was calm. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, Mother, I\u2019ll give the house to you. You\u2019ve nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Maggie turned to her sister. \u201cWhat about the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard what it said at the will reading,\u201d Brianna began, but Maggie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take any of it in. Lawyer\u2019s talk. I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left it to her.\u201d Still trembling, Maeve lifted a finger and jabbed it out as an accusation. \u201cHe left the house to her. All the years I suffered and sacrificed, and he takes even that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll settle down right enough when she knows she has a sturdy roof over her head and no need to do anything to keep it,\u201d Maggie said once her mother left the room.</p><p>It was true enough. And Brianna thought she could maintain the peace. She\u2019d had a lifetime of practice. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the house, and she\u2019ll stay here. I can tend them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint Brianna,\u201d Maggie murmured, but there was no malice in it. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage it between us.\u201d The new furnace would have to wait, she decided. But as long as McGuinness kept buying, there would be enough to hold the two houses together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about...Da and I talked about it a little while ago, and I\u2019ve been thinking....\u201d Brianna hesitated.</p><p>Maggie pushed aside her own thoughts. \u201cJust say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needs some fixing up, I know, and I\u2019ve only a bit left of what Gran left me\u2014and there\u2019s the lien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be paying off the lien.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly right.\u201d Maggie got up to fetch the teapot. \u201cHe took it to send me to Venice, didn\u2019t he? Mortgaged the house and weathered the gale Mother brought down on his head for doing it. I had three years of training thanks to him. And I\u2019ll pay it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is mine.\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice firmed. \u201cAnd so\u2019s the lien.\u201d</p><p>Her sister had a soft look about her, but Maggie knew Brianna could be mule stubborn when it suited her. \u201cWell, we can argue that to death. We\u2019ll both pay it off. If you won\u2019t let me do it for you, Brie, let me do it for him. I\u2019ve a need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work it out.\u201d Brianna took the cup of tea Maggie poured her.</p> <p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d It felt foolish. She could only hope it didn\u2019t sound so. \u201cI want to turn the house into a B-and-B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hotel!\u201d Stunned, Maggie could only stare. \u201cYou want to have paying guests nosing about the place? You\u2019ll have no privacy at all, Brianna, and you\u2019ll be working from morning till night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like having people around,\u201d Brianna said coolly. \u201cNot everyone wants to be a hermit like you. And I\u2019ve a knack for it, I think, for making people comfortable. It\u2019s in the blood.\u201d She stuck out her chin. \u201cGranda ran a hotel, didn\u2019t he, and Gran ran it after he died. I could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you couldn\u2019t, I just for the life of me can\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to. Strangers in and out every day.\u201d Why, it gave her the shudders just to imagine it.</p><p>\u201cI can only hope they\u2019ll come. The bedrooms upstairs will need freshening, of course.\u201d Brianna\u2019s eyes blurred as she thought through the details. \u201cSome paint, some paper. A new rug or two. And the plumbing needs work, God knows. The fact is, we\u2019d need another bath altogether, but I think the closet down at the end of the hall upstairs would serve. I might have a little apartment added off the kitchen here, for Mother\u2014so she won\u2019t be disturbed. And I\u2019d add a bit to the gardens, put up a little sign. Nothing on a grand scale, you see. Just small and tasteful and comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want this,\u201d Maggie murmured, seeing the light in her sister\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou truly do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yes. I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d Maggie grabbed her hands. \u201cJust do it, Brie. Freshen your rooms and fix your plumbing. Put up a fine sign. He wanted it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he did. He laughed when I talked to him about it, in that big way he had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he had a grand laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he kissed me and joked about me being an innkeeper\u2019s granddaughter, and following tradition. If I started small enough, I could open for summer this year. The tourists, they come to the west counties in the summer especially, and they look for a nice, comfortable place to spend the night. I could\u2014\u201d Brianna shut her eyes. \u201cOh, listen to this talk, and we\u2019re burying our father tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what he\u2019d want to hear.\u201d Maggie was able to smile again. \u201cA grand scheme like that, he\u2019d have cheered you on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe Concannons.\u201d Brianna shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re great ones for scheming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrianna, that day on the cliff, he talked of you. He called you his rose. He\u2019d want you to bloom.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d been his star, Maggie thought. She was going to do whatever she could to shine.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>SHE was alone\u2014as she liked best. From the doorway of her cottage she watched the rain lashing Murphy Muldoon\u2019s fields, slashing wildly over the grass and stone while the sun beamed hopefully, stubbornly, behind her. There was the possibility of a dozen different weathers in the layered sky, all brief and fickle.</p><p>That was Ireland.</p><p>But for Margaret Mary Concannon, the rain was a fine thing. She often preferred it to the warm slant of sun and the clear brilliance of cloudless blue skies. The rain was a soft gray curtain, tucking her away from the world. Or more important, cutting out the world, beyond her view of hill and field and sleek spotted cows.</p><p>For while the farm, the stone fences and green grasses beyond the tangle of fuchsia no longer belonged to Maggie or her family, this spot with its small wild garden and damp spring air was her own.</p><p>She was a farmer\u2019s daughter, true enough. But no farmer was she. In the five years since her father\u2019s death, she\u2019d set about making her own place\u2014and the mark he\u2019d asked her to make. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t so deep as yet, but she continued to sell what she made, in Galway now and Cork, as well as Ennis.</p><p>She needed nothing more than what she had. Wanted more, perhaps, but she knew that desires, no matter how deep and dragging, didn\u2019t pay the bills. She also knew that some ambitions, when realized, carried a heavy price.</p><p>If from time to time she grew frustrated or restless, she had only to remind herself that she was where she needed to be, and doing what she chose to do.</p><p>But on mornings like this, with the rain and the sun at war, she thought of her father, and of the dreams he\u2019d never seen come true.</p><p>He\u2019d died without wealth, without success and without the farm that had been plowed and harvested by Concannon hands for generations.</p><p>She didn\u2019t resent the fact that so much of her birthright had been sold off for taxes and debts and the high-blown fantasies of her father. Perhaps there was a tug of sentiment and regret for the hillocks and fields she had once raced over with all the arrogance and innocence of youth. But that was past. Indeed, she wanted no part of the working of it, the worrying over it. She had little of the love of growing things that stirred her sister, Brianna. True, she enjoyed her garden, the big defiant blooms and the scents that wafted from them. But the flowers grew despite her periods of neglect.</p><p>She had her place, and anything beyond it was out of her realm, and therefore, most usually, out of her mind. Maggie preferred needing no one, and certainly needing nothing she could not provide herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dependence, she knew, and the longing for more than what you had, led to unhappiness and discontent. She had her parents\u2019 example before her.</p><p>Pausing there, just past the open door into the chilling rain, she breathed in the air, the damp sweetness of it tinged with spring from the blackthorn blossoms that formed a hedgerow to the east and the early roses struggling into bloom to the west. She was a small woman, shapely beneath the baggy jeans and flannel shirt. Over her shoulder-length, fiery hair she wore a slouch hat, as gray as the rain. Beneath its bill her eyes were the moody, mystical green of the sea.</p><p>The rain dampened her face, the soft curve of cheek and chin, the wide, melancholy mouth. It dewed the creamy redhead\u2019s complexion and joined the gold freckles scattered over the bridge of her nose.</p><p>She drank the strong sweet breakfast tea from a glass mug of her own design and ignored the phone that had begun to shrill from the kitchen. Ignoring the summons was as much policy as habit, particularly when her mind was drifting toward her work. There was a sculpture forming in her head, as clear as a raindrop, she thought. Pure and smooth, with glass flowing into glass in the heart of it.</p> <p>The pull of the vision beckoned. Dismissing the ringing phone, she walked through the rain toward her workshop and the soothing roar of the glass furnace.</p><p>From his offices in Dublin, Rogan Sweeney listened to the ring of the phone through the receiver and swore. He was a busy man, too busy to waste his time on a rude and temperamental artist who refused to answer the sharp knock of opportunity.</p><p>He had businesses to see to, calls to answer, files to read, figures to tally. He should, while the day was young, go down to the gallery and oversee the latest shipment. The Native American pottery was, after all, his baby, and he\u2019d spent months selecting the best of the best.</p><p>But that, of course, was a challenge already met. That particular show would once again ensure that Worldwide was a top international gallery. Meanwhile the woman, the damn, stubborn Clarewoman, was crowding his mind. Though he\u2019d yet to meet her face-to-face, she and her genius occupied too much of his mind.</p><p>The new shipment would, of course, receive as much of his skill, energy and time as it required. But a new artist, particularly one whose work had so completely captured his imagination, excited on a different level. The thrill of discovery was as vital to Rogan as the careful development, marketing and sale of an artist\u2019s works.</p> <p>He wanted Concannon, exclusively, for Worldwide Galleries. As with most of his desires, all of which Rogan deemed quite reasonable, he wouldn\u2019t rest until it was accomplished.</p><p>He\u2019d been raised to succeed\u2014the third generation of prosperous merchants who found clever ways to turn pence into pounds. The business his grandfather had founded sixty years before flourished under his leadership\u2014because Rogan Sweeney refused to take no for an answer. He would achieve his goals by sweat, by charm, by tenacity or any other means he deemed suitable.</p><p>Margaret Mary Concannon and her unbridled talent was his newest and most frustrating goal.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t an unreasonable man in his own mind, and would have been shocked and insulted to discover that he was described as just that by many of his acquaintances. If he expected long hours and hard work from his employees, he expected no less of himself. Drive and dedication weren\u2019t merely virtues to Rogan, they were necessities that had been bred in his bones.</p><p>He could have handed the reins of Worldwide over to a manager and lived quite comfortably on the proceeds. Then he could travel, not for business but for pleasure, enjoying the fruits of his inheritance without sweating over the harvesting.</p><p>He could have, but his responsibility and thirsty ambition were his birthrights.</p> <p>And M. M. Concannon, glass artist, hermit and eccentric was his obsession.</p><p>He was going to make changes in Worldwide Galleries, changes that would reflect his own vision, that would celebrate his own country. M. M. Concannon was his first step, and he\u2019d be damned if her stubbornness would make him stumble.</p><p>She was unaware\u2014because she refused to listen, Rogan thought grimly\u2014that he intended to make her Worldwide\u2019s first native Irish star. In the past, with his father and grandfather at the helm, the galleries had specialized in international art. Rogan didn\u2019t intend to narrow the scope, but he did intend to shift the focus and give the world the best of the land of his birth.</p><p>He would risk both his money and his reputation to do it.</p><p>If his first artist was a success, as he fully intended her to be, his investment would have paid off, his instincts would have been justified and his dream, a new gallery that showcased works exclusively by Irish artists, would become reality.</p><p>To begin, he wanted Margaret Mary Concannon.</p><p>Annoyed with himself, he rose from his antique oak desk to stand by the window. The city stretched out before him, its broad streets and green squares, the silver glint that was the river and the bridges that spanned it.</p><p>Below, traffic moved in a steady stream, laborers and tourists merging on the street in a colorful stream in the sunlight. They seemed very distant to him now as they strolled in packs or twosomes. He watched a young couple embrace, a casual linking of arms, meeting of lips. Both wore backpacks and expressions of giddy delight.</p> <p>He turned away, stung by an odd little arrow of envy.</p><p>He was unused to feeling restless, as he was now. There was work on his desk, appointments in his book, yet he turned to neither. Since childhood he\u2019d moved with purpose from education to profession, from success to success. As had been expected of him. As he had expected of himself.</p><p>He\u2019d lost both of his parents seven years before when his father had suffered a heart attack behind the wheel of his car and had smashed into a utility pole. He could still remember the grim panic, and the almost dreamy disbelief, that had cloaked him during the flight from Dublin to London, where his mother and father had traveled for business and the horrible, sterile scent of hospital.</p><p>His father had died on impact. His mother had lived barely an hour longer. So they had both been gone before he\u2019d arrived, long before he\u2019d been able to accept it. But they\u2019d taught him a great deal before he\u2019d lost them\u2014about family and pride of heritage, the love of art, the love of business and how to combine them.</p><p>At twenty-six he\u2019d found himself the head of Worldwide and its subsidiaries, responsible for staff, for decisions, for the art placed in his hands. For seven years he\u2019d worked not only to make the business grow, but to make it shine. It had been more than enough for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This unsettled sensation, the dilemma of it, he knew had its roots in the breezy winter afternoon when he had first seen Maggie Concannon\u2019s work.</p><p>That first piece, spied during an obligatory tea with his grandmother, had started him on this odyssey to possess\u2014no, he thought, uncomfortable with the word. To control, he corrected, he wanted to control the fate of the artistry, and the career of the artist. Since that afternoon, he\u2019d been able to buy only two pieces of her work. One was as delicate as a daydream, a slim almost weightless column riddled with shimmering rainbows and hardly larger than the span of his hand from wrist to fingertip.</p><p>The second, and the one he could admit privately haunted and enticed him, was a violent nightmare, fired from a passionate mind into a turbulent tangle of glass. It should have been unbalanced, he thought now as he studied the piece on his desk. It should have been ugly with its wild war of colors and shapes, the grasping tendrils curling and clawing out of the squat base.</p><p>Instead, it was fascinating and uncomfortably sexual. And it made him wonder what kind of woman could create both pieces with equal skill and power.</p> <p>Since he had purchased it a little more than two months before, he had tried with no success to contact the artist and interest her in patronage.</p><p>He had twice reached her by phone, but the conversation on her part had been brief to the point of rudeness. She didn\u2019t require a patron, particularly a Dublin businessman with too much education and too little taste.</p><p>Oh, that had stung.</p><p>She was, she had told him in her musical west county brogue, content to create at her own pace and sell her work when and where it suited her. She had no need for his contracts, or for someone to tell her what must be sold. It was her work, was it not, so why didn\u2019t he go back to his ledgers, of which she was certain he had plenty, and leave her to it?</p><p>Insolent little twit, he thought, firing up again. Here he was offering a helping hand, a hand that countless other artists would have begged for, and she snarled at it.</p> <p>He should leave her to it, Rogan mused. Leave her to create in obscurity. It was certain that neither he nor Worldwide needed her.</p><p>But, damn it all, he wanted her.</p><p>On impulse, he picked up his phone and buzzed his secretary. \u201cEileen, cancel my appointments for the next couple of days. I\u2019m going on a trip.\u201d</p><p>It was a rare thing for Rogan to have business in the west counties. He remembered a family holiday from childhood. Most usually his parents had preferred trips to Paris or Milan, or an occasional break in the villa they kept on the French Mediterranean. There had been trips that had combined business and pleasure. New York, London, Bonn, Venice, Boston. But once, when he had been nine or ten, they had driven to the Shannon area to take in the wild, glorious scenery of the west. He remembered it in patches, the dizzying views from the Cliffs of Mohr, the dazzling panoramas and gem-bright waters of the Lake District, the quiet villages and the endless green of farmlands.</p><p>Beautiful it was. But it was also inconvenient. He was already regretting his impulsive decision to make the drive, particularly since the directions he\u2019d been given in the nearby village had taken him onto a pitted excuse for a road. His Aston Martin handled it well, even as the dirt turned to mud under the ceaseless driving rain. His mood didn\u2019t negotiate the potholes as smoothly as did his car.</p><p>Only stubbornness kept him from turning back. The woman would listen to reason, by God. He would see to it. If she wanted to bury herself behind hedges of furze and hawthorn, it was her business. But her art was his. Or would be.</p> <p>Following the directions he\u2019d been given at the local post office, he passed the bed-and-breakfast called Blackthorn Cottage with its glorious gardens and trim blue shutters. Farther on there were stone cabins, sheds for animals, a hay barn, a slate-roofed shed where a man worked on a tractor.</p><p>The man lifted a hand in salute, then went back to work as Rogan maneuvered the car around the narrow curve. The farmer was the first sign of life, other than livestock, he had seen since leaving the village.</p><p>How anyone survived in this godforsaken place was beyond him. He\u2019d take Dublin\u2019s crowded streets and conveniences over the incessant rain and endless fields every day of the week. Scenery be damned.</p><p>She\u2019d hidden herself well, he thought. He\u2019d barely caught sight of the garden gate and the whitewashed cottage beyond it through the tumbling bushes of privet and fuchsia.</p><p>Rogan slowed, though he\u2019d nearly been at a crawl in any case. There was a short drive occupied by a faded blue lorry going to rust. He pulled his dashing white Aston behind it and got out.</p><p>He circled around to the gate, moved down the short walk that cut between heavy-headed, brilliant flowers that bobbed in the rain. He gave the door, which was painted a bold magenta, three sharp raps, then three again before impatience had him stalking to a window to peer inside.</p><p>There was a fire burning low in the grate, and a sugan chair pulled up close. A sagging sofa covered in some wild floral print that mated reds and blues and purples teetered in a corner. He would have thought he\u2019d mistaken the house but for the pieces of her work set throughout the small room. Statues and bottles, vases and bowls stood, sat or reclined on every available surface.</p><p>Rogan wiped the wet from the window and spied the many-branch candelabra positioned dead center of the mantel. It was fashioned of glass so clear, so pure, it might have been water frozen in place. The arms curved fluidly up, the base a waterfall. He felt the quick surge, the inner click that presaged acquisition.</p> <p>Oh yes, he\u2019d found her.</p><p>Now if she\u2019d just answer the damn door.</p><p>He gave up on the front and walked through the wet grass around to the back of the cabin. More flowers, growing wild as weeds. Or, he corrected, growing wild with weeds. Miss Concannon obviously didn\u2019t spend much time tidying her beds.</p><p>There was a lean-to beside the door under which bricks of turf were piled. An ancient bike with one flat tire was propped beside them along with a pair of Wellingtons that were muddy to the ankles.</p><p>He started to knock again when the sound coming from behind him had him turning toward the sheds. The roar, constant and low, was almost like the sea. He could see the smoke pluming out of the chimney into the leaden sky.</p><p>The building had several windows, and despite the chilly damp of the day, some were propped open. Her workshop, no doubt, Rogan thought, and crossed to it, pleased that he had tracked her down and confident of the outcome of their meeting.</p><p>He knocked and, though he received no answer, shoved the door open. He had a moment to register the blast of heat, the sharp smells and the small woman seated in a big wooden chair, a long pipe in her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thought of fairies and magic spells.</p><p>\u201cClose the door, damn you, there\u2019s a draft.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed automatically, bristling under the sharp fury of the order. \u201cYour windows are open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVentilation. Draft. Idiot.\u201d She said nothing more, nor did she spare him so much as a glance. She set her mouth to the pipe and blew.</p> <p>He watched the bubble form, fascinated despite himself. Such a simple procedure, he thought, only breath and molten glass. Her fingers worked on the pipe, turning it and turning it, fighting gravity, using it, until she was satisfied with the shape.</p><p>She thought nothing of him at all as she went about her work. She necked the bubble, using jacks to indent a shallow grove just beyond the head of the pipe. There were steps, dozens of them yet to take, but she could already see the finished work as clearly as if she held it cool and solid in her hand.</p><p>At the furnace, she pushed the bubble under the surface of the molten glass heated there to make the second gather. Back at the bench she rolled the gather in a wooden block to chill the glass and form the \u201cskin.\u201d All the while the pipe was moving, moving, steady and controlled by her hands, just as the initial stages of the work had been controlled by her breath.</p><p>She repeated the same procedure over and over again, endlessly patient, completely focused while Rogan stood by the door and watched. She used larger blocks for forming as the shape grew. And as time passed and she spoke not a word, he took off his wet coat and waited.</p><p>The room was filled with heat from the furnace. It felt as though his clothes were steaming on his body. She seemed sublimely unaffected, centered on her work, reaching for a new tool now and then while one hand constantly revolved the pipe.</p> <p>The chair on which she sat was obviously homemade, with a deep seat and long arms, hooks set here and there where tools hung. There were buckets nearby filled with water or sand or hot wax.</p><p>She took a tool, one that looked to Rogan to be a pair of sharp-pointed tongs, and placed them at the edge of the vessel she was creating. It seemed they would flow straight through, the glass so resembled water, but she drew the shape of it out, lengthening it, slimming it.</p><p>When she rose again, he started to speak, but a sound from her, something like a snarl, had him lifting a brow and keeping his silence.</p><p>Fine then, he thought. He could be patient. An hour, two hours, as long as it took. If she could stand this vicious heat, so, by Christ, could he.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even feel it, so intent was she. She dipped a punt, another gather of molten glass, onto the side of the vessel she was creating. When the hot glass had softened the wall, she pushed a pointed file, coated with wax, into the glass.</p><p>Gently, gently.</p> <p>Flames sparked under her hand as the wax burned. She had to work quickly now to keep the tool from sticking to the glass. The pressure had to be exactly right for the effect she wanted. The inner wall made contact with the outer wall, merging, creating the inner form, the angel swing.</p><p>Glass within glass, transparent and fluid.</p><p>She nearly smiled.</p><p>Carefully, she reblew the form before flattening the bottom with a paddle. She attached the vessel to a hot pontil. She plunged a file into a bucket of water, dripping it onto the neck groove of her vessel. Then, with a stroke that made Rogan jolt, she struck the file against the blowpipe. With the vessel now attached to the pontil, she thrust it into the furnace to heat the lip. Taking the vessel to the annealing oven, she rapped the pontil sharply with a file to break the seal.</p><p>She set the time and the temperature, then walked directly to a small refrigerator.</p><p>It was low to the floor, so she was forced to bend down. Rogan tilted his head at the view. The baggy jeans were beginning to wear quite thin in several interesting places. She straightened, turned and tossed one of the two soft-drink cans she taken out in his direction.</p><p>Rogan caught the missile by blind instinct before it connected with his nose.</p><p>\u201cStill here?\u201d She popped the top on her can and drank deeply. \u201cYou must be roasting in that suit.\u201d Now that her work was out of her mind and her eyes clear of the visions of it, she studied him.</p> <p>Tall, lean, dark. She drank again. Well styled hair as black as a raven\u2019s wing and eyes as blue as a Kerry lake. Not hard to look at, she mused, tapping a finger against the can as they stared at each other. He had a good mouth, nicely sculpted and generous. But she didn\u2019t think he used it often for smiling. Not with those eyes. As blue as they were, and as appealing, they were cool, calculating and confident.</p><p>A sharply featured face with good bones. Good bones, good breeding, her granny used to say. And this one, unless she was very mistaken, had blue blood beneath the bone.</p><p>The suit was tailored, probably English. The tie discreet. There was a wink of gold at his cuffs. And he stood like a soldier\u2014the sort that had earned plenty of brass and braid.</p><p>She smiled at him, content to be friendly now that her work had gone well. \u201cAre you lost then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The smile made her look like a pixie, one capable of all sorts of magic and mischief. He preferred the scowl she\u2019d worn while she\u2019d worked. \u201cI\u2019ve come a long way to speak with you, Miss Concannon. I\u2019m Rogan Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>Her smile tilted a few degrees into something closer to a sneer. Sweeney, she thought. The man who wanted to take over her work. \u201cThe jackeen.\u201d She used the term, not terribly flattering, for a Dubliner. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a stubborn one, Mr. Sweeney, that\u2019s the truth. I hope you had a pleasant drive so your trip won\u2019t be wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a miserable drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t consider the trip wasted.\u201d Though he would have preferred a strong cup of tea, he opened the soft-drink can. \u201cYou have an interesting setup here.\u201d</p><p>He scanned the room with its roaring furnace, its ovens and benches, the jumble of metal and wooden tools, the rods, the pipes and the shelves and cupboards he imagined held her chemicals.</p><p>\u201cI do well enough, as I believe I told you over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat piece you were working on when I came in. It was lovely.\u201d He stepped over to a table cluttered with sketch pads, pencils, charcoal and chalk. He picked up a sketch of the glass sculpture now annealing. It was delicate, fluid.</p><p>\u201cDo you sell your sketches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a glass artist, Mr. Sweeney, not a painter.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look, set the sketch down again. \u201cIf you were to sign that, I could get a hundred pounds for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let out a snort of disbelief and tossed her empty can into a waste bin.</p><p>\u201cAnd the piece you\u2019ve just finished?

No one could tell her the worth of her work, not even herself. But a price\u2014a price had to be set. She knew that well. For, artist or not, she had to eat.</p><p>Her formula for figuring price was loose and flexible. Unlike her formulas for making glass and mixing colors it had very little to do with science. She would calculate the time spent on producing the piece, her own feelings toward it, then factor in her opinion of the purchaser.</p><p>Her opinion of Rogan Sweeney was going to cost him dear.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred and fifty pounds,\u201d she decided. A hundred of that was due to his gold cuff links.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you a check.\u201d Then he smiled, and Maggie realized she was grateful he didn\u2019t seem to use that particular weapon often. Lethal, she thought, watching the way his lips curved, his eyes darkened. Charm floated down on him, light and effortless as a cloud. \u201cAnd though I\u2019ll add it to my personal collection\u2014for sentiment, shall we say?\u2014I could easily get double that for it at my gallery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Tis a wonder you stay in business, Mr. Sweeney, soaking your clients that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate yourself, Miss Concannon.\u201d He crossed to her then, as if he knew he\u2019d suddenly gained the upper hand. He waited until she\u2019d tipped her head back to keep her eyes level with his. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d He lifted an arm to encompass the room. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that quite dramatically for myself. But the business world is a different matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he told her, smiling again as if she\u2019d answered a particularly thorny question. \u201cI, on the other hand, am fascinated by it.\u201d</p> <p>She was at a disadvantage, sitting on the bench with him hovering over her. And she didn\u2019t care for it. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone messing in my work, Mr. Sweeney. I do what I choose, when I choose, and I get along very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do what you choose, when you choose.\u201d He picked up a wooden form from the bench as if to admire the grain. \u201cAnd you do it very well. What a loss it would be for someone with your talent to merely get along. As to...messing about with your work, I have no intention of doing so. Though watching you work was certainly interesting.\u201d His eyes cut from the mold back to her with a speed that made her jolt. \u201cVery interesting.\u201d</p><p>She pushed off the bench, the better to stand on her own feet. To gain the room required, she shoved him aside. \u201cI don\u2019t want a manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you need one, Margaret Mary. You need one badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot you know about what I\u2019d be needing,\u201d she mumbled, and began to pace. \u201cSome Dublin sharpie with fancy shoes.\u201d</p><p>Twice as much, he\u2019d said; her mind replayed his earlier words. Twice what she\u2019d asked. And there was Mother to care for, and the bills to pay, and Sweet Jesus, the price of chemicals was murderous.</p><p>\u201cWhat I need\u2019s peace and quiet. And room.\u201d She whirled back at him. His very presense in the studio was crowding her. \u201cRoom. I don\u2019t need someone like you coming along and telling me we need three vases for next week, or twenty paperweights, or a half dozen goblets with pink stems. I\u2019m not an assembly line, Sweeney, I\u2019m an artist.\u201d</p><p>Very calmly, he took a pad and a gold pen out of his pocket and began to write.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m noting down that you\u2019re not to be given orders for vases, paperweights or goblets with pink stems.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched once before she controlled it. \u201cI won\u2019t take orders, at all.</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers. \u201cI believe that\u2019s understood. I own a factory or two, Miss Concannon, and know the difference between an assembly line and art. I happen to make my living through both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine for you then.\u201d She waved both arms before setting her fists on her hips. \u201cCongratulations. Why would you be needing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He replaced the pen and pad. \u201cBut I want you.\u201d</p><p>Her chin angled up. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you need me. And there is where we\u2019ll complement each other. I\u2019ll make you a rich woman, Miss Concannon. And more than that, a famous one.\u201d</p><p>He saw something flicker in her eyes at that. Ah, he thought, ambition. And he turned the key easily in the lock. \u201cDo you create just to hide your gift on your own shelves and cupboards? To sell a few pieces here and there to keep the wolf from the door, and horde the rest? Or do you want your work appreciated, admired, even applauded?\u201d His voice changed, subtly, into a tone of sarcasm so light it stabbed bloodlessly. \u201cOr...are you afraid it won\u2019t be?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went molten as the blade struck true. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. My work stands. I spent three years apprenticing in a Venice glass house, sweating as a pontil boy. I learned the craft there, but not the art. Because the art is in me.\u201d She thumped a hand on her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s in me, and I breathe in and out into the glass. Any who don\u2019t like my work can jump straight into hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll give you a show at my gallery, and we\u2019ll see how many take the jump.\u201d</p><p>A dare, damn him. She hadn\u2019t been prepared for it. \u201cSo a bunch of art snobs can sniff around my work while they slurp champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are afraid.\u201d</p><p>She hissed through her teeth and stomped to the door. \u201cGo away. Go away so I can think. You\u2019re crowding my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk again in the morning.\u201d He picked up his coat. \u201cPerhaps you can recommend a place I could stay the night. Close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackthorn Cottage, at the end of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I saw it.\u201d He slipped into his coat. \u201cLovely garden, very trim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeat and tidy as a pin. You\u2019ll find the beds soft and the food good. My sister owns it, and she has a practical, homemaking soul.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted a brow at the tone, but said nothing. \u201cThen I trust I\u2019ll be comfortable enough until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get out.\u201d She pulled open the door to the rain. \u201cI\u2019ll call the cottage in the morning if I want to talk to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure meeting you, Miss Concannon.\u201d Though it wasn\u2019t offered, he took her hand, held it while he looked into her eyes. \u201cA greater one watching you work.\u201d On an impulse that surprised both of them, he lifted her hand to his lips, lingered just a moment over the taste of her skin. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for an invitation,\u201d she said, and closed the door smartly behind him.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>AT Blackthorn Cottage, the scones were always warm, the flowers always fresh and the kettle always on the boil. Though it was early in the season for guests, Brianna Concannon made Rogan comfortable in her serenely efficient manner, as she had all the other guests she\u2019s welcomed since that first summer after her father\u2019s death.</p><p>She served him tea in the tidy, polished parlor where a fire burned cheerfully and a vase full of freesia scented the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be serving dinner at seven, if that suits you, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d She was already thinking of ways to stretch the chicken she\u2019d planned to cook so it would feed one more.</p><p>\u201cThat will be fine, Miss Concannon.\u201d He sipped the tea and found it perfect, a far cry from the chilly, sugar-laden soft drink Maggie had tossed at him. \u201cYou have a lovely place here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It was, if not her only pride, perhaps her only joy. \u201cIf you need anything, anything at all, you\u2019ve only to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could make use of the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She started to step away to give him privacy, when he held up a hand, a signal of command to anyone who has served.</p><p>\u201cThe vase there on the table\u2014your sister\u2019s work?\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s surprise at the question showed only in the quick widening of her eyes. \u201cIt is, yes. You know of Maggie\u2019s work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I have two pieces myself. And I\u2019ve just purchased another even as it was made.\u201d He sipped his tea again, measuring Brianna. As different from Maggie as one piece of her work was from another. Which meant, he assumed, that they were the same somewhere beneath what the eye could see. \u201cI\u2019ve just come from her workshop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were in Maggie\u2019s workshop?\u201d Only true shock would have driven Brianna to ask a question of a guest with such a tone of disbelief. \u201cInside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it so dangerous, then?\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile crossed Brianna\u2019s face, lightening her features. \u201cYou seem to be alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough. Your sister is an immensely talented woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is.\u201d</p><p>Rogan recognized the same undercurrent of pride and annoyance in the statement as he had when Maggie had spoken of her sister. \u201cDo you have other pieces of hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. She brings them by when the mood strikes her. If you\u2019ll not be needing anything else at the moment, Mr. Sweeney, I\u2019ll see about dinner.\u201d</p><p>Alone, Rogan settled back with his excellent tea. An interesting pair, he thought, the Concannon sisters. Brianna was taller, slimmer and certainly more lovely than Maggie. Her hair was rose gold rather than flame and fell in soft curls to her shoulders. Her eyes were a wide, pale green, almost translucent. Quiet, he thought, even a trifle aloof, like her manner. Her features were finer, her limbs softer, and she\u2019d smelled of wildflowers rather than smoke and sweat.</p> <p>All in all she was much more the type of woman he found appealing.</p><p>Yet he found his thoughts trailing back to Maggie with her compact body, her moody eyes and her uncertain temper. Artists, he mused, with their egos and insecurities, needed guidance, a firm hand. He let his gaze roam over the rose-colored vase with its swirls of glass from base to lip. He was very much looking forward to guiding Maggie Concannon.</p><p>\u201cSo, is he here?\u201d Maggie slipped out of the rain into the warm, fragrant kitchen.</p><p>Brianna continued to peel potatoes. She\u2019d been expecting the visit. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweeney.\u201d Crossing to the counter, Maggie snatched a peeled carrot and bit in. \u201cTall, dark, handsome and rich as sin. You can\u2019t miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the parlor. You can take in a cup and join him for tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201d Maggie hitched herself up on the counter, crossed her ankles. \u201cWhat I wanted, Brie, love, is your opinion of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s polite and well-spoken.\u201d</p><p>Maggie rolled her eyes. \u201cSo\u2019s an altar boy in church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guest in my home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA paying one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve no intention,\u201d Brianna went on without pause, \u201cof gossiping about him behind his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint Brianna.\u201d Maggie crunched down on the carrot, gestured with the stub of it. \u201cWhat if I were to tell you that he\u2019s after managing my career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cManaging?\u201d Brianna\u2019s hands faltered before they picked on the rhythm again. Peelings fell steadily on the newspaper she\u2019d laid on the counter. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancially, to start. Displaying my work in his galleries and talking rich patrons into buying it for great sums of money.\u201d She waved the remains of the carrot before finishing it off. \u201cAll the man can think about is making money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGalleries,\u201d Brianna repeated. \u201cHe owns art galleries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Dublin and Cork. He has interests in others in London and New York. Paris, too, I think. Probably Rome. Everybody in the art world knows Rogan Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>The art world was as removed from Brianna\u2019s life as the moon. But she felt a quick, warm pride that her sister could claim it. \u201cAnd he\u2019s taken an interest in your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuck his aristocrat\u2019s nose in is what he\u2019s done.\u201d Maggie snorted. \u201cCalling me on the phone, sending letters, all but demanding rights to everything I make. Now today, he pops up on my doorstep, telling me that I need him. Hah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t, no.\u201d Brianna carried the vegetables to the sink to rinse. \u201cNot you, Margaret Mary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I hate that tone, all cold and superior. You sound just like Mother.\u201d She slid off the counter to stalk to the refrigerator. And because of it, she was swamped with guilt. \u201cWe\u2019re getting along well enough,\u201d she added as she pulled out a beer. \u201cThe bills are paid, there\u2019s food on the table and a roof over all our heads.\u201d She stared at her sister\u2019s stiff back and let out a sound of impatience. \u201cIt can\u2019t be what it once was, Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Brianna\u2019s lilting voice turned edgy. \u201cDo you think I have to have more? That I can\u2019t be content with what is?\u201d Suddenly unbearably sad, she stared out the window toward the fields beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s not me, Maggie. \u2019Tisn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>Maggie scowled down at her beer. It was Brianna who suffered, Maggie knew. Brianna who had always been in the middle. Now, Maggie thought, she had the chance to change that. All she had to do was sell part of her soul.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been complaining again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brianna tucked a stray hair away in the knot at the nape of her neck. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell by the look on your face she\u2019s been in one of her moods\u2014and taking it out on you.\u201d Before Brianna could speak, Maggie waved a hand. \u201cShe\u2019ll never be happy, Brianna. You can\u2019t make her happy. The good Lord knows I can\u2019t. She\u2019ll never forgive him for being what he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was he?\u201d Brianna demanded as she turned around. \u201cJust what was our father, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman. Flawed.\u201d She set her beer down and walked to her sister. \u201cWonderful. Do you remember, Brie, the time he bought the mule, and was going to make a fortune having tourists snap pictures of it in a peaked cap with our old dog sitting on its back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Brie would have turned away, but Maggie grabbed her hands. \u201cAnd I remember he lost more money feeding that cursed, bad-tempered mule than he ever did with his scheming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, but it was fun. We went to the Cliffs of Mohr, and it was such a bright summer day. The tourists swarming about and the music playing. And there was Da holding that stupid mule, and that poor old dog, Joe, as terrified of that mule as he would have been of a roaring lion.\u201d</p><p>Brianna softened. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cPoor Joe sitting and shivering with fear on that mule\u2019s back. Then that German came along, wanting a picture of himself with Joe and the mule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the mule kicked.\u201d Maggie grinned and picked up her beer again for a toast. \u201cAnd the German screamed in three different languages while he hopped about on one foot. And Joe, terrified, leaped off and landed right on a display of lace collars, and the mule ran, scattering tourists. Oh, what a sight. People shouting and running, ladies screaming. There was a fiddler there, remember? And he just kept playing a reel as if we\u2019d all start dancing any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that nice boy from Killarney caught the mule\u2019s lead and dragged him back. Da tried to sell him the mule there and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nearly did. It\u2019s a good memory, Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made many memories worth laughing over. But you can\u2019t live on laughter alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t live without it, as she would. He was alive. Now it seems this family\u2019s more dead than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ill,\u201d Brianna said shortly.</p><p>\u201cAs she has been for more than twenty years. And ill she\u2019ll stay as long as she has you to tend to her hand and foot.\u201d</p><p>It was true, but knowing the truth didn\u2019t change Brianna\u2019s heart. \u201cShe\u2019s our mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is.\u201d Maggie drained the beer and set it aside. The yeasty taste warred with the bitterness on her tongue. \u201cI\u2019ve sold another piece. I\u2019ll have money for you by the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for it. So is she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she is.\u201d Maggie looked into her sister\u2019s eyes with all the passion and anger and hurt boiling beneath. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for her. When there\u2019s enough you\u2019ll hire a nurse and you\u2019ll move her into her own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Maggie interrupted. \u201cThat was the agreement, Brie. I\u2019ll not stand by and watch you dance to her tune for the rest of her life. A nurse and a place in the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019ll have.\u201d Maggie inclined her head. \u201cShe kept you up last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was restless.\u201d Embarrassed, Brianna turned back to prepare the chicken. \u201cOne of her headaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Maggie remembered her mother\u2019s headaches well, and how well timed they could be. An argument Maeve was losing: instant headache. A family outing she didn\u2019t approve of: the throbbing began.</p><p>\u201cI know what she is, Maggie.\u201d Brianna\u2019s own head began to ache. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make her less of my mother.\u201d</p><p>Saint Brianna, Maggie thought again, but with affection. Her sister might be younger than her own twenty-eight by a year, but it had always been Brianna who took responsibility. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t change what you are, Brie.\u201d Maggie gave her sister a fierce hug. \u201cDa always said you\u2019d be the good angel and I the bad. He was finally right about something.\u201d She closed her eyes a moment. \u201cTell Mr. Sweeney to come by the cottage in the morning. I\u2019ll speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let him manage you, then?\u201d</p><p>The phrase had Maggie wincing. \u201cI\u2019ll speak with him,\u201d she repeated, and headed back into the rain.</p><p>If Maggie had a weakness, it was family. That weakness had kept her up late into the night and had awakened her early in the chill, murky dawn. To the outside world she preferred to pretend she had responsibilities only to herself and her art, but beneath the facade was a constant love of family, and the dragging, often bitter obligations that went with it.</p><p>She wanted to refuse Rogan Sweeney, first on principle. Art and business, to her mind, could not and should not mix. She wanted to refuse him secondly because his type\u2014wealthy, confident and blue-blooded\u2014irritated her. Thirdly, and most telling, she wanted to refuse him because to do otherwise was an admission that she lacked the skill to handle her affairs alone.</p><p>Oh, that was a pill that stuck bitterly in her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She would not refuse him. She\u2019d made the decision sometime during the long and restless night to allow Rogan Sweeney to make her rich.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though she couldn\u2019t support herself, and well, too. She\u2019d been doing just that for more than five years. Brianna\u2019s bed and breakfast was successful enough that keeping two homes was no heavy burden. But they could not between them afford a third.</p><p>Maggie\u2019s goal, indeed her Holy Grail, was to establish their mother in a separate residence. If Rogan could help clear the path to her quest, she\u2019d deal with him. She\u2019d deal with the very devil.</p><p>But the devil might come to regret the bargain.</p> <p>In her kitchen with the rain falling soft and steady outside, Maggie brewed tea. And plotted.</p><p>Rogan Sweeney had to be cleverly handled, she mused. With just the right amount of artistic disdain and feminine flattery. The disdain would be no problem at all, but the other ingredient would be hard coming.</p><p>She let herself picture Brianna baking, gardening, curled up with a book by the fire\u2014without the whining, demanding voice of their mother to spoil the peace. Brianna would marry, have children. Which Maggie knew was a dream her sister kept locked in her heart. And locked it would stay as long as Brianna had the responsibility of a chronic hypochondriac.</p><p>While Maggie couldn\u2019t understand her sister\u2019s need to strap herself down with a man and a half a dozen children, she would do whatever it took to help Brianna realize the dream.</p><p>It was possible, just possible, that Rogan Sweeney could play fairy godfather.</p> <p>The knock on the front door of the cottage was brisk and impatient. This fairy godfather, Maggie thought as she went to answer, wouldn\u2019t make his entrance with angel dust and colored lights.</p><p>After opening the door, she smiled a little. He was wet, as he\u2019d been the day before, and just as elegantly dressed. She wondered if he slept in a suit and tie.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you, Miss Concannon.\u201d He stepped inside, out of the rain and the swirl of mist.</p><p>\u201cShall I take your coat? It\u2019ll dry out some by the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He slipped out of his overcoat, watched her spread it over a chair by the fire. She was different today, he thought. Pleasant. The change put him on guard. \u201cTell me, does it do anything but rain in Clare?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe enjoy good soft weather in the spring. Don\u2019t worry, Mr. Sweeney. Even a Dubliner shouldn\u2019t melt in a west-county rain.\u201d She sent him a quick, charming smile, but her eyes were wickedly amused. \u201cI\u2019m brewing tea, if you\u2019d like some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d Before she could turn to the kitchen, he stopped her\u2014a hand on her arm. His attention wasn\u2019t on her, but on the sculpture on the table beside them. It was a long, sinuous curve in a deep icy blue. The color of an arctic lake. Glass clung to glass in waves at the tip then flowed down, liquid ice.</p><p>\u201cAn interesting piece,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d Maggie blocked the urge to shake off his hand. It held her lightly, with an understated possession that made her ridiculously uncomfortable. She could smell him, the subtle woodsy cologne he\u2019d probably dashed on after shaving, with undertones of soap from his shower. When he ran a fingertip along the length of the curved glass, she suppressed a shudder. For a moment, a foolish one, it had felt as though he\u2019d trailed a touch from her throat to her center.</p><p>\u201cObviously feminine,\u201d he murmured. Though his eyes stayed on the glass, he was very aware of her. The coiled tension in her arm, the quick tremble she\u2019d tried to mask, the dark, wild scent of her hair. \u201cPowerful. A woman about to surrender sexually to a man.\u201d</p><p>It flustered her because he was exactly right. \u201cHow do you find power in surrender?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her then, those depthless blue eyes locked on her face. His hand remained light on her arm. \u201cNothing\u2019s more powerful than a woman at that instant before she gives herself.\u201d He stroked the glass again. \u201cObviously you\u2019re aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the man?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled then, just the faintest curve of lips. His grip on her arm seemed more of a caress now. A request. And his eyes, amused, interested, skimmed over her face. \u201cThat, Margaret Mary, would depend on the woman.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, absorbed the sexual punch, acknowledged it with a slight nod. \u201cWell, we agree on something. Sex and power generally depend on the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not at all what I said, or meant. What draws you to create something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain art to a man of business.\u201d</p><p>When she would have stepped back, he curled his fingers around her arm, tightened his grip. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance pricked through her. \u201cWhat comes to me comes. There\u2019s no plot, no plan. It has to do with emotions, with passions and not with practicality or profit. Otherwise I\u2019d be making little glass swans for gift shops. Jesus, what a thought.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cHorrifying. Fortunately I\u2019m not interested in little glass swans. But I would like that tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have it in the kitchen.\u201d She started to step away again, and again his grip stopped her. Temper flashed into her eyes like lightning. \u201cYou\u2019re blocking my way, Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m about to clear it for you.\u201d He released her and followed her silently into the kitchen.</p><p>Her cottage was a far cry from the country comfort of Blackthorn. There were no rich smells of baking wafting in the air, no plumped pillows or gleaming woodwork. It was spartan, utilitarian and untidy. Which was why, he supposed, the art carelessly set here and there was that much more effective and striking.</p><p>He wondered where she slept, and if her bed was as soft and inviting as the one he\u2019d spent the night in. And he wondered if he would share it with her. No, not if, he corrected himself. When.</p><p>Maggie set the teapot on the table along with two thick pottery mugs. \u201cDid you enjoy your stay at Blackthorn Cottage?\u201d she asked as she poured.</p><p>\u201cI did. Your sister\u2019s charming. And her cooking memorable.\u201d</p><p>Maggie softened, added three generous spoons of sugar to her tea. \u201cBrie\u2019s a homemaker in the best sense of the word. Did she make her currant buns this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had two of them.\u201d</p><p>Relaxed again, Maggie laughed and propped one booted foot on her knee. \u201cOur father used to say Brie got all the gold and I the brass. I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t get any home-baked buns here, Sweeney, but I could probably dig out a tin of biscuits.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably rather get straight to business.\u201d Cupping the mug in both hands, Maggie leaned forward. \u201cWhat if I were to tell you plain I\u2019m not interested in your offer?\u201d</p><p>Rogan considered, sipping his tea black and strong. \u201cI\u2019d have to call you a liar, Maggie.\u201d He grinned at the fire that erupted in her eyes. \u201cBecause if you weren\u2019t interested, you wouldn\u2019t have agreed to see me this morning. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t be drinking tea in your kitchen.\u201d He held up a hand before she could speak. \u201cWe\u2019ll agree, however, that you don\u2019t want to be interested.\u201d</p><p>A clever man, she mused, only slightly mollified. Clever men were dangerous ones. \u201cI\u2019ve no wish to be produced, or managed, or guided.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe rarely wish for what we need.\u201d He watched her over the rim of his cup, calculating even as he enjoyed the way the faint flush seemed to silken her skin, deepen the green of her eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I explain myself more clearly? Your art is your domain. I have no intention of interfering in any way with what you do in your studio. You create what you\u2019re inspired to create, when you\u2019re inspired to create it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if what I create isn\u2019t to your taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve shown and sold a great number of pieces I wouldn\u2019t care to have in my home. That\u2019s the business, Maggie. And as I won\u2019t interfere with your art, you won\u2019t interfere with my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have no say in who buys my work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIf you have an emotional attachment to a piece, you\u2019ll have to get over it, or keep the piece for yourself. Once it\u2019s in my hands, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>Her jaw clenched. \u201cAnd anyone with the money can own it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Maggie slapped the mug down and sprang up to pace. She used her whole body, a habit Rogan admired. Legs, arms, shoulders all in rhythmically angry movements. He topped off his tea and sat back to enjoy the show.</p><p>\u201cI pull something out of myself, and I create it, make it solid, tangible, real, and some idiot from Kerry or Dublin or, God help me, London, comes in and buys it for his wife\u2019s birthday without having the least understanding of what it is, what it means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you develop personal relationships with everyone who buys your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I know where it\u2019s going, who\u2019s buying it.\u201d Usually, she added to herself.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to remind you that I bought two of your pieces before we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And look where that\u2019s got me.\u201d</p><p>Temperament, he thought with a sigh. As long as he\u2019d worked with artists he\u2019d never understood it. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he began, trying for the most reasonable of tones. \u201cThe reason you need a manager is to eliminate these difficulties. You won\u2019t have to worry about the sales, only the creation. And yes, if someone from Kerry or Dublin, or God help you London comes into one of my galleries and takes an interest in one of your pieces, it\u2019s his\u2014as long as he meets the price. No r\u00e9sum\u00e9, no character references required. And by the end of a year, with my help, you\u2019ll be a rich woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think I want?\u201d Insulted, infuriated, she whirled on him. \u201cDo you think, Rogan Sweeney, that I pick up my pipe every day calculating how much profit there might be at the end of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. That\u2019s precisely where I come in. You\u2019re an exceptional artist, Maggie. And at the risk of inflating what appears to be an already titanic ego, I\u2019ll admit that I was captivated the first time I saw your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you have decent taste,\u201d she said with a cranky shrug.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. My point is that your work deserves more than you\u2019re giving it. You deserve more than you\u2019re giving yourself.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back on the counter, eyeing him narrowly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to help me get more out of the goodness of your heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy heart has nothing to do with it. I\u2019m going to help you because your work will add to the prestige of my galleries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to your pocketbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day you\u2019ll have to explain to me the root of your disdain for money. In the meantime, your tea\u2019s getting cold.\u201d</p><p>Maggie let out a long breath. She wasn\u2019t doing a good job of flattering him, she reminded herself, and returned to the table. \u201cRogan.\u201d She let herself smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re very good at what you do. Your galleries have a reputation for quality and integrity, which I\u2019m sure is a reflection of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She was good, he mused, and ran his tongue over his teeth. Very good. \u201cI like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless any artist would be thrilled to be considered by you. But I\u2019m accustomed to dealing for myself, for handling all the aspects of my work from making the glass to selling the finished piece\u2014or at least placing it into the hands of someone I know and trust to sell it. I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr trust me?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand, let it fall. \u201cI would be a fool not to trust Worldwide Galleries. But it\u2019s difficult for me to imagine a business of that size. I\u2019m a simple woman.\u201d</p><p>He laughed so quickly, so richly, that she blinked. Before she could recover, he was leaning forward, taking one of her hands in his. \u201cOh, no, Margaret Mary, simple is exactly what you are not. Canny, obstinate, brilliant, bad-tempered and beautiful you are. But simple, never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say I am.\u201d She yanked her hand free and struggled not to be charmed. \u201cAnd I know myself better than you do or ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time you finish a sculpture you\u2019re shouting out this is who I am. At least for today. That\u2019s what makes art true.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with him. It was an observation she hadn\u2019t expected from a man of his background. Making money from art didn\u2019t mean you understood it. Apparently, he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a simple woman,\u201d she said again, daring him to contradict her a second time. \u201cAnd I prefer to stay that way. If I agree to your management, there will be rules. Mine.\u201d</p><p>He had her, and he knew it. But a wise negotiator was never a smug one. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do no publicity, unless it suits me. And I can promise you it won\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll add to the mystery, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She very nearly grinned before she recovered. \u201cI\u2019ll not be after dressing up like some fashion plate for showings\u2014if I come at all.\u201d</p><p>This time he tucked his tongue firmly in his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure your sense of style will reflect your artistic nature.\u201d</p><p>It might have been an insult, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be nice to people if I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTemperament, again artistic.\u201d He toasted her with his tea. \u201cShould add to sales.\u201d</p><p>Though she was amused, she sat back and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI will never, never duplicate a piece or create something out of someone else\u2019s fancy.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, shook his head. \u201cThat may be a deal breaker. I had this idea for a unicorn, with a touch of gold leaf on the horn and hooves. Very tasteful.\u201d</p><p>She snickered, then gave up and laughed out loud. \u201cAll right, Rogan. Maybe by some miracle we\u2019ll be able to work together. How do we do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have contracts drawn up. Worldwide will want exclusive rights to your work.\u201d</p> <p>She winced at that. It felt as though she were surrendering a part of herself. Perhaps the best part. \u201cExclusive rights to the pieces I choose to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She looked past him, out the window toward the fields beyond. Once, long ago, they, like her art, had felt like part of her. Now they were just part of a lovely view. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. She looked almost unbearably sad. \u201cIt won\u2019t change what you do. It won\u2019t change who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she murmured. With an effort, she shook off the mood and faced him again. \u201cGo on. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want a show, within two months, at the Dublin gallery. Naturally, I\u2019ll need to see what you have finished, and I\u2019ll arrange for shipping. I\u2019ll also need you to keep me apprised of what you\u2019ve completed over the next few weeks. We\u2019ll price the pieces, and whatever inventory is left after the show will be displayed in Dublin and our other galleries.\u201d</p> <p>She took a long, calming breath. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it, if you\u2019d not refer to my work as inventory. At least in my presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He steepled his fingers. \u201cYou will, of course, be sent a complete itemization of pieces sold. You may, if you choose, have some input as to which ones we photograph for our catalog. Or you can leave it up to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how and when am I paid?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI can buy the pieces outright. I have no objection to that since I have confidence in your work.\u201d</p><p>She remembered what he\u2019d said before, about getting twice as much as what he\u2019d paid her for the sculpture she\u2019d just finished. She might not have been a businesswoman, but she wasn\u2019t a fool.</p><p>\u201cHow else do you handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy commission. We take the piece, and when and if we sell it, we deduct a percentage.\u201d</p><p>More of a gamble, she mused. And she preferred a gamble. \u201cWhat percentage do you take?\u201d</p> <p>Hoping for a reaction, he kept his eyes level with hers. \u201cThirty-five percent.\u201d</p><p>She made a strangled sound in her throat. \u201cThirty-five? Thirty-five? You thief. You robber.\u201d She shoved back from the table and stood. \u201cYou\u2019re a vulture, Rogan Sweeney. Thirty-five percent be damned and you with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take all the risks, I have all the expenses.\u201d He spread his hands, steepled them again. \u201cYou have merely to create.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, as if all it takes is sitting on me ass and waiting for the inspiration to come fluttering down like raindrops. You know nothing, nothing about it.\u201d She began to pace again, swirling the air with temper and energy. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you, you\u2019d have nothing to sell without me. And it\u2019s my work, my sweat and blood that they\u2019ll spend good money for. You\u2019ll get fifteen percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlague take you, Rogan, for a horse thief. Twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five.\u201d He rose then to stand toe to toe with her. \u201cWorldwide will earn a quarter of your sweat and blood, Maggie, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quarter.\u201d She hissed through her teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s a businessman for you, preying on art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd making the artist financially secure. Think of it, Maggie. Your work will be seen in New York, in Rome and Paris. And no one who sees it will forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s clever you are, Rogan, taking a quick turn from money into fame.\u201d She scowled at him then stuck out her hand. \u201cThe hell with it and you, you\u2019ll have your twenty-five percent.\u201d</p><p>Which was exactly what he\u2019d planned on. He took her hand, held it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do well together, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>Well enough, she hoped, to settle her mother in the village and away from Blackthorn Cottage. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, Rogan, I\u2019ll see that you pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d enjoyed the taste of her, he lifted her hand to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll risk it.\u201d</p><p>His lips lingered there long enough to make her pulse stutter. \u201cIf you were going to try to seduce me, you\u2019d have been smarter to start before we had a deal.\u201d</p><p>The statement both surprised and annoyed him. \u201cI prefer to keep personal and professional matters separate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother difference between us.\u201d It pleased her to see she\u2019d scratched the seamlessly polite exterior. \u201cMy personal and professional lives are always fusing. And I indulge both when the whim strikes.\u201d Smiling, she slipped her hand from his. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t as yet\u2014personally speaking. I\u2019ll let you know if and when it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you baiting me, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>She stopped as if thinking it through. \u201cNo, I\u2019m explaining to you. Now I\u2019ll take you to the glass house so you can choose what you want shipped to Dublin.\u201d She turned to pull a jacket from a peg by the back door. \u201cYou might want your coat. It\u2019d be a shame to get that fancy suit wet.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment, wondering why he should feel so completely insulted. Without a word he turned on his heel and strode back into the living room for his coat.</p><p>Maggie took the opportunity to step outside and cool her blood in the chilly rain. Ridiculous, she told herself, to get so sexually tied up over having her hand kissed. Rogan Sweeney was smooth, too smooth. It was a fortunate thing he lived on the other side of the country. More fortunate yet, he wasn\u2019t her type. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not at all.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>THE high grass beside the ruined abbey made a lovely resting place for the dead. Maggie had fought to have her father buried there, rather than in the tidy and cold ground near the village church. She had wanted the peace, and the touch of royalty for her father. For once, Brianna had argued with her until their mother had sullenly closed her mouth and washed her hands of the arrangements.</p><p>Maggie visited there only twice a year, once on her father\u2019s birthday and once on her own. To thank him for the gift of her life. She never came on the anniversary of his death, nor did she allow herself to mourn in private.</p> <p>Nor did she mourn him now, but sat down on the grass beside him, tucking her knees up and wrapping her arms around them. The sun fought through layers of clouds to gild the graves and the wind was fresh, smelling of wildflowers.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t brought flowers with her, never did. Brianna had planted a bed right over him, so that as spring warmed the earth, his grave sprang with color and beauty.</p><p>Tender buds were just forming on the primroses. The fairy heads of columbine nodded gently among the tender shoots of larkspur and betony. She watched a magpie dart over headstones and sway toward a field. One for sorrow, she thought, and searched the sky fruitlessly for the second that would stand for joy.</p><p>Butterflies fluttered nearby, flashing thin, silent wings. She watched them for a time, taking comfort in the color and the movement. There had been no place to bury him near the sea, but this, she thought, this place would have pleased him.</p><p>Maggie leaned back comfortably on the side of her father\u2019s headstone and closed her eyes.</p> <p>I wish you were still here, she thought, so I could tell you what I\u2019m doing. Not that I\u2019d listen to any of your advice, mind. But it would be good to hear it.</p><p>If Rogan Sweeney\u2019s a man of his word\u2014and I can\u2019t see how he\u2019d be anything else\u2014I\u2019ll be a rich woman. How you\u2019d enjoy that. There\u2019d be enough for you to open your own pub like you always wanted. Oh, what a poor farmer you were, darling. But the best of fathers. The very best.</p><p>She was doing her best to keep her promise to him, she thought. To take care of her mother and her sister, and to follow her dream.</p><p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked up at Brianna. Tidy as a pin, she thought, studying her sister. Her lovely hair all scooped up, her clothes neatly pressed. \u201cYou look like a schoolteacher,\u201d Maggie said, and laughed at Brianna\u2019s expression. \u201cA lovely one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a ragpicker,\u201d Brianna retorted, scowling at Maggie\u2019s choice of ripped jeans and a tattered sweater. \u201cA lovely one.\u201d</p> <p>Brianna knelt beside her sister and folded her hands. Not to pray, just for neatness\u2019 sake.</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment while the wind breathed through the grass and floated through the tumbled stones.</p><p>\u201cA lovely day for grave sitting,\u201d Maggie commented. He\u2019d have been seventy-one today, she thought. \u201cHis flowers are blooming nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeeds some weeding.\u201d And Brianna began to do so. \u201cI found the money on the kitchen counter this morning, Maggie. It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a good sale. You\u2019ll put some of it by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, knowing you\u2019re that much closer to having her out.\u201d</p><p>Brianna sighed. \u201cShe isn\u2019t a burden to me.\u201d Catching her sister\u2019s expression, she shrugged. \u201cNot as much as you think. Only when she\u2019s feeling poorly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is most of the time. Brie, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money\u2019s the best way I know how to show it. Da wanted me to help you with her. And the good Lord knows I couldn\u2019t live with her as you do. She\u2019d send me to the madhouse, or I\u2019d send myself to prison by murdering her in her sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis business with Rogan Sweeney, you did it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d Maggie bristled at the thought of it. \u201cBecause of her, perhaps, which is a different matter altogether. Once she\u2019s settled and you have your life back, you\u2019ll get married and give me a horde of nieces and nephews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have your own children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want marriage.\u201d Comfortable, Maggie closed her eyes again. \u201cNo, indeed. I prefer coming and going as it suits me and answering to no one. I\u2019ll spoil your children, and they\u2019ll come running to Aunt Maggie whenever you\u2019re too strict with them.\u201d She opened one eye. \u201cYou could marry Murphy.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s laugh carried beautifully over the high grass. \u201cIt would shock him to know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was always sweet on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was, yes\u2014when I was thirteen. No, he\u2019s a lovely man and I\u2019m as fond of him as I would be of a brother. But he\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for in a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all planned then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve nothing planned,\u201d Brianna said primly, \u201cand we\u2019re getting off the subject. I don\u2019t want you to join hands with Mr. Sweeney because you feel obliged to me. I might think it\u2019s the best thing you could do for your work, but I won\u2019t have you unhappy because you think I am. Because I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times did you have to serve her a meal in bed this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t keep an accounting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Maggie interrupted. \u201cIn any case, it\u2019s done. I signed his contracts a week ago. I\u2019m now being managed by Rogan Sweeney and Worldwide Galleries. I\u2019ll have a show in his Dublin gallery in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks. That\u2019s so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be a man to waste time. Come with me, Brianna.\u201d Maggie grabbed her sister\u2019s hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll make Sweeney pay for a fancy hotel and we\u2019ll eat out in restaurants and buy something foolish.\u201d</p><p>Shops. Food she hadn\u2019t cooked herself. A bed that didn\u2019t have to be made. Brianna yearned, but only for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d love to be with you, Maggie. But I can\u2019t leave her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you can\u2019t. Jesus, she can stand her own company for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Brianna hesitated then sat back wearily on her haunches. \u201cShe fell last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she hurt?\u201d Maggie\u2019s fingers tightened on her sister\u2019s. \u201cDamn it, Brie, why didn\u2019t you tell me? How did it happen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because it turned out to be no great matter. She was outside, went out on her own while I was upstairs tidying rooms. Lost her footing, it seems. She bruised her hip, jarred her shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called Dr. Hogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. He said there was nothing to worry about. She\u2019d lost her balance was all. And if she got more exercise, ate better and all the rest, she\u2019d be stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Damn the woman, Maggie thought. And damn the constant and incessant guilt that lived in her own heart. \u201cAnd it\u2019s back to bed she went, I\u2019ll wager. And has stayed there ever since.\u201d</p> <p>Brianna\u2019s lips twitched into a wry smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to budge her. She claims she has an inner-ear deficiency and wants to go into Cork to a specialist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d Maggie tossed back her head and glared at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s typical. Never have I known anyone with more complaints than Maeve Concannon. And she\u2019s got you on a string, my girl.\u201d She jabbed a finger at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t deny it, but I haven\u2019t the heart to cut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Maggie stood, brushed at her knees. \u201cThe answer\u2019s money, Brie. It\u2019s what she\u2019s always wanted. God knows she made his life a misery because he couldn\u2019t hang on to it.\u201d In a gesture of protection, Maggie laid a hand on her father\u2019s headstone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, and he made hers a misery as well. Two people less suited I\u2019ve never seen. Marriages aren\u2019t always made in heaven, or in hell. Sometimes they\u2019re just stuck in purgatory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd sometimes people are too foolish or too righteous to walk away.\u201d The hand on the headstone stroked once, then dropped away. \u201cI prefer fools to martyrs. Put the money by, Brie. There\u2019ll be more coming soon. I\u2019ll see to that in Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you see her before you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Maggie said grimly.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll enjoy her.\u201d Rogan dipped into the clotted cream for his scone and smiled at his grandmother. \u201cShe\u2019s an interesting woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Christine Rogan Sweeney lifted one sharp white brow. She knew her grandson well, could interpret every nuance of tone and expression. On the subject of Maggie Concannon, however, he was cryptic. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure of that himself and stalled for time by stirring his tea. \u201cShe\u2019s a brilliant artist; her vision is extraordinary. Yet she lives alone in a little cottage in Clare, and the decor is anything but aesthetically unique. She\u2019s passionate about her work, but reluctant to show it. She\u2019s by turns charming and rude\u2014and both seem to be true to her nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA contradictory woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He settled back, a man completely content in the gracious parlor, S\u00e8vres cup in his hand, and his head resting against the brocade cushion of a Queen Anne chair. A fire burned quietly in the grate. The flowers and the scones were fresh.</p><p>He enjoyed these occasional teas with his grandmother as much as she did. The peace and order of her home were soothing, as was she with her perpetual dignity and softly faded beauty.</p><p>He knew she was seventy-three and took personal pride in the fact that she looked ten years younger. Her skin was pale as alabaster. Lined, yes, but the marks of age only added to the serenity of her face. Her eyes were brilliantly blue, her hair as soft and white as a first snowfall.</p><p>She had a sharp mind, unquestionable taste, a generous heart and a dry, sometimes biting wit. She was, as Rogan had often told her, his ideal woman.</p><p>It was a sentiment that flattered Christine as much as it concerned her.</p><p>He had failed her in only one way. That was to find a personal contentment that equalled his professional one.</p><p>\u201cHow are preparations for the show going?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cVery well. It would be easier if our artist of the moment answered her damn phone.\u201d He brushed that irritation away. \u201cThe pieces that have been shipped in are wonderful. You\u2019ll have to come by the gallery and see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may do that.\u201d But she was more interested in the artist than in the art. \u201cDid you say she was a young woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie Concannon. Did you mention she was young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, middle twenties, I\u2019d expect. Young, certainly, for the scope of her work.\u201d</p><p>Lord, it was like drawing teeth. \u201cAnd flashy would you say? Like\u2014what was her name\u2014Miranda Whitfield-Fry, the one who did metal sculpture and wore all the heavy jewelry and colored scarves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nothing like Miranda.\u201d Thank Christ. He remembered with a shudder how relentlessly, and embarrassingly, the woman had pursued him. \u201cMaggie\u2019s more the boots and cotton shirt type. Her hair looks like she had a whack at it with kitchen shears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnattractive then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, very attractive\u2014but in an unusual sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMannish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He recalled, uncomfortably, the vicious sexual tug, the sensual scent of her, the feel of that quick, involuntary tremble under his hand. \u201cFar from it.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Christine thought. She would definitely make time to meet the woman who put that scowl on Rogan\u2019s face. \u201cShe intrigues you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, I wouldn\u2019t have signed her otherwise.\u201d He caught Christine\u2019s look and raised a brow in an identical manner. \u201cIt\u2019s business, Grandmother. Just business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Smiling to herself, she poured him more tea. \u201cTell me what else you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d</p><p>Rogan arrived at the gallery at eight A.M. the next morning. He\u2019d enjoyed an evening at the theater, and a late supper with a sometimes companion. As always, he\u2019d found Patricia charming and delightful. The widow of an old friend, she was, to his mind, more of a distant cousin than a date. They\u2019d discussed the Eugene O\u2019Neill play over salmon and champagne and had parted with a platonic kiss at just after midnight.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t slept a wink.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been Patricia\u2019s light laugh or her subtle perfume that had kept him tossing.</p><p>Maggie Concannon, he thought. Naturally the woman was in the forefront of his mind, since most of his time and effort was focused on her upcoming show. It was hardly any wonder that he was thinking of her\u2014particularly since it was all but impossible to speak to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her aversion to the phone had caused him to resort to telegrams, which he fired off to the west with blistering regularity.</p><p>Her one and only answer had been brief and to the point: STOP NAGGING.</p><p>Imagine, Rogan thought as he unlocked the elegant glass doors of the gallery. She\u2019d accused him of nagging, like some spoiled, whiny child. He was a businessman, for God\u2019s sake, one about to give her career an astronomical boost. And she wouldn\u2019t even spare the time to pick up the damn phone and have a reasonable conversation.</p><p>He was used to artists. Sweet Mary knew he had dealt with their eccentricities, their insecurities, their often childish demands. It was his job to do so, and he considered himself adept. But Maggie Concannon was trying both his skill and his patience.</p> <p>He relocked the doors behind him and breathed in the quietly scented air of the gallery. Built by his grandfather, the building was lofty and grand, a striking testament to art with its Gothic stonework and carved balusters.</p><p>The interior consisted of dozens of rooms, some small, some large, all flowing into the next with wide archways. Stairs curved up fluidly to a second story that housed a ballroom-size space along with intimate parlors fitted with antique sofas.</p><p>It was there he would show Maggie\u2019s work. In the ballroom he would have a small orchestra. While the guests enjoyed the music, the champagne, the canapes, they could browse among her strategically placed works. The larger, bolder pieces he would highlight, showcasing smaller pieces in more intimate settings.</p><p>Imagining it, refining the pictures in his mind, he walked through the lower gallery toward the office and storage rooms.</p><p>He found his gallery manager, Joseph Donahoe, pouring coffee in the kitchenette.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d Joseph smiled, showing the flash of one gold tooth. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanted to check on the progress upstairs before heading into the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right along,\u201d Joseph assured him. Though the two men were of an age, Joseph\u2019s hair was thinning on top. He compensated for the loss by growing it long enough to tie in a streaming ponytail. His nose had been broken once by a wayward polo mallet and so listed a bit to the left. The result was the look of a pirate in a Savile Row suit.</p><p>The women adored him.</p><p>\u201cYou look a bit washed-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsomnia,\u201d Rogan said, and took his coffee black. \u201cDid yesterday\u2019s shipment get unpacked?\u201d</p> <p>Joseph winced. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d ask.\u201d He lifted his cup and muttered into it. \u201cHasn\u2019t come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Joseph rolled his eyes. He\u2019d worked for Rogan for more than a decade and knew that tone. \u201cIt didn\u2019t arrive yesterday. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be along this morning. That\u2019s why I came in early myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that woman doing? Her instructions were very specific, very simple. She was to ship the last of the pieces overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an artist, Rogan. She probably got struck by inspiration and worked past the time to post it. We\u2019ve got plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have her dragging her feet.\u201d Incensed, Rogan snapped up the kitchen phone. He didn\u2019t have to look up Maggie\u2019s number in his address book. He already knew it by heart. He stabbed buttons and listened to the phone ring. And ring. \u201cIrresponsible twit.\u201d</p><p>Joseph took out a cigarette as Rogan slammed down the receiver. \u201cWe have more than thirty pieces,\u201d he said as he flicked an ornate enameled lighter. \u201cEven without this last shipment, it\u2019s enough. And the work, Rogan. Even a jaded old hand like me is dazzled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly the point, is it?\u201d</p> <p>Joseph blew out smoke, pursed his lips. \u201cActually, it is, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agreed on forty pieces, not thirty-five, not thirty-six. Forty. And by God, forty is what I\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan\u2014where are you going?\u201d he called out when Rogan stormed from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cTo goddamn Clare.\u201d</p><p>Joseph took another drag on his cigarette and toasted the air with his coffee cup. \u201cBon voyage.\u201d</p><p>The flight was a short one and didn\u2019t give Rogan\u2019s temper time to cool. The fact that the sky was gloriously blue, the air balmy, didn\u2019t change a thing. When he slammed the door on his rental car and headed away from Shannon Airport, he was still cursing Maggie.</p><p>By the time he arrived at her cottage, he was at full boil.</p><p>The nerve of the woman, he thought as he stalked up to her front door. Pulling him away from his work, from his obligations. Did she think she was the only artist he represented?</p><p>He pounded on her door until his fist throbbed. Ignoring manners, he pushed the door open. \u201cMaggie!\u201d he called out, striding from the living room to the kitchen. \u201cDamn you.\u201d Without pausing, he stamped through the back door and headed for her workshop.</p><p>He should have known she\u2019d be there.</p><p>She glanced up from a workbench and a mountain of shredded paper. \u201cGood, I could use some help with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell don\u2019t you answer the bloody phone? Why have the damn thing if you\u2019re going to ignore it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI often ask myself the same thing. Pass me that hammer, will you?\u201d</p><p>He lifted it from the bench, hefted the weight a moment as the very pleasant image of bopping her on the head with it flitted into his brain. \u201cWhere the devil\u2019s my shipment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d She dragged a hand through her untidy hair before taking the hammer from him. \u201cI\u2019m just packing it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be in Dublin yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it couldn\u2019t be because I hadn\u2019t sent it yet.\u201d With quick, expert moves, she began to hammer nails into the crate on the floor. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve come all this way to check on it, I have to say you don\u2019t have enough to do with your time.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her off the floor and plunked her down on the workbench. The hammer clanked on concrete, barely missing his foot. Before she\u2019d drawn the breath to spit at him, he caught her chin in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI have more than enough to do with my time,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cAnd baby-sitting for an irresponsible, scatterbrained woman interferes with my schedule. I have a staff at the gallery, one whose timetable is carefully, even meticulously thought out. All you had to do was follow instructions and ship the damn merchandise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slapped his hand away. \u201cI don\u2019t give a tinker\u2019s damn about your schedules and timetables. You signed on an artist, Sweeney, not a bleeding clerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what artistic endeavor prevented you from following a simple direction?\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth, considered punching him, then simply pointed. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over, froze. Only the blindness of temper could have prevented him from seeing it, being struck dumb by it on entering the building.</p> <p>The sculpture stood on the far side of the room, fully three feet high, all bleeding colors and twisting, sinuous shapes. A tangle of limbs, surely, he thought, unashamedly sexual, beautifully human. He crossed to it to study it from a different angle.</p><p>He could almost, almost make out faces. They seemed to melt into imagination, leaving only the sensation of absolute fulfillment. It was impossible to see where one form began and the other left off, so completely, so perfectly were they merged.</p><p>It was, he thought, a celebration of the human spirit and the sexuality of the beast.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurrender.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt seems you inspired me, Rogan.\u201d Whipped by fresh energy, she pushed off the bench. She was light-headed, giddy, and felt glorious. \u201cIt took forever to get the colors right. You wouldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve remelted and discarded. But I could see it, perfectly, and it had to be exact.\u201d She laughed and picked up her hammer to drive another nail. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve slept last. Two days, three.\u201d She laughed again, dragging her hands through her tousled hair. \u201cI\u2019m not tired. I feel incredible. Full of desperate energy. I can\u2019t seem to stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s magnificent, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best work I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d She turned to study it again, tapping the hammer against her palm. \u201cProbably the best I\u2019ll ever do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll arrange for a crate.\u201d He tossed her a look over his shoulder. She was pale as wax, he noted, with the fatigue her bustling brain had yet to transmit to her body. \u201cAnd handle the shipping personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to build one. It wouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d Her mood was so festive, she didn\u2019t even take offense. \u201cAnd it\u2019d be quicker for me to build one than for you to have one built. I already have the dimensions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll use your phone and arrange for a truck. Your phone does work, I assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarcasm\u201d\u2014chuckling, she crossed to him\u2014\u201cbecomes you. So does that impeccably proper tie.\u201d</p><p>Before either of them had a chance to think, she grabbed his tie and hauled him toward her. Her warm mouth fixed on his, stunning him into immobility. Her free hand slid into his hair, gripped as her body pressed close. The kiss sizzled, sparked, smoldered. Then as quickly as she had initiated it, she broke away.</p><p>\u201cJust a whim,\u201d she said, and smiled up at him. Her heart might have been jolting like a rabbit in her chest, but she would think about that later. \u201cBlame it on sleep deprivation and excess energy. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>He snagged her arm before she could turn away. She wouldn\u2019t get away so easily, he thought. Wouldn\u2019t paralyze him one moment and shrug it off the next.</p><p>\u201cI have a whim of my own,\u201d he murmured. As he slid a hand around to cup the back of her neck, he watched her eyes register wary surprise. She didn\u2019t resist. He thought he saw a hint of amusement on her face before he lowered his mouth to hers.</p> <p>The amusement faded quickly. This kiss was soft, sweet, sumptuous. As unexpected as rose petals in the blaze of a furnace, it cooled and soothed and aroused all at once. She thought she heard a sound, something between a whimper and a sigh. The fact that it had slipped from her own burning throat amazed her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t draw away, not even when the sound came again, quiet and helpless and beguiled. No, she didn\u2019t pull away. His mouth was too clever, too gently persuasive. She opened herself to it and absorbed.</p><p>She seemed to melt against him, degree by slow degree. That first blast of heat had mellowed, ripened into a low, long burn. He forgot that he\u2019d been angry, or that he\u2019d been challenged, and knew only that he was alive.</p><p>She tasted dark, dangerous, and his mouth was full of her. His mind veered toward taking, toward conquering, toward ravishing. The civilized man in him, the one who had been raised to follow a strict code of ethics, stepped back, appalled.</p><p>Her head reeled. She placed a hand down on the workbench for balance as her legs buckled. One long breath followed by another helped clear her vision. And she saw him staring at her, a mixture of hunger and shock in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she managed, \u201cthat\u2019s certainly something to think about.\u201d</p><p>It was foolish to apologize for his thoughts, Rogan told himself. Ridiculous to blame himself for the fact that his imagination had drawn erotic and vivid pictures of throwing her to the floor and tearing away flannel and denim. He hadn\u2019t acted on it. He\u2019d only kissed her.</p><p>But he thought it was possible, even preferable, to blame her.</p><p>\u201cWe have a business relationship,\u201d he began tersely. \u201cIt would be unwise and possibly destructive to let anything interfere with that at this point.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, rocked back on her heels. \u201cAnd sleeping together would confuse things?\u201d</p><p>Curse her for making him sound like a fool. Curse her twice for leaving him shaken and horribly, horribly needy. \u201cAt this point I think we should concentrate on launching your show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She turned away on the pretext of tidying the workbench. In truth she needed a moment to settle herself. She wasn\u2019t promiscuous by any means, and certainly didn\u2019t tumble into bed with every man who attracted her. But she liked to think of herself as independent enough, liberated enough and smart enough to choose her lovers with care.</p><p>She had, she realized, chosen Rogan Sweeney.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou annoyed me.\u201d</p><p>Her wide, generous mouth curved. \u201cSince I seem to be doing that on a regular basis, we\u2019ll be spending a lot of time with our lips locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of control.\u201d He knew he sounded stiff and prim, and hated her for it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have just buckets of it. I don\u2019t.\u201d She tossed her head, folded her arms over her chest. \u201cIf I decide I want you, what are you going to do about it? Fight me off?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019ll come to that.\u201d The image brought on twinges of humor and desperation. \u201cWe both need to concentrate on the business at hand. This could be the turning point in your career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It would be wise to remember that, she thought. \u201cSo we\u2019ll use each other, professionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll enhance each other, professionally,\u201d he corrected. Christ, he needed air. \u201cI\u2019ll go in and call for that truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan.\u201d She waited until he reached the door and turned back to her. \u201cI\u2019d like to go with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo Dublin? Today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can be ready to go by the time the truck arrives. I only need to make one stop, at my sister\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She was as good as her word. Even as the shipment chugged away she was tossing a suitcase into the back of Rogan\u2019s rented car.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just give me ten minutes,\u201d she said as Rogan started down the narrow lane, \u201cI\u2019m sure Brie has some tea or coffee on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He stopped the car by Blackthorn and went with Maggie up the walk.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t knock, but stepped inside and headed straight toward the kitchen in the back. Brianna was there, a white bib apron tied at her waist and her hands coated with flour.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Sweeney, hello. Maggie. You\u2019ll have to excuse the mess. We have guests and I\u2019m making pies for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Brianna picked up a tea towel to dust off her hands. \u201cI thought the show was next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019m going early. Is she in her room?\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s polite smile strained a bit at the edges. \u201cYes. Why don\u2019t I go tell her you\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her myself. Perhaps you could give Rogan some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She cast one worried look at Maggie as her sister walked out of the kitchen into the adjoining apartment. \u201cIf you\u2019ll make yourself comfortable in the parlor, Mr. Sweeney, I\u2019ll bring you some coffee right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble.\u201d His curiosity was up. \u201cI\u2019ll have a cup right here, if I won\u2019t be in your way.\u201d He added an easy smile. \u201cAnd please, call me Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it black as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a good memory.\u201d And you\u2019re a bundle of nerves, he observed, watching Brianna reach for a cup and saucer.</p><p>\u201cI try to remember the preferences of my guests. Would you have some cake? It\u2019s a bit of chocolate I made yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe memory of your cooking makes it difficult to refuse.\u201d He took a seat at the scrubbed wood table. \u201cYou do it all yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I...\u201d She heard the first raised voice and fumbled. \u201cI do. I\u2019ve a fire laid in the parlor. Are you sure you wouldn\u2019t be more comfortable?\u201d</p> <p>The clash of voices from the next room rose, bringing a flush of embarrassment to Brianna\u2019s cheeks. Rogan merely lifted his cup. \u201cWho\u2019s she shouting at this time?\u201d</p><p>Brianna managed a smile. \u201cOur mother. They don\u2019t get on very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Maggie get along with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when it suits her. But she has a heart, a wonderful, generous heart. It\u2019s only that she guards it so carefully.\u201d Brianna sighed. If Rogan wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the shouting, neither would she be. \u201cI\u2019ll cut you that cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never change.\u201d Maeve stared at her oldest child through narrowed eyes. \u201cJust like your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s an insult to me, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Maeve sniffed and brushed at the lace cuffs of her bed gown. The years and her own dissatisfactions had stolen the beauty of her face. It was puffy and pale, with lines dug deeply around the pursed mouth. Her hair, once as golden as sunlight, had faded to gray and was scraped back ruthlessly into a tight bun.</p><p>She was plumped onto a mountain of pillows, her Bible at one hand and a box of chocolates at the other. The television across the room murmured low.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s Dublin, is it? Brianna told me you were going off. Frittering money away on hotels, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you won\u2019t let me forget it.\u201d Bitterness reared as Maeve pushed up in bed. For her whole life, someone else had held the purse strings, her parents, her husband, and now, most demeaning of all, her own daughter. \u201cTo think of all he tossed away on you, buying you glass, sending you off to that foreign country. And for what? So you could play at being an artist and superior to the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tossed nothing away on me. He gave me the chance to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I stayed on the farm, working my fingers to the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never worked a blessed day in your life. It was Brianna who did it all while you took to your bed with one ailment after another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I enjoy being delicate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Maggie said with relish. \u201cI think you revel in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cross to bear.\u201d Maeve picked up her Bible, pressed it to her chest like a shield. She had paid for her sin, she thought. A hundred times over she had paid for it. Yet if forgiveness had come, comfort had not. \u201cThat and an ungrateful child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to be grateful for? The fact that you complained every day of your life? That you made your dissatisfaction for my father and your disappointment in me clear with every word, every look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave birth to you!\u201d Maeve shouted. \u201cI nearly died giving you life. And because I carried you in my womb, I married a man who didn\u2019t love me, and who I didn\u2019t love. I sacrificed everything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrificed?\u201d Maggie said wearily. \u201cWhat sacrifices have you made?\u201d</p><p>Maeve cloaked herself in the bitter rage of her pride. \u201cMore than you know. And my reward was to have children who have no love for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think because you got pregnant and married to give me a name, I should overlook everything you\u2019ve done? Everything you haven\u2019t done?\u201d Like love me even a little, Maggie thought, and ruthlessly pushed the ache away. \u201cIt was you on your back, Mother. I was the result, not the cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you speak to me that way?\u201d Maeve\u2019s face flushed hot, her fingers dug into the blankets. \u201cYou never had any respect, any kindness, any compassion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Because her eyes were stinging, Maggie\u2019s voice was sharp as a whip. \u201cAnd it\u2019s that lack I inherited from you.

If I find you have, I\u2019ll stop the allowance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d take food out of my mouth?\u201d</p><p>Maggie leaned over to tap the box of chocolates. \u201cYes. Be sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor thy father and thy mother.\u201d Maeve hugged the Bible close. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking a commandment, Margaret Mary, and sending your soul to hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll give up my place in heaven rather than live a hypocrite on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret Mary!\u201d Maeve shouted when Maggie had reached the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll never amount to anything. You\u2019re just like him. God\u2019s curse is on you, Maggie, for being conceived outside the sacrament of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw no sacrament of marriage in my house,\u201d Maggie tossed back. \u201cOnly the agony of it. And if there was a sin in my conception, it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the door behind her, then leaned back against it a moment to steady herself.</p><p>It was always the same, she thought. They could never be in the same room together without hurling insults. She had known, since she was twelve, why her mother disliked her, condemned her. Her very existence was the reason Maeve\u2019s life had turned from dream to harsh reality.</p> <p>A loveless marriage, a seven-month baby and a farm without a farmer.</p><p>It was that her mother had thrown in her face when Maggie had reached puberty.</p><p>It was that they had never forgiven each other for.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she walked back into the kitchen. She didn\u2019t know her eyes were still angry and overbright or her face pale. She walked to her sister and kissed her briskly on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you from Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d There was too much to say, and nothing to say. Brianna only squeezed her hands. \u201cI wish I could be there for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could if you wished it enough. Rogan, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He rose. \u201cGoodbye, Brianna. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just walk you\u2014\u201d Brianna broke off when her mother called out.</p><p>\u201cGo see to her,\u201d Maggie said, and walked quickly out of the house. She was yanking at the door of Rogan\u2019s car when he laid a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d With a final tug, she jerked the door open and climbed inside.</p><p>He hurried around the hood and slipped onto the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cMaggie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. Anything at all. There\u2019s nothing you can do or say to change what\u2019s always been. Just drive the car and leave me alone. It would be a great favor to me.\u201d She began to weep then, passionately, bitterly, while he struggled with the urge to comfort her and the wish to comply with her request.</p> <p>In the end, he drove, saying nothing, but holding her hand. They were nearing the airport when her sobs died and her tensed fingers went limp. Glancing over, he saw she was sleeping.</p><p>She didn\u2019t awaken when he carried her inside his company jet, or when he settled her in a seat. Nor did she awaken all through the flight as he watched her. And wondered.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>MAGGIE awoke in the dark. The only thing she was certain of in those first groggy minutes was that she wasn\u2019t in her own bed. The scent of the sheets, the texture of them was wrong. She didn\u2019t have to sleep on fine linen habitually to recognize the difference, or to notice the faint, restful scent of verbena that clung to the pillowslip in which she\u2019d buried her face.</p><p>As an uncomfortable thought zeroed into her brain, she stretched out a cautious hand to make certain she was the only occupant of the bed. The mattress flowed on, a veritable lake of smooth sheets and cozy blankets. An empty lake, thank Jesus, she thought, and rolled over to the center of the bed.</p><p>Her last clear memory was of crying herself empty in Rogan\u2019s car, and the hollow feeling that had left her drifting like a broken reed in a stream.</p><p>A good purge, she decided, for she felt incredibly better\u2014steady and rested and clean.</p><p>It was tempting to luxuriate in the soft dark on soft sheets with soft scents. But she decided she\u2019d best find out where she was and how she\u2019d arrived. After sliding her way over to the edge of the bed, she groped around the smooth wood of the night table, eased her fingers over and up until she located a lamp and its switch.</p><p>The light was gently shaded, a warm golden hue that subtly illuminated a large bedroom with coffered ceiling, dainty rosebud wallpaper and the bed itself, a massive four-poster.</p><p>The veritable queen of beds, she thought with a smile. A pity she\u2019d been too tired to appreciate it.</p><p>The fireplace across the room was unlit, but scrubbed clean as a new coin and set for kindling. Long-stemmed pink roses, fresh as a summer morning, stood in a Waterford vase on a majestic bureau along with a silver brush set and gorgeous little colored bottles with fancy stoppers.</p><p>The mirror above it reflected Maggie, rumpled and heavy-eyed among the sheets.</p><p>You look a bit out of place, my girl, she decided, and grinning, tugged on the sleeve of her cotton nightshirt. Someone, it seemed, had had the good sense to change her before dumping her into the royal bed.</p><p>A maid perhaps, or Rogan himself. It hardly mattered, she thought practically, since the deed was done and she\u2019d certainly benefited from it. In all likelihood, her clothes were gracing the carved rosewood armoire. As out of place there, she decided with a chuckle, as she was in the glorious lake of smooth linen sheets.</p><p>If she was in a hotel, it was certainly the finest that had ever had her patronage. She scrambled up, stumbled toward the closest door over a deep-piled Aubusson.</p><p>The bath was as sumptuous as the bedroom, all gleaming rose and ivory tiles, a huge tub fashioned for lounging and a separate shower constructed from a wavy glass block. With a sigh of pure greed, she stripped off her nightshirt and turned on the spray.</p><p>It was heaven, the hot water beating on the back of her neck, her shoulders, like the firm fingers of an expert masseuse. A far cry from the stingy trickle her own shower managed at home. The soap smelled of lemon and glided over her skin like silk.</p><p>She saw with some amusement that her few meager toiletries had been set out on the generous counter by the shell-shaped pink sinks. Her robe, such as it was, hung on a brass hook beside the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, someone was taking care of her, she realized, and at the moment she could find no cause for complaint.</p><p>After a steamy fifteen minutes while the water ran hot, she reached for one of the thick towels folded over a warming bar. It was big enough to wrap her from breast to calf.</p><p>She combed her wet hair back from her face, made use of the cream in a crystal decanter, then exchanged the towel for her tattered flannel robe.</p><p>Barefoot and curious, she set out to explore.</p> <p>Her room was off a long wide hall. Low lights tossed shadows over the gleaming floor and its regal red runner. She heard not a sound as she wandered toward the stairs that curved graciously up to another story, and down. She chose down, letting her fingers play along the polished railing.</p><p>Quite obviously she wasn\u2019t a guest in a luxury hotel, but in a private home. Rogan\u2019s home, she concluded, with an envious glance at the art that graced the foyer and main hall. The man had a Van Gogh and a Matisse, she realized as her mouth watered.</p><p>She found the front parlor, with its wide windows open to the balmy night, a sitting room, its chairs and sofas arranged in conversation groupings. Across the hall was what she supposed would be called the music room, as it was dominated by a grand piano and a gilded harp.</p><p>Beautiful it all was, with enough artwork to keep Maggie entranced for days. But at the moment she had another priority.</p><p>She wondered how long she would have to search before she found the kitchen.</p> <p>The light under a door drew her closer. When she looked in, she saw Rogan seated behind a desk, papers arranged in tidy piles before him. It was a two-level room, with his desk on the first and steps leading up to a small sitting area. The walls were lined with books.</p><p>Acres of them, she thought at a glance, in a room smelling of leather and beeswax. The room was done in burgundies and dark woods that suited the man as much as it suited the literature.</p><p>She watched him, interested in the way he scanned the page in front of him, made quick, decisive notes. He was, for the first time in their acquaintance, without a suit coat or tie. He\u2019d been wearing them, certainly, she mused, but now his collar was unbuttoned, the sleeves of his crisp shirt rolled up to the elbows.</p><p>His hair, glinting darkly in the lamplight, was a bit mussed. As if he\u2019d run his hands impatiently through it while he worked. Even as she watched he did so again, raking the fingers through, scowling a bit.</p><p>Whatever he was working on absorbed him, for he worked in a steady, undistracted rhythm that was, in some odd way, fascinating.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a man to let his mind wander, she thought. Whatever he chose to do, he would do with the utmost concentration and skill.</p> <p>She remembered the way he had kissed her. Concentration and skill indeed.</p><p>Rogan read the next clause in the proposal and frowned. The wording wasn\u2019t quite right. A modification...He paused, considered, crossed out a phrase and reworded it. The expansion of his factory in Limerick was crucial to his game plan, and needed to be implemented before the end of the year.</p><p>Hundreds of jobs would be created, and with the construction of moderate-income apartments that a subsidiary of Worldwide was planning, hundreds of families would have homes as well.</p><p>One branch of the business would feed directly into the other, he thought. It would be a small but important contribution to keeping the Irish\u2014sadly, his country\u2019s biggest export\u2014in Ireland.</p><p>His mind circled around the next clause, had nearly zeroed in, when he caught himself drifting. Something pulled at his brain, distracting it from the business at hand. Rogan glanced toward the doorway and saw it was not something, but someone.</p><p>He must have sensed her standing there, barefoot and sleepy-eyed in a ratty gray robe. Her hair was slicked back, shining red fire, in a style that should have been severe but instead was striking.</p><p>Unadorned and fresh-scrubbed, her face was like ivory with a blush of rose beneath. Her lashes were spiked with damp around her slumberous eyes.</p><p>His reaction was swift and brutal and human. Even as the heat blasted through him he checked it, ruthlessly.</p> <p>\u201cSorry to interrupt.\u201d She flashed him a quick, cheeky smile that tortured his already active libido. \u201cI was looking for the kitchen. I\u2019m half-starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly a wonder.\u201d He was forced to clear his throat. Her voice was husky, as sleepily sexy as her eyes. \u201cWhen did you eat last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain.\u201d Leaning lazily on the doorjamb, she yawned. \u201cYesterday, I think. I\u2019m still a bit foggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you slept yesterday. All of yesterday\u2014from the time we left your sister\u2019s\u2014and all of today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust past eight\u2014Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She walked into the room and curled up in a big leather chair across from his desk, as if she\u2019d been joining him there for years.</p><p>\u201cDo you often sleep for thirty-odd hours straight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019ve been up too long.\u201d She stretched her arms high to work out kinks she was just beginning to feel. \u201cSometimes a piece grabs you by the throat and it won\u2019t let you go until you\u2019ve finished.\u201d</p><p>Resolutely, he shifted his gaze from the flesh the fall of her robe had revealed, and looked down blindly at the paperwork before him. He was appalled that he would react like some hormone-mad teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, in your line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you\u2019re not tired. You\u2019re almost unbearably alert. When you\u2019ve simply worked too long, you lose the edge. You have to stop, rest. This is different. And when I\u2019m done, I fall down and stay down until I\u2019ve slept it off.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cThe kitchen, Rogan? I\u2019m ravenous.\u201d</p><p>Instead of an answer, he reached for the phone and punched in a number. \u201cMiss Concannon is awake,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019d like a meal. In the library, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s grand,\u201d she said when he replaced the receiver. \u201cBut I could have scrambled myself some eggs and saved your staff the bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re paid to bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her voice was dry as dust. \u201cHow smug you must be to have round-the-clock servants.\u201d She waved a hand before he could answer. \u201cBest we don\u2019t get into that on an empty stomach. Tell me, Rogan, how exactly did I come to be in that big bed upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put you there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d If he was hoping for a blush or stutter, he\u2019d be disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept like a stone. At one point I nearly held a mirror up to your lips to be certain you were alive.\u201d She was certainly alive now, vibrant in the lamplight. \u201cDo you want a brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not, before I\u2019ve eaten.\u201d</p><p>He rose, went to a sideboard and poured a single snifter from a decanter. \u201cYou were upset before we left.\u201d</p> <p>She cocked her head. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a fine and diplomatic way of phrasing it.\u201d The weeping spell didn\u2019t embarrass her. It was simply emotion, passion, as real and as human as laughter or lust. But she remembered that he had held her hand and had offered no useless words to stem the storm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>She had, miserably, but he shrugged it off. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t, and don\u2019t.\u201d She took a quiet breath because her voice had been sharp. He didn\u2019t deserve such rudeness after his kindness. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you, Rogan, just old family miseries. Since I\u2019m feeling mellow, I\u2019ll tell you it was comforting to have you hold my hand. I didn\u2019t think you were the type to offer.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicked back to hers. \u201cIt seems to me we don\u2019t know each other well enough to generalize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself a quick and accurate judge, but you may be right. So tell me\u201d\u2014she propped an elbow on the arm of the chair, cocked her chin on her fist\u2014\u201cwho are you, Rogan Sweeney?\u201d</p> <p>He was relieved when the need to answer was postponed by the arrival of her dinner. A tidy, uniformed maid wheeled in a tray, settling it in front of Maggie with no more than a whisper of sound and a jingle of silverware. She bobbed once when Maggie thanked her, then disappeared the moment Rogan told her that would be all.</p><p>\u201cAh, what a scent.\u201d Maggie attacked the soup first, a rich, thick broth swimming with chunks of vegetables. \u201cDo you want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve eaten.\u201d Rather than go back around the desk, he sat in the chair beside hers. It was oddly cozy, he realized, to sit with her while she ate and the house seemed to settle quietly around them. \u201cSince you\u2019re back among the living, perhaps you\u2019d like to go by the gallery in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d She nodded, her mouth full of crusty roll. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight\u2014I have appointments midmorning, but I can take you in and leave a car at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car at my disposal.\u201d Tickled, she pressed a fist to her mouth as she laughed. \u201cOh, I could get used to that quick enough. And what would I do with the car at my disposal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat you like.\u201d God knew why her reaction annoyed him, but it did. \u201cOr you can wander around Dublin on foot, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit touchy this evening, are we?\u201d She moved from the soup to the entr\u00e9e of honeyed chicken. \u201cYour cook\u2019s a treasure, Rogan. Do you think I can charm this recipe out of him\u2014or her\u2014for Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re welcome to try. He\u2019s French, insolent and given to tantrums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have all but nationality in common. Tell me, will I be moving to a hotel tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought about that, a great deal. It would certainly be more comfortable for him if she were tucked away in a suite at the Westbury. More comfortable, he thought, and much more dull. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay in the guest room if it suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt suits me down to the ground.\u201d She studied him as she speared a tiny new potato. He looked relaxed here, she realized. Very much the complacent king of the castle. \u201cIs it just you in this big house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cDoes that worry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry me? Oh, you mean because you might come knocking on my door one lustful night?\u201d She chuckled, infuriating him. \u201cI\u2019m able to say yes or no, Rogan, the same as you would be if I came knocking on yours. I only asked because it seems a lot of room for one man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my family home,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a fine place it is.\u201d She pushed the tray back and rose to go to the small sideboard. Lifting the top of a decanter, she sniffed. Sighed at the fine scent of Irish whiskey. After pouring herself a glass, she came back and curled up her legs. \u201cSl\u00e1inte,\u201d she said, and tossed the whiskey back. It set a good, strong fire kindling in her gut.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019ll do me. One warms the soul, two warms the brain, my father often said. I\u2019m in the mood for a cool head.\u201d She set the empty glass on the tray, shifted her body more comfortably. Her frayed flannel robe slid open at the curve of her knee. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a businessman, as you remind me with regularity.\u201d He settled back, making a determined effort not to let his mind or his gaze wander to her bare legs. \u201cThird generation. Born and bred in Dublin, with love and respect for art nurtured in me from the cradle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that love and respect was augmented by the idea of making a profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d He swirled his brandy, sipped, and looked exactly like what he was. A man comfortable with his own wealth and content with his life. \u201cWhile making a profit brings its own sense of satisfaction, there\u2019s another, more spiritual satisfaction that comes from developing and promoting a new artist. Particularly one you believe in passionately.\u201d</p><p>Maggie touched her tongue to her top lip. He was entirely too confident, she decided, much too sure of himself and his place in the world. All that tidy certainty begged for a bit of shaking.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m here to satisfy you, Rogan?\u201d</p><p>He met her amused eyes, nodded. \u201cI have no doubt you will, Maggie, eventually. On every level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant, really, to steer them onto this boggy ground, but it seemed irresistible, sitting with him in the quiet room with her body so rested, her mind so alert. \u201cYour choice of time and place, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s traditional, I believe, for the man to choose when to advance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHah!\u201d Bristling, she leaned over to jab a finger in his chest. Any thoughts she\u2019d had of easing into romance vanished like smoke. \u201cStuff your traditions in your hat and wear it well. I don\u2019t cater to them. You might be interested to know that as we approach the twenty-first century, women are doing their own choosing. The fact is we\u2019ve been doing so since time began, those of us sharp enough, and men are just catching on to it.\u201d She plopped back in her chair. \u201cI\u2019ll have you, Rogan, in my time, and in my place.\u201d</p><p>It baffled him why such an incredible statement should both arouse him and make him uneasy. \u201cYour father was right, Maggie, about you getting the brass. You have it to spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of it? Oh, I know your type.\u201d Contempt colored her tone. \u201cYou like a woman to sit quietly by, mooning a bit, catering to your whims, to be sure, and hoping, while her romantic heart beats desperately in her breast, that you\u2019ll look twice in her direction. She\u2019ll be proper as a saint in public, never a sour word slipping through her rosy lips. Then, of course, when you\u2019ve decided on that time and that place, she\u2019s to transform herself into a veritable tiger, indulging your most prurient fantasies until the lights switch on again and she turns into a door-stop.\u201d</p><p>Rogan waited to be sure she\u2019d run down, then hid a smile in his brandy. \u201cThat sums it up amazingly well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShrew,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cWould you care for some dessert?\u201d</p><p>The chuckle tickled her throat, so she set it free. Who would have thought she\u2019d actually come to like him? \u201cNo, damn you. I\u2019ll not drag that poor maid away again from her television or her flirtation with the butler or however she spends her evenings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy butler is seventy-six, and well safe from flirtations with a maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot you know.\u201d Maggie rose again and wandered toward a wall of books. Alphabetized by author, she noted, and nearly snorted. She should have known. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maid\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know my maid\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Maggie stroked a finger down a volume of James Joyce. \u201cNo, I want to see if you know your maid\u2019s name. It\u2019s a test.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, closed it again, grateful that Maggie\u2019s back was to him. What difference did it make if he knew the name of one of his maids? Colleen? Maureen? Hell! The domestic staff was his butler\u2019s domain. Bridgit? No, damn it, it was...</p><p>\u201cNancy.\u201d He thought\u2014was nearly certain. \u201cShe\u2019s fairly new. I believe she\u2019s been here about five months. Would you like me to call her back in for an introduction?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Casually, Maggie moved from Joyce to Keats. \u201cIt was a curiosity to me, that\u2019s all. Tell me, Rogan, do you have anything in here other than classics? You know, a good murder mystery I might pass some time with?\u201d</p><p>His library of first editions was considered one of the finest in the country, and she was criticizing it for lacking a potboiler. With an effort, he schooled his temper and his voice. \u201cI believe you\u2019ll find some of Dame Agatha\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe British.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNot bloodthirsty enough as a rule\u2014unless they\u2019re sacking castles like those damn Cromwellians. What\u2019s this?\u201d She bent down, peered. \u201cThis Dante\u2019s in Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you read it, or is it just for show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can fumble through it well enough.\u201d</p><p>She passed by it, hoping for something more contemporary. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick up as much of the language as I should have in Venice. Plenty of slang, little of the socially correct.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder and grinned. \u201cArtists are a colorful lot in any country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d He rose and crossed to another shelf of books. \u201cThis might be more what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d He offered Maggie a copy of Thomas Harris\u2019s Red Dragon. \u201cI believe several people are murdered horribly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d She tucked the book under her arm. \u201cI\u2019ll say good night then so you can get back to work. I\u2019m grateful for the bed and the meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He sat behind his desk again, lifted a pen and ran it through his fingers while he watched her. \u201cI\u2019d like to leave at eight sharp. The dining room\u2019s down this hall and to the left. Breakfast will be served anytime after six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee it won\u2019t be served to me at that hour, but I\u2019ll be ready at eight.\u201d On impulse she crossed to him, placed her hands on the arms of his chair and leaned her face close to his. \u201cYou know, Rogan, we\u2019re precisely what each other doesn\u2019t need or want\u2014on a personal level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. On a personal level.\u201d Her skin, soft and white where the flannel parted at her throat, smelled like sin.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why, to my way of thinking, we\u2019re going to have such a fascinating relationship. Barely any common ground at all, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than a toehold.\u201d His gaze lowered to her mouth, lingered, rose to hers again. \u201cA shaky one at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like dangerous climbs.\u201d She leaned forward a little more, just an inch, and nipped his bottom lip with her teeth.</p><p>A spear of fire arrowed straight to his loins. \u201cI prefer having my feet on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She leaned back again, leaving him with a tingle on his lips and the heat in his gut. \u201cWe\u2019ll try it your way first. Good night.\u201d</p><p>She strolled out of the room without looking back. Rogan waited until he was certain she was well away before he lifted his hands and scrubbed them over his face.</p><p>Good Christ, the woman was tying him into knots, slippery tangled knots of pure lust. He didn\u2019t believe on acting on lust alone, at least not since his adolescence. He was, after all, a civilized man, one of taste and breeding.</p><p>He respected women, admired them. Certainly he\u2019d developed relationships that had culminated in bed, but he\u2019d always tried to wait until the relationships had developed before making love. Reasonably, mutually and discreetly. He wasn\u2019t an animal to be driven by instinct alone.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even certain he liked Maggie Concannon as a person. So what kind of man would he be if he did what he was burning to do at this moment? If he stalked up those stairs, threw open the door to her bedroom and ravished her good and proper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A satisfied man, he thought with grim humor.</p><p>At least until morning when he had to face her, and himself, and the business they had to complete.</p><p>Perhaps it was more difficult to take the high road. Perhaps he would suffer, as he was damn well certain she expected him to. But when the time came for him to take her to bed, he would have the upper hand.</p><p>That, most certainly, was worth something.</p> <p>Even, he thought as he shoved papers aside, a miserably sleepless night.</p><p>Maggie slept like a baby. Despite the images evoked by the novel Rogan had given her, she\u2019d dropped off to sleep just after midnight and had slept dreamlessly until nearly seven.</p><p>Flushed with energy and anticipation, she searched out the dining room and was pleased to see a full Irish breakfast warming on the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, miss.\u201d The same maid who had served her the night before scurried in from the kitchen. \u201cIs there anything I can get for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, no. I can serve myself.\u201d Maggie picked up a plate from the table and moved toward the tempting scents on the sideboard.</p> <p>\u201cShall I pour you coffee or tea, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea would be lovely.\u201d Maggie took the lid off a silver warmer and sniffed appreciately at the thick rashers of bacon. \u201cNancy, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss, it\u2019s Noreen.\u201d</p><p>Failed that test, Squire Sweeney, Maggie mused. \u201cWould you tell the cook, Noreen, that I\u2019ve never had a better meal than my dinner last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to, miss.\u201d</p><p>Maggie moved from server to server, heaping her plate. She often skipped meals altogether, so indifferent was her own cooking. But when food was available in such quantity, and food of such quality, she made up for it.</p> <p>\u201cWill Mr. Sweeney be joining me for breakfast?\u201d she asked as she carried her plate back to the table.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already eaten, miss. Mr. Sweeney breakfasts every day at half-six, precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA creature of habit, is he?\u201d Maggie winked at the maid and slathered fresh jam on her warmed toast.</p><p>\u201cHe is, yes,\u201d Noreen answered, flushing a bit. \u201cI\u2019m to remind you, miss, he\u2019ll be ready to leave at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Noreen, I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only to ring if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Quiet as a mouse, Noreen faded back into the kitchen. Maggie applied herself to a breakfast she felt was fit for a queen and perused the copy of the Irish Times that had been neatly folded beside her plate.</p><p>A cozy way to live, she supposed, with servants only the snap of a finger away. But didn\u2019t it drive Rogan mad to know they were always about the house? That he was never alone?</p> <p>The very idea made her wince. She\u2019d go mad for sure, Maggie decided, without solitude. She looked over the room with its dark and glossy wainscoting, the glitter from the twin crystal chandeliers, the gleam from the silver on the antique sideboard, the sparkle of china and Waterford glass.</p><p>Yes, even in this lush setting, she\u2019d go stark, raving mad.</p><p>She lingered over a second cup of tea, read the paper from back to front and cleaned every crumb from her plate. From somewhere in the house a clock chimed the hour. She debated having just one more serving of bacon, called herself a glutton and resisted.</p><p>She took a few moments to study the art on the walls. There was a watercolor she found particularly exquisite. Taking a last, leisurely turn around the room, she started out, down the hall.</p><p>Rogan stood in the foyer, immaculate in a gray suit and navy tie. He studied her, studied his watch. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight past the hour.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her brows, saw he was serious and dutifully muffled a chuckle. \u201cI should be flogged.\u201d</p><p>He skimmed a gaze up her, from the half boots and dark leggings to the mannish white shirt that reached to midthigh and was cinched with two leather belts. Glittering translucent stones swung at her ears, and she had, for once, added a touch of makeup. She hadn\u2019t, however, bothered with a watch.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t wear a timepiece, how can you be on time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a point there. Perhaps that\u2019s why I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Still watching her, he took out a pad and his pen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoting down that we have to supply you with a watch, as well as a phone-answering machine and a calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous of you, Rogan.\u201d She waited until he opened the door and gestured her out. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe watch so you\u2019ll be prompt. The answering machine so I\u2019ll at least be able to leave a damn message when you ignore the phone, and the calendar so you\u2019ll know what the bloody day is when I request a shipment.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d bitten off the last word as if it were stringy meat, Maggie thought. \u201cSince you\u2019re in such a bright and cheerful mood this morning, I\u2019ll risk telling you that none of those things will change me a whit. I\u2019m irresponsible, Rogan. You\u2019ve only to ask what\u2019s left of my family.\u201d She turned around, ignoring his hiss of impatience, and studied his house.</p><p>It overlooked a lovely, shady green\u2014St. Stephen\u2019s, she was to learn later\u2014and stood proudly, a trifle haughtily, against a dreamy blue sky.</p><p>Though the stone was aged, the lines were as graceful as a young woman\u2019s body. It was a combination of dignity and elegance Maggie knew only the rich could afford. Every window, of which there were many, glistened like diamonds in the sun. The lawn, smooth and green, gave way to a lovely front garden, tidy as a church and twice as formal.</p><p>\u201cA pretty spot you have here. I missed it, you know, on my way in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. You\u2019ll have to wait for the tour, Margaret Mary. I don\u2019t like to be late.\u201d He took her arm and all but dragged her to the waiting car.</p><p>\u201cDo you get docked for tardiness, then?\u201d She laughed when he said nothing, and settled back to enjoy the ride. \u201cAre you by nature surly of a morning, Rogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surly,\u201d he snapped at her. Or he wouldn\u2019t be, he thought, if he\u2019d gotten above two hours\u2019 sleep. And the responsibility for that, damn all women, fell solidly on her head. \u201cI have a lot to accomplish today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, to be sure. Empires to build, fortunes to win.\u201d</p><p>That did it. He didn\u2019t know why, but the light undertone of disdain broke the last link on control. He swerved to the side of the road, causing the driver who had been cruising behind him to blast rudely on his horn. Grabbing Maggie by the collar, he hauled her half out of her seat and crushed his mouth to hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t been expecting quite that reaction. But that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t enjoy it. She could meet him on even ground when he wasn\u2019t quite so controlled, quite so skillful. Her head might have spun, but the sensation of power remained. No seduction here, only raw needs, rubbing together like live wires and threatening to flare.</p><p>He dragged her head back and plundered her mouth. Just once, he promised himself. Only once to relieve some of this vicious tension that coiled inside him like a snake.</p><p>But kissing her didn\u2019t relieve it. Instead, the complete and eager response of her, the total verve of it, wrapped his tension only tighter until he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>For a moment he felt as though he were being sucked into some velvet-lined, airless tunnel. And he was terrified that he\u2019d never want or need light again.</p> <p>He jerked away, fastened his hands like vises on the wheel. He eased back onto the road like a drunk trying to negotiate a straight line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that was an answer to something.\u201d Her voice was unnaturally quiet. It wasn\u2019t his kiss that had unnerved her nearly as much as the way he had ended it.</p><p>\u201cIt was that or throttle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer being kissed to strangled. Still, I\u2019d like it better if you weren\u2019t angry about wanting me.\u201d</p><p>He was calmer now, concentrating on the road and making up the time she\u2019d cost him that morning. \u201cI explained myself before. The timing\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInappropriate. And who\u2019s in charge of propriety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer knowing whom I\u2019m sleeping with. Having some mutual affection and respect.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way between a kiss on the lips and a tumble in the sheets, Sweeney. I\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m not one to leap onto the mattress at the blink of an eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, didn\u2019t you, now?\u201d She was all the more insulted because she knew how quickly she would have leaped onto a mattress with him. \u201cAs far as I can see, you\u2019ve decided I\u2019m plenty loose enough. Well, I won\u2019t be explaining my past history to you. And as for affection and respect, you\u2019ve yet to earn them from me, boy-o.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then. We\u2019re agreed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re agreed you can go straight to hell. And your maid\u2019s name is Noreen.\u201d</p><p>That distracted him enough to have him taking his eyes off the road and staring. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour maid, you dolt, you narrow-nosed aristocrat. \u2019Tisn\u2019t Nancy. It\u2019s Noreen.\u201d Maggie folded her arms and stared resolutely out the side window.</p><p>Rogan only shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to you for clearing that up. God knows what an embarrassment it would have been to me if I\u2019d had to introduce her to the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue-blooded snob,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWasp-tongued viper.\u201d</p><p>They settled into an angry silence for the rest of the drive.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>IT was impossible not to be impressed by Worldwide Gallery, Dublin. The architecture alone was worth a visit to the place. Indeed, photographs of the building had appeared in dozens of magazines and art books around the world as a shining example of the Georgian style that was part of Dublin\u2019s architectural legacy.</p><p>Though Maggie had seen it reproduced in glossy pages, the sight of it, the sheer grandeur of it in three dimensions, took her breath away.</p><p>She\u2019d spent hours of her free time during her apprenticeship in Venice haunting galleries. But nothing compared in splendor with Rogan\u2019s.</p><p>Yet she made no comment at all while he unlocked the imposing-looking front doors and gestured her inside.</p><p>She had to resist the urge to genuflect, such was the churchlike quiet, the play of light, the scented air in the main room. The Native American display was beautifully and carefully mounted\u2014the pottery bowls, the gorgeous baskets, the ritual masks, shaman rattles and beadwork. On the walls were drawings at once primitive and sophisticated. Maggie\u2019s attention and her admiration focused on a buckskin dress the color of cream, adorned with beads and smooth, bright stones. Rogan had ordered it hung like a tapestry. Maggie\u2019s fingers itched to touch.</p><p>\u201cImpressive\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted you approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen American Indian work outside of books and such.\u201d She leaned over a water vessel.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely why I wanted to bring the display to Ireland. We too often focus on European history and culture and forget there\u2019s more to the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to believe people who could create this would be the savages we see in those old John Wayne movies. Then again\u201d\u2014she smiled as she straightened\u2014\u201cmy ancestors were savage enough, stripping naked and painting themselves blue before they screamed into battle. I come from that.\u201d She tilted her head to study him, the perfectly polished businessman. \u201cWe both do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could say that such tendencies become more diluted in some than in others over the centuries. I haven\u2019t had the urge to paint myself blue in years.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but he was already checking his watch again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re using the second floor for your work.\u201d He started toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cFor any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor several particular reasons.\u201d Impatience shimmering like a wave of heat around him, he paused until she joined him on the staircase. \u201cI prefer a show like this to have some sense of a social occasion. People tend to appreciate art, at least feel it\u2019s more accessible, if they\u2019re relaxed and enjoying themselves.\u201d He stopped at the top of the steps, lifting a brow at her expression. \u201cYou\u2019ve a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like people to take my work seriously, not think of it as a party favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, they\u2019ll take it seriously.\u201d Particularly with the prices he\u2019d decided to demand for it, the strategy he intended to employ. \u201cAnd the marketing of your work is, after all, my province.\u201d He turned, sliding open double pocket doors, then stepped back so that Maggie could enter first.</p><p>She quite simply lost her voice. The wonderfully enormous room was flooded with light from the domed central skylight above. It poured down over the dark, polished floor and tossed back stunning reflections, almost mirrorlike, of the work Rogan had chosen to display. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In all of her dreams, in her wildest and most secret hopes, she\u2019d never imagined that her work would be showcased so sensitively, or so grandly.</p><p>Thick-based pedestals of creamy white marble stood around the room, lifting the glass to eye level. Rogan had chosen only twelve pieces to grace the lofty space. A canny move, she realized, as it made each piece seem all the more unique. And there, in the center of the room, glistening like ice heated by a core of fire, was Maggie\u2019s Surrender.</p><p>There was a dull ache in her heart as she studied the sculpture. Someone would buy it, she knew. Within days someone would pay the price Rogan was asking and steal it completely and finally from her life.</p><p>The price of wanting more, she thought, seemed to be the loss of what you already had. Or perhaps of what you were.</p> <p>When she said nothing, only walked through the room with her boots echoing, Rogan stuck his hands in his pockets. \u201cThe smaller pieces are displayed in what we call the upper sitting rooms. It\u2019s a more intimate space.\u201d He paused, waiting for some response, then hissed through his teeth when he received none. Damn the woman, he thought. What did she want? \u201cWe\u2019ll have an orchestra at the show. Strings. And champagne and canapes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Maggie managed. She kept her back to him, wondering why she should stand in such a magnificent room and want to weep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you to attend, at least for a short time. You needn\u2019t do or say anything that would compromise your artistic integrity.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was beating much too loudly for her to catch his tone of annoyance. \u201cIt looks...\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of a word. Simply couldn\u2019t. \u201cFine,\u201d she said lamely. \u201cIt all looks fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She turned back, sober-eyed and, for the first time in recent memory, terrified. \u201cYou have a nice aesthetic sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nice aesthetic sense,\u201d he repeated, amazed at her tepid response. \u201cWell, Margaret Mary, I\u2019m so gratified. It\u2019s only taken three incredibly difficult weeks and the combined efforts of more than a dozen highly qualified people to make everything look \u2018fine.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She ran an unsteady hand through her hair. Couldn\u2019t he see she was speechless, that she was completely out of her realm and scared as a rabbit faced by a hound? \u201cWhat do you want me to say? I\u2019ve done my job and given you the art. You\u2019ve done yours and utilized it. We\u2019re both to be congratulated, Rogan. Now perhaps I should look about in your more intimate rooms.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, blocking her path as she started for the doorway. The fury that rose up in him was so molten, so intense, he was surprised it didn\u2019t melt her glass into puddles of shine and color.</p><p>\u201cYou ungrateful peasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA peasant, am I?\u201d Emotions swirled inside her, contradictory and frightening. \u201cYou\u2019re right enough on that, Sweeney. And if I\u2019m ungrateful because I don\u2019t fall at your feet and kiss your boots, then it\u2019s ungrateful I\u2019ll stay. I don\u2019t want or expect any more from you than what it said in your cursed contracts with your bloody exclusive clauses, and you\u2019ll get no more from me.\u201d</p> <p>She could feel the hot tears boiling up, ready to erupt. She was certain that if she didn\u2019t get out of the room quickly, her lungs would quite simply collapse from the strain. In her desperation to escape, she shoved at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I expect.\u201d He snagged her shoulder, whirled her around. \u201cAnd what I\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Joseph said from the doorway. \u201cI seem to be interrupting.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have been more amused, or more fascinated, as he watched his coolheaded boss spit fire and rage at the small, dangerous-eyed woman whose fists had already raised as if for a bout.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Using every ounce of willpower, Rogan released Maggie\u2019s arm and stepped back. In the wink of an eye, he had gone from fury to calmness. \u201cMiss Concannon and I were just discussing the terms of our contract. Maggie Concannon, Joseph Donahoe, the curator of this gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure.\u201d All charm, Joseph stepped forward to take Maggie\u2019s hand. Though it trembled a bit, he kissed it lavishly, dashingly, and set his gold tooth flashing with a grin. \u201cA pure pleasure, Miss Concannon, to meet the person behind the genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a pleasure for me, Mr. Donahoe, to meet a man so sensitive to art, and to the artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving Maggie in your capable hands, Joseph. I have appointments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be doing me an honor, Rogan.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes twinkled as he kept Maggie\u2019s hand lightly in his.</p><p>The gesture wasn\u2019t lost on Rogan, nor was the fact that Maggie made no move to break the contact. She was, in fact, smiling up at Joseph flirtatiously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only to tell Joseph when you require the car,\u201d Rogan said stiffly. \u201cThe driver\u2019s at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rogan,\u201d she said without looking at him. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure Joseph can keep me entertained for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d rather spend the day,\u201d Joseph quickly put in. \u201cHave you seen the sitting rooms, Miss Concannon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, no. You\u2019ll call me Maggie, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d His hand still linked with hers, Joseph drew her through the doorway. \u201cI believe you\u2019ll appreciate what we\u2019ve done here. With the showing only days away, we want to be certain you\u2019re happy. Any suggestions you have will be most welcomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be a change.\u201d Maggie paused, glanced over her shoulder to where Rogan remained standing. \u201cDon\u2019t let us keep you from your business, Rogan. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pressing.\u201d With a toss of her head, she beamed at Joseph. \u201cI know a Francis Donahoe, from near Ennis. A merchant he is, with the same look around the eyes as you. Would you be related?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve cousins in Clare, on my father\u2019s side, and my mother\u2019s. They\u2019d be Ryans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know scores of Ryans. Oh.\u201d She stopped, sighed as she stepped through an archway into a tidy little room complete with fireplace and love seat. Several of her smaller pieces, including the one Rogan had bought at their first meeting, graced the antique tables.</p><p>\u201cAn elegant setting, I think.\u201d Joseph moved inside to switch on the recessed lighting. The glass jumped into life under the beams, seemed to pulse. \u201cThe ballroom makes a breathless statement. This, a delicate one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cDo you mind if I sit a moment, Joseph? For the truth is I have lost my breath.\u201d She settled on the love seat and closed her eyes. \u201cOnce when I was a child, my father bought a billy goat, with some idea of breeding. I was in the field with it one morning, paying it no mind, and it got its dander up. Butted me hard, he did, and sent me flying. I felt just that way when I stepped into that other room. As if something had butted me hard and sent me flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous, are you?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw the understanding in Joseph\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m frightened to death. And damned if I\u2019ll let himself know it. He\u2019s so damned cocksure, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s confident, our Rogan. And with reason enough. He\u2019s got an uncanny sense for buying the right piece, or patronizing the right artist.\u201d A curious man, and one who enjoyed a good gossip, Joseph made himself comfortable beside her. He stretched out his legs, crossed them at the ankle in a posture inviting relaxation and confidence. \u201cI noticed the two of you were butting heads, so to speak, when I interrupted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t seem to have a lot of common ground.\u201d Maggie smiled a little. \u201cHe\u2019s pushy, our Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough, but usually in such a subtle way one doesn\u2019t know one\u2019s been pushed.\u201d</p><p>Maggie hissed through her teeth, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been subtle with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Interesting. You know, Maggie, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be giving away any corporate secrets if I told you Rogan was determined to sign you with Worldwide. I\u2019ve worked for him for more than ten years, and never recall seeing him more focused on a single artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should be flattered.\u201d She sighed and closed her eyes again. \u201cI am, most of the time, when I\u2019m not busy being infuriated with his bossy ways. Always prince to peasant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s used to having things his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he won\u2019t be having me his way.\u201d She opened her eyes and rose. \u201cWill you show me the rest of the gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to. And perhaps you\u2019ll tell me the story of your life.\u201d</p><p>Maggie cocked her head and studied him. A mischief maker, she thought, with his dreamy eyes and piratical demeaner. She\u2019d always enjoyed a mischief-making friend. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said, and linked her arm through his as they strolled through the next archway. \u201cThere once was a farmer who wanted to be a poet....\u201d</p><p>There were just too damn many people in Dublin for Maggie\u2019s taste. You could hardly take a step without bumping into someone. It was a pretty city, she couldn\u2019t deny it, with its lovely bay and spearing steeples. She could admire the magnificence of its architecture, all the red brick and gray stone, the charm of its colorful storefronts.</p><p>She was told by her driver, Brian Duggin, that the early Dubliners had a sense of order and beauty as keen as their sense of profit. And so, she thought, the city suited Rogan even as he suited it.</p> <p>She settled back in the quiet car to admire the dazzling front gardens and copper cupolas, the shady greens and the busy River Liffey, which split the city in two.</p><p>She felt her pulse quicken to the pace around her, respond to the crowds and the hurry. But the bustle excited her only briefly before it exhausted. The sheer number of people on O\u2019Connell Street, where everyone seemed to be in a desperate rush to get somewhere else, made her yearn for the lazy, quiet roads of the west.</p><p>Still, she found the view from O\u2019Connell Bridge spectacular, the ships moored at the quays, the majestic dome of the Four Courts glinting in the sun. Her driver seemed happy enough to obey her request simply to cruise, or to pull over and wait while she walked through parks and squares.</p><p>She stopped on Grafton Street among the smart shops and bought a pin for Brianna, a simple silver crescent with a curve of garnets. It would, Maggie thought as she tucked the box in her purse, suit her sister\u2019s traditional taste.</p><p>For herself, she mooned briefly over a pair of earrings, long twists of gold and silver and copper, accented top and bottom with fire opals. She had no business spending good money on such frivolous baubles. No business at all, she reminded herself, when she had no real guarantee when she might sell another piece.</p><p>So, of course, she bought the earrings, and sent her budget to the devil.</p><p>To round off her day, she visited museums, wandered along the river and had tea in a tiny shop off FitzWilliam Square. She spent her last hour watching the sunlight and reflections from Half Penny Bridge and sketching in a pad she\u2019d picked up in an art store.</p><p>It was after seven when she returned to Rogan\u2019s house. He came out of the front parlor and stopped her before she\u2019d reached the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d begun to wonder if you\u2019d had Duggin drive you all the way back to Clare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of it once or twice.\u201d She pushed back her untidy hair. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve visited Dublin.\u201d She thought of the juggler she\u2019d seen, and of course, of her father. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how noisy it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, no.\u201d If she didn\u2019t count the biscuit she\u2019d had with her tea.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s ordered for seven-thirty, but I can have it put back until eight if you\u2019d like to join us for cocktails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother. She\u2019s anxious to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Maggie\u2019s mood plummeted. Someone else to meet, to talk to, to be with. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hold you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. If you\u2019d like to change, we\u2019ll be in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange for what?\u201d Resigned, she tucked her sketchbook under her arm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I left all my formal attire at home. But if my appearance embarrasses you, I can have a tray in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth, Maggie.\u201d Taking her firmly by the arm, Rogan steered her into the parlor. \u201cGrandmother.\u201d He addressed the woman sitting regally in the high back brocaded chair. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Margaret Mary Concannon. Maggie, Christine Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn absolute delight.\u201d Christine offered a fine-boned hand, accented with one gleaming sapphire. Matching ones dripped from her ears. \u201cI take full credit for you being here, my dear, as I bought the first piece of your work that intrigued Rogan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.

Why, the girl was striking, she thought. All cream and fire, as eye-catching in a shirt and tights as dozens of women would attempt to be in diamonds and silks.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, Mrs. Sweeney, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine it.\u201d She accepted the glass from Rogan and hoped its contents would be enough to brace her for an evening of making conversation.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you thought of the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. A cathedral to art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Christine reached out again, squeezing Maggie\u2019s hand. \u201cHow my Michael would have loved to hear you say that. It\u2019s exactly what he wanted. He was a frustrated artist, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maggie slanted Rogan a glance. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to paint. He had the vision, but not the aptitude. So he created the atmosphere and the means to celebrate others who did.\u201d Christine\u2019s smoky silk suit rustled as she sat back. \u201cHe was a wonderful man. Rogan takes after him, in looks and temperament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must make you very proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. As I\u2019m sure what you\u2019ve done with your life has made your family proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know as pride\u2019s quite the word.\u201d Maggie sipped her drink, discovered Rogan had served her sherry and struggled not to grimace. Fortunately, the butler came to the doorway at that moment to announce dinner.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s handy.\u201d Grateful, Maggie set her glass aside. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go straight in.\u201d Rogan offered his grandmother his arm. \u201cJulien is delighted you\u2019re enjoying his cuisine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s a fine cook, that\u2019s the truth. I wouldn\u2019t have the heart to tell him I\u2019m such a poor one myself I\u2019ll eat anything I don\u2019t have to prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t mention it.\u201d Rogan drew out a chair for Christine, then for Maggie.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Maggie agreed. \u201cSince I\u2019ve decided to try to barter some of Brie\u2019s recipes for his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie is Maggie\u2019s sister,\u201d Rogan explained as the soup course was served. \u201cShe runs a B-and-B in Clare, and from personal experience, I can attest that her cuisine is excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your sister\u2019s an artist in the kitchen rather than the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Maggie agreed, finding herself much more comfortable in Christine Sweeney\u2019s company than she\u2019d expected to be. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic touch Brianna has with hearth and home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Clare, you say.\u201d Christine nodded as Rogan offered her wine. \u201cI know the area well. I come from Galway myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Surprise and pleasure flitted across Maggie\u2019s face. It was another reminder to her of how much she missed home. \u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGalway City. My father was in shipping. I met Michael through his business deals with my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own grandmother\u2014on my mother\u2019s side\u2014came from Galway.\u201d Though under most circumstances, Maggie would rather eat than talk, she was enjoying the combination of excellent food and conversation. \u201cShe lived there until she married. That would be about sixty years ago. She was a merchant\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so. And her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was Sharon Feeney before her marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon Feeney.\u201d Christine\u2019s eyes brightened, as deep now and as sparkling as her sapphires. \u201cDaughter of Colin and Mary Feeney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. You knew her, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I did. We lived minutes from each other. I was a bit younger than she, but we spent time together.\u201d Christine winked at Maggie, then looked at Rogan to draw him into the conversation. \u201cI was madly in love with Maggie\u2019s great-uncle Niall, and used Sharon shamelessly to be around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you needed to use nothing and no one to get any man\u2019s attention,\u201d Rogan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve a sweet tongue.\u201d Christine laughed and patted his hand. \u201cMind yourself around this one, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t waste much sugar on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt dissolves in vinegar,\u201d Rogan retorted in the most pleasant of tones.</p><p>Deciding to ignore him, Maggie turned back to Christine. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my uncle in years, but I\u2019ve heard he was a fine, handsome man in his youth, and had a way with the ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was, and he did.\u201d Christine laughed again, and the sound was young and g*y. \u201cI spent many a night dreaming of Niall Feeney when I was a girl. The truth is\u201d\u2014she turned her brilliant eyes on Rogan, and there was a hint of mischief in them that Maggie admired\u2014\u201cif Michael hadn\u2019t come along and swept me off my feet, I\u2019d have fought to the death to marry Niall. Interesting, isn\u2019t it? You two might have been cousins had things worked out differently.\u201d</p><p>Rogan glanced at Maggie, lifted his wine. Horrifying was all he could think. Absolutely horrifying.</p><p>Maggie snickered and polished off her soup. \u201cNiall Feeney never married, you know, and lives a bachelor\u2019s life in Galway. Perhaps, Mrs. Sweeney, you broke his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d The bone-deep beauty so evident in Christine Sweeney\u2019s face was enhanced by a flattering blush. \u201cBut the sad truth is, Niall never noticed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he blind, then?\u201d Rogan asked, and earned a beaming smile from his grandmother.</p><p>\u201cNot blind.\u201d Maggie sighed at the scents as the fish course was set before her. \u201cBut a man perhaps more foolish than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd never married, you say?\u201d Christine\u2019s inquiry, Rogan noted with a slight frown, was perhaps just a tad too casual.</p><p>\u201cNever. My sister corresponds with him.\u201d A wicked twinkle gleamed in Maggie\u2019s eye. \u201cI\u2019ll have her mention you in her next letter. We\u2019ll see if his memory\u2019s better than his youthful judgment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Though her smile was a bit dreamy, Christine shook her head. \u201cFifty-five years it\u2019s been since I left Galway for Dublin, and for Michael. Sweet Mary.\u201d</p><p>The thought of the passing years brought a pleasant sadness, the same she might have felt on watching a ship sail out of port. She still missed her husband, though he\u2019d been gone for more than a dozen years. In an automatic gesture Maggie found touching, Christine laid a hand over Rogan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSharon married a hotelier, did she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, yes, and was widowed for the last ten years of her life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But she had her daughter to comfort her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. But I don\u2019t know as she was a comfort.\u201d The dregs of bitterness interfered with the delicate flavor of the trout in Maggie\u2019s mouth. She washed them away with wine.</p><p>\u201cWe wrote for several years after Sharon married. She was very proud of her girl. Maeve, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Maggie tried to envision her mother as a girl, and failed.</p><p>\u201cA lovely child, Sharon told me, with striking golden hair. The temper of a devil, she would say, and the voice of an angel.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie swallowed hurriedly, gaped. \u201cThe voice of an angel? My mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. Sharon said she sang like a saint and wanted to be a professional. I believe she was, at least for a time.\u201d Christine paused, thinking, while Maggie simply stared. \u201cYes, I know she was. In fact she came up to Gort to sing, but I couldn\u2019t get down to see her. I had some clippings Sharon sent me, must have been thirty years past.\u201d She smiled, curious. \u201cShe no longer sings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maggie let out a quiet baffled breath. She had never heard her mother raise her voice in anything other than complaint or criticism. A singer? A professional, with a voice like an angel? Surely they must be speaking of different people.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Christine went on, \u201cI imagine she was happy raising her family.\u201d</p><p>Happy? That was surely a different Maeve Feeney Concannon than had raised her. \u201cI suppose,\u201d Maggie said slowly, \u201cshe made her choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we all do. Sharon made hers when she married and moved from Galway. I must say I missed her sorely, but she loved her Johnny, and her hotel.\u201d</p> <p>With an effort, Maggie put thoughts of her mother aside. She would have to pick through them later, carefully. \u201cI remember Gran\u2019s hotel from childhood. We worked there one summer, Brie and I, as girls. Tidying and fetching. I didn\u2019t take to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fortunate thing for the art world.\u201d</p><p>Maggie acknowledged Rogan\u2019s compliment. \u201cPerhaps, but it was certainly a relief to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never asked you how you became interested in glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s mother had a vase\u2014Venetian glass it was, flute-shaped, of pale, hazy green. The color of leaves in bud. I thought it was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen. She told me it had been made with breath and fire.\u201d Maggie smiled at the memory, lost herself in it a moment, so that her eyes became as hazy as the vase she described. \u201cIt was like a fairy tale to me. Using breath and fire to create something you could hold in your hand. So she brought me a book that had pictures of a glass house, the workers, the pipes, the furnaces. I think from that moment there was nothing else I wanted to do but make my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan was the same,\u201d Christine murmured. \u201cSo sure at such a young age of what his life would be.\u201d She let her gaze wander from Maggie to her grandson and back. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve found each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d Rogan agreed, and rang for the next course.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>MAGGIE couldn\u2019t stay away from the gallery. There seemed to be no reason to. Joseph and the rest of the staff were welcoming enough, even going so far as asking for her opinion on some of the displays.</p><p>However much it might have pleased her, she couldn\u2019t improve on Rogan\u2019s eye for detail and placement. She left the staff to carry out his orders and set herself up unobtrusively to sketch the Native American artwork.</p><p>It fascinated her\u2014the baskets and headdresses, the meticulous beading, the intricacies of the ritual masks. Ideas and visions leaped around in her head like gazelles, bounding, soaring, so that she rushed to transfer them to paper.</p><p>She preferred burying herself in work to everything else. Whenever she took too much time to think, her mind veered back to what Christine had told her about Maeve. Just how much, she\u2019d wondered, was beneath the surface of her parents\u2019 lives that she\u2019d been ignorant of? Her mother with a career, her father loving some other woman. And the two of them trapped\u2014because of her\u2014in a prison that had denied them their deepest wishes.</p><p>She needed to find out more, and yet she was afraid, afraid that whatever she learned would only further demonstrate the fact that she hadn\u2019t really known the people who had created her. Hadn\u2019t known them at all.</p><p>So she put that need aside and haunted the gallery.</p><p>When no one objected, she used Rogan\u2019s office as a temporary studio. The light was good, and as the room was tucked away in the back of the building, she was rarely disturbed. Roomy, it was not. Obviously Rogan had elected to utilize every space he could find for the showing of art.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with that decision.</p><p>She covered his gleaming walnut desk with a sheet of plastic and thick pads of newspaper. The charcoal-and-pencil sketches she had made were only a start. She worked now by adding splashes of color. She\u2019d picked up a few acrylics in a shop near the gallery, but often her impatience with the imperfections of her materials caused her to use other materials at hand, and she would dip her brush into coffee dregs or dampened ashes, or stroke bolder lines with lipstick or eyebrow pencils.</p><p>She considered her sketches merely a first step. While she believed herself an adequate enough draftsman, Maggie would never have termed herself a master with brush and paint. This was only a way to keep her vision alive from conception to execution. The fact that Rogan had arranged for several of her sketches to be matted and hung for the show embarrassed her more than pleased her.</p><p>Still, she reminded herself that people would buy anything if they were made to believe in its quality and value.</p><p>She\u2019d become a cynic, she thought, narrowing her eyes as she studied her work. And a bean counter as well, tallying up profits before they were made. God help her, she\u2019d been caught up in the gossamer dream Rogan had spun, and she\u2019d hate herself, even more than she would hate him, if she went back home a failure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did failure run in her blood? she wondered. Would she be like her father and fail to achieve the goal that mattered most to her? She was so intent on her work, and on her darkening thoughts, that she hissed in surprise and annoyance as the office door opened.</p><p>\u201cOut! Out! Do I have to lock the damn thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d Rogan closed the door at his back. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn experiment in nuclear physics,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d Frustrated by the interruption, she blew her choppy bangs out of her eyes and glared. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe this gallery, which includes this office, belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no forgetting that.\u201d Maggie dipped her brush in a mixture of paint she\u2019d daubed on an old board. \u201cNot with the first words out of everyone\u2019s mouth around here being Mr. Sweeney this and Mr. Sweeney that.\u201d Inspired by this little verbal foray, she washed color over the thick paper she\u2019d tacked to another board.</p><p>As she did so his gaze dropped from her face to her hands, and for a moment he was struck speechless. \u201cWhat in sweet hell are you about?\u201d Dumbfounded, he lunged forward. His priceless and well-loved desk was covered with paint-splattered newspapers, jars of brushes, pencils and\u2014unless he had very much mistaken the sharp smell\u2014bottles of turpentine. \u201cYou\u2019re a madwoman. Do you realize this desk is a George II?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sturdy piece,\u201d she responded, with no respect for the dead English king. \u201cYou\u2019re in my light.\u201d Distracted, she waved a paint-flecked hand at him. He avoided it out of instinct. \u201cAnd well protected,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve a sheet of plastic under the newspaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, that makes it all right, then.\u201d He grabbed a handful of her hair and tugged ruthlessly. \u201cIf you\u2019d wanted a bloody easel,\u201d he said when they were nose to nose, \u201cI\u2019d have provided you with one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an easel, only a bit of privacy. So if you\u2019d make yourself scarce, as you\u2019ve done brilliantly for the past two days\u2014\u201d She gave him a helpful shove. They both looked down at the bold red smudges she\u2019d transferred to his pin-striped lapel.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d His eyes narrowed into dangerous cobalt slits when she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Truly.\u201d But the apology was diluted by a strangled laugh. \u201cI\u2019m messy when I work, and I forgot about my hands. But from what I\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve a warehouse full of suits. You won\u2019t be missing this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not.\u201d Quick as a snake, he dipped his fingers in paint and smeared it over her face. Her squeal of surprise was intensely satisfying. \u201cThe color becomes you.\u201d</p><p>She swiped the back of her hand over her cheek and spread the paint around. \u201cSo you want to play, do you?\u201d Laughing, she snatched up a tube of canary yellow.</p> <p>\u201cIf you dare,\u201d he said, torn between anger and amusement, \u201cI\u2019ll make you eat it, tube and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Concannon never ignores a challenge.\u201d Her grin spread as she prepared to squeeze. Retaliation on both sides was interrupted as the office door opened.</p><p>\u201cRogan, I hope you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d The elegant woman in the Chanel suit broke off, pale blue eyes widening. \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d Obviously baffled, she smoothed back her soft swing of sable hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were...engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour interruption\u2019s timely.\u201d Cool as a spring breeze, Rogan ripped a sheet of newspaper and rubbed at the paint on his fingertips. \u201cI believe we were about to make fools of ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, Maggie thought, setting aside the tube of paint with a ridiculous sense of regret. But it would have been fun.</p><p>\u201cPatricia Hennessy, I\u2019d like to present Margaret Mary Concannon, our featured artist.\u201d</p><p>This? Patricia thought, though her fragile, well-bred features revealed nothing but polite interest. This paint-smeared, wild-haired woman was M. M. Concannon? \u201cHow lovely to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Miss Hennessy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Missus,\u201d Patricia told her with the faintest of smiles. \u201cBut please call me Patricia.\u201d</p><p>Like a single rose behind glass, Maggie thought, Patricia Hennessy was lovely, delicate and perfect. And, she mused, studying the elegant oval face, unhappy. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of your way in a moment or two. I\u2019m sure you want to talk to Rogan alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurry on my account.\u201d Patricia\u2019s smile curved her lips but barely touched her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve just been upstairs with Joseph, admiring your work. You have an incredible talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Maggie snatched Rogan\u2019s handkerchief from his breast pocket.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d The order died on his lips as she soaked the Irish linen in turpentine. With something resembling a snarl, he took it back and scrubbed the rest of the paint from his hands. \u201cMy office seems to have been temporarily transformed into an artist\u2019s garret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure and I\u2019ve never worked in a garret in me life,\u201d Maggie announced, deliberately broadening her brogue. \u201cI\u2019ve annoyed himself by disturbing sacred ground here, don\u2019t you know. If you\u2019ve been acquainted with Rogan long, you\u2019ll understand he\u2019s a finicky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finicky,\u201d he said between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d Maggie responded with a roll of the eyes. \u201cA wild man he is, as unpredictable as the colors of a sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sense of organization and control is not generally considered a flaw. A complete lack of it normally is.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d turned toward each other again, effectively, if unintentionally, closing Patricia out, even in the small room. There was tension in the air, and it was obvious to Patricia. She couldn\u2019t forget the time when he had desired her keenly. She couldn\u2019t forget it because she was in love with Rogan Sweeney.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve come at a bad time.\u201d She hated the fact that her voice was stiff with formality.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rogan\u2019s scowl was easily transformed into a charming smile as he turned to her. \u201cIt\u2019s always a delight to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just dropped in thinking you might be done with business for the day. The Carneys invited me for drinks and hoped you could join us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Patricia.\u201d Rogan looked down at his ruined handkerchief, then dropped it onto the spread-out sheets of newspaper. \u201cWith the show tomorrow, I\u2019ve dozens of details yet to see to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Maggie shot Rogan a wide grin. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to interfere with your social hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault\u2014I\u2019ve simply other obligations.

We\u2019ll hope for the best. Good day to you, Patricia.\u201d Maggie hummed to herself as she cleaned her brushes. \u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d she commented after Patricia left. \u201cOld friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld married friend.\u201d</p><p>He only lifted a brow at the implication. \u201cAn old widowed friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA very significant response.\u201d For reasons he couldn\u2019t fathom, he became defensive. \u201cI\u2019ve known Patricia for more than fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, you\u2019re a slow one, Sweeney.\u201d Propping a hip on the desk, Maggie tapped a pencil to her lips. \u201cA beautiful woman, of obvious taste\u2014a woman of your own class, I may add, and in fifteen years you haven\u2019t made a move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA move?\u201d His tone iced like frost on glass. \u201cA particularly unattractive phrase, but ignoring your infelicitous phrasing for the moment, how do you know I haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch things show.\u201d With a shrug, Maggie eased off the desk. \u201cIntimate relationships and platonic ones give off entirely different signals.\u201d Her look softened. He was, after all, only a man. \u201cI\u2019ll wager you think you\u2019re terribly good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dolt.\u201d She felt a rush of sympathy for Patricia. \u201cShe\u2019s more than half in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>The idea, and the casually confident way Maggie presented it, took him aback. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing absurd about it is that you haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d Briskly, she began to gather her supplies. \u201cMrs. Hennessy has my sympathy\u2014or part of it. Hard for me to offer it all when I\u2019m interested in you myself, and I don\u2019t fancy the idea of you popping from her bed to mine.\u201d</p><p>She was, he thought, exasperated, the damnedest woman. \u201cThis is a ridiculous conversation, and I have a great deal of work to do.\u201d</p><p>It was rather endearing, the way his voice could go so grandly formal. \u201cOn my account at that, so I shouldn\u2019t be holding you up. I\u2019ll spread these drawings out in the kitchen to dry, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they\u2019re out of my way.\u201d And their creator with them, he thought. He made the mistake of glancing down, focusing. \u201cWhat have you done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade a bit of a mess, as you\u2019ve already pointed out, but it\u2019ll tidy quick enough.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he picked up one of her drawings by the edges. He could see clearly what had inspired her, how she meant to employ the Native American art and turn it into something boldly and uniquely her own.</p><p>No matter how much or how often she exasperated him, he was struck time and again by her talent.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been wasting time, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the little things we have in common. Do you want to tell me what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you understand pride and beauty very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good compliment, Rogan.\u201d She smiled over it. \u201cA very good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour work exposes you, Maggie, and makes you all the more confusing. Sensitive and arrogant, compassionate, pitiless. Sensual and aloof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re saying I\u2019m moody, I won\u2019t argue.\u201d The tug came again, quick and painful. She wondered if there would come a time when he would look at her the way he looked at her work. And what they would create between them when, and if, he did. \u201cIt\u2019s not a flaw to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only makes you difficult to live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has to but myself.\u201d She lifted a hand, disconcerting him by stroking it down his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of sleeping with you, Rogan, and we both know it. But I\u2019m not your proper Mrs. Hennessy, looking for a husband to guide the way.\u201d</p><p>He curled his fingers around her wrist, surprised and darkly pleased when her pulse bumped unsteadily. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>She should have had the answer. It should have been on the tip of her tongue. But she\u2019d lost it somewhere between the question and the hard, fast stroke of her own heart. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I find out.\u201d She leaned forward, rising on her toes to brush her mouth over his. \u201cBut that does fine for now.\u201d</p><p>She took the painting from him and gathered up others.</p><p>\u201cMargaret Mary,\u201d he said as she started for the door. \u201cI\u2019d wash that paint from my face if I were you.\u201d</p><p>She twitched her nose, looked cross-eyed down at the red smear. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d she muttered, and slammed the door on her way out.</p><p>The parting shot may have soothed his pride, but he wasn\u2019t steady and bitterly resented that she could turn him inside out with so little effort. There was simply no time for the complications she could cause in her personal life. If there were time, he would simply drag her off to some quiet room and empty all of this frustration, this lust, this maddening hunger, into her until he was purged of it.</p><p>Surely once he\u2019d taken control of her, or at least of the situation, he\u2019d find his balance again.</p><p>But there were priorities, and his first, by legal contract and moral obligation, was to her art.</p><p>He glanced down at one of the paintings she\u2019d left behind. It looked hurriedly executed, carelessly brilliant, with quick strokes and bold colors demanding attention.</p><p>Like the artist herself, he mused, it simply wouldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>Deliberately he turned his back on it and started out. But the image remained, teasing his brain just as the taste of her remained, teasing his senses.</p><p>\u201cMr. Sweeney. Sir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rogan stopped in the main room, bit back a sigh. The thin, grizzled-looking man standing there, clutching a ragged portfolio, was no stranger.</p><p>\u201cAiman.\u201d He greeted the roughly dressed man as politely as he would have a silk-draped client. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been in for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working.\u201d A nervous tic worked around Aiman\u2019s left eye. \u201cI\u2019ve a lot of new work, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he had been working, Rogan mused. He\u2019d most certainly been drinking. The signs were all there in the flushed cheeks, the red-rimmed eyes, the trembling hands. Aiman was barely thirty, but drink had made him old, frail and desperate.</p> <p>He stayed just inside the door, off to the side, so that visitors to the gallery wouldn\u2019t be distracted by him. His eyes pleaded with Rogan. His fingers curled and uncurled on the old cardboard portfolio.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d have time to look, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a show tomorrow, Aiman. A large one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw it in the paper.\u201d Nervously, Aiman licked his lips. He\u2019d spent the last of the money he\u2019d earned from sidewalk sales in the pub the night before. He knew it was crazy. Worse, he knew it was stupid. Now he desperately needed a hundred pounds for rent or he\u2019d be out on the street within the week. \u201cI could leave them with you, Mr. Sweeney. Come back on Monday. I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve done some good work here. I wanted you to be the first to see it.\u201d</p><p>Rogan didn\u2019t ask if Aiman was out of money. The answer was obvious and the question would only have humiliated the man. He had shown promise once, Rogan remembered, before fears and whiskey had leveled him.</p> <p>\u201cMy office is a bit disrupted at the moment,\u201d Rogan said kindly. \u201cCome upstairs and show me what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Aiman\u2019s bloodshot eyes brightened with a smile, with hope as pathetic as tears. \u201cThank you, Mr. Sweeney. I won\u2019t take up much of your time. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to have a bit of tea.\u201d Unobtrusively, Rogan took Aiman\u2019s arm to steady him as they started upstairs. \u201cYou\u2019ll join me while we look over your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be pleased to, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>Maggie eased back so that Rogan wouldn\u2019t see her watching as he took the curve of the stairs. She\u2019d been certain, absolutely certain, that he would boot the scruffy artist out the door. Or, she mused, have one of his underlings do his dirty work for him. Instead he\u2019d invited the man to tea and had led him upstairs like a welcomed guest.</p><p>Who would have thought Rogan Sweeney had such kindness in him?</p> <p>He\u2019d buy some of the paintings as well, she realized. Enough so that the artist could keep his pride, and a meal or two in his belly. The gesture was more impressive to her, more important than a dozen of the grants and donations she imagined Worldwide made annually.</p><p>He cared. The realization shamed her even as it pleased her. He cared as much about the very human hands that created art as he did the art itself.</p><p>She went back into his office to tidy, and to try to assimilate this new aspect of Rogan to all the others.</p><p>Twenty-four hours later Maggie sat on the edge of her bed in Rogan\u2019s guest room. She had her head between her knees and was cursing herself for being vilely ill. It was humiliating to admit, even to herself, that nerves could rule her. But there was no denying it, with the nasty taste of sickness still in her throat and her body shivering with the chills.</p><p>It won\u2019t matter, she told herself again. It won\u2019t matter a whit what they think. What I think is what counts.</p><p>Oh God, oh God, why did I let myself be pulled into this?</p><p>On long, careful breaths, she raised her head. The wave of dizziness slapped her, made her grit her teeth. In the cheval glass across the room, her image shot back at her.</p><p>She was wearing nothing but her underwear, and her skin was shockingly white against the lacy black she\u2019d chosen. Her face was pasty looking, her eyes red-rimmed. A shuddering moan escaped her as she lowered her head again.</p> <p>A fine mess she looked. And it was nothing but a spectacle she was going to make of herself. She\u2019d been happy in Clare, hadn\u2019t she? It was there she belonged, alone and unfettered. Just herself and her glass, with the quiet fields and the morning mists. It was there she would be if it hadn\u2019t been for Rogan Sweeney and all his fancy words tempting her away.</p><p>He was the devil, she thought, conveniently forgetting that she\u2019d begun to change her mind about him. A monster he was, who preyed on innocent artists for his own greedy ends. He would squeeze her dry, then cast her aside like an empty tube of paint.</p><p>She would have murdered him if she\u2019d had the strength to stand.</p><p>When the knock came softly at her door, she squeezed her eyes shut. Go away, she shouted in her mind. Go away and leave me to die in peace.</p><p>It came again, followed by a quiet inquiry. \u201cMaggie, dear, are you nearly ready?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Sweeney. Maggie pressed the heels of her hands to her gritty eyes and bit back a scream. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She fought to make her voice curt and decisive, but it came out in a whimper. \u201cI\u2019m not going at all.\u201d</p><p>With a swish of silk, Christine slipped into the room. \u201cOh, sweetheart.\u201d Instantly maternal, she hurried to Maggie and draped an arm over her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, darling. It\u2019s just nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But Maggie abandoned pride and turned her face into Christine\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m just not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d Briskly, Christine lifted Maggie\u2019s face to hers. She knew exactly which button needed to be pushed, and did so, ruthlessly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to think you\u2019re afraid, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d Maggie\u2019s chin came up, but the nausea swam like oil in her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m just not interested.\u201d</p><p>Christine smiled, stroked Maggie\u2019s hair and waited.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t face it, Mrs. Sweeney,\u201d Maggie blurted out. \u201cI just can\u2019t. I\u2019ll humiliate myself, and I hate that more than anything. I\u2019d sooner be hanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand completely, but you\u2019ll not humiliate yourself.\u201d She took Maggie\u2019s frozen hands in hers. \u201cIt\u2019s true it\u2019s yourself on display as much as your work. That\u2019s the foolishness of the art world. They\u2019ll wonder about you, and talk about you and speculate. Let them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that so much\u2014though that\u2019s part of it. I\u2019m not used to being wondered over, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll like it, but it\u2019s my work....\u201d She pressed her lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s the best part of me, Mrs. Sweeney. If it\u2019s found wanting. If it\u2019s not good enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan thinks it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot he knows,\u201d Maggie muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. A lot he does know.\u201d Christine tilted her head. The child needed a bit of mothering, she decided. And mothering wasn\u2019t always kind. \u201cDo you want me to go down and tell him you\u2019re too afraid, too insecure to attend the show?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Helpless, Maggie covered her face with her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s trapped me. The tricky snake of a man. The damned greedy\u2014I beg your pardon.\u201d Going stiff, Maggie lowered her hands.</p><p>Christine made certain to swallow the chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d she said soberly. \u201cNow, you wait here and I\u2019ll go down and tell Rogan to go on without us. He\u2019s already wearing a trench in the hallway with his pacing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone so obsessed with time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Sweeney trait. Michael drove me mad with it, God bless him.\u201d She patted Maggie\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back up to help you dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sweeney.\u201d Desperate, Maggie grabbed at Christine\u2019s sleeve. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you just tell him I\u2019ve died? They could make a lovely wake out of the showing. And as a rule, you make more of a profit off a dead artist than a live one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere, you see.\u201d Christine dislodged Maggie\u2019s clutching fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling better already. Now run along and wash your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing in for your gran tonight,\u201d Christine said firmly. \u201cI believe Sharon would have wanted me to. And I said go wash your face, Margaret Mary.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Mrs. Sweeney?\u201d With no place else to go, Maggie got shakily to her feet. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell him...I mean, I\u2019d be grateful to you if you didn\u2019t mention to Rogan that I\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn one of the most important evenings of her life, a woman\u2019s entitled to linger over dressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d A ghost of a smile played around Maggie\u2019s mouth. \u201cIt makes me sound like a frivolous fool, but it\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave Rogan to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one other thing.\u201d She\u2019d been putting this off, Maggie admitted. She might as well face it now when she was feeling as low as she imagined she could possibly feel. \u201cDo you think you might be able to find those clippings you spoke of? The ones about my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I could. I should have thought of it myself. Of course, you\u2019d like to read them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, yes. I\u2019d be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that you get them. Now go fix your face. I\u2019ll scoot Rogan along.\u201d She sent Maggie a bolstering smile before closing the door.</p><p>When Christine found him, Rogan was still furiously pacing in the foyer. \u201cWhere the devil is she?\u201d he demanded the moment he spotted his grandmother. \u201cShe\u2019s been primping up there for two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course she has.\u201d Christine gestured grandly. \u201cThe impression she makes tonight is vital, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important, naturally.\u201d If she made the wrong one, his dreams would slide down the drain along with Maggie\u2019s. He needed her here, now, and ready to dazzle. \u201cBut why should it take her so long? She\u2019s only to put on her clothes and fuss with her hair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a single man too long, my darling, if you truly believe such nonsense.\u201d Affectionately, Christine reached out to straighten his already perfect tie. \u201cHow handsome you look in a tuxedo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandmother, you\u2019re stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Beaming at him, she brushed at his spotless lapels. \u201cI\u2019ve just come down to tell you to go along without us. We\u2019ll follow when Maggie\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should be ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not. Besides, how much more effective might it be if she arrived just late enough to make an entrance? You appreciate the theater of these events, Rogan.\u201d</p><p>There was truth in that. \u201cAll right then.\u201d He checked his watch, swore lightly. If he didn\u2019t go within the minute he\u2019d most certainly be late. It was his responsibility to be there, he reminded himself, to see to any last minute details, no matter how much he wanted to wait and take Maggie to the gallery himself. \u201cI\u2019ll leave her in your more than capable hands. I\u2019ll have the car come back for you as soon as I\u2019ve been dropped off. See that she\u2019s there within the hour, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can count on me, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do.\u201d He kissed her on the cheek, stepped back. \u201cBy the way, Mrs. Sweeney, I haven\u2019t mentioned how beautiful you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. I was quite deflated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be, as always, the most stunning woman in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell said. Now, run along with you and leave Maggie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d He shot one look up the stairs as he headed for the door. It was not a gentle look. \u201cI wish you good luck with her.\u201d</p><p>As the door closed Christine let out a sigh. She thought she might need all the luck she could get.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>NO detail had been overlooked. The lighting was perfect, leaping and bounding off the curves and swirls of glass. The music, a waltz now, flowed as softly as happy tears through the room. Fizzing glasses of champagne crowded the silver trays carried gracefully by liveried waiters. The sound of clinking crystal and murmuring voices set up a gracious counterpoint to the weeping violins.</p><p>It was, in a word, perfect, not a detail missing. Except, Rogan thought grimly, the artist herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, Rogan.\u201d Patricia stood beside him, elegant in a narrow white gown shivering with bugle beads. \u201cYou have a smashing success.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, smiling. \u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lingered on hers long enough, intensely enough, to make her uneasy. \u201cWhat is it? Have I smudged my nose?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lifted his own glass quickly, cursing Maggie for putting ridiculous thoughts in his head and making him wary of one of his oldest friends.</p><p>In love with him? Absurd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I suppose my mind was wandering. I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s keeping Maggie\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be along any moment.\u201d Patricia laid a hand on his arm. \u201cAnd in the meantime, everyone\u2019s being dazzled by our combined efforts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lucky thing. She\u2019s always late,\u201d he added under his breath. \u201cNo more than a child\u2019s sense of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan, dear, there you are. I see my Patricia found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mrs. Connelly.\u201d Rogan took Patricia\u2019s mother\u2019s delicate hand in his own. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see you. No gallery showing can be a success without your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer.\u201d Pleased, she swept up her mink stole. Anne Connelly held on as tightly to her beauty as she did to her vanity. She considered it as much a woman\u2019s duty to preserve her looks as it was to make a home and bear children. Ann never, never neglected her duties, and as a result, she had the dewy skin and the youthful figure of a girl. She fought a constant battle with the years and had, for half a century, emerged the victor.</p><p>\u201cAnd your husband?\u201d Rogan continued. \u201cDid Dennis come with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally, though he\u2019s already off somewhere puffing on one of his cigars and discussing finance.\u201d She smiled when Rogan signaled for a waiter and offered her a glass of champagne. \u201cEven his fondness for you doesn\u2019t change his apathy toward art. This is fascinating work.\u201d She gestured to the sculpture beside them, an explosion of color, mushrooming up from a twisted base. \u201cGorgeous and disturbing all at once. Patricia tells me she met the artist briefly yesterday. I\u2019m dying to do so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yet to arrive,\u201d Rogan covered his own impatience smoothly. \u201cYou\u2019ll find Miss Concannon as contradictory and as interesting, I think, as her work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure as fascinating. We haven\u2019t seen nearly enough of you lately, Rogan. I\u2019ve badgered Patricia unmercifully about bringing you by.\u201d She shot her daughter a veiled look that spoke volumes.</p><p>Get a move on, girl, it said. Don\u2019t let him slip away from you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been so obsessed with getting this show together quickly that I\u2019ve neglected my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, as long as we can expect you to dine with us one evening next week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Rogan caught Joseph\u2019s eye. \u201cExcuse me just a moment, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you be so obvious, Mother?\u201d Patricia murmured into her wine as Rogan slipped through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to be. Merciful heavens, girl, he treats you like a sister.\u201d Beaming a smile across the room at an acquaintance, Anne continued to speak in undertones. \u201cA man doesn\u2019t marry a woman he thinks of as his sister, and it\u2019s time you were wed again. You couldn\u2019t ask for a better match. Keep loitering around, and someone else will scoop him up from under your nose. Now smile, will you? Must you always look as though you\u2019re in mourning?\u201d</p><p>Dutifully, Patricia forced her lips to curve.</p><p>\u201cDid you reach them?\u201d Rogan demanded the moment he\u2019d cornered Joseph.</p><p>\u201cOn the car phone.\u201d Joseph\u2019s gaze skimmed the room, brushed over Patricia, lingered, then moved on. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than an hour late. Typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that we have sales on ten pieces already, and at least that many offers on Surrender.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat piece is not for sale.\u201d Rogan studied the flamboyant sculpture that stood in the center of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll tour it first, in our galleries in Rome, Paris and New York, but along with the other pieces we\u2019ve chosen it is not to be sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your decision,\u201d Joseph said easily enough. \u201cBut I should tell you that General Fitzsimmons offered us twenty-five thousand pounds for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he? Make sure that gets around, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it. In the meantime I\u2019ve been entertaining some of the art critics. I think you should...\u201d Joseph trailed off when he saw Rogan\u2019s eyes darken as he looked intently at something over his shoulder. Joseph turned, saw the object of his boss\u2019s gaze and let out a low whistle. \u201cShe may be late, but she\u2019s certainly a showstopper.\u201d</p><p>Joseph looked back at Patricia and saw from the expression on her face that she, too, had noted Rogan\u2019s reaction. His heard bled a little for the woman. He knew from personal experience how miserable it was to love someone who thought of you as only a friend.</p><p>\u201cShall I go take her around?\u201d Joseph asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u2014no. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>Rogan had never imagined Maggie could look like that\u2014sleek and stunning and sensual as sin. She\u2019d chosen black, unrelieved and unadorned. The dress took all its style from the body it covered. It draped from throat to ankle, but no one would call it prim, not with the glossy black buttons that swirled the length of it, the buttons that she\u2019d left daringly unfastened to the swell of her breast, and up to the top of one slim thigh.</p><p>Her hair was a tousled crown of fire, carelessly curled around her face. As he drew closer he saw that her eyes were already scanning, assessing and absorbing everything in the room.</p><p>She looked fearless, defiant and completely in control.</p><p>And so she was...now. The bout of nerves had served to embarrass her so much that she\u2019d beaten them back with nothing more than sheer willfulness.</p><p>She was here. And she meant to succeed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossibly late.\u201d The complaint was a last line of defense, delivered in a mutter as he took her hand and raised it to his lips. Their eyes met. \u201cAnd incredibly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou approve of the dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the word I would have chosen, but yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled then. \u201cYou were afraid I\u2019d wear boots and torn jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with my grandmother standing guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the most wonderful woman in the world. You\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The emotional force of the statement more than the words caused Rogan to study her curiously. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be. Not really, for you\u2019ve never known any different.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cWell.\u201d There were eyes on her already, dozens of them, bright with curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s into the lions\u2019 den, isn\u2019t it? You needn\u2019t worry,\u201d she said before he could speak. \u201cI\u2019ll behave. My future depends on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is only the beginning, Margaret Mary.\u201d</p><p>As he drew her into the room with its whirl of light and color, she was very much afraid he was right.</p> <p>But behave she did. The evening seemed to go well as she shook hands, accepted compliments, answered questions. The first hour seemed to float by like a dream, what with the sparkle of wine, the glitter of glass and the flash of jewels. Drifting through it was easy, as Maggie felt slightly removed from the reality, somewhat disconnected, as much audience as actor in a sumptuously produced play.</p><p>\u201cThis, ah this.\u201d A bald man with a drooping mustache and a fussy British accent expounded on a piece. It was a series of glowing blue spears trapped within a sheer glass globe. \u201cImprisoned, you call it. Your creativity, your sexuality, fighting to set itself free. Man\u2019s eternal struggle, after all. It\u2019s triumphant, even as it\u2019s melancholy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the six counties,\u201d Maggie said simply.</p><p>The bald man blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe six counties of Ireland,\u201d she repeated with a wicked rebel gleam in her eyes. \u201cImprisoned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Standing beside this would-be critic, Joseph muffled a laugh. \u201cI found the use of color here so striking, Lord Whitfield. The translucence of it creates an unresolved tension between its delicacy and its boldness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so.\u201d Lord Whitfield nodded, cleared his throat. \u201cQuite extraordinary. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Maggie watched him retreat with a broad smile. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be after buying it and setting it in his den, do you, Joseph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wicked woman, Maggie Concannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an Irishwoman, Joseph.\u201d She winked at him. \u201cUp the rebels.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed delightedly and, slipping an arm around her waist, led her around the room. \u201cAh, Mrs. Connelly.\u201d Joseph gave Maggie a subtle squeeze to signal her. \u201cLooking stunning as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph, always a smooth word. And this\u2014\u201d Anne Connelly shifted her attention from Joseph, whom she considered a mere factotum to Maggie. \u201cThis is the creative drive. I\u2019m thrilled to meet you, my dear. I\u2019m Mrs. Dennis Connelly\u2014Anne. I believe you met my daughter, Patricia, yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d Maggie found Anne\u2019s handclasp as delicate and soft as a brush of satin.</p><p>\u201cShe must be off with Rogan somewhere. They\u2019re a lovely couple, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Maggie lifted a brow. She knew a warning when she heard one. \u201cDo you live in Dublin, Mrs. Connelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do indeed. Only a few houses away from the Sweeney mansion. My family has been a part of Dublin society for generations. And you\u2019re from the west counties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely scenery. All those charming quaint villages and thatched roofs. Your family are farmers, I\u2019m told?\u201d Anne lifted a brow, obviously amused.</p> <p>\u201cWere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis must be so exciting for you, particularly with your rural upbringing. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve enjoyed your visit to Dublin. You\u2019ll be going back soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery soon, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you miss the country. Dublin can be very confusing to one unused to city life. Almost like a foreign land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I understand the language,\u201d Maggie said equably. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll enjoy your evening, Mrs. Connelly. Excuse me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>And if Rogan thought he would sell that woman anything that Maggie Concannon created, Maggie thought as she walked away, he\u2019d hang for it.</p><p>Exclusive rights be damned. She\u2019d smash every last piece into dust before she saw any in Anne Connelly\u2019s hands. Talking to her as though she were some slack-jawed milkmaid with straw in her hair.</p><p>She held her temper back as she made her way out of the ballroom and toward one of the sitting rooms. Each was crowded with people, talking, sitting, laughing, discussing her. Her head began to throb as she marched down the stairs. She\u2019d get herself a beer out of the kitchen, she decided, and have a few minutes of peace.</p><p>She strode straight in, only to come up short when she saw a portly man puffing on a cigar and nursing a pilsner.</p><p>\u201cCaught,\u201d he said, and grinned sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us then. I was coming down for a quiet beer myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me fetch you one.\u201d Gallantly, he heaved his bulk out of the chair and pulled a bottle out for her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to put out the cigar, do you?\u201d</p><p>The plea in his voice made her laugh. \u201cNot at all. My father used to smoke the world\u2019s worst pipe. Stunk to high heaven. I loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lass.\u201d He found her a beer and a glass. \u201cI hate these things.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward the ceiling. \u201cM\u2019wife drags me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty enough work, I suppose,\u201d he said as she drank. \u201cLike the colors and shapes. Not that I know a damn thing about it. Wife\u2019s the expert. But I liked the look of it, and that should be enough, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s always trying to explain it at these blasted affairs. What the artist had in mind and such. Symbolism.\u201d He rolled his tongue over the word as if it were a strange dish he wasn\u2019t quite ready to sample. \u201cDon\u2019t know what the devil they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Maggie decided the man was half-potted and that she loved him. \u201cNeither do they.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d He raised his glass and drank deeply. \u201cNeither do they. Just blustering. But if I was to say that to Anne\u2014that\u2019s my wife\u2014she\u2019d give me one of those looks.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, lowered his brows and scowled. Maggie hooted with laughter.</p><p>\u201cWho cares what they think anyway?\u201d Maggie propped her elbow on the table and held a fist to her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if anyone\u2019s life depended on it.\u201d Except mine, she thought, and pushed the idea away. \u201cDon\u2019t you think affairs like this are just an excuse for people to get all dressed up and act important?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do absolutely.\u201d So complete was his agreement that he rapped his glass sharply to hers. \u201cAs for me, do you know what I wanted to be doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting in my chair, with my feet on the hassock and Irish in my glass, watching the television.\u201d He sighed, regretfully. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t disappoint Anne\u2014or Rogan, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Rogan, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike my own son. A fine man he\u2019s turned out to be. He wasn\u2019t yet twenty when I saw him first. His father and I had business together, and the boy couldn\u2019t wait to be part of it.\u201d He gestured vaguely to encompass the gallery. \u201cSmart as a whip, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what business are you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d A female voice interrupted them. They looked up to see Patricia standing in the doorway, her hands folded neatly.</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s my love.\u201d</p> <p>While Maggie looked on, goggle-eyed, the man lunged out of his chair and enfolded Patricia in a hug that could have felled a mule. Patricia\u2019s reaction, rather than stiff rejection or cool disgust, was a quick, musical laugh.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you\u2019ll break me in half.\u201d</p><p>Daddy? Maggie thought. Daddy? Patricia Henessy\u2019s father? Anne\u2019s husband? This delightful man was married to that\u2014that icy stick of a woman? It only went to prove, she decided, that the words till death do us part were the most foolish syllables human beings were ever forced to utter.</p><p>\u201cMeet my little girl.\u201d With obvious pride, Dennis whirled Patricia around. \u201cA beauty, isn\u2019t she? My Patricia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d Maggie rose, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you. Congratulations on the wonderful success of your show.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour show?\u201d Dennis said blankly.</p><p>\u201cWe never introduced ourselves.\u201d Laughing now, Maggie stepped forward and offered Dennis her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Maggie Concannon, Mr. Connelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He said nothing for a moment as he racked his brain trying to recall if he\u2019d said anything insulting. \u201cA pleasure,\u201d he managed to say as his brain stalled.</p><p>\u201cIt was, truly. Thank you for the best ten minutes I\u2019ve had since I walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>Dennis smiled. This woman seemed downright human, for an artist. \u201cI do like the colors, and the shapes,\u201d he offered hopefully.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the nicest compliment I\u2019ve had all evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Mother\u2019s looking for you.\u201d Patricia brushed a stray ash from his lapel. The gesture, one she had carelessly used with her own father countless times, arrowed straight into Maggie\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better let her find me, then.\u201d He looked back at Maggie, and when she grinned at him, he grinned back. \u201cI hope we meet again, Miss Concannon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come up with us?\u201d Patricia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not just now,\u201d Maggie answered, not wishing to socialize further with Patricia\u2019s mother.</p><p>The bright look faded the moment their footsteps died away on the polished floor. She sat down, alone, in the light-flooded kitchen. It was quiet there, so quiet she could nearly fool herself into believing the building was empty but for her.</p><p>She wanted to believe she was alone. More, she wanted to believe the sadness she suddenly felt was just that she missed the solitude of her own green fields and quiet hills, the endless hours of silence with only the roar of her own kiln and her own imagination to drive her.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t only that. On this, one of the brightest nights of her life, she had no one. None of the chattering, brilliant crowd of people upstairs knew her, cared for her, understood her. There was no one abovestairs waiting for Maggie Concannon.</p><p>So she had herself, she thought, and rose. And that was all anyone needed. Her work was well received. It wasn\u2019t so difficult to cut through all the fancy and pompous phrases to the core. Rogan\u2019s people liked what she did, and that was the first step.</p><p>She was on her way, she told herself as she swung out of the kitchen. She was rushing down the path toward fame and fortune, the path that had eluded the Concannons for the last two generations. And she would do it all herself.</p><p>The light and the music sparkled down the staircase like fairy dust along the curve of a rainbow. She stood at the foot of the stairs, her hand clutched on the rail, her foot on the first tread. Then, with a jerk, she turned to hurry outside, into the dark.</p><p>When the clock struck one, Rogan yanked at his elegant black tie and swore. The woman, he thought as he paced the darkened parlor, deserved murder and no less. She\u2019d vanished like smoke in the middle of a crowded party arranged for her benefit. Leaving him, he remembered with boiling resentment, to make foolish excuses.</p><p>He should have known that a woman of her temperament couldn\u2019t be trusted to behave reasonably. He certainly should have known better than to give her such a prominent place in his own ambitions, his hopes for the future of his business.</p><p>How in hell could he hope to build a gallery for Irish art when the first Irish artist he\u2019d personally selected, groomed and showcased had fled her own opening like an irresponsible child?</p><p>Now it was the middle of the night, and he\u2019d not had a word from her. The brilliant success of the show, his own satisfaction with a job well done, had clouded over like her precious west county sky. There was nothing he could do but wait.</p><p>And worry.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know Dublin. For all its beauty and charm there were still sections dangerous to a woman alone. And there was always the possibility of an accident\u2014the thought of which brought on a vicious, throbbing headache at the base of his skull.</p><p>He\u2019d taken two long strides toward the phone to telephone the hospitals when he heard the click of the front door. He pivoted and rushed into the hallway.</p><p>She was safe, and under the dazzle of the foyer chandelier, he could see she was unharmed. Visions of murder leaped back into his aching head.</p><p>\u201cWhere in the sweet hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hoped he be out at some high-class club, clinking glasses with his friends. But since he wasn\u2019t, she offered him a smile and a shrug. \u201cOh, out and about. Your Dublin\u2019s a lovely city at night.\u201d</p><p>As he stared at her, his hands closed into ready fists. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019ve been out sightseeing until one in the morning?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it so late then? I must have lost track. Well then, I\u2019ll say good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cWhat you will do is give me an explanation for your behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I don\u2019t have to explain to anyone, but if you\u2019d be more clear, perhaps I\u2019d make an exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were nearly two hundred people gathered tonight for your benefit. You were unbelievably rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was nothing of the kind.\u201d More weary than she wanted to admit, she strolled past him into the parlor, slipped out of the miserably uncomfortable heels and propped her tired feet on a tassled stool. \u201cThe truth is, I was so unbelievably polite, my teeth nearly fell out of my head. I hope to Christ I don\u2019t have to smile at another bloody soul for a month. I wouldn\u2019t mind one of your brandies now, Rogan. It\u2019s chilly out this time of night.\u201d</p><p>He noticed for the first time that she wore nothing over the thin black dress. \u201cWhere the devil is your wrap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have one. You\u2019ll have to mark that down in your little book. Acquire Maggie a suitable evening wrap.\u201d She reached up for the snifter he\u2019d poured.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, your hands are frozen. Have you no sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll warm quick enough.\u201d Her brows arched as he stalked over to the fireplace and crouched down to start a fire. \u201cWhat, no servants?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up. The one thing I won\u2019t tolerate from you tonight is sarcasm. I\u2019ve taken all I plan to take.\u201d</p><p>Flames licked into life to eat greedily at dry wood. In the shifting light Maggie saw that his face was tight with anger. The best way to meet temper, she\u2019d always thought, was to match it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given you nothing to take.\u201d She sipped the brandy, would have sighed over the welcome heat of the liquor if she and Rogan hadn\u2019t been glaring at each other. \u201cI went to your showing, didn\u2019t I? In a proper dress, with a proper foolish smile pasted on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your showing,\u201d he shot back. \u201cYou ungrateful, selfish, inconsiderate brat.\u201d</p><p>However weary her body, she wouldn\u2019t allow him to get away with such language. She stood rigidly and faced him. \u201cI won\u2019t contradict you. I\u2019m exactly as you say, and have been told so most of my life. Fortunately for both of us, it\u2019s only my work you have to be concerned about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea the time and effort and expense that went into putting that show together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your province.\u201d Her voice was as stiff as her spine. \u201cAs you\u2019re always so quick to tell me. And I was there, stayed above two hours, rubbing elbows with strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better learn that a patron is never a stranger, and that rudeness is never attractive.\u201d</p><p>The quiet, controlled tone cut through her defensive armor like a sword. \u201cI never agreed to stay the whole evening. I needed to be alone, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to wander the streets all night? I\u2019m responsible for you while you\u2019re here, Maggie. For God\u2019s sake, I\u2019d nearly called out the garda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for me, I am.\u201d But she could see now that it wasn\u2019t simply anger darkening his eyes, but concern as well. \u201cIf I caused you worry, I\u2019ll apologize. I simply went for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out strolling and left your first major show without a by-your-leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The snifter was out of her hand and hurtling toward the stone hearth before she realized it. Glass shattered, rained like bullets. \u201cI had to get out! I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t bear it. All those people, staring at me, at my work, and the music, the lights. Everything so lovely, so perfect. I didn\u2019t know it would scare me so. I thought I\u2019d gotten over it since that first day you showed me the room, and my work set up like something out of a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were frightened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes, damn you. Are you happy to hear it? I was terrified when you opened the door and I looked inside and saw what you\u2019d done. I could barely speak. You did this to me,\u201d she said furiously. \u201cYou opened this Pandora\u2019s box and let out all my hopes and my fears and my needs. You can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have needs, terrible ones, you don\u2019t even think you should have.\u201d</p><p>He studied her now, ivory and flame in a slim black dress. \u201cOh, but I can,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI can. You should have told me, Maggie.\u201d His voice was gentle now as he stepped toward her.</p><p>She threw up both hands to ward him off. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t bear you to be kind just now. Especially when I know I don\u2019t deserve it. It was wrong of me to leave that way. It was selfish and ungrateful.\u201d She dropped her hands helplessly at her sides. \u201cBut there was no one for me up those stairs. No one. And it broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>She looked so delicate all at once, so he did what she asked and didn\u2019t touch her. He was afraid if he did, however gently, she might snap in his hands. \u201cIf you\u2019d let me know how important it was to you, Maggie, I\u2019d have arranged to have your family here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t arrange Brianna. God knows you can\u2019t bring my father back.\u201d Her voice broke, shaming her. With a strangled sound she pressed a hand to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m overtired, that\u2019s all.\u201d She fought a bitter war to control her voice. \u201cOverstimulated with all the excitement. I owe you an apology for leaving the way I did, and gratitude for all the work you did for me.\u201d</p><p>He preferred her raging or weeping to this stilted politeness. It left him no choice but to respond in kind. \u201cThe important thing is that the show was a success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes glittered in the firelight. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing. If you\u2019ll excuse me now, I\u2019ll go up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Maggie? One more thing.\u201d</p><p>She turned back. He stood before the fire, the flames leaping gold behind him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there for you, up those stairs. Perhaps next time you\u2019ll remember that, and be content.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He heard only the rustle of her dress as she hurried across the hall and up the stairs, then the quick click of her bedroom door closing.</p><p>He stared at the fire, watched a log break apart, cut through by flame and heat. Smoke puffed once, stirred by the wind. He continued to stare as a shower of sparks rained against the screen, scattered over stone and winked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was, he realized, every bit as capricious, moody and brilliant as that fire. As dangerous and as elemental.</p><p>And he was, quite desperately, in love with her.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cWHAT do you mean, gone?\u201d Rogan pushed away from his desk and scraped Joseph with look of outrage. \u201cOf course she\u2019s not gone.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut she is. She stopped by the gallery to say goodbye only an hour ago.\u201d Reaching into his pocket, Joseph drew out an envelope. \u201cShe asked me to give you this.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Rogan took it, tossed it on his desk. \u201cAre you saying she\u2019s gone back to Clare? The morning after her show?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cYes, and in a tearing hurry. I didn\u2019t have time to show her the reviews.\u201d Joseph reached up to fiddle with the tiny gold hoop in his ear. \u201cShe\u2019d booked a flight to Shannon. Said she only had a moment to say goodbye and God bless, gave me the note for you, kissed me and ran out again.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt was a bit like being battered by a small tornado.\u201d He lifted his shoulders, let them fall. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rogan, if I\u2019d known you wanted her to stay, I\u2019d have tried to stop her. I believe I\u2019d have been flattened, but I\u2019d have tried.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He lowered carefully into his chair again. \u201cHow did she seem?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cImpatient, rushed, distracted. Very much as usual. She wanted to be back home, was all she told me, back at work. I wasn\u2019t sure you knew, so I thought I\u2019d come by and tell you in person. I have an appointment with General Fitzsimmons, and it was on my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate it. I should be by the gallery by four. Give the general my regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give him the business,\u201d Joseph said with a flashing grin. \u201cBy the way, he went up another five thousand on Surrender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for sale.\u201d</p><p>Rogan picked up the note on his desk after Joseph closed the door behind him. Ignoring his work, Rogan split the envelope with his ebony-handled letter opener. The creamy stationery from his own guest room was dashed over with Maggie\u2019s hurried and beautiful scrawl.</p><p>Dear Rogan,</p><p>I imagine you\u2019ll be annoyed that I\u2019ve left so abruptly, but it can\u2019t be helped. I need to be home and back at work, and I won\u2019t apologize for it. I will thank you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll start firing wires my way, and I\u2019ll warn you in advance I intend to ignore them, at least for a time. Please give my best to your grandmother. And I wouldn\u2019t mind if you thought of me now and again.</p> <p>Maggie</p><p>Oh, one more thing. You might be interested to know that I\u2019m taking home a half dozen of Julien\u2019s recipes\u2014that\u2019s your cook\u2019s name, if you don\u2019t know. He thinks I\u2019m charming.</p><p>Rogan skimmed the letter a second time before setting it aside. It was for the best, he decided. They would both be happier and more productive with the whole of Ireland between them. Certainly, he would be. It was difficult to be productive around a woman when you were in love with her, and when she frustrated you on every possible level.</p><p>And with any luck, any at all, these feelings that had grown in him would ease and fade with time and distance.</p><p>So...He folded the letter and set it aside. He was glad she\u2019d gone back, satisfied that they\u2019d accomplished the first stage of his plans for her career, happy that she\u2019d inadvertently given him time to deal with his own confused emotions.</p><p>The hell, he thought. He missed her already.</p><p>The sky was the color of a robin\u2019s egg and clear as a mountain stream. Maggie sat on the little stoop at her front door, elbows on knees, and just breathed. Beyond her own garden gate and the trailing, flowering fuchsia, she could see the lush green of hill and valley. And farther, since the day was so clear, so bright, she glimpsed the distant dark mountains.</p><p>She watched a magpie dart across her line of vision, flashing over the hedge and up. Straight as an arrow he went, until even the shadow of him was lost in the green.</p> <p>One of Murphy\u2019s cows lowed and was answered by another. There was a humming echo that would be his tractor, and the more insistent sealike roar of her furnaces, which she\u2019d fired the moment she\u2019d arrived.</p><p>Her flowers were brilliant in the sunshine, vivid red begonias tangled with the late-blooming tulips and dainty spears of larkspur. She could smell rose-mary and thyme and the strong perfume of the wild roses that swayed like dancers in the mild, sweet breeze.</p><p>A wind chime she\u2019d made out of scraps of glass sang musically above her head.</p><p>Dublin, with its busy streets, seemed very far away.</p><p>On the ribbon of road in the valley below, she saw a red truck, tiny and bright as a toy, rumble along, turn into a lane and climb toward a cottage.</p><p>Home for tea, she thought, and let out a sigh of pure contentment.</p><p>She heard the dog first, that full-throated echoing bark, then the rustle of brush that told her he\u2019d flushed out a bird. Her sister\u2019s voice floated out on the air, amused, indulgent.</p><p>\u201cLeave the poor thing alone, Con, you great bully.\u201d</p><p>The dog barked again and, moments later, leaped at the garden gate. His tongue lolled happily when he spotted Maggie.</p><p>\u201cGet down from there,\u201d Brianna ordered. \u201cDo you want her to come home and find her gate crashed in, and...Oh.\u201d She stopped, laying a hand on the wolfhound\u2019s massive head as she saw her sister. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were home.\u201d The smile came first as she tugged open the gate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived.\u201d Maggie spent the next few minutes being greeted by Concobar, wrestling and accepting his lavish licks until he responded to Brianna\u2019s command to sit. Sit he did, his front paws over Maggie\u2019s feet, as if to ensure that she would stay put.</p><p>\u201cI had a little time,\u201d Brianna began. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d come down and tend to your garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks fine to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always think so. I\u2019ve brought you some bread I baked this morning. I was going to put it in your freezer.\u201d Feeling awkward, Brianna held out the basket. There was something here, she realized. Something behind the cool, calm look in her sister\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow was Dublin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowded.\u201d Maggie set the basket beside her on the stoop. The scent beneath the neat cloth was so tempting that she lifted the cloth aside and broke off a warm hunk of brown bread. \u201cNoisy.\u201d She tore off a bit of bread and tossed it. Concobar nipped it midair, swallowed it whole and grinned. \u201cGreedy bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She tossed him another piece before she rose. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maggie turned into the house, leaving Brianna standing on the path. When she came back, she handed Brianna a box and a manila envelope.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anything\u2014\u201d Brianna began, but stopped. It was guilt she felt, she realized. And guilt she was meant to feel. Accepting it, she opened the box. \u201cOh, Maggie, it\u2019s lovely. The loveliest thing I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d She held the pin up to the sun and watched it glint. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have spent your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine to spend,\u201d Maggie said shortly. \u201cAnd I hope you\u2019ll wear it on something other than an apron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear an apron everywhere,\u201d Brianna said evenly. She replaced the pin carefully in the box, slipped the box into her pocket. \u201cThank you. Maggie, I wish\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t looked at the other.\u201d Maggie knew what her sister wished, and didn\u2019t care to hear it. Regrets that she hadn\u2019t been in Dublin for the show hardly mattered now.</p><p>Brianna studied her sister\u2019s face, found no sign of softening. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d She opened the envelope, drew out a sheet. \u201cOh! Oh my.\u201d However bright and lovely the pin, it was nothing compared with this. They both knew it. \u201cRecipes. So many. Souffl\u00e9s and pastries, and\u2014oh, look at this chicken. It must be wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Maggie shook her head at Brianna\u2019s reaction, nearly sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve tasted it myself. And the soup there\u2014the herbs are the trick to it, I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d Brianna caught her bottom lip between her teeth, studied the handwritten pages as if they were the treasures of all the ages.</p><p>\u201cFrom Rogan\u2019s cook. He\u2019s a Frenchman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRecipes from a French chef,\u201d Brianna said reverently.</p><p>\u201cI promised him you\u2019d send a like number of your own in trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf mine?\u201d Brianna blinked, as if coming out of a dream. \u201cWhy, he couldn\u2019t want mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can, and he does. I praised your Irish stew and your berry pie to the moon and back. And I gave him my solemn word you\u2019d send them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, of course, but I can\u2019t imagine\u2014thank you, Maggie. It\u2019s a wonderful gift.\u201d Brianna stepped forward for an embrace, then back again, cut to the quick by the coolness of Maggie\u2019s response. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell me how it went for you? I kept trying to imagine it, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went well enough. There were a lot of people. Rogan seems to know how to tickle their interest. There was an orchestra and waiters in white suits serving flutes of champagne and silver platters of fancy finger food.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt must have been beautiful. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Maggie\u2019s eyes chilled. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I needed you there. Damn it, Brie, I needed you there.\u201d</p><p>Con whined at the shout and looked uneasily from Maggie to his mistress.</p><p>\u201cI would have been there if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing stopping you but her. One night of your life was all I asked. One. I had no one there, no family, no friends, no one who loved me. Because you chose her as you always have, over me, over Da, even over yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of choosing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a matter of choosing,\u201d Maggie said coldly. \u201cYou\u2019ve let her kill your heart, Brianna, just as she killed his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cruel, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it is. She\u2019d be the first to tell you that cruel is just what I am. Cruel, marked with sin and damned to the devil. Well, I\u2019m glad to be bad. I\u2019d chose hell in a blink over kneeling in ashes and suffering silently for heaven as you do.\u201d Maggie stepped back, curled a stiff hand around the doorknob. \u201cWell, I had my night without you, or anyone, and it went well enough. I should think they\u2019ll be some sales out of it. I\u2019ll have money for you in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you, Maggie.\u201d Brianna\u2019s own pride stiffened her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Maggie shut the door.</p><p>For three days she was undisturbed. The phone didn\u2019t ring, no knock came at the door. Even if there had been a summons, she would have ignored it. She spent nearly every waking minute in the glass house, refining, perfecting, forming the images in her brain and on her sketchpad into glass.</p><p>Despite Rogan\u2019s claim as to their worth, she hung her drawings on clothespins or on magnets, so that a corner of the studio soon came to resemble a dark room, with prints drying.</p><p>She\u2019d burned herself twice in her hurry, once badly enough to make her stop for some hastily applied first aid. Now she sat in her chair, carefully, meticulously, turning her sketch of an Apache breastplate into her own vision.</p><p>It was sweaty work, and viciously exacting. Bleeding color into color, shape into shape as she wanted required hundreds of trips to the glory hole.</p><p>But here, at least, she could be patient.</p><p>White-hot flames licked through open furnace doors, blasting out heat. The exhaust fan hummed like an engine to keep the fumes coating the glass\u2014and not her lungs\u2014to an iridescent hue.</p><p>For two days she worked with chemicals, mixing and experimenting like a mad scientist until she\u2019d perfected the colors she desired. Copper for the deep turquoise, iron for the rich golden yellow, manganese for a royal, bluish purple. The red, the true ruby she wanted, had given her trouble, as it did any glass artist. She was working with that now, sandwiching that section between two layers of clear glass. She\u2019d used copper again, with reducing agents in the melt to ensure a pure color. Though it was poisonous, and potentially dangerous even under controlled conditions, she\u2019d chosen sodium cyanide.</p><p>Even with this the casing was necessary to prevent the red from going livery.</p><p>The first gather of the new section was blown, rotated, then carefully trailed from the iron. She used long tweezers to draw the molten, taffylike glass into a subtly feathery shape.</p><p>Sweat dripped down onto the cotton bandanna she\u2019d tied around her brow as she worked the second gather, repeated the procedure.</p><p>Again and again, she went to the glory hole to reheat, not only to keep the glass hot, but to ensure against thermal strains that could break any vessel\u2014and the heart of the artist.</p><p>To prevent searing her hands, she dripped water over the pipe. Only the tip needed to be kept hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted the wall of the breastplate thin enough so that light could seep and be refracted through it. This required additional trips for heating and careful patient work with tools for flattening and for adding the slight curve she envisioned.</p><p>Hours after she\u2019d blown the first gather, she placed the vessel in the annealing oven and struck the pontil.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d set both temperature and time that she felt the cramps in her hands, the knots in her shoulders and neck.</p><p>And the emptiness in her belly.</p> <p>No scraping out of a can tonight, she decided. She would celebrate with a meal and a pint at the pub.</p><p>Maggie didn\u2019t ask herself why, after pining for solitude, she now hurried toward company. She\u2019d been home for three days and had spoken to no one but Brianna. And then only briefly and angrily.</p><p>Maggie was sorry for it now, sorry that she hadn\u2019t tried harder to understand Brianna\u2019s position. Her sister was always in the middle, the unlucky second child of a flawed marriage. Instead of leaping for her sister\u2019s throat, she should have taken her oversolicitousness toward their mother in stride. And she should have told Brianna what she\u2019d learned from Christine Sweeney. It would be interesting to gauge Brianna\u2019s reaction to the news of their mother\u2019s past.</p><p>But that would have to wait. She wanted an undemanding hour with people she knew, over a hot meal and a cold beer. It would take her mind off the work that had been driving her for days, and off the fact that she\u2019d yet to hear from Rogan.</p><p>Because the evening was fine and she wanted to work out the worst of her kinks, she straddled her bicycle and began the three-mile trek into the village.</p> <p>The long days of summer had begun. The sun was brilliant and pleasantly warm, keeping many of the farmers out in their fields long after their supper was over. The curving narrow road was flanked on both sides by high hedgerows that provided no shoulder and gave Maggie the impression of riding down a long, sweet-smelling tunnel. She passed a car, gave the driver a wave and felt the breeze of its passing flutter her jeans.</p><p>Pedaling hard, more for the fun than because she was in a hurry, she burst out of the tunnel of hedges into the sheer breathless beauty of the valley.</p><p>The sun dashed off the tin roof of a hay barn and dazzled her eyes. The road was smoother now, if no wider, but she slowed, simply to enjoy the evening breeze and the lingering sunlight.</p><p>She caught the scent of honeysuckle, of hay, of sweet mown grass. Her mood, which had been manic and restless since her return, began to mellow.</p><p>She passed houses with clothes drying on the line and children playing in the yard, and the ruins of castles, majestic still with their gray stones and legends of ghostly inhabitants, a testament to a way of life that still lingered.</p><p>She took a curve, caught the bright flash that was the river flowing through high grass and turned away from it toward the village.</p> <p>The houses were more plentiful now and stood closer together. Some of the newer ones made her sigh with disappointment. They were blocky and plain to her artist\u2019s eye, and usually drab in color. Only the gardens, lush and vivid, saved them from ugliness.</p><p>The long last curve took her into the village proper. She passed the butcher\u2019s, the chemist\u2019s, O\u2019Ryan\u2019s little food store and the tiny, neat hotel that had once belonged to her grandfather.</p><p>Maggie paused to study the building a moment, trying to imagine her mother living there as a girl. A lovely girl, according to Christine Sweeney\u2019s report, with the voice of an angel.</p><p>If it were true, why had there been so little music in the house? And why, Maggie wondered, had there never been a mention, a hint of Maeve\u2019s talent?</p><p>She would ask, Maggie decided. And there was likely no place better than O\u2019Malley\u2019s.</p><p>As she pulled her bike to the curb Maggie noticed a family of tourists wandering on foot, shooting videos and looking enormously pleased with themselves to be committing a quaint Irish village onto tape.</p><p>The woman held the small, clever little camera and laughed as she focused on her husband and two children. Maggie must have stepped into the frame, for the woman lifted her hand and waved.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, miss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd to you.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, Maggie didn\u2019t even snicker when the woman whispered to her husband, \u201cIsn\u2019t her accent wonderful? Ask her about food, John. I\u2019m dying to get more of her on tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Tourism couldn\u2019t hurt the village, Maggie decided, and turned back to play the game. \u201cCan I help you with something this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind. We were wondering about a place to eat in town. If you could recommend something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sure I could do that.\u201d Because they looked so delighted with her, she layered a bit more west county into her speech. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re after wanting something fancy, you couldn\u2019t do better but to drive along this road another, oh, fifteen minutes, and you could have the very king of meals at Dromoland Castle. It\u2019ll be hard on your wallet, but your taste buds will be in heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dressed for a fancy meal,\u201d the woman put in. \u201cActually, we were hoping for something simple right here in the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in the mood for a bit of pub grub\u201d\u2014she winked at the two children, who were eyeing her as if she\u2019d stepped off a light-flashing UFO\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll find O\u2019Malley\u2019s to your liking, I\u2019m sure. His chips are as good as anyone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s means french fries,\u201d the woman translated. \u201cWe just arrived this morning, from America,\u201d she told Maggie. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t know much about the local customs. Are children permitted in the bars\u2014pubs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Ireland. Children are welcome anywhere, anywhere a\u2019tall. That\u2019s O\u2019Malley\u2019s there.\u201d She gestured toward the low plastered block building with dark trim. \u201cI\u2019m going there meself. They\u2019d be pleased to have you and your family for a meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The man beamed at her, the children stared and the woman had yet to take the camera from in front of her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your meal, then, and the rest of your stay.\u201d Maggie turned and sauntered down the sidewalk and into O\u2019Malley\u2019s. It was dim, smoky and smelled of frying onions and beer.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you, Tim?\u201d Maggie asked as she settled herself at the bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd look who\u2019s dragged herself in.\u201d Tim grinned at her as he built a pint of Guinness. \u201cAnd how are you, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fit and hungry as a bear.\u201d She exchanged greetings with a couple at a postage-stamp-sized table behind her and at the two men who nursed pints at the bar. \u201cWill you fix me one of your steak sandwiches, Tim, with a pile of chips, and I\u2019ll have a pint of Harp while I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>The proprietor stuck his head around the back of the bar and shouted out Maggie\u2019s order. \u201cWell now, how was Dublin City?\u201d he asked while he drew her a pint.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d She propped her elbows on the bar and began to describe her trip for the patrons of the bar. While she talked the American family came in and settled at a table.</p> <p>\u201cChampagne and goose liver?\u201d Tim shook his head. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a wonder? And all those people come to see your glass. Your father\u2019d be proud of you, Maggie girl. Proud as a peacock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d She sniffed deeply when Tim slid her plate in front of her. \u201cBut the truth is, I\u2019d rather have your steak sandwich than a pound of goose liver.\u201d</p><p>He laughed heartily. \u201cThat\u2019s our girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turns out that the grandmother of the man who\u2019s managing things for me was a friend of my gran, Gran O\u2019Reilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean it?\u201d With a sigh, Tim rubbed his belly. \u201cSure and it\u2019s a small world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Maggie agreed, making it casual. \u201cShe\u2019s from Galway and knew Gran when they were girls. They wrote letters for years after Gran moved here, keeping up, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. No friend like an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran wrote her about the hotel and such, the family. Mentioned how it was my mother used to sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was a time ago.\u201d Remembering, Tim picked up a glass to polish. \u201cBefore you were born, to be sure. Fact is, now that I think of it, she sang here in this very pub one of the last times before she gave it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? You had her sing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes. She had a sweet voice, did Maeve. Traveled all over the country. Hardly saw a bit of her for, oh, more than ten years, I\u2019d say, then she came back to stay a time. It seems to me Missus O\u2019Reilly was ailing. So I asked Maeve if maybe she\u2019d like to sing an evening or two, not that we\u2019ve as grand a place as some in Dublin and Cork and Donnegal where she\u2019d performed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe performed? For ten years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, I don\u2019t know as she made much of it at first. Anxious to be off and away was Maeve, as long as I remember. She wasn\u2019t happy making beds in a hotel in a village like ours, and let us know it.\u201d He winked to take the sting out of his words. \u201cBut she was doing well by the time she came back and sang here. Then she and Tom...well, they only had eyes for each other the moment he walked in and heard her singing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after they married,\u201d Maggie said carefully, \u201cshe didn\u2019t sing any longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t care to. Wouldn\u2019t talk of it. Fact is, it\u2019s been so long, till you brought it up, I\u2019d nearly forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Maggie doubted her mother had forgotten, or could forget. How would she herself feel if some twist in her life demanded that she give up her art? she wondered. Angry, sad, resentful. She looked down at her hands, thought of how it would be if she couldn\u2019t use them again. What would she become if suddenly, just as she was about to make her mark, it was all taken away?</p><p>If relinquishing her career wasn\u2019t an excuse for the bitter years that had passed with her mother, at least it was a reason.</p><p>Maggie needed time to shift through it, to talk to Brianna. She toyed with her beer and began to put the pieces of the woman her mother had been together with the personality of the woman she\u2019d become.</p><p>How much of both, Maggie wondered, had Maeve passed on to her daughter?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re to eat that sandwich,\u201d Tim ordered as he slid another pint down the bar. \u201cNot study it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d To prove her point, Maggie took a healthy bite. The pub was warm and comforting. Time enough tomorrow, she decided, to wipe the film off old dreams. \u201cWill you get me another pint, Tim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019ll do,\u201d he said, then lifted a hand when the pub door opened again. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a night for strangers. Where\u2019ve you been, Murphy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy missing you, boy-o.\u201d Spotting Maggie, Murphy grinned and joined her at the bar. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I can sit by the celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I can allow it,\u201d she returned. \u201cThis once, at any rate. So, Murphy, when are you going to court my sister?\u201d</p><p>It was an old joke, but still made the pub patrons chuckle. Murphy sipped from Maggie\u2019s glass and sighed. \u201cNow, darling, you know there\u2019s only room in my heart for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a scoundrel.\u201d She took back her beer.</p><p>He was a wildly handsome man, trim and strong and weathered like an oak from the sun and wind. His dark hair curled around his collar, over his ears, and his eyes were as blue as the cobalt bottle in her shop.</p><p>Not polished like Rogan, she thought. Rough as a Gypsy was Murphy, but with a heart as wide and sweet as the valley he loved. Maggie had never had a brother, but Murphy was the nearest to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d marry you tomorrow,\u201d he claimed, sending the pub, except for the Americans who looked on avidly, into whoops of laughter. \u201cIf you\u2019d have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can rest easy, then, for I won\u2019t be having the likes of you. But I\u2019ll kiss you and make you sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>She made good on her word, kissing him long and hard until they drew back and grinned at one another. \u201cHave you missed me, then?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a whit. I\u2019ll have a pint of Guinness, Tim, and the same thing our celebrity\u2019s having.\u201d He stole one of her chips. \u201cI heard you were back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her voice cooled a little. \u201cYou saw Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I heard you were back,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYour furnace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister sent me some clippings, from Cork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. How is Mary Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s fit. Drew and the children, too.\u201d Murphy reached in his pocket, frowned, patted another. \u201cAh, here we go.\u201d He took out two folded pieces of newspaper. \u201c\u2018Clarewoman triumphs in Dublin,\u2019\u201d he read. \u201c\u2018Margaret Mary Concannon impressed the art word at a showing at Worldwide Gallery, Dublin, Sunday night.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me see that.\u201d Maggie snatched the clipping out of his hand. \u201c\u2018Miss Concannon, a free-blown-glass artist, drew praise and compliments from attendees of the show with her bold and complex sculptures and drawings. The artist herself is a diminutive\u2019\u2014diminutive, hah!\u201d Maggie editorialized.</p><p>\u201cGive it back.\u201d Murphy tugged the clipping away and continued to read it aloud himself. \u201c\u2018A diminutive young woman of exceptional talent and beauty.\u2019 Hah, yourself,\u201d Murphy added, sneering at her. \u201c\u2018The green-eyed redhead of ivory complexion and considerable charm was as fascinating as her work to this art lover. Worldwide, one of the top galleries in the world, considers itself fortunate to display Miss Concannon\u2019s work.</p><p>\u201c\u2018\u201cI believe she\u2019s only begun to tap her creativity,\u201d stated Rogan Sweeney, president of Worldwide. \u201cBringing Miss Concannon\u2019s work to the attention of the world is a privilege.\u201d\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d She reached for the clipping again, but Murphy held it out of reach.</p> <p>\u201cHe did. It\u2019s here in black and white. Now let me finish. People want to hear.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, the pub had gone quiet. Every eye was on Murphy as he finished the review.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Worldwide will be touring several of Miss Concannon\u2019s pieces over the next year, and will keep others, personally selected by the artist and Mr. Sweeney, on permanent display in Dublin.\u2019\u201d Satisfied, Murphy placed the clipping on the bar, where Tim craned over to see it.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s pictures,\u201d he added, unfolding the second clipping. \u201cOf Maggie with the ivory complexion and some of her fancy glass. Nothing to say, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>She let out a long breath, dragged at her hair. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better say \u2018drinks for all my friends.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet, Maggie Mae.\u201d</p><p>Maggie smiled over the nickname, one her father had used for her. She was more than comfortable in Murphy\u2019s lorry, with her bike stowed in the bed and the engine purring, as did all of Murphy\u2019s machinery, like a satisfied cat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019m a wee bit drunk, Murphy.\u201d She stretched and sighed. \u201cAnd that I like the feeling quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you earned it.\u201d She was more than a wee bit drunk, which was why he\u2019d hauled her bike into his lorry before she could think to argue. \u201cWe\u2019re all proud of you, and I for one will look upon that bottle you made me with more respect from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a weed pot, I\u2019ve told you, not a bottle. You put pretty twigs or wild flowers in it.\u201d</p><p>Why anyone would bring twigs, pretty or otherwise, into the house was beyond him. \u201cSo are you going back to Dublin, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014not for a time, anyway. I can\u2019t work there and work\u2019s what I want to do right now.\u201d She scowled at a tumble of furze, silvered now by the rising moon. \u201cHe never acted like it was a privilege, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it was always that I should be privileged he\u2019d taken a second look at me work. The great and powerful Sweeney giving the poor, struggling artist a chance for fame and fortune. Well, did I ask for fame and fortune, Murphy? That\u2019s what I want to know? Did I ask for it?\u201d</p><p>He knew the tone, the belligerent, defensive slap of it, and answered cautiously. \u201cI can\u2019t say, Maggie. But don\u2019t you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Do I look like a fleabrain? But ask for it? No, I did not. I never once asked him for a blessed thing, except at the start to leave me alone. And did he? Hah!\u201d She folded her arms across her chest. \u201cNot much he did. He tempted me, Murphy, and the devil himself couldn\u2019t have been more sly and persuasive. Now I\u2019m stuck, you see, and can\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>Murphy pursed his lips and pulled smoothly to a stop by her gate. \u201cWell, are you wanting to go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And that\u2019s the worst of it. I want exactly what he says I can have, and want it so it hurts my heart. But I don\u2019t want things to change either, that\u2019s the hell of it. I want to be left alone to work and to think, and just to be. I don\u2019t know as I can have both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have what you want, Maggie. You\u2019re too stubborn to take less.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed at that and turned to kiss him sloppily. \u201cOh, I love you, Murphy. Why don\u2019t you come out into the field and dance with me in the moonlight?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, ruffled her hair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I put your bike away and tuck you into bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it meself.\u201d She climbed out of the lorry, but he was quicker. He lifted out her bike and set it on the road. \u201cThank you for escorting me home, Mr. Muldoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was mine, Miss Concannon. Now get yourself to bed.\u201d</p><p>She wheeled her bike through the gate as he began to sing. Stopping just inside the garden, she listened as his voice, a strong, sweet tenor, drifted through the night quiet and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cAlone all alone by the wave wash strand, all alone in a crowded hall. The hall it is g*y, and the waves they are grand, but my heart is not here at all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little and finished the rest in her mind. It flies far away, by night and by day, to the times and the joys that are gone.</p><p>\u201cSlievenamon\u201d was the ballad, she knew. Woman of the Mountain. Well, she wasn\u2019t standing on a mountain, but she thought she understood the soul of the tune. The hall in Dublin had been g*y, yet her heart hadn\u2019t been there. She\u2019d been alone. All alone.</p><p>She wheeled her bike around the back, but instead of going inside, Maggie headed away from the house. It was true she was a little light-headed and none too steady on her feet, but she didn\u2019t want to waste such a night in bed. Alone in bed.</p><p>And drunk or sober, day or night, she could find her way over the land that had once been hers.</p><p>She heard the hoot of an owl and the rustle of something that hunted or hid by night in the higher grass to the east. Overhead, the moon, just past full, shone like a bright beacon in a swimming sea of stars. The night whispered around her, secretly. A brook to the west babbled in answer.</p><p>This, this, was part of what she wanted. What she needed as much as breath was the glory of solitude. Having the green fields flowing around her, silvered now in moon- and star-light, with only the faint glow in the distance that was the lamp in Murphy\u2019s kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She remembered walking here with her father, her child\u2019s hand clutched warmly in his. He hadn\u2019t talked of planting or plowing, but of dreams. Always, he had spoken of dreams.</p><p>He\u2019d never really found his.</p><p>Sadder somehow, she thought, was that she was beginning to see that her mother had found hers, only to lose it again.</p><p>How would it be, she wondered, to have what you wanted as close as your fingertips, then have it slip away? Forever.</p> <p>And wasn\u2019t that exactly what she herself was so afraid of?</p><p>She lay on her back on the grass, her head spinning with too much drink and too many dreams of her own. The stars wheeled in their angels\u2019 dance, and the moon, shiny as a silver coin, looked down on her. The air was sweetened by the lilt of a nightingale. And the night was hers alone.</p><p>She smiled, shut her eyes and slept.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>IT was the cow that woke her. The big, liquid eyes studied the sleeping form curled in the pasture. There was little thought in a cow\u2019s head other than food and the need to be milked. So she sniffed once, twice, at Maggie\u2019s cheek, snorted, then began to crop grass.</p> <p>\u201cOh God have mercy, what\u2019s the noise?\u201d</p><p>Her head throbbing like a large drum being beaten, Maggie rolled over, bumped solidly into the cow\u2019s foreleg and opened bleary, bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus Christ!\u201d Maggie\u2019s squeal reverberated in her head like a gong, causing her to catch hold of her ears as if they were about to explode as she scrambled away. The cow, as startled as she, mooed and rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Keeping a firm hold on her head, Maggie made it to her knees. \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d When she dropped back on her haunches, she and the cow studied each other doubtfully. \u201cI must\u2019ve fallen asleep. Oh!\u201d In pitiful defense against a raging hangover, she shifted her hands from her ears to her eyes. \u201cOh, the penance paid for one drink over the limit. I\u2019ll just sit right here for a minute, if you don\u2019t mind, until I have the strength to stand.\u201d</p><p>The cow, after one last roll of her eyes, began to graze again.</p><p>The morning was bright and warm, and full of sound. The drone of a tractor, the bark of a dog, the cheerful birdsong rolled in Maggie\u2019s sick head. Her mouth tasted as if she\u2019d spent the night dining on a peat bog, and her clothes were coated with morning dew.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a fine thing to pass out in a field like a drunken hobo.\u201d</p> <p>She made it to her feet, swayed once and moaned. The cow swished its tail in what might have been sympathy. Cautious, Maggie stretched. When her bones didn\u2019t shatter, she worked out the rest of the kinks and let her gritty eyes scan the field.</p><p>More cows, uninterested in their human visitor, grazed. In the next field, she could see the circle of standing stones, ancient as the air, that the locals called Druid\u2019s Mark. She remembered now kissing Murphy good night and, with his fading song playing in her head, wandering under the moon.</p><p>And the dream she\u2019d had, sleeping under its silver light, came back to her so vividly, so breathlessly, that she forgot the throbbing in her head and the stiffness in her joints.</p><p>The moon, glowing with light, pulsing like a heartbeat. Flooding the sky, and the earth beneath it with cold white light. Then it had burned, hot as a torch until it ran with color, bled blues and reds and golds so lovely that even in sleep she had wept.</p><p>She had reached up, and up, and up, until she had touched it. Smooth it had been, and solid and cool as she cupped it in her hands. In that sphere she had seen herself, and deep, somewhere deep within those swimming colors, had been her heart.</p><p>The vision whirling in her head was more than a match for a hangover. Driven by it, she ran from the field, leaving the placid cows to their grazing and the morning to its birdsong.</p><p>Within the hour she was in her studio, desperate to turn vision into reality. She needed no sketch, not with the image so boldly imprinted in her mind. She\u2019d eaten nothing, didn\u2019t need to. With the thrill of discovery glittering over her like a cloak, she made the first gather.</p><p>She smoothed it on the marble to chill and center it. Then she gave it her breath.</p> <p>When it was heated and fluid again, she marvered the bubble over powdered colorants. Into the flames it went again until the color melted into the vessel wall.</p><p>She repeated the process over and over, adding glass, fire, breath, color. Turning and turning the rod both against and with gravity, she smoothed the glowing sphere with paddles to maintain its shape.</p><p>Once she\u2019d transferred the vessel from pipe to pontil, she heated it strongly in the glory hole. She would employ a wet stick now, holding it tightly to the mouth of her work so that the steam pressure enlarged the form.</p><p>All of her energies were focused. She knew that the water on the stick would vaporize. The pressure could blow out the vessel walls. She would have done with a pontil boy now, someone to be another pair of hands, to fetch tools, to gather more glass, but she had never hired anyone for the job.</p><p>She began to mutter to herself as she was forced to make the trips herself, back to the furnace, back to the marver, back to the chair.</p><p>The sun rose higher, streaming through the windows and crowning her in a nimbus of light.</p><p>That was how Rogan saw her when he opened the door. Sitting in the chair, with a ball of molten color under her hands and sunlight circling her.</p><p>She spared him one sharp glance. \u201cTake off that damn suit coat and tie. I need your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your hands, damn it. Do exactly what I tell you and don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he could. He wasn\u2019t often struck dumb, but at that moment, with the blast of fire, the flash of sun, she looked like some sort of fierce, fiery goddess creating new worlds. He set his briefcase aside and stripped off his coat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hold this steady,\u201d she told him as she slipped out of the chair. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll turn the pontil just as I am. You see? Slowly, constantly. No jerks or pauses or I\u2019ll have to kill you. I need a prunt.\u201d</p><p>He was so stunned that she would trust him with her work that he sat in her chair without a word. The pipe was warm in his hands, heavier than he\u2019d expected. She kept hers over his until she felt he had the rhythm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she warned him. \u201cBelieve me, your very life depends on it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t doubt her. She went to the furnace, gathered a prunt and came back.</p><p>\u201cDo you see how I did that? Nothing to that part. I want you to do it for me next time.\u201d Once the wall was softened, she took jacks and pushed into the glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo it now.\u201d She took the pipe from him and continued to work it. \u201cI can shear it off if you gather too much.\u201d</p><p>The heat from the furnace stole his breath. He dipped the pipe in, following her terse directions, rolled it under the melt. He watched the glass gather and cling, like hot tears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring it to me from the back of the bench and to the right.\u201d Anticipating him, she snatched up a pair of tongs and took control of the pontil even as he angled it toward her.</p><p>She repeated the process, sending off sparks from the wax, merging glass into glass, color into color. When she was satisfied with the interior design, she reblew the vessel, urging it into a sphere again, shaping it with air.</p> <p>What Rogan saw was a perfect circle, the size perhaps of a soccer ball. The interior of the clear glass orb exploded with colors and shapes, bled and throbbed with them. If he had been a fanciful man, he would have said the glass lived and breathed just as he did. The colors swirled, impossibly vivid, at the center, then flowed to the most delicate hues as they trailed to the wall.</p><p>Dreams, he thought. It\u2019s a circle of dreams.</p><p>\u201cBring me that file,\u201d she snapped out.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe file, blast it.\u201d She was already moving to a bench covered with fireproof pads. As she braced the pontil on a wooded vise, she held out her hand, like a surgeon demanding a scalpel. Rogan slapped a file into it.</p> <p>He heard her slow steady breathing pause, hold, just as she struck the glass bond with the file. She struck the pontil. The ball rolled comfortably onto the pad. \u201cGloves,\u201d she ordered. \u201cThe heavy ones by my chair. Hurry up.\u201d</p><p>With her eyes still on the ball, she jerked the gloves on. Oh, she wanted to hold it. To cup it in her naked palms as she had in her dream. Instead, she chose a metal fork, covered with asbestos, and carried the sphere to the annealing oven.</p><p>She set the timer, then stood for a minute, staring blankly into space.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the moon, you see,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt pulls the tides, in the sea, in us. We hunt by it and harvest by it and sleep by it. And if we\u2019re lucky enough, we can hold it in our hands and dream by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t have a name. Everyone should see what they want most in it.\u201d As if coming out of a dream herself, she lifted a hand to her head. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d She trudged wearily back to her chair, sat and let her head fall back.</p> <p>She was milk pale, Rogan noticed, drained of the energized glow that had covered her while she\u2019d worked. \u201cHave you worked through the night again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I slept last night.\u201d She smiled to herself. \u201cIn Murphy\u2019s field, under the bright, full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept in a field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk.\u201d She yawned, then laughed and opened her eyes. \u201cA little. And it was such a grand night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who,\u201d Rogan asked as he crossed to her, \u201cis Murphy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man I know. Who would have been a bit surprised to find me sleeping in his pasture. Would you get me a drink?\u201d At his lifted brow, she laughed. \u201cA soft one, if you will. From the refrigerator there. And help yourself,\u201d she added when he obliged her. \u201cYou make a passable pontil boy, Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, taking that for a thanks. As she tipped the can he gave her back, he scanned the room. She hadn\u2019t been idle, he noted. There were several new pieces tucked away, her interpretations of the Native American display. He studied a shallow wide-lipped dish, decorated with deep, dull colors.</p><p>\u201cLovely work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm. An experiment that turned out well. I combined opaque and transparent glass.\u201d She yawned again, broadly. \u201cThen tin-fumed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTin-fumed? Never mind,\u201d he said when he saw that she was about to launch into a complicated explanation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t understand what you were talking about, anyway. Chemistry was never my forte. I\u2019ll just be pleased with the finished product.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say it\u2019s fascinating, just as I am.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her and his lips twitched. \u201cBeen reading your reviews, have you? God help us now. Why don\u2019t you go get some rest? We\u2019ll talk later. I\u2019ll take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come all this way to take me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy it just the same.\u201d</p><p>There was something different about him, she decided. Some subtle change somewhere deep in those gorgeous eyes of his. Whatever it was, he had it under control. A couple of hours with her ought to fix that, Maggie concluded, and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go in the house, have some tea and a bite to eat. You can tell me why you\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see you, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>Something in his tone told her to sharpen her work-dulled wits. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve seen me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have.\u201d He picked up his briefcase and opened the door. \u201cI could use that tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, you can brew it.\u201d She shot a look over her shoulder as she stepped outside. \u201cIf you know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I do. Your garden looks lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie\u2019s tended it while I was gone. What\u2019s this?\u201d She tapped a foot against a cardboard box at her back door.</p><p>\u201cA few things I brought with me. Your shoes for one. You left them in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the briefcase and hauled the box into the kitchen. After dumping it on the table, he looked around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the cupboard above the stove.\u201d</p><p>While he went to work she slit the box open. Moments later she was sitting down, holding her belly as she laughed.</p><p>\u201cTrust you never to forget a thing. Rogan, if I won\u2019t answer the phone, why should I listen to a silly answering machine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll murder you if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that.\u201d She rose again and pulled out a wall calendar. \u201cFrench Impressionists,\u201d she murmured, studying the pictures above each month. \u201cWell, at least it\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse it,\u201d he said simply, and set the kettle to boil. \u201cAnd the machine, and this.\u201d He reached into the box himself and pulled out a long velvet case. Without ceremony he flipped it open and took out a slim gold watch, its amber face circled by diamonds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, I can\u2019t wear that.

You\u2019ve no right to be careless. None at all. Am I to be worried about you setting yourself afire now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You\u2019d think I severed my hand.\u201d She would have pulled her hand away, but his grip tightened. \u201cRogan, for pity sake, a glass artist gets a burn now and again. It\u2019s not fatal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said stiffly. He forced back the anger he was feeling at her carelessness and clasped the watch on her wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hear you\u2019ve been careless.\u201d He let her hand go, slipped his own in his pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She watched him warily when he went to answer the kettle\u2019s shrill. \u201cShall I make us a sandwich?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say how long you\u2019d be staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back tonight. I wanted to speak with you in person rather than try to reach you by phone.\u201d In control again, he finished making the tea and brought the pot to the table. \u201cI\u2019ve brought the clippings you asked my grandmother about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the clippings.\u201d Maggie stared at his briefcase. \u201cYes, that was good of her. I\u2019ll read them later.\u201d When she was alone.</p><p>\u201cAll right. And there was something else I wanted to give you. In person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else.\u201d She sliced through a loaf of Brianna\u2019s bread. \u201cIt\u2019s a day for presents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t qualify as a present.\u201d Rogan opened his briefcase and took out an envelope. \u201cYou may want to open this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d She dusted off her hands, tore open the envelope. She had to grab the back of a chair to keep her balance as she read the amount on the check. \u201cMary, mother of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sold every piece we\u2019d priced.\u201d More than satisfied by her reaction, he watched her sink into the chair. \u201cI would say the showing was quite successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery piece,\u201d she echoed. \u201cFor so much.\u201d</p><p>She thought of the moon, of dreams, of changes. Weak, she laid her head on the table.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe. My lungs have collapsed.\u201d Indeed, she could hardly talk. \u201cI can\u2019t get my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d He went behind her, massaged her shoulders. \u201cJust in and out. Give yourself a minute to let it take hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost two hundred thousand pounds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery nearly. With the interest we\u2019ll generate from touring your work, and offering only a portion of it to the market, we\u2019ll increase the price.\u201d The strangled sound she made caused him to laugh. \u201cIn and out, Maggie love. Just push the air out and bring it in again. I\u2019ll arrange for shipping for those pieces you\u2019ve finished. We\u2019ll set the tour for the fall, because you\u2019ve so much completed already. You may want to take some time off to enjoy yourself. Have a holiday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA holiday.\u201d She sat up again. \u201cI can\u2019t think about that yet. I can\u2019t think at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve time.\u201d He patted her head, then moved around her to pour the tea. \u201cYou\u2019ll have dinner with me tonight, to celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Rogan. I never really believed it would...I just didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d She pressed her hands to her mouth. For a moment he was afraid she would begin to sob, but it was laughter, wild and jubilant, that burst out of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m rich! I\u2019m a rich woman, Rogan Sweeney.\u201d She popped out of the chair to kiss him, then whirled away. \u201cOh, I know it\u2019s a drop in the bucket to you, but to me\u2014to me, it\u2019s freedom. The chains are broken, whether she wants them to be or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, thinking of Brianna. \u201cDreams, Rogan, wonderful dreams. Oh, I have to tell her. Right away.\u201d She snatched up the check and impulsively stuffed it in her back pocket. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay, please. Have your tea, make some food. Make use of the phone you\u2019re so fond of. Whatever you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d There were wings on her feet as she whirled back and kissed him again. Her lips missed his in her hurry and caught his chin. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d With that she was racing out of the door and across the fields.</p><p>She was puffing like a steam engine by the time she scrambled over the stone fence that bordered Brianna\u2019s land. But then, she\u2019d been out of breath before she\u2019d begun the race. She barely missed trampling her sister\u2019s pansies\u2014a sin she would have paid for dearly\u2014and skidded on the narrow stone path that wound through the velvety flowers.</p><p>She drew in air to shout, but didn\u2019t waste it as she spotted Brianna in the little path of green beyond the garden, hanging linen on the line.</p><p>Clothespins in her mouth, wet sheets in her hands, Brianna stared across the nodding columbines and daisies while Maggie pressed her hands to her thudding heart. Saying nothing, Brianna snapped the sheet expertly and began to clip it to the line.</p><p>There was hurt in her sister\u2019s face still, Maggie observed. And anger. All chilled lightly with Brianna\u2019s special blend of pride and control. The wolfhound gave a happy bark and started forward, only to stop short at Brianna\u2019s quiet order. He settled, with what could only be a look of regret at Maggie, back at his mistress\u2019s feet. She took another sheet from the basket beside her, flicked it and clipped it neatly to dry.</p><p>\u201cHello, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>So the wind blew cold from this quarter, Maggie mused, and tucked her hands into her back pockets. \u201cHello, Brianna. You\u2019ve guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. We\u2019re full at the moment. An American couple, an English family and a young man from Belgium.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA virtual United Nations.\u201d She sniffed elaborately. \u201cYou\u2019ve pies baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re baked and cooling on the windowsill.\u201d Because she hated confrontations of any kind, Brianna kept her eyes on her work as she spoke. \u201cI thought about what you said, Maggie, and I want to say I\u2019m sorry. I should have been there for you. I should have found a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Brianna let out a quick breath, her only sign of agitation. \u201cYou never make it easy, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have obligations\u2014not only to her,\u201d she said before Maggie could speak. \u201cBut to this place. You\u2019re not the only one with ambitions, or with dreams.\u201d</p><p>The heated words that burned on Maggie\u2019s tongue cooled, then slid away. She turned to study the back of the house. The paint was fresh and white; the windows, open to the summer afternoon, were glistening. Lace curtains billowed, romantic as a bridal veil. Flowers crowded the ground and poured out of pots and tin buckets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done fine work here, Brianna. Gran would have approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d In an apology of her own, she laid a hand on her sister\u2019s arm. \u201cI don\u2019t claim I understand how you do it, or why you want to, but that\u2019s not for me to say. If this place is your dream, Brie, you\u2019ve made it shine. I\u2019m sorry I shouted at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m used to that.\u201d Despite her resigned tone, it was clear that she had thawed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll wait till I\u2019ve finished here, I\u2019ll put on some tea. I\u2019ve a bit of trifle to go with it.\u201d</p><p>Maggie\u2019s empty stomach responded eagerly, but she shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t time for it. I left Rogan back at the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft him? You should have brought him along with you. You can\u2019t leave a guest kicking his heels that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a guest, he\u2019s...well, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d call him, but that doesn\u2019t matter. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>Though her sense of propriety was offended, Brianna took out the last pillowslip. \u201cAll right, show me. Then get back to Rogan. If you\u2019ve no food in the house, bring him here. The man\u2019s come all the way from Dublin after all, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you stop worrying about Sweeney?\u201d Maggie cut in impatiently, and pulled the check out of her pocket. \u201cAnd look at this?\u201d</p><p>One hand on the line, Brianna glanced at the paper. Her mouth dropped open and the clothespin fell out to plop on the ground. The pillowslip floated after it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a check, are you blind? A big, fat, beautiful check. He sold all of it, Brie. All he\u2019d set out to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor so much?\u201d Brianna could only gape at all the zeros. \u201cFor so much? How can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a genius.\u201d Maggie grabbed Brianna\u2019s shoulders and whirled her around. \u201cDon\u2019t you read my reviews? I have untapped depths of creativity.\u201d Laughing, she dragged Brianna into a lively hornpipe. \u201cOh, and there\u2019s something more about my soul and my sexuality. I haven\u2019t memorized it all yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, wait. My head\u2019s spinning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it spin. We\u2019re rich, don\u2019t you see?\u201d They tumbled to the ground together, Maggie shrieking with laughter and Con jumping in frantic circles around them. \u201cI can buy that glass lathe I\u2019ve been wanting, and you can have that new stove you\u2019ve been pretending you don\u2019t need. And we\u2019ll have a holiday. Anywhere in the world, anywhere a\u2019tall. I\u2019ll have a new bed.\u201d She plopped back on the grass to wrestle with Con. \u201cAnd you can add a whole wing onto Blackthorn if you\u2019ve a mind to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it in. I just can\u2019t take it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a house.\u201d Pushing herself up again, Maggie hooked an arm around Con\u2019s neck. \u201cWhatever kind she wants. And hire someone to fetch and carry for her.\u201d</p><p>Brianna shut her eyes and fought back the first guilty flare of elation. \u201cShe might not want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be what she wants. Listen to me.\u201d Maggie grabbed Brianna\u2019s hands and squeezed. \u201cShe\u2019ll go, Brie. And she\u2019ll be well taken care of. She\u2019ll have whatever pleases her. Tomorrow we\u2019ll go into Ennis and talk to Pat O\u2019Shea. He sells houses. We\u2019ll set her up as grandly as we can, and as quickly. I promised Da I\u2019d do my best by both of you, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you no consideration?\u201d Maeve stood on the garden path, a shawl around her shoulders despite the warmth of the sun. The dress beneath it was starched and pressed\u2014by Brianna\u2019s hand, Maggie had no doubt. \u201cOut here shouting and shrieking while a body\u2019s trying to rest.\u201d She pulled the shawl closer and jabbed a finger at her younger daughter. \u201cGet up off the ground. What\u2019s wrong with you? Behaving like a hoyden, and you with guests in the house.\u201d</p><p>Brianna rose stiffly, brushed at her slacks. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day. Perhaps you\u2019d like to sit in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might as well. Call off that vicious dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit, Con.\u201d Protectively, Brianna laid a hand on the dog\u2019s head. \u201cCan I bring you some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and brew it properly this time.\u201d Maeve shuffled to the chair and table Brianna had set up beside the garden. \u201cThat boy, that Belgian, he\u2019s clattered up the stairs twice today. You\u2019ll have to tell him to mind the racket. It\u2019s what comes when parents let their children traipse all over the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the tea in a moment. Maggie, will you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for tea. But I\u2019ll have a word with Mother.\u201d She sent her sister a steely look to prevent any argument. \u201cCan you be ready to drive into Ennis by ten tomorrow, Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Maeve demanded as Brie walked toward the kitchen door. \u201cWhat are the two of you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour future.\u201d Maggie took the chair beside her mother\u2019s, kicked out her legs. She\u2019d wanted to go about it differently. After what she\u2019d begun to learn, she\u2019d hoped she and her mother could find a meeting ground somewhere beyond the old hurts. But already the old angers and guilts were working in her. Remembering last night\u2019s moon and her thoughts about lost dreams, she spoke quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re after buying you a house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maeve made a sound of disgust and plucked at the fringe of her shawl. \u201cNonsense.

But you won\u2019t be using Brie any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna understands the responsibilities of a child to her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than,\u201d Maggie agreed. \u201cShe\u2019s done everything in her power to make you content, Mother. It hasn\u2019t been enough, and maybe I\u2019ve begun to understand that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou understand nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I\u2019d like to understand.\u201d She took a deep breath. Though she couldn\u2019t reach out to her mother, physically or emotionally, her voice softened. \u201cI truly would. I\u2019m sorry for what you gave up. I learned of the singing only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t speak of it.\u201d Maeve\u2019s voice was frigid. Her already pale skin whitened further with the shock of a pain she\u2019d never forgotten, never forgiven. \u201cYou will never speak of that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted only to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your sorrow.\u201d With her mouth tight, Maeve looked aside. She couldn\u2019t bear to have the past tossed in her face, to be pitied because she had sinned and lost what had mattered most to her. \u201cYou will not speak of it to me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Maggie leaned forward until Maeve\u2019s gaze settled on her. \u201cI\u2019ll say this. You blame me for what you lost, and maybe that comforts you somehow. I can\u2019t wish myself unborn. But I\u2019ll do what I can. You\u2019ll have a house, a good one, and a respectable, competent woman to see to your needs, someone I hope can be a friend to you as well as a companion. This I\u2019ll do for Da, and for Brie. And for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing for me in your life but cause me misery.\u201d</p><p>So there would be no softening, Maggie realized. No meeting on new ground. \u201cSo you\u2019ve told me, time and again. We\u2019ll find a place close enough so that Brie can visit you, for she\u2019ll feel she should. And I\u2019ll furnish the place as well, however you like. You\u2019ll have a monthly allowance\u2014for food, for clothes, for whatever it is you need. But I swear before God you\u2019ll be out of his house and into your own before a month is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPipe dreams.\u201d Her tone was blunt and dismissive, but Maggie sensed a little frisson of fear beneath. \u201cLike your father, you are full of empty dreams and foolish schemes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot empty, and not foolish.\u201d Again, Maggie drew the check out of her pocket. This time she had the satisfaction of seeing her mother\u2019s eyes go wide and blank. \u201cAye, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s mine. I earned it. I earned it because Da had the faith in me to let me learn, to let me try.\u201d</p><p>Maeve\u2019s eyes flicked to Maggie\u2019s, calculating. \u201cWhat he gave you belonged to me as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe money for Venice, for schooling and for the roof over my head, that\u2019s true. What else he gave me had nothing to do with you. And you\u2019ll get your share of this.\u201d Maggie tucked the check away again. \u201cThen I\u2019ll owe you nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me your life,\u201d Maeve spat.</p><p>\u201cMine meant little enough to you. I may know why that is, but it doesn\u2019t change how it makes me feel inside. Understand me, you\u2019ll go without complaint, without making your last days with Brianna a misery for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not go at all.\u201d Maeve dug in her pocket for a lace-edged hanky. \u201cA mother needs the comfort of her child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no more love for Brianna than you do for me. We both know it, Mother. She might believe differently, but here, now, let\u2019s at least be honest. You\u2019ve played on her heart, it\u2019s true, and God knows she\u2019s deserving of any love you have in that cold heart of yours.\u201d After a long breath, she pulled out the trump card she\u2019d been holding for five years. \u201cWould you have me tell her why Rory McAvery went off to America and broke her heart?\u201d</p><p>Maeve\u2019s hands gave a quick little jerk. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you do. You took him aside when you saw he was getting serious in his courting. And you told him that you couldn\u2019t in good conscience let him give his heart to your daughter. Not when she\u2019d given her body to another. You convinced him, and he was only a boy, after all, that she\u2019d been sleeping with Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d Maeve\u2019s chin thrust out, but there was fear in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re an evil, lying child, Margaret Mary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the liar, and worse, much worse than that. What kind of a woman is it that steals happiness from her own blood because she has none herself? I heard from Murphy,\u201d Maggie said tersely. \u201cAfter he and Rory beat each other to bloody pulps. Rory didn\u2019t believe his denial. Why should he, when Brianna\u2019s own mother had tearfully told him the tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was too young to marry,\u201d Maeve said quickly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have her making the same mistake as I did, ruining her life that way. The boy wasn\u2019t right for her, I tell you. He\u2019d never have amounted to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove doesn\u2019t put bread on the table.\u201d Maeve fisted her hands, twisting the handkerchief in them. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought it would only hurt her more. I asked Murphy to say nothing, knowing Brianna\u2019s pride, and how it would be shattered. And maybe because I was angry that he would have believed you, that he didn\u2019t love her enough to see the lie. But I will tell her now. I\u2019ll walk right into that kitchen and tell her now. And if I have to, I\u2019ll drag poor Murphy over to stand with me. You\u2019ll have no one then.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known the flavor of revenge would be so bitter. It lay cold and distasteful on Maggie\u2019s tongue as she continued. \u201cI\u2019ll say nothing if you do as I say. And I\u2019ll promise you that I will provide for you as long as you live and do whatever I can to see that you\u2019re content. I can\u2019t give you back what you had, or wanted to have before you conceived me. But I can give you something that might make you happier than you\u2019ve been since. Your own home. You\u2019ve only to agree to my offer in order to have everything you\u2019ve always wanted\u2014money, a fine house and a servant to tend you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maeve pressed her lips together. Oh, it crushed the pride to bargain with the girl. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019ll keep your word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I give it to you. Because I swear these things to you on my father\u2019s soul.\u201d Maggie rose. \u201cThat will have to content you. Tell Brianna I\u2019ll be by to pick her up at ten tomorrow.\u201d And with these words, Maggie turned on her heel and walked away.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>SHE took her time walking back, again choosing the fields rather than the road. As she went she gathered wildflowers, the meadowsweet and valerian that sunned themselves among the grass. Murphy\u2019s well-fed cows, their udders plump and nearly ready for milking, grazed unconcernedly as she climbed over the stone walls that separated pasture from plowed field and field from summer hay.</p> <p>Then she saw Murphy himself, atop his tractor, with young Brian O\u2019Shay and Dougal Finnian with him, all to harvest the waving hay. They called it comhair in Irish, but Maggie knew that here, in the west, the word meant much more than its literal translation of \u201chelp.\u201d It meant community. No man was alone here, not when it came to haying, or opening a bank of peat or sowing in the spring.</p><p>If today O\u2019Shay and Finnian were working Murphy\u2019s land, then tomorrow, or the day after, he would be working theirs. No one would have to ask. The tractor or plow or two good hands and a strong back would simply come, and the work would be done.</p><p>Stone fences might separate one man\u2019s fields from another, but the love of the land joined them.</p><p>She lifted a hand to answer the salute of the three farmers and, gathering her flowers, continued on to her home.</p><p>A jackdaw swooped overhead, complaining fiercely. A moment later Maggie saw why as Con barreled through the verge of the hay, his tongue lolling happily.</p> <p>\u201cHelping Murphy again, are you?\u201d She reached down to ruffle his fur. \u201cAnd a fine farmer you are, too. Go on back, then.\u201d</p><p>With a flurry of self-important barks, Con raced back toward the tractor. Maggie stood looking around her, the gold of the hay, the green of the pasture with its lazy cows and the shadows cast by the sun on the circle of stones that generations of Concannons, and now Murphy, had left undisturbed for time out of mind. She saw the rich brown of the land where potatoes had been dug. And over it all, a sky as blue as a cornflower in full blossom.</p><p>A quick laugh bubbled up in her throat, and she found herself racing the rest of the way.</p><p>Perhaps it was the pure pleasure of the day, coupled with the giddy excitement of her first major success that made her blood pump fast. It might have been the sound of birds singing as if their hearts would break, or the scent of wildflowers gathered by her own hands. But when she stopped just outside her own door and looked into her own kitchen, she was breathless with more than a quick scramble over the fields.</p><p>He was at the table, elegant in his English suit and handmade shoes. His briefcase was open, his pen out. It made her smile to see him work there, amid the clutter, on a crude wooden table he might have used for firewood at home.</p><p>The sun streamed through the windows and open door, flashing gold off his pen as he wrote in his neat hand. Then his fingers tapped over the keys of a calculator, hesitated, tapped again. She could see his profile, the faint line of concentration between the strong black brows, the firm set of his mouth.</p> <p>He reached for his tea, sipped as he studied his figures. Set it down again. Wrote, read.</p><p>Elegant, he was. And beautiful, she thought, in a way so uniquely male, and as wonderfully competent and precise as the handy little machine he used to run his figures. Not a man to run across sunny fields or lie dreaming under the moon.</p><p>But he was more than she\u2019d first imagined him to be, much more, she now understood.</p><p>The overpowering urge came over her to loosen that careful knot in his tie, unbutton that snug collar and find the man beneath.</p><p>Rarely did Maggie refuse her own urges.</p><p>She slipped inside. Even as her shadow fell over his papers, she was straddling his lap and fastening her mouth to his.</p><p>Shock, pleasure and lust speared into him like a three-tipped arrow, all sharp, all true to aim. The pen had clattered from his fingers and his hands had dived into her hair before he took the next breath. Through a haze he felt the tug on his tie.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he managed in something like a croak. The need for dignity had him clearing his throat and pressing her back. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know....\u201d She punctuated her words by feathering light kisses over his face. He smelled expensive, she realized, all fine soap and starched linen. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought a tie a foolish thing, a sort of punishment for a man for simply being a man. Doesn\u2019t it choke you?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t, unless his heart was in his throat. \u201cNo.\u201d He shoved her hands away, but the damage was already done. Under her quick fingers, his tie was loose and his collar undone. \u201cWhat are you about, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be obvious enough, even to a Dubliner.\u201d She laughed at him, her eyes wickedly green. \u201cI brought you flowers.\u201d</p><p>The latter were, at that moment, crushed between them. Rogan glanced down at the bruised petals. \u201cVery nice. They could use some water, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>She tossed back her head and laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s always first things first with you, isn\u2019t it? But Rogan, from where I\u2019m sitting, I\u2019m aware there\u2019s something on your mind other than fetching a vase.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny his obvious, and very human reaction. \u201cYou\u2019d harden a dead man,\u201d he muttered, and put his hands firmly on her hips to lift her away. She only wriggled closer, torturing him.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s a pretty compliment, to be sure. But you\u2019re not dead, are you?\u201d She kissed him again, using her teeth to prove her point. \u201cAre you thinking you\u2019ve work to finish up, and no time to waste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hands were still on her hips, but the fingers had dug in and had begun to knead. She smelled of wildflowers and smoke. All he could see was her face, the white skin with its blush of rose, dusting of gold freckles, the depthless green of her eyes. He made an heroic effort to level his voice. \u201cBut I\u2019m thinking this is a mistake.\u201d A groan sounded in his throat when she moved her lips to his ear. \u201cThat there\u2019s a time and a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you should choose it,\u201d she murmured as her nimble fingers flipped open the rest of the buttons on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014no.\u201d Good God, how was a man supposed to think? \u201cThat we should both choose it, after we\u2019ve set some priorities.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only one priority at the moment.\u201d Her hands cruised up his chest, crushing wildflowers petals against his skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to have you now, Rogan.\u201d Her laugh came again, low and challenging, before her lips sank into his. \u201cGo ahead, fight me off.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to touch her. That was his last coherent thought before his hands streaked up and filled themselves with her br**sts. Her throaty moan spilled into his mouth like wine, rich and drugging.</p><p>Then he was tugging away her shirt and shoving back from the table all at once. \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d he muttered against her greedy mouth, and was lifting her.</p><p>Her arms and legs wrapped around him like silken rope, her shirt dangling from one wrist where the buttons held. Beneath, she wore a plain cotton camisole as erotic to him as ivory lace.</p><p>She was small and light, but with the blood trumpeting in his brain, he thought he could have carried a mountain. Her busy mouth never paused, racing from cheek to jaw to ear and back, while sexy little whimpers purred in her throat.</p><p>He started out of the kitchen, stumbled over a loose throw rug and knocked her back against the doorjamb. She only laughed, breathlessly now, and tightened the vise of her legs around his waist.</p><p>Their lips fused again in a rough, desperate kiss. With the doorway and her own limbs bracing her, he tore his mouth free to fasten it on her breast, suckling greedily through cotton.</p><p>The pleasure of it, dark and damning, lanced like a spear through her system. This was more, she realized as the blood sizzling through her veins began to hum like an engine. More than she\u2019d expected. More than she might have been ready for. But there was no turning back.</p><p>He whirled away from the wall.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d was all she could say as he strode toward the stairs. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Her words pumped like a pulse of his blood. Hurry. Hurry. Against his thundering heart, hers beat in furious response. With Maggie clinging like a bur, he all but leaped up the stairs, leaving a trail of broken flowers in their wake.</p><p>He turned unerringly to the left, into the bedroom where the sun poured gold and the fragrant breeze lifted the open curtains. He fell with her onto already tumbled sheets.</p><p>If it was madness that overcame him, it ruled her as well. There was no thought, or need, in either of them for gentle caresses, for soft words or slow hands. They tore at each other, mindless as beasts, dragging at clothes, pulling, tugging, kicking off shoes, all the while feeding greedily with violent kisses.</p><p>Her body was like an engine, fueled to race. She bucked and rolled and reared while her breath seared out in burning gasps. Seams ripped, needs exploded.</p><p>His hands were smooth. Another time they might have glided over her body like water. But now they grasped and bruised and plundered, bringing her unspeakable pleasure that tore through her over-charged system like lightning tears a darkened sky. He filled his palms with her breast again, and now, without barriers, drew the rigid tips into his mouth.</p><p>She cried out, not in pain at the rough scrape of his teeth and tongue, but in glory as the first harsh, vicious orgasm struck like a blow.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected it to slap her so quick and hard, nor had she ever experienced the utter helplessness that followed so fast on the heels of the storm. Before she could do more than wonder, fresh needs coiled whiplike inside her.</p><p>She spoke in Gaelic, half-remembered words she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d held in her heart. She\u2019d never believed, never, that hunger could swallow her up and leave her trembling. But she shook under his hands, under the wild demand of his mouth. For another dazed interlude she was totally vulnerable, her bones molten and her mind reeling, stunned into surrender by the punch of her own climax.</p><p>He never felt the change. He knew only that she vibrated beneath him like a plucked bow. She was wet and hot and unbearably arousing. Her body was smooth, soft, supple, all the lovely dips and curves his to explore. He knew only the desperate desire to conquer, to possess, and so gorged himself on the flavor of her flesh until it seemed the essence of her raced through his veins like his own blood.</p><p>He clasped her limp hand in his and ravaged until she cried out once again, and his name was like a sob in the air.</p><p>With the room spinning like a carousel around her, she dragged her hands from his, tangled her fingers in his hair. Need spurted through her again, voraciously. She thrust her hips up.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d The demand broke from her throat. \u201cRogan, for God\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he had already plunged inside her, deep and hard. She arched back, arched up, in glorious welcome as fresh pleasure geysered through her in one lancing, molten flash. Her body mated with his, matching rhythms, stroke for desperate stroke. The bite of her nails on his back was unfelt.</p> <p>With vision blurred and dimmed, he watched her, saw each stunning sensation flicker over her face. It won\u2019t be enough, he thought dizzily. Even as the sorrow nicked through the burnished shield of passion, she opened her eyes and said his name again.</p><p>So he drowned in that sea of green, and burying his face in the fire of her hair, surrendered. With one last flash of glorious greed, he emptied himself into her.</p><p>In a war of any kind, there are casualties. No one, Maggie thought, knew the glory, the sorrow or the price of battle better than the Irish. And if, as she was very much afraid at the moment, her body was paralyzed for life as the result of this wonderful little war, she wouldn\u2019t count the cost.</p><p>The sun was still shining. Now that her heart had ceased to crash like thunder in her head, she heard the twitter of birds, the roar of her furnace, and the hum of a bee buzzing by the window.</p><p>She lay across the bed, her head clear off the mattress and dragged down by gravity. Her arms were aching. Perhaps because they were still wrapped like vises around Rogan, who was splayed over her, still as death.</p><p>She felt, when she held her own breath, the quicksilver race of his heart. It was, she decided, a wonder they hadn\u2019t killed each other. Content with his weight, and the drouzy feel of cobwebs in her brain, she watched the sun dance on the ceiling.</p><p>His own mind cleared slowly, the red haze mellowing, then fading completely until he became aware again of the quiet light and the small, warm body beneath his. He shut his eyes again and lay still.</p><p>What were the words he should say? he wondered. If he told her that he\u2019d discovered, to his own shock and confusion, that he loved her, why should she believe it? To say those words now, when they were both still sated and dazed from sex, would hardly please a woman like Maggie, or make her see the bare truth of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What words were there, after a man had tossed a woman down and plundered like an animal? Oh, he\u2019d no doubt she\u2019d enjoyed it, but that hardly changed the fact that he\u2019d completely lost control, of his mind, of his body, of whatever it was that separated the civilized from the wild.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he\u2019d taken a woman without finesse, without care and, he thought with a sudden start, without a thought about the consequences.</p><p>He started to shift, but she murmured in protest and tightened her already fierce grip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He realized her head was unsupported and, cupping a hand beneath it, rolled to reverse their positions. And nearly sent them over the other edge. \u201cHow do you sleep on a bed this size? Hardly big enough for a cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s done well enough for me. But I\u2019m thinking of buying another now that I\u2019ve money to spare. A fine big one, like the one in your house.\u201d</p><p>He thought of a Chippendale four-poster in the tiny loft and smiled. Then his thoughts veered back and wiped the smile away. \u201cMaggie.\u201d Her face was glowing, her eyes half-shut. There was a smug little smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cRogan,\u201d she said in the same serious tone, then laughed. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not going to start telling me you\u2019re sorry to have trampled my honor or some such thing? If anyone\u2019s honor was trampled, after all, it was yours. And I\u2019m not a bit sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he said again, and brushed the tousled hair from her cheek. \u201cWhat a woman you are. It\u2019s hard to be sorry for trampling, or for being trampled when I\u2014\u201d He broke off. He\u2019d lifted her hand as he spoke, started to kiss her fingers, when his gaze landed on the dark smudges on her arm. Appalled, he started. \u201cI\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm. Now that you mention it, I\u2019m beginning to feel it.\u201d She rolled her shoulder. \u201cI must have hit the doorway pretty hard. Now, you were about to say?\u201d</p><p>He shifted off of her. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d he said in an odd voice. \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable. An apology\u2019s hardly adequate for my behavior.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted, and she took a good long look at him. Breeding, she thought again. How else could a buck-naked man sitting on a rumpled bed appear so dignified. \u201cYour behavior?\u201d she repeated. \u201cI\u2019d say it was more our behavior, Rogan, and that it was well done on both parts.\u201d Laughing at him, she pushed herself up and locked her arms around his neck. \u201cDo you think a few bruises will wilt me like a rose, Rogan? They won\u2019t, I promise you, especially when I earned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is we tumbled each other. Now stop acting as though I\u2019m a fragile blossom that can\u2019t admit to having enjoyed a good, hot bout of sex. Because I enjoyed it very much, and so, my fine fellow, did you.\u201d</p><p>He trailed a fingertip over the faint bruise above her wrist. \u201cI\u2019d rather I hadn\u2019t marked you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a brand that\u2019s permanent.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. But there was something else, in his carelessness, that could be. \u201cMaggie, I wasn\u2019t thinking before, and I certainly didn\u2019t leave Dublin today planning on ending up like this. It\u2019s a little late to be thinking of being responsible now.\u201d In frustration he dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cCould I have gotten you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, sat back on her haunches. Let out a long breath. Born in fire. She remembered her father had told her she\u2019d been born in fire. And this was what he\u2019d meant. \u201cNo.\u201d She said it flatly, her emotions too mixed and unsteady for her to explore. \u201cThe timing\u2019s wrong. And I\u2019m responsible for myself, Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have seen to it.\u201d He reached over to rub his knuckles down her cheek. \u201cYou dazzled me, Maggie, sitting on my lap with your wildflowers. You dazzle me now.\u201d</p><p>Her smile came back, lighting her eyes first, then curving her lips. \u201cI was coming across the fields away from my sister\u2019s and toward home. The sun was bright, Murphy was haying in his field, and there were flowers at my feet. I haven\u2019t felt so happy since my father died five years ago. Then I saw you in the kitchen, working. And it may be I was dazzled as well.\u201d</p><p>She knelt again, rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cMust you go back to Dublin tonight, Rogan?\u201d</p><p>All the minute and tedious details of his schedule ran like a river through his brain. Her scent, mixed with his own, settled over them like a mist. \u201cI can rearrange some things, leave in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019d rather not go out to dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll cancel the reservations.\u201d He glanced around the room. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a phone up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? So it can ring in my ear and wake me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think why I asked.\u201d He eased away to tug on the wrinkled slacks of his suit. \u201cI\u2019ll go down, make some calls.\u201d He looked back to where she knelt in the center of the narrow, rumpled bed. \u201cVery quick calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could wait,\u201d she shouted after him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to be interrupted by anything until morning.\u201d He hurried down, sentimentally scooping up a tattered meadowsweet as he went.</p><p>Upstairs, Maggie waited five minutes, then six before climbing out of bed. She stretched, wincing a bit at the aches. She considered the robe that was tossed carelessly over a chair, then humming to herself, strolled downstairs without it.</p><p>He was still on the phone, the receiver cocked on his shoulder as he made notes in his book. The light, softer now, pooled at his feet. \u201cReschedule that for eleven. No, eleven,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the office by ten. Yes, and contact Joseph, will you, Eileen? Tell him I\u2019ve having another shipment sent from Clare. Concannon\u2019s work, yes. I...\u201d</p><p>He heard the sound behind him, glanced back. Maggie stood like some flame-crowned goddess, all alabaster skin, sleek curves and knowing eyes. His secretary\u2019s voice buzzed in his ear like an annoying fly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The what?\u201d His eyes, their expression dazed at first, then heated, skimmed up, then down, then up again to lock on Maggie\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it when I get back.\u201d His stomach muscles quivered when Maggie stepped forward and jerked down the zipper of his slacks. \u201cNo,\u201d he said in a strangled voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t reach me anymore today. I\u2019m...\u201d The breath hissed between his teeth when Maggie took him in her long, artist\u2019s fingers. \u201cSweet Jesus. Tomorrow,\u201d he said with the last of his control. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slapped the receiver into the cradle, where it jiggled then slipped off to crash against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI interrupted your call,\u201d she began, then laughed when he dragged her against him.</p><p>It was happening again. He could almost stand outside himself and watch the animal inside take over. With one desperate yank, he pulled her head back by the hair and savaged her throat, her mouth. The need to take her was raging, some fatal drug that stabbed into his veins, speeding up his heartbeat and clouding his mind.</p><p>He would hurt her again. Even knowing it, he couldn\u2019t stop. With a sound, part rage, part triumph, he pushed her back on the kitchen table.</p> <p>He had the dark, twisted satisfaction of seeing her eyes widen in surprise. \u201cRogan, your papers.\u201d</p><p>He jerked her hips from the edge of the wood, raising them with his hands. His eyes were warrior bright on hers as he drove himself into her.</p><p>Her hand flailed out, knocked the cup from its saucer and sent both flying to the floor. China shattered, even as the jolting table sent his open briefcase crashing to the ground.</p><p>Stars seemed to explode in front of Maggie\u2019s eyes as she gave herself up to the delirium. She felt the rough wood on her back, the sweat that bloomed up to slicken her skin. And when he braced her legs higher and thrust himself deep, she could have sworn she felt him touch her heart.</p><p>Then she felt nothing at all but the wild wind that tossed her up and up and over that jagged-edged peak. She gasped for air like a woman drowning, then expelled it on a long, languorous moan.</p> <p>Later, sometime later, when she found she could speak, she was cradled in his arms. \u201cDid you finish your calls, then?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and carried her out of the kitchen.</p><p>It was early when he left her. A sunshower tossed wavering rainbows into the morning sky. She\u2019d made some sleepy offer to brew him tea, then had drifted off again. So he\u2019d gone to the kitchen alone.</p><p>There\u2019d been a miserable jar of hardening instant coffee in her cupboard. Though he\u2019d winced, Rogan had settled for it, and for the single egg in her refrigerator.</p><p>He was gathering up, and trying to sort out, his scattered papers when she stumbled into the kitchen. She was heavy-eyed and rumpled, and barely grunted at him as she headed for the kettle.</p><p>So much, he thought, for loverlike farewells.</p> <p>\u201cI used what appeared to be your last clean towel.\u201d</p><p>She grunted again and scooped out tea.</p><p>\u201cAnd you ran out of hot water in the middle of my shower.\u201d</p><p>This time she only yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any eggs.\u201d</p><p>She muttered something that sounded like \u201cMurphy\u2019s hens.\u201d</p><p>He tapped his wrinkled papers together and stacked them in his briefcase. \u201cI\u2019ve left the clippings you wanted on the counter. There\u2019ll be a truck by this afternoon to pick up the shipment. You\u2019ll need to crate it before one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>When he made no answer at all to this, he snapped his briefcase closed. \u201cI have to go.\u201d Annoyed, he strode to her, took her chin firmly in hand and kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d</p> <p>He was out the front door before she could gather her wits and chase after him. \u201cRogan! For pity\u2019s sake, hold up a moment. I\u2019ve barely got my eyes open.\u201d</p><p>He turned just as she launched herself at him. Off balance, he nearly tumbled them both into the flower bed. Then she was caught close and they were kissing each other breathless in the soft, luminous rain.</p><p>\u201cI will miss you, damn it.\u201d She pressed her face into his shoulder, breathed deep.</p><p>\u201cCome with me. Go throw some things in a bag and come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She drew back, surprised at how sorry she was to have to refuse. \u201cI\u2019ve some things I need to do. And I\u2014I can\u2019t really work in Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said after a long moment. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you come back? Take a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible now. In a couple of weeks, perhaps I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not so long.\u201d It seemed like eternity. \u201cWe can both get what needs to be done done, and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then.\u201d He bent to kiss her. \u201cYou\u2019ll think of me, Margaret Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She watched him go, carrying his briefcase to the car, starting the engine, backing out into the road.</p><p>She stood for a long time after the sound of the car had faded, until the rain stopped and the sun gilded the morning.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>MAGGIE walked across the empty living room, took a long look out of the front window, then retraced her steps. It was the fifth house she had considered in a week, the only one not currently occupied by hopeful sellers, and the last one she intended to view.</p><p>It was on the outskirts of Ennis, a bit farther away than Brianna might have liked\u2014and not far enough to Maggie\u2019s taste. It was new, which was in its favor, a box of a house with the rooms all on one floor.</p><p>Two bedrooms, Maggie mused as she walked through yet again. A bath, a kitchen with room for eating, a living area with plenty of light and tidy brick hearth.</p><p>She took one last glance, set her fists on her hips. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, it\u2019s certainly the right size for her.\u201d Brianna nibbled her lip as she scanned the empty room. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we have something closer to home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? She hates it there in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is closer to more conveniences. Food shops, the chemist, places to eat out if she\u2019s of a mind to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never goes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time she did. And since she won\u2019t have you jumping at every snap of her finger, she\u2019ll have to, won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t jump.\u201d Spine stiff, Brianna walked to the window. \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, she\u2019s likely to refuse to move here in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t refuse.\u201d Not, Maggie thought, with the ax I hold over her head. \u201cIf you\u2019ll let go of that guilt you love wrapping about you for a moment, you\u2019ll admit this is best for everyone. She\u2019ll be happier in her own place\u2014or as happy as a woman of her nature can be. You can give her whatever she wants out of the house if that eases your conscience, or I\u2019ll give her money to buy new. Which is what she\u2019d rather.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaggie, the place is charmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so is our mother.\u201d Before Brianna could retort, Maggie crossed to her and swung an arm around the stiffened shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ll make a garden, right outside the door there. We\u2019ll have the walls painted or papered or whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be made nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s better suited to do that than you. You\u2019ll draw out whatever money it takes until the two of you are satisfied.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Maggie, that you should bear all this expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairer than you might think.\u201d The time had come, Maggie decided, to speak to Brianna about their mother. \u201cDid you know she used to sing? Professionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d The idea was so farfetched, Brianna laughed. \u201cWhere did you get a notion like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I learned of it by accident, and I\u2019ve checked to be sure.\u201d Reaching into her purse, Maggie pulled out the yellowed clippings. \u201cYou can see for yourself, she was even written up a few times.\u201d</p><p>Speechless, Brianna scanned the newsprint, stared at the faded photo. \u201cShe sang in Dublin,\u201d she murmured. \u201cShe had a living. \u2018A voice as clear and sweet as church bells on Easter morning,\u2019 it says. But how can this be? She\u2019s never once spoken of it. Nor Da either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it quite a lot in the last few days.\u201d Turning away, Maggie walked to the window again. \u201cShe lost something she wanted, and got something she didn\u2019t. All this time she\u2019s punished herself, and all of us.\u201d</p><p>Dazed, Brianna lowered the clipping. \u201cBut she never sang at home. Not a note. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking she couldn\u2019t bear to, or considered her refusal penance for her sin. Probably both.\u201d A weariness came over Maggie and she struggled to fight it back. \u201cI\u2019m trying to excuse her for it, Brie, to imagine how devastated she must have been when she learned she was pregnant with me. And being what she is, there\u2019d have been nothing for her but marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was wrong of her to blame you, Maggie. It always was. That\u2019s no less true today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Still, it gives me more of an understanding as to why she\u2019s never loved me. Never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you...\u201d Carefully Brianna folded the clippings and slipped them into her own purse. \u201cHave you spoken to her of it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI tried to. She won\u2019t talk about it. It could have been different.\u201d Maggie whirled back, hating the burden of guilt she couldn\u2019t shake. \u201cIt could have been. If she couldn\u2019t have the career she wanted, there could have been music still. Did she have to shut off everything because she couldn\u2019t have it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer. Some people aren\u2019t content with less than all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be changed,\u201d Maggie said firmly. \u201cBut we\u2019ll give her this, we\u2019ll give all of us this.\u201d</p><p>How quickly money dribbled away, Maggie thought a few days later. It seemed the more you had, the more you needed. But the deed to the house was now in Maeve\u2019s name, and the details, the dozens of them that came from establishing a home, were being dealt with, one by one.</p><p>A pity the details of her own life seemed to hang in limbo.</p><p>She\u2019d barely spoken to Rogan, she thought as she sulked at her kitchen table. Oh, there\u2019d been messages relayed through his Eileen and Joseph, but he rarely bothered to contact her directly. Or to come back, as he\u2019d said he would.</p><p>Well, that was fine, she thought. She was busy in any case. There were any number of sketches that were begging to be turned into glass. If she was a bit late getting started this morning, it was only because she\u2019d yet to decide which project to pursue first.</p><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t because she was waiting for the blasted phone to ring.</p> <p>She got up and started to the door when she saw Brianna through the window, the devoted wolfhound at her heels.</p><p>\u201cGood. I hoped I\u2019d catch you before you started for the day.\u201d Brianna took the basket from her arm as she stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou did, just. Is it going well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Brisk and efficient, Brianna uncovered the steaming muffins she\u2019d brought along. \u201cFinding Lottie Sullivan\u2019s like a gift from God.\u201d She smiled, thinking of the retired nurse they\u2019d hired as Maeve\u2019s companion. \u201cShe\u2019s simply wonderful, Maggie. Like part of the family already. Yesterday, when I was working on the front flower beds, Mother was carrying on about how it was too late in the year for planting and how the paint on the outside of the house was the wrong color. And, oh, just being contrary. And Lottie was standing there laughing, disagreeing with everything she said. I swear, the two of them were having the time of their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d seen it.\u201d Maggie broke open a muffin. The smell of it, and the picture Brianna had put in her head, almost made up for postponing her morning\u2019s work. \u201cYou found a treasure there, Brie. Lottie\u2019ll keep her in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. She really enjoys doing it. Every time Mother says something horrid, Lottie just laughs and winks and goes about her business. I never thought I\u2019d say it, Maggie, but I really believe this is going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s going to work.\u201d Maggie tossed a bit of muffin to the patiently hopeful Con. \u201cDid you ask Murphy if he\u2019d help move her bed and the other things she wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to. Word\u2019s out that you\u2019ve bought her a house near Ennis. I\u2019ve had a dozen people drop by in the last two weeks, casuallike. Murphy already offered his back and his lorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll be moved tidily in with Lottie before the next week is up. I\u2019ve bought us a bottle of champagne, and we\u2019re going to drink ourselves drunk when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s lips twitched, but her voice was sober. \u201cIt\u2019s not something to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just drop in, casuallike,\u201d Maggie said with a sly grin. \u201cWith a bottle of bubbly under me arm.\u201d</p><p>Though Brianna smiled back, her heart wasn\u2019t in it. \u201cMaggie, I tried to talk to her about her singing.\u201d She was sorry to see the light go out of her sister\u2019s eyes. \u201cI thought I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d Losing her appetite for the muffin, Maggie tossed the rest to Con. \u201cDid you have better luck than I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. She wouldn\u2019t talk to me, only got angry.\u201d It wasn\u2019t worth recounting the verbal blows punch by punch, Brianna thought. To do so would only serve to spread the unhappiness more thickly. \u201cShe went off to her room, but she took the clippings with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something. Perhaps they\u2019ll comfort her.\u201d Maggie jolted when the phone rang and scrambled out of her chair so quickly that Brianna gaped. \u201cHello. Oh, Eileen, is it?\u201d The disappointment in her voice was unmistakable. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve the photos you sent for the catalog. They look more than fine. Perhaps I should tell Mr. Sweeney myself that\u2014oh, a meeting. No, that\u2019s all right, then, you can tell him I approved of them. You\u2019re welcome. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou answered the phone,\u201d Brianna commented.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. It rang, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>The waspish tone of her sister\u2019s voice had Brianna\u2019s brow arching. \u201cWere you expecting a call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the way you went leaping up, like you were after snatching a child from in front of a car.\u201d</p><p>Oh, had she? Maggie thought. Had she done that? It was humiliating. \u201cI don\u2019t like the damn thing ringing my ears off, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve got to get to work.\u201d With that as a fare-thee-well, she stalked out of the kitchen.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter a tinker\u2019s damn to her whether he called or not, Maggie told herself. Maybe it had been three weeks since he\u2019d gone back to Dublin, maybe she\u2019d only spoken to him twice in all that time, but it hardly mattered to her. She was much too busy to be bothered chattering over the phone, or entertaining him if he came to see her.</p> <p>As he\u2019d bloody well said he would, she added silently, and slammed the shop door behind her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need Rogan Sweeney\u2019s company, or anyone\u2019s. She had herself.</p><p>Maggie picked up her pipe and went to work.</p><p>The Connellys\u2019 formal dining room would have reminded Maggie of a set she had seen on the glossy soap opera that had been on television the day her father died. Everything gleamed and sparkled and shone. Wine of the very best vintage glimmered gold in the crystal, shooting rainbows into the facets. Candles, slim and white, added to the elegance of light showered down from the five-tiered chandelier.</p><p>The people surrounding the lace-decked table were every bit as polished as the room. Anne, in sapphire silk and her grandmother\u2019s diamonds, was the picture of the gracious hostess. Dennis, flushed from the good meal and better company, beamed at his daughter. Patricia looked particularly lovely, and as delicate as the pastel pink and creamy pearls she wore.</p><p>Across from her, Rogan sipped at his wine and struggled to keep his mind from wandering west, toward Maggie.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have a quiet family meal.\u201d Anne picked at the miserly portion of pheasant on her plate. The scale had warned her that she\u2019d added two pounds in the last month, and that would never do. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not disappointed I didn\u2019t invite a party, Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. It\u2019s a pleasure, a rare one for me these days, to spend a quiet evening with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I\u2019ve been telling Dennis,\u201d Anne went on. \u201cWhy, we\u2019ve hardly seen you in months. You work much too hard, Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man can\u2019t work too hard at something he loves,\u201d Dennis put in.</p><p>\u201cAh, you and your man\u2019s work.\u201d Anne laughed lightly and barely resisted kicking her husband smartly under the table. \u201cToo much business makes a man tense, I say. Especially if he has no wife to soothe him.\u201d</p><p>Knowing just where this was leading, Patricia did her best to change the subject. \u201cYou had a wonderful success with Miss Concannon\u2019s showing, Rogan. And I\u2019ve heard the American Indian art has been very well received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, on both counts. The American art is moving to the Cork gallery this week, and Maggie\u2019s\u2014Miss Concannon\u2019s\u2014moves on to Paris shortly. She\u2019s finished some astonishing pieces this past month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a few of them. I believe Joseph covets the globe. The one with all the colors and shapes inside. It\u2019s quite fascinating really.\u201d Patricia folded her hands in her lap as the dessert course was served. \u201cI wonder how it was done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs it happens, I was there when she made it.\u201d He remembered the heat, the bleeding colors, the sizzling sparks. \u201cAnd I still can\u2019t explain it to you.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes put Anne on full alert. \u201cKnowing too much about the artistic process can spoil the enjoyment, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all routine to Miss Concannon, after all. Patricia, you haven\u2019t told us about your little project? How is the day school going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming along nicely, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine our little Patricia starting a school.\u201d Anne smiled indulgently.</p><p>Rogan realized with a guilty start that he hadn\u2019t asked Patricia about her pet project in weeks. \u201cHave you found a location, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have. It\u2019s a house off Mountjoy Square. The building will require some renovation, of course. I\u2019ve hired an architect. The grounds are more than suitable, with plenty of space for play areas. I hope to have it ready for children by next spring.\u201d</p><p>And she could imagine it. The babies and toddlers whose mothers needed a reliable place to leave their children while they worked. The older children who would come after school and before the close of business. It would fill some of the ache, she thought, and the emptiness that throbbed inside her. She and Robert hadn\u2019t had children. They had been so sure there was plenty of time. So sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Rogan could help you with the business end of it, Patricia,\u201d Anne went on. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019ve no experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my daughter, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Dennis interjected with a wink. \u201cShe\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will.\u201d Again Anne itched to connect her foot with her husband\u2019s shin.</p><p>She waited until she was in the parlor with her daughter and the men were lingering over glasses of port in the dining room\u2014a custom Anne refused to believe was outdated. She dismissed the maid who had wheeled in coffee, and rounded on her daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for, Patricia? You\u2019re letting the man slip between your fingers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t start this.\u201d Already Patricia could feel the dull, insistent throb of a headache in progress.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be a widow all your life, I suppose.\u201d Grim-eyed, Anne added cream to her cup. \u201cI\u2019m telling you it\u2019s been time enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been telling me that since a year after Robbie died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s no more than the truth.\u201d Anne sighed. She\u2019d hated to watch her daughter grieve, had wept long and hard herself, not only over the loss of the son-in-law she\u2019d loved, but for the pain she\u2019d been unable to erase from Patricia\u2019s eyes. \u201cDarling, as much as we all wish it wasn\u2019t so, Robert\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that. I\u2019ve accepted it and I\u2019m trying to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy starting a day-care service for other people\u2019s children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in part. I\u2019m doing that for myself, Mother. Because I need work, the satisfaction of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve finished trying to talk you out of that.\u201d In a gesture of peace, Anne raised her hands. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s what you want, truly, than it\u2019s what I want as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that.\u201d Patricia\u2019s face softened as she leaned over to kiss her mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cI know that you only want the best for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. Which is exactly why I want Rogan for you. No, don\u2019t close up on me, girl. You can\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t want him as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care for him,\u201d Patricia said carefully. \u201cVery much. I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he for you. But you\u2019re standing back, all too patiently, and waiting for him to take the next step. And while you\u2019re waiting he\u2019s becoming distracted. A blind woman could see that he\u2019s interested in more than that Concannon woman\u2019s art. And she\u2019s not the type to wait,\u201d Anne added with a wag of the finger. \u201cOh, no, indeed. She\u2019ll see a man of Rogan\u2019s background and means and snap him up before he can blink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI very much doubt Rogan can be snapped up,\u201d Patricia said dryly. \u201cHe knows his own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn most areas,\u201d Anne agreed. \u201cBut men need to be guided, Patricia. Allured. You haven\u2019t set yourself out to allure Rogan Sweeney. You\u2019ve got to make him see you as a woman, not as his friend\u2019s widow. You want him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you do. Now see to it that he wants you, too.\u201d</p><p>Patricia said little when Rogan drove her home. Home to the house she\u2019d shared with Robert, the house she couldn\u2019t give up. She no longer walked into a room expecting to find him waiting for her, or suffered those silvery slashes of pain at odd moments when she suddenly remembered their life together.</p><p>It was simply a house that held good memories.</p><p>But did she want to live in it alone for the rest of her life? Did she want to spend her days caring for other women\u2019s children while there were none of her own to brighten her life?</p><p>If her mother was right and Rogan was what she wanted, then what was wrong with a little allure.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come in for a while?\u201d she asked when he walked her to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s early still, and I\u2019m restless.\u201d</p><p>He thought of his own empty house, and the hours before the workday began. \u201cIf you\u2019ll promise me a brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the terrace,\u201d she agreed, and walked inside.</p> <p>The house reflected the quiet elegance and faultless taste of its mistress. Though he\u2019d always felt completely at home there, Rogan thought of Maggie\u2019s cluttered cottage and narrow rumpled bed.</p><p>Even the brandy snifter reminded him of Maggie. He thought of the way she\u2019d smashed one against the hearth in a rage of passion. And of the package that had come days later, holding the one she\u2019d made to replace it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely night,\u201d Patricia said, and snagged his wandering attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yes. Yes, it is.\u201d He swirled the brandy, but didn\u2019t drink.</p><p>A crescent moon rode the sky, misted by clouds, then glowing white and thin as the breeze nudged them clear. The air was warm and fragrant, disturbed only by the muffled sound of traffic beyond the hedges.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about the school,\u201d he began. \u201cWhat architect have you chosen?\u201d She named a firm he approved of. \u201cThey do good work. We\u2019ve used them ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Joseph recommended them. He\u2019s been wonderfully helpful, though I feel guilty taking his mind off his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s well able to do a half-dozen things at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never seems to mind my dropping into the gallery.\u201d Testing him, herself, Patricia moved closer. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have been hectic.\u201d He tucked her hair behind her ear, an old gesture, an old habit he wasn\u2019t even aware of. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make some time. We haven\u2019t been to the theater in weeks, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She caught his hand, held it. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad we have time now. Alone.\u201d</p><p>A warning signal sounded in his head. He dismissed it as ridiculous and smiled at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll make more. Why don\u2019t I come by that property you\u2019ve bought, look it over for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I value your opinion.\u201d Her heart beat light, quick, in her chest. \u201cI value you.\u201d</p><p>Before she could change her mind, she leaned forward and pressed her mouth to his. If there had been alarm in his eyes, she refused to see it.</p><p>No sweet, platonic kiss this time. Patricia curled her fingers into his hair and poured herself into it. She wanted, desperately wanted, to feel something again.</p><p>But his arms didn\u2019t come around her. His lips didn\u2019t heat. He stood, still as a statue. It wasn\u2019t pleasure, nor was it desire that trembled between them. It was the chilly air of shock.</p><p>She drew back, saw the astonishment and, worse, much worse, the regret in his eyes. Stung, she whirled away.</p><p>Rogan set his untouched brandy down. \u201cPatricia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She squeezed her eyes tight. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. I have to.\u201d His hands hesitated over her shoulders and finally settled gently. \u201cPatricia, you know how much I...\u201d What words were there? he thought frantically. What possible words? \u201cI care about you,\u201d he said, and hated himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeave it at that.\u201d She gripped her hands together until her fingers ached. \u201cI\u2019m humiliated enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought\u2014\u201d He cursed himself again and, because he felt so miserable, cursed Maggie for being right. \u201cPatty,\u201d he said helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d Her voice was cool again, despite his use of her old nickname. \u201cAnd so am I, for putting you in such an awkward position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I should have understood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should you?\u201d Chilled, she stepped away from his hands, made herself turn. In the dappled starlight, her face was fragile as glass, her eyes as blank. \u201cI\u2019m always there, aren\u2019t I? Dropping by, available for whatever evening you might have free. Poor Patricia, at such loose ends, dreaming up her little projects to keep herself busy. The young widow who\u2019s content with a pat on the head and an indulgent smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not at all true. It\u2019s not the way I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel.\u201d Her voice rose, cracked, alarming them both. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel. I only know I want you to go, before we say things that would embarrass us both more than we already are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you this way. Please come inside, sit down. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought, she would weep and complete her mortification. \u201cI mean it, Rogan,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI want you to go. There\u2019s nothing for either of us to say but good night. You know the way out.\u201d She swept past him, into the house.</p> <p>Damn all women, Rogan thought as he strode into the gallery the following afternoon. Damn them for their uncanny ability to make a man feel guilty and needy and idiotic.</p><p>He\u2019d lost a friend, one who was very dear to him. Lost her, he thought, because he\u2019d been blind to her feelings. Feelings, he remembered with growing resentment, that Maggie had seen and understood in the blink of an eye.</p><p>He stalked up the stairs, furious with himself. Why was it he had no idea how to handle two of the women who meant so much to him?</p><p>He\u2019d broken Patricia\u2019s heart, carelessly. And Maggie, God cursed her, had the power to break his.</p><p>Did people never fall in love with anyone who was eager to return it?</p><p>Well, he wouldn\u2019t be fool enough to toss his feelings at Maggie\u2019s feet and have her crush them. Not now. Not after he\u2019d inadvertently done some crushing of his own. He could get along very well on his own, thank you.</p> <p>He stepped into the first sitting room and scowled. They\u2019d put a few more pieces of her work on display. A mere glimpse of what would be toured over the next twelve months. The globe she\u2019d created in front of his eyes gleamed back at him, seeming to contain all the dreams she\u2019d claimed were held inside, dreams that now mocked at him as he stared into its depths.</p><p>It was just as well she hadn\u2019t answered the phone when he\u2019d called the night before. Perhaps he\u2019d needed her at that moment while the miserable guilt over Patricia had clawed at him. He\u2019d needed to hear her voice, to soothe himself with it. Instead he\u2019d heard his own, clipped and precise on the answering machine. She\u2019d refused to make the recording herself.</p><p>So instead of a quiet, perhaps intimate late-night conversation, he\u2019d left a terse message that would, no doubt, annoy Maggie as much as it annoyed him.</p><p>God, he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cAh, just the man I wanted to see.\u201d Cheerful as a robin, Joseph popped into the room. \u201cI\u2019ve sold Carlotta.\u201d Joseph\u2019s self-satisfied smile faded into curiosity when Rogan turned. \u201cBad day, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had better. Carlotta, you say? To whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo an American tourist who strolled in this morning. She was absolutely enthralled by Carlotta. We\u2019re having her shipped\u2014the painting, that is\u2014to someplace called Tucson.\u201d</p><p>Joseph sat on the corner of the love seat and lighted a celebratory cigarette. \u201cThe American claimed that she adores primitive nudes, and our Carlotta was certainly primitive. I\u2019m quite fond of nudes myself, but Carlotta was never my type. Too heavy at the hip\u2014and the brush strokes. Well, the artist lacked subtlety, shall we say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was an excellent oil,\u201d Rogan said absently.</p><p>\u201cOf its type. Since I prefer something a bit less obvious, I won\u2019t be sorry to ship Carlotta off to Tucson.\u201d He pulled a little flip-top ashtray out of his pocket and tapped his cigarette in it. \u201cOh, and that watercolor series, from the Scotsman? Arrived an hour ago. It\u2019s beautiful work, Rogan. I think you\u2019ve discovered another star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind luck. If I hadn\u2019t been checking on the factory in Inverness, I never would have seen the paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA street artist.\u201d Joseph shook his head. \u201cWell, not for long, I can guarantee that. There\u2019s a wonderfully mystical quality to the work, rather fragile and austere.\u201d His tooth flashed in a grin. \u201cAnd a nude as well, to make up for the loss of Carlotta. More to my taste, I\u2019ll have to say. She\u2019s elegant, rather delicate and just a bit sad-eyed. I fell hopelessly in love.\u201d</p><p>He broke off, flushing a little around the collar as he saw Patricia in the doorway. His heart trembled hopelessly. Out of your reach, boy-o, he reminded himself. Way out of your reach. His smile was dashing as he rose.</p><p>\u201cHello, Patricia. How lovely to see you.\u201d</p><p>Rogan turned, decided he should be flogged for putting those shadows under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHello, Joseph. I hope I\u2019m not disturbing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Beauty is always welcome here.\u201d He took her hand, kissed it, and called himself an idiot. \u201cWould you like tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, no problem at all. It\u2019s near to closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019d hoped...\u201d Patricia braced herself. \u201cJoseph, would you mind? I need to have a moment alone with Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Fool. Dolt. Imbecile. \u201cI\u2019ll just go on down. I\u2019ll put the kettle on if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She waited until he\u2019d gone, then shut the door. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my coming, since it\u2019s so near closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Rogan wasn\u2019t prepared, again, he discovered, to handle himself. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d She smiled a little as she said it, to ease the sting. \u201cYou\u2019re standing there, frantically trying to think of what to say, how to behave. I\u2019ve known you too long, Rogan. Can we sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He started to offer a hand, then let it fall back to his side. Patricia lifted a brow at the movement. She sat, folded her hands in her lap. \u201cI\u2019ve come to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Now his distress was complete. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t. There\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every need. You\u2019ll do me the courtesy of hearing me out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatty.\u201d He sat as well, felt his stomach lurch. \u201cI\u2019ve made you cry.\u201d It was all too obvious now that they were close. However careful her makeup, he could see the signs.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. And after I\u2019d finished crying, I began to think. For myself.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve had much too little practice thinking for myself, Rogan. Mother and Daddy took such close care of me. And they had such expectations. I was always afraid I couldn\u2019t meet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked you to hear me out,\u201d she said in a tone that had him staring in surprise. \u201cAnd you will. You were always there, from the time I was what\u2014fourteen, fifteen? And then there was Robbie. I was so in love there was no need to think, no room for it. It was all him, and putting the house together, making a home. When I lost him, I thought I would die, too. God knows I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing else Rogan could do but take her hand. \u201cI loved him, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you did. And it was you who got me through it. You who helped me grieve, then move past the grieving. I could talk about Robbie with you, and laugh or cry. You\u2019ve been the best of friends to me, so it was natural that I\u2019d love you. If seemed sensible for me to wait until you began to see me as a woman instead of an old friend. Then, wouldn\u2019t it be natural enough for you to fall in love with me, ask me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved restlessly under hers. \u201cIf I\u2019d paid closer attention\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have still seen nothing I didn\u2019t wish you to see,\u201d she finished. \u201cFor reasons I\u2019d rather not discuss, I decided I\u2019d take the next step myself, last night. When I kissed you, I expected to feel, oh, stardust and moonbeams. I threw myself into kissing you, expecting it to be everything I\u2019d been waiting for, all those wonderful, terrifying tugs and pulls. I wanted so much to feel them again. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatricia, it\u2019s not that I\u2014\u201d He broke off, eyes narrowing. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, confusing him all the more. \u201cWhen I\u2019d finished my well-deserved bout of weeping, I thought through the whole episode. It wasn\u2019t just you who was taken by surprise, Rogan. I realized I\u2019d felt nothing at all when I\u2019d kissed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d he repeated after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cNothing more than embarrassment for having put us both in such a potentially dreadful situation. It came to me that while I love you dearly, I\u2019m not in love with you at all. I was simply kissing my closest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d It was ridiculous to feel as though his manhood had been impugned. But he was, after all, a man. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She did know him well. Laughing, she pressed his hand to her cheek. \u201cNow I\u2019ve insulted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. I\u2019m relieved we\u2019ve sorted this out.\u201d Her bland look had him cursing. \u201cAll right, damn it, you have insulted me. Or at least nicked my masculine pride.\u201d He grinned back at her. \u201cFriends, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d She let out a long breath. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how relieved I am that that\u2019s over. You know, I think I\u2019ll take Joseph up on that tea. Can you join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. We\u2019ve just gotten in a shipment from Inverness I want to look over.\u201d</p><p>She rose. \u201cYou know, I have to agree with Mother on one thing. You\u2019re working too hard, Rogan. It\u2019s beginning to show. You need a few days to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a month or two.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking her head, she leaned down to kiss him. \u201cYou always say that. I wish I thought you meant it this time.\u201d She tilted her head, smiled. \u201cI believe your villa in the south of France is an excellent place not only to relax, but for creative inspiration. The colors and the textures would undoubtedly appeal to an artist.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, closed it again. \u201cYou do know me too well,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI do. Give it some thought.\u201d She left him brooding and went down to the kitchen. Since Joseph was in the main gallery with a few lingering clients, she began to brew the tea herself.</p><p>Joseph came in just as she was pouring the first cup. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be hurried along, nor could they be seduced into parting with a single pound. Here I thought I\u2019d end the day by selling that copper sculpture. You know, the one that looks a bit like a holly shrub, but they got away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some tea and console yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, thanks. Have you\u2014\u201d He stopped when she turned to him and he saw her face in the full light. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, nothing.\u201d She brought the cups to the table, nearly dropping them both when he caught her by the arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been crying,\u201d he said in a tight voice. \u201cAnd there\u2019re shadows under your eyes.\u201d</p><p>On an impatient breath she set the jostling cups down. \u201cWhy are cosmetics so damn expensive if they don\u2019t do the job? A woman can\u2019t indulge herself in a good weeping spell if she can\u2019t depend on her powder.\u201d She started to sit, but his hands remained firm on her shoulders. Surprised, she looked up at him. What she saw in his eyes had her fumbling. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2014really nothing. Just some foolishness. I\u2019m...I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think. He\u2019d held her before, of course. They\u2019d danced together. But there was no music now. Only her. Slowly, he lifted a hand, brushed a thumb gently over the faint smudges under her eyes. \u201cYou still miss him. Robbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I always will.\u201d But her husband\u2019s face, so well loved, blurred. She saw only Joseph. \u201cI wasn\u2019t crying for Robbie. Not really. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I was crying for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was so lovely, he thought. Her eyes so soft and confused. And her skin\u2014he\u2019d never dared touch her like this before\u2014was like silk. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t cry, Patty,\u201d he heard himself say. Then he was kissing her, his mouth homing to hers like an arrow, his hand scooping up into that soft swing of hair.</p><p>He lost himself, drowning in the scent of her, aching at the way her lips parted in surprise to allow him one long, full-bodied taste of her.</p><p>Her body gave to his, a delicate sway of fragility that aroused unbearable and conflicting needs. To take, to protect, to comfort and to possess.</p><p>It was her sigh, part shock, part wonder, that snapped him back like a faceful of ice water.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I beg your pardon.\u201d He fumbled over the words, then went rigid with regret when she only stared at him. Emotions churned sickly inside of him as he stepped back. \u201cThat was inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and walked away before her head stopped spinning.</p><p>She took one step after him, his name on her lips. Then she stopped, pressed her hand to her racing heart and let her shaking legs buckle her into a chair.</p><p>Joseph? Her hand crept up from her breast to her flushed cheek. Joseph, she thought again, staggered. Why, it was ridiculous. They were no more than casual friends who shared an affection for Rogan and for art. He was...well, the closest thing she knew to a bohemian, she decided. Charming, certainly, as every woman who walked into the gallery would attest.</p><p>And it had only been a kiss. Just a kiss, she told herself as she reached for her cup. But her hand trembled and spilled tea onto the table.</p> <p>A kiss, she realized with a jolt, that had given her those moonbeams, the stardust, and all the wonderful and terrifying tugs and pulls she had hoped for.</p><p>Joseph, she thought again, and raced out of the kitchen to find him.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of him outside and darted past Rogan with barely a word.</p><p>\u201cJoseph!\u201d</p><p>He stopped, swore. Here it was, he thought bitterly. She\u2019d slap him down good and proper, and\u2014since he hadn\u2019t made a quick enough exit\u2014in public as well. Resigned to facing the music, he turned, tossed his streaming hair back over his shoulder.</p><p>She skidded to a halt inches in front of him. \u201cI\u2014\u201d She completely forgot what she\u2019d hoped to say.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve every right to be angry,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt hardly matters that I never meant\u2014that is, I\u2019d only wanted to...Goddamn it, what do you expect? You come in looking so sad and beautiful. So lost. I forgot myself, and I\u2019ve apologized for it.\u201d</p><p>She had been feeling lost, she realized. She wondered if he would understand what it was like to know just where you were, and to believe you knew where you were going, but to be lost just the same. She thought he might.</p><p>\u201cWill you have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, stepped back. Stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you have dinner with me?\u201d she repeated. She felt giddy, almost reckless. \u201cTonight. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to have dinner?\u201d He spoke slowly, spacing each word. \u201cWith me? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>He looked so baffled, so leery, that she laughed. \u201cYes. Actually, no, that isn\u2019t what I want at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He nodded stiffly and headed down the street.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want dinner,\u201d she called out, loudly enough to have heads turn. Almost reckless? she thought. Oh, no, completely reckless. \u201cI want you to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him. He turned back, ignored the wink and encouraging word from a man in a flowered shirt. Like a blind man feeling his way, he walked toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I caught that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll speak plainly.\u201d She swallowed a foolish bubble of pride. \u201cI want you to take me home with you, Joseph. And I want you to kiss me again. And unless I\u2019ve very much mistaken what we\u2019re both feeling, I want you to make love with me.\u201d She took the last step toward him. \u201cDid you understand that, and is it agreeable to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreeable?\u201d He took her face in his hands, stared hard into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind. Thank God.\u201d He laughed and swooped her against him. \u201cOh, it\u2019s more than agreeable, Patty darling. Much more.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>MAGGIE dozed off at her kitchen table, her head on her folded arms.</p><p>Moving day had been sheer hell.</p><p>Her mother had complained constantly, relentlessly, about everything from the steady fall of rain to the curtains Brianna had hung at the wide front window of the new house. But it was worth the misery of the day to see Maeve at last settled in her own place. Maggie had kept her word, and Brianna was free.</p><p>Still, Maggie hadn\u2019t expected the wave of guilt that swamped her when Maeve had wept\u2014her back bent, her face buried in her hands and the hot fast tears leaking through her fingers. No, she hadn\u2019t expected to feel guilty, or to feel so miserably sorry for the woman who\u2019d barely finished cursing her before she collapsed into sobs.</p><p>In the end it was Lottie, with her brisk, unflappable cheerfulness who had taken control. She scooted both Brianna and Maggie out of the house, telling them not to worry, no, not to worry a bit, as the tears were as natural as the rain. And what a lovely place it was, she\u2019d gone on to say, all the while nudging and pushing them along. Like a dollhouse and just as tidy. They\u2019d be fine. They\u2019d be cozy as cats.</p><p>She\u2019d all but shoved them into Maggie\u2019s lorry.</p><p>So it was done, and it was right. But there would be no opening of champagne bottles that night.</p><p>Maggie had downed one bracing whiskey and simply folded into a heap of exhausted emotions at the table while the rain drummed on the roof and dusk deepened the gloom.</p><p>The phone didn\u2019t awaken her. It rang demandingly while she dozed. But Rogan\u2019s voice stabbed through the fatigue and had her jolting up, shaking off sleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll expect to hear from you by morning, as I\u2019ve neither the time nor the patience to come fetch you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Groggy, she blinked like an owl and stared around the darkened room. Why, she\u2019d have sworn he\u2019d been right there, badgering her.</p><p>Annoyed that her nap had been interrupted, and that the interruption reminded her she was hungry and there was no more to eat in the house than would satisfy a bird, she pushed away from the table.</p><p>She\u2019d go down to Brie\u2019s, she decided. Raid her kitchen. Perhaps they could cheer each other up. She was reaching for a cap when she saw the impatient red blip on the answering machine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBloody nuisance,\u201d she muttered, but stabbed the buttons until the tape rewound, then played.</p><p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d Again, Rogan\u2019s voice filled the room. It made her smile as she realized he had been the one to wake her after all. \u201cWhy the devil don\u2019t you ever answer this thing? It\u2019s noon. I want you to call the moment you come in from your studio. I mean it. There\u2019s something I need to discuss with you. So\u2014I miss you. Damn you, Maggie, I miss you.\u201d</p><p>The message clicked off, and before she could feel too smug about it, another began.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ve nothing better to do than spend my time talking to this blasted machine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she answered back, \u201cbut you\u2019re the one who put it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s half four now, and I need to go by the gallery. Perhaps I didn\u2019t make myself clear. I need to speak with you, today. I\u2019ll be at the gallery until six, then you can reach me at home. I don\u2019t give a damn how wrapped up you are in your work. Damn you for being so far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man spends more time damning me than anything else,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just as far away from me as I am from you, Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>As if in answer, his voice came again. \u201cYou irresponsible, idiotic, insensitive brat. Am I supposed to worry now that you\u2019ve blown yourself up with your chemicals and set your hair on fire? Thanks to your sister, who does answer her phone, I know perfectly well you\u2019re there. It\u2019s nearly eight, and I have a dinner meeting. Now you listen to me, Margaret Mary. Get yourself to Dublin, and bring your passport. I won\u2019t waste my time explaining why, just do as you\u2019re told. If you can\u2019t arrange a flight, I\u2019ll send the plane for you. I expect to hear from you by morning, as I\u2019ve neither the time nor the patience to fetch you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetch me? As if you could.\u201d She stood for a moment, scowling at the machine. So she was supposed to get herself to Dublin, was she? Just because he demanded it. Never a please or a will you, just do what you\u2019re told.</p> <p>Ice would flow in hell before she\u2019d give him the satisfaction.</p><p>Forgetting her hunger, she stormed from the room and up the stairs. Get herself to Dublin, she fumed. The nerve of the man, ordering her about.</p><p>She yanked the suitcase out of her closet and heaved it onto the bed.</p><p>Did he think she was so eager to see him that she\u2019d drop everything and scramble off to do his bidding? He was going to find out differently. Oh, yes, she decided as she tossed clothes into the case. She was going to tell him differently, in person. Face-to-face.</p><p>She doubted he\u2019d thank her for it.</p><p>\u201cEileen, I\u2019ll need Limerick to fax me those adjusted figures before the end of the day.\u201d Behind his desk, Rogan checked off a line of his list, rubbed at the tension at the base of his neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll want to see the report on the construction there the moment it comes in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was promised by noon.\u201d Eileen, a trim brunette who managed the office as skillfully as she did her husband and three children, jotted a note. \u201cYou\u2019ve a two o\u2019clock meeting with Mr. Greenwald. That\u2019s re the changes in the London catalog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got that. He\u2019ll want martinis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cTwo olives. Should I see about a cheese tray to keep him from staggering out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d Rogan drummed his fingers on the desk. \u201cHas there been no call from Clare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone this morning.\u201d She shot a quick, interested look from under her lashes. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let you know the moment Miss Concannon calls.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound, the vocal equivalent of a shrug. \u201cGo ahead and put that call through to Rome if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away. Oh, and I have that draft of the letter to Inverness on my desk if you want to approve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. And we\u2019d best send a wire to Boston. What\u2019s the time there?\u201d He started to check his watch when a blur of color in the doorway stopped him. \u201cMaggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. Maggie.\u201d She tossed her suitcase down with a thud and fisted her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ve a few choice words for you, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d She bit down on her temper long enough to nod at the woman rising from the chair in front of Rogan\u2019s desk. \u201cYou\u2019d be Eileen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you at last, Miss Concannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to say so. I must say you look remarkably well for a woman who works for a tyrant.\u201d Her voice rose on the last word.</p><p>Eileen\u2019s lips twitched. She cleared her throat, closed her steno pad. \u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to say so. Is there anything else, Mr. Sweeney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hold my calls please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Eileen walked out, closing the door discreetly behind her.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Rogan leaned back in his chair, tapped his pen against his palm. \u201cYou got my message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>She walked across the room. No, Rogan thought, she swaggered across it, hands still fisted on hips, eyes flashing.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit that his mouth watered at the sight of her.</p><p>\u201cWho in this wide world do you think you are?\u201d She slapped her palms on his desk, rattling pens. \u201cI signed my work to you, Rogan Sweeney, and aye, I slept with you\u2014to my undying regret. But none of it gives you the right to order me about or swear at me every five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to you in days,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cSo how can I have sworn at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver your hideous machine\u2014which I tossed into the garbage this very morning.\u201d</p><p>Very calmly, he made a note on a pad.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m merely noting down that you need a replacement for your answering machine. You had no trouble getting a flight in, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble? You\u2019ve been nothing but trouble to me since the moment you walked into my glass house. Nothing but. You think you can just take over everything, not just my work\u2014which is bad enough\u2014but me as well. I\u2019m here to tell you that you can\u2019t. I won\u2019t\u2014where in the hell are you going? I haven\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you had.\u201d He continued to the door, locked it, turned back.</p><p>\u201cUnlock that door.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he was smiling as he came back toward her didn\u2019t help her nerves. \u201cDon\u2019t you put your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to. In fact, I\u2019m about to do something I haven\u2019t done in the twelve years I\u2019ve worked in this office.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began a fast hard tattoo in her throat. \u201cYou are not.\u201d</p> <p>So, he thought, he\u2019d finally shocked her. He watched her gaze slide to the door, then made his grab. \u201cYou can rage at me once I\u2019ve finished with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished with me?\u201d Even as she took a swing at him he was crushing his mouth to hers. \u201cGet off me, you ham-handed brute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like my hands.\u201d And he used them to tug her sweater up. \u201cYou told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. I won\u2019t have this, Rogan.\u201d But the denial ended in a moan as his lips skimmed hot over her throat. Then, \u201cI\u2019ll shout down the roof,\u201d once she got her breath back.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He bit her, none too gently. \u201cI like it when you shout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCurse you,\u201d she muttered, and went willingly when he lowered her to the floor.</p><p>It was fast and hot, a frantic coupling that was over almost as soon as it had begun. But the speed didn\u2019t diminish the power. They lay tangled together a moment longer, limbs vibrating. Rogan turned his head to press a kiss to her jaw.</p><p>\u201cNice of you to drop by, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>She summoned up the strength to bounce her fist off his shoulder. \u201cGet off of me, you brute.\u201d She would have shoved him, but he was already shifting, drawing her with him until she was straddled across his lap.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThan what?\u201d She grinned, then remembered she was furious with him. Pushing away, she sat on the rug and tidied her clothes. \u201cYou\u2019ve a nerve, you do, Rogan Sweeney.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I dragged you to the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snapped her jeans. \u201cIt\u2019d be foolish to say that when it\u2019s obvious I enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery obvious.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a steely look as he rose and offered her a hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there. Who do you think you are, ordering me about, telling me what to do without a will you or a won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He bent down and pulled her to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, you swine, to tell you that I won\u2019t tolerate it. Here it\u2019s been nearly a month since you walked away from my door whistling, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed me.\u201d</p> <p>She hissed at him. \u201cI did not. I have more than enough to keep my time filled. Oh, straighten that silly tie. You look like a drunkard.\u201d</p><p>He obliged her. \u201cYou missed me, Margaret Mary, though you never bothered to say so whenever I managed to reach you by phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk on the phone. How am I supposed to say anything to someone I can\u2019t see? And you\u2019re evading the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the issue?\u201d He leaned back comfortably against his desk.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be given orders. I\u2019m not one of your servants or one of your staff, so get that through your head. Mark it down in that fancy leather notebook of yours if you need reminding. But don\u2019t you ever tell me what to do again.\u201d She let out a short, satisfied breath. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve made that clear, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie. If you\u2019d no intention to stay, why did you pack a suitcase?\u201d</p><p>He had her there. Patiently he waited while annoyance, dismay and confusion flitted across her face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve a mind to stay in Dublin for a day or two. I can come and go as I please, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Did you bring your passport?\u201d</p><p>She eyed him warily. \u201cAnd what if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He circled around his desk, sat. \u201cIt\u2019ll save time. I thought you might have been stubborn and left it at home. It would have been a nuisance to go back and get it.\u201d He leaned back, smiling. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down? Shall I ask Eileen to bring in some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit, and I don\u2019t want tea.\u201d Folding her arms, she turned away from him and stared hard at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe on the wall. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a couple of reasons. One, I\u2019ve been swamped here. I had several matters I wanted to clear up so I\u2019d have a block of free time. Second, I wanted to stay away from you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did you?\u201d She kept her eyes trained on the bold colors. \u201cDid you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to admit how much I wanted to be with you.\u201d He waited, shook his head. \u201cNo response to that, I see. No I-wanted-to-be-with-you-as-well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Not that I don\u2019t have a life of my own. But there were odd moments when I would have liked your company.\u201d</p><p>And he would, it seemed, have to settle for that. \u201cYou\u2019re about to get it. Would you sit now, Maggie? There are some things we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d She turned back, sat in front of his desk. He looked perfect there, she thought. Dignified, competent, in charge. Not at all like a man who would have indulged in a wild tussle on the office rug. The idea made her smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering what your secretary might be thinking out there.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cI\u2019m sure she assumes we\u2019re having a civilized business discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! She looked like a sensible woman to me, but you go right on believing that.\u201d Pleased by the way his eyes flickered to the door, she propped her ankle on her knee. \u201cSo, what business are we about to discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014your work over the last few weeks has been exceptional. As you know, we held back ten pieces from the first showing with the purpose of touring them over the next year. I would like to keep a few of your newest pieces in Dublin, but the rest is already on its way to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your very efficient and very sensible Eileen told me.\u201d She began to tap her fingers on her ankle. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call me all the way to Dublin to tell me again\u2014nor do I think you called me here for a spot of hot sex on the office rug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I would have preferred discussing the plans with you over the phone, but you never bothered to return my calls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was out a good deal of the time. You may have exclusive rights to my work, but not to me, Rogan. I do have my own life, as I\u2019ve already explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA number of times.\u201d He could feel the temper seeping back into him. \u201cI\u2019m not interfering with your life. I\u2019m managing your career. And to that purpose, I\u2019ll be traveling to Paris to oversee the display, and the showing.\u201d</p><p>Paris. She\u2019d barely had an hour with him and he was already talking about leaving. Distressed by her own plummeting heart, she spoke crisply. \u201c\u2019Tis a wonder you keep your business thriving, Rogan. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be hiring people capable of handling details like that without you feeling the need to peek over their shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I have very competent people. As it happens, I have a vested interest in your work, and I want to handle those details myself. I want it done right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich means you want it done your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. And I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>The sarcastic little comment that had sprung to her lips slipped off. \u201cWith you? To Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize you have some artistic or possibly moral objection to promoting your own work, but you did well enough at the Dublin show. It would be advantageous to have you appear, however briefly, at your first international show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first international show,\u201d she repeated, dumb-founded as the phrase sank into her head. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t speak French.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. You\u2019ll have a look at the Paris gallery, dispense a bit of charm and have plenty of time to see the sights.\u201d He waited for her answer, received nothing but a blank stare. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d The first skitter of panic had her pressing a hand to her stomach. \u201cYou want me to go with you to Paris tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019ve some pressing previous engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d The relief was almost brutal. \u201cAfter we\u2019ve satisfied ourselves that the Paris show is successful, I\u2019d like you to go south with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a villa on the Mediterranean. I want to be alone with you, Maggie. No distractions, no interruptions. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lifted to his. \u201cThe block of time you\u2019ve been working on for these weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have shouted at you if you\u2019d explained it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to explain it to myself first. Will you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d only to ask.\u201d</p> <p>An hour later she burst into the gallery, only to stop and simmer with frustration as she waited for Joseph to finish with a client. While he charmed a woman old enough to be his mother, Maggie wandered around the main room, noting that the American Indian display had been replaced by a selection of metal sculptures. Intrigued by the shapes, she lost her sense of urgency in admiration.</p><p>\u201cA German artist,\u201d Joseph said from behind her. \u201cThis particular work is, I feel, both visceral and joyous. A celebration of elemental forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarth, fire, water, the suggestion of wind in the feathering of the copper.\u201d She put on an airy accent to match his. \u201cPowerful indeed in scope, but with an underlying mischief that suggests satire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it can be yours for a mere two thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bargain. A pity I\u2019m without a farthing to me name.\u201d She turned, laughing, and kissed him. \u201cYou\u2019re looking fit, Joseph. How many hearts have you broken since I left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNary a one. Since mine belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! A good thing for us both that I know you\u2019re full of blarney. Have you a minute to spare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, days. Weeks.\u201d He kissed her hand. \u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute will do me. Joseph, what do I need for Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tight black sweater, a short skirt and very high heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the day. Really, I\u2019m to go, and I haven\u2019t a clue what I\u2019ll need. I tried to reach Mrs. Sweeney, but she\u2019s out today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m your second choice. You devastate me.\u201d He signaled to one of his staff to take the room. \u201cAll you need for Paris, Maggie, is a romantic heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere can I buy one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your own. You can\u2019t hide it from me, I\u2019ve seen your work.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, then slipped her arm through his. \u201cListen now, I\u2019d not admit this to just anyone, but I\u2019ve never traveled. In Venice I only had to worry about learning and not wearing anything that would catch fire. And paying the rent. If I\u2019m going to have a trip to Paris, I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. You\u2019ll be going with Rogan, I take it, and he knows Paris as well as a native. You\u2019ve only to act a bit arrogant, a bit bored, and you\u2019ll fit right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to you for fashion advice. Oh, it\u2019s humiliating to say it, but I can\u2019t go looking like this. Not that I want to paint myself up like a mannequin, but I don\u2019t want to look like Rogan\u2019s country cousin either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Joseph took the question seriously, drawing her back to arm\u2019s length for a slow, careful study. \u201cYou\u2019d do just fine as you are, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy yourself a silk blouse, very tailored, but soft. Vivid colors, my girl, no pastels for you. Slacks of the same type. Use your eye for color. Go for the clash. And that short skirt is a must. You\u2019ve got that black dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring it with me.\u201d</p><p>He clucked his tongue like a maiden aunt. \u201cYou should always be prepared. All right, that\u2019s out, so go for glitter this time. Something that dazzles the eye.\u201d He tapped the sculpture beside them. \u201cThese metal tones would suit you. Don\u2019t go for classic, go for bold.\u201d Pleased with the thought, he nodded. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfusing. I\u2019m ashamed to find it matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing shameful about it. It\u2019s simply a matter of presentation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be, but I\u2019d be grateful to you if you didn\u2019t mention this to Rogan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cConsider me your confessor, darling.\u201d He looked over her shoulder, and Maggie saw joy leap into his eyes.</p><p>Patricia came in, hesitated, then crossed the glossy tiles. \u201cHello, Maggie. I didn\u2019t know you were coming to Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d What change was this? Maggie wondered. Gone was the shadowed sadness, the fragile reserve. It only took a moment, seeing the way Patricia\u2019s eyes lighted on Joseph\u2019s, to give her the answer. Aha, she thought. So there\u2019s where the wind blows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to tell Joseph...\u201d Patricia sputtered to a halt. \u201cAh, that is, I was passing by and remembered the business we\u2019d discussed. The seven o\u2019clock appointment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Joseph dipped his hands into his pockets to keep them from reaching for her. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to make it seven-thirty. I\u2019ve a bit of a conflict. I wanted to be sure that wouldn\u2019t upset the schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll adjust it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d She stood for a moment, staring foolishly at him before she remembered Maggie and her manners. \u201cWill you be in town long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow.\u201d The way the air was sizzling, Maggie thought, it was a wonder the sculptures didn\u2019t melt. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, please, don\u2019t run off on my account. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Patricia sent one more longing look in Joseph\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019ve people waiting for me. I just wanted to\u2014well, goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Maggie waited one beat. \u201cAre you just going to stand here?\u201d she hissed at Joseph as Patricia headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cHmm? What? Excuse me.\u201d He made the dash to the door in two seconds flat. She watched Patricia turn, blush, smile. Then they were in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>The romantic heart Maggie refused to believe she had, swelled. She waited until Patricia hurried out and Joseph stood staring after her like a man recently struck by lighting.</p><p>\u201cSo your heart belongs to me, does it?\u201d</p><p>The dazed look cleared from his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no denying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with her so long, even before she married Robbie. I never thought, never believed...\u201d He laughed a little, still dazzled by love. \u201cI thought it was Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. It\u2019s plain to see you make her happy.\u201d She kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re trying to keep it between us. At least until...for a while. Her family...I can guarantee her mother won\u2019t approve of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell with her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatricia said nearly the same thing.\u201d It brought a smile to his lips to remember it. \u201cBut I\u2019ll not be the cause of any trouble there. So I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d say nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to Rogan either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for him, Maggie. He\u2019s a friend, yes, but I work for him. Patricia\u2019s the widow of one of his oldest friends, a woman he\u2019s escorted himself. A great many people thought she\u2019d become his wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe Rogan was among them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d rather tell him myself when the time\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your business, Joseph. Yours and Patricia\u2019s. So we\u2019ll trade confession for confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. If Rogan\u2019s stiff-necked enough to disapprove, he deserves to be fooled.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>PARIS was hot, muggy and crowded. The traffic was abominable. Cars, buses, motorbikes screeched and swerved and sped, their drivers seemingly bent on challenging each other to endless roadway duels. Along the sidewalks, people strolled and swaggered in a colorful pedestrian parade. Women in those short skirts Joseph seemed so fond of looked lean and bored and impossibly chic. Men, equally fashionable, watched them from little caf\u00e9 tables where they sipped red wine or strong black coffee.</p><p>Flowers bloomed everywhere\u2014roses, gladiolus, marigolds, snapdragons, begonias tumbling out of vendors\u2019 stalls, sunning on banks, spilling out of the arms of young girls whose legs flashed bright as blades in the sunshine.</p><p>Boys skated by with yards of golden bread spearing up out of bags. Packs of tourists aimed cameras like so many shotguns to blast away at their shutter view of Paris life.</p><p>And there were dogs. The city seemed a veritable den of them, prancing on leashes, skulking in alleyways, darting by shops. Even the lowliest cur appeared exotic, wonderfully foreign and arrogantly French.</p><p>Maggie took it all in from her window overlooking the Place de la Concorde.</p><p>She was in Paris. The air was full of sound and scent and gaudy light. And her lover was sleeping like a stone in the bed behind her.</p><p>Or so she thought.</p><p>He\u2019d been watching her watch Paris for some time. She leaned out of the grand window, heedless of the cotton nightshirt falling off her left shoulder. She\u2019d acted wholly indifferent to the city when they\u2019d arrived the evening before. Her eyes had widened at the lush lobby of the H\u00f4tel de Crillon, but she\u2019d made no comment when they\u2019d checked in.</p><p>She\u2019d said little more when they entered the plush and lofty suite, and wandered away when Rogan tipped the bellman.</p><p>When he asked her if the room suited her, she\u2019d simply shrugged and said it would do well enough.</p><p>It made him laugh and drag her off to bed.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t quite so blas\u00e9 now, he noted. He could all but see the excitement shimmering around her as she stared out at the street and absorbed the bustling life of the city. Nothing could have pleased him more than to give her Paris.</p><p>\u201cIf you lean out much farther, you\u2019ll stop traffic.\u201d</p><p>She jolted and, dragging her hair from her eyes, looked around to where he lay among rumpled sheets and a mountain of pillows.</p><p>\u201cA bomb couldn\u2019t stop that traffic. Why do they want to kill each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of honor. What do you think of the city in daylight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crowded. Worse than Dublin.\u201d Then she relented and grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, Rogan. Like an old, bad-tempered woman holding court. There\u2019s a vendor down there with an ocean of flowers. And every time someone stops to look or buy, he ignores them, like it\u2019s beneath his dignity to notice them. But he takes their money, and counts every coin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She crawled back into bed and stretched herself over him. \u201cI know exactly how he feels,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNothing makes you more irritable than selling what you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t sell them, they\u2019d die.\u201d He tipped up her chin. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t sell what you love, part of you would die, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the part that needs to eat would without a doubt. Are you going to call up one of those fancy waiters and have him bring us breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes danced. \u201cOh, everything. Starting with this...\u201d</p><p>She tugged the sheets away and fell on him.</p><p>Quite a bit later she stepped out of the shower, wrapping herself in the plush white robe that had hung on the back of the door. She found Rogan at a table by the parlor window, pouring coffee and reading the paper.</p><p>\u201cThat newspaper\u2019s in French.\u201d She sniffed at a basket of croissants. \u201cYou read French and Italian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His brows were knit over the financial pages. He was thinking of calling his broker.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you read\u2014speak. Language I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome German. Enough Spanish to get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaelic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned the page, scanning for news of art auctions. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy father\u2019s mother spoke it, so I learned.\u201d Her shoulders moved restlessly as she slathered jam onto a steaming croissant. \u201cIt\u2019s not much good, I suppose, except for cursing. It won\u2019t get you the best table in a French restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s valuable. We\u2019ve lost a considerable amount of our heritage.\u201d Which was something he thought about, often. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that there are only pockets in Ireland where you can hear Irish spoken.\u201d Because this reminded him of an idea he\u2019d been toying with, he folded his paper and set it aside. \u201cSay something in Gaelic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay something for me, Maggie, in the old tongue.\u201d</p><p>She made a little sound of impatience, but obliged him. It was musical, exotic and as foreign to him as Greek.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve a pleasing face to see of a morning.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou see it\u2019s a language as useful for flattery as it is for cursing. Now say something to me in French.\u201d</p><p>He did more than speak. He leaned over, touched his lips softly to hers, then murmured, \u201cMe reveiller \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de toi, c\u2019est le plus beau de tous les r\u00eaves.\u201d Her heart did a long, slow swirl in her chest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat waking beside you is more lovely than any dream.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes. \u201cWell. It seems French is a tongue more given to pretty sounds than plain English.\u201d</p><p>Her quick, unplanned feminine reaction both amused and allured. \u201cI\u2019ve touched you. I should have tried French before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish.\u201d But he had touched her, deeply. She combated the uneasy weakness by attacking her meal. \u201cWhat am I eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs Benedict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d she said with her mouth full. \u201cA bit on the rich side, but good. What are we after doing today, Rogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still blushing, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She met his eyes narrowly, in a dare. \u201cI\u2019d like to know what the plans are. I\u2019m assuming this time you\u2019ll discuss them with me first instead of just tugging me along like an idiot dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m growing very fond of that wasp you call a tongue,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019m probably losing my mind. And before you sting me again, I thought you\u2019d enjoy seeing some of the city. You\u2019d no doubt enjoy the Louvre. So I\u2019ve left the morning quite clear for sight-seeing, or shopping, or whatever you\u2019d like. Then we\u2019ll go by the gallery later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>The notion of strolling through the great museum pleased her. She topped off Rogan\u2019s coffee, then heated up her own cup of tea. \u201cI\u2019d like to wander about, I suppose. As for shopping, I\u2019ll want to find something to take back for Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have something for Maggie as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie doesn\u2019t need anything. Besides, I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. You\u2019ve no need to deny yourself a present or two. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent what I\u2019ve earned.\u201d She grimaced over her cup. \u201cDo they have the nerve to call this tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019ve spent it?\u201d He set down his fork. \u201cOnly a month ago I gave you a check in the six figures. You can hardly have frittered that away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrittered?\u201d She gestured dangerously with her knife. \u201cDo I look like a fritterer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to mean? That I haven\u2019t the taste or style to spend my money well?\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand for peace. \u201cIt means nothing more than no. But if you\u2019ve wasted the money I gave you, I\u2019d like to know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasted nothing, as if it were your business to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my business. If you can\u2019t manage your money, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not. Why you pompous, penny-pinching ass, \u2019tis mine, isn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s gone, or most of it. So you\u2019ll just have to see that you sell my work and get me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I\u2019ll do. Now, where did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway.\u201d Infuriated, embarrassed, she shoved back from the table. \u201cI\u2019ve expenses, don\u2019t I? I needed supplies, and I was foolish enough to buy a dress.\u201d\u2019</p><p>He folded his hands. \u201cYou spent, in a month\u2019s time, nearly two hundred thousand pounds on supplies and a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a debt to pay,\u201d she raged at him. \u201cAnd why should I have to explain to you? It says nothing of how I spend my money in your bloody contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contract has nothing to do with it,\u201d he said patiently, because he could see it wasn\u2019t anger so much as mortification that was driving her. \u201cI\u2019m asking you where the money went. But you\u2019re certainly under no legal obligation to tell me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His reasonable tone only pinched harder at her humiliation. \u201cI bought my mother a house, though she\u2019ll never thank me for it. And I had to furnish it for her, didn\u2019t I? She\u2019d have taken every stick and cushion from Brianna otherwise.\u201d Frustrated, she dragged both hands through her hair and sent it into fiery tufts. \u201cAnd I had to hire Lottie, and see they had a car. And she\u2019ll have to be paid every week, so I gave Brie enough for six months in salary and for food and such. Then there was the lien, though Brie will be furious when she finds I\u2019ve paid it off. But it was mine to pay, as Da took it out for me. So it\u2019s done. I kept my word to him and I won\u2019t have you telling me what I should or shouldn\u2019t do with my own money.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d stormed around the room while she spoke and came to a halt now by the table where Rogan continued to sit, silently, patiently.</p><p>\u201cIf I might summarize?\u201d he said. \u201cYou bought a house for your mother, furnished it, purchased a car and hired a companion for her. You\u2019ve paid off a lien, which will displease your sister, but which you felt was your responsibility. You\u2019ve given Brianna enough to keep your mother for six months, bought supplies. And with what was left, you bought yourself a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I said. What of it?\u201d</p> <p>She stood there, trembling with fury, her eyes sharp and bright and eager for battle. He could, he mused, tell her he admired her incredible generosity, her loyalty to her family. But he doubted that she\u2019d appreciate the effort.</p><p>\u201cThat explains it.\u201d He picked up his coffee again. \u201cI\u2019ll see that you get an advance.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all sure she could speak. When she did, her voice came out in a dangerous hiss. \u201cI don\u2019t want your bloody advance. I don\u2019t want it. I\u2019ll earn my own keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you\u2019re doing\u2014and quite well. It\u2019s not charity, Maggie, or even a loan. It\u2019s a simple business transaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe damned to your business.\u201d Her face was pink with embarrassment now. \u201cI\u2019ll not take a penny until I\u2019ve earned it. I\u2019ve just gotten myself out of debt, I won\u2019t go into it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re stubborn.\u201d He tapped his fingers on the table as he thought her reaction through, trying to understand her display of passion. If it was pride she needed so badly, he could help her keep it. \u201cVery well, we\u2019ll do this another way entirely. We\u2019ve had several offers on your Surrender, which I\u2019ve turned down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. The last, I believe, was thirty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPounds!\u201d The word erupted from her. \u201cI was offered thirty thousand pounds for it, and you turned it down? Are you mad? It may seem like little or nothing to you, Rogan Sweeney, but I could live handsomely on that amount for more than a year. If this is how you manage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d And because he said it so casually, so absently, she did just that. \u201cI refused the offer because I intended to buy the piece myself, after we\u2019d toured it. I\u2019ll simply buy it now and it will continue on the tour as part of my collection. We\u2019ll make it thirty-five thousand.\u201d</p><p>He tossed off the amount as though it was loose change casually dropped on a bureau.</p> <p>Something inside her was trembling like the heart of a frightened bird. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, ethically, purchase it for myself at the same amount offered by a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean why do you want it?\u201d</p><p>He stopped his mental calculations and looked up at her. \u201cBecause it\u2019s beautiful work, intimate work. And because whenever I look at it, I remember making love with you the first time. You didn\u2019t want to sell it. Did you think I couldn\u2019t see that in your face the day you showed it to me? Did you really think I couldn\u2019t understand how much it hurt you to give it up?\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak, she simply shook her head and turned away.</p><p>\u201cIt was mine, Maggie, even before you finished it. As much, I think, as it was yours. And it\u2019ll go to no one else. I never intended it to go to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Still silent, she walked to the window. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to pay me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money,\u201d she said quickly, while she could. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014that piece was terribly special to me, and I\u2019d be grateful if you\u2019d accept it.\u201d She let out a long breath, staring hard through the glass. \u201cI\u2019d be pleased to know it was yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs,\u201d he said in a tone that drew her gaze back to his like a magnet. \u201cAs it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs, then.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHow can I stay angry with you?\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHow can I fight what you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid he was right about that. But she could, at least, take a stand on a smaller matter. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to you for offering an advance, but I don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s important to me to take only what I make, when I make it. I\u2019ve enough left to get by. I want no more than that for now. What needed to be done is done. From this point on, what comes will be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only money, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo easy to say when you\u2019ve more than you\u2019ve ever needed.\u201d The edge in her voice, so much like her mother\u2019s, stopped her cold. She took a deep breath and let out what was in her own heart. \u201cMoney was like an open wound in my house\u2014the lack of it, my father\u2019s skill for losing it, and my mother\u2019s constant nagging for more. I don\u2019t want to depend on pounds for my happiness, Rogan. And it frightens and shames me that I might.\u201d</p><p>So, he thought, studying her, this was why she\u2019d fought him every step of the way. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me once that you didn\u2019t pick up your pipe each day thinking about the profit on the other end of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think of it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Rogan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re arguing against shadows, Maggie.\u201d He rose to cross to her. \u201cThe woman you are has already decided that the future will be very different from the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d she murmured. \u201cEven if I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. You\u2019ll always be one to go forward.\u201d He kissed her softly on the brow. \u201cWill you get dressed now, Maggie? Let me give you Paris.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He did. For nearly a week he gave her everything the city had to offer, from the magnificence of Notre Dame to the intimacy of dim caf\u00e9s. He bought her flowers from the tight-lipped street vendor every morning until the suite smelled like a garden. They strolled along the Seine in the moonlight, Maggie with her shoes in her hand and the river\u2019s breeze on her cheeks. They danced in clubs to poorly played American music, and dined on glorious food and wine at Maxim\u2019s.</p><p>She watched him pore over the sidewalk art, searching always for another diamond in the rough. And though he winced when she bought an undoubtedly bad painting of the Eiffel Tower, she only laughed and told him art was in the soul, not always in the execution.</p><p>The hours she spent in the Paris gallery were just as exciting to her. While Rogan ordered, directed and arranged she saw her work shine under his vigilant eye.</p><p>A vested interest, he\u2019d said. She couldn\u2019t deny that he tended his interests well. He was as passionate and attentive to her art during those afternoons as he was to her body during the nights.</p> <p>When it was done, and the last piece was set to shine under the lights, she thought that the show was every bit as much a result of his efforts as of her own.</p><p>But partnership didn\u2019t always equal harmony.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Maggie, if you keep fussing in there we\u2019ll be late.\u201d For the third time in as many minutes, Rogan knocked on the bedroom door she\u2019d locked.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you keep bothering me, we\u2019ll be later still,\u201d she called out. \u201cGo away. Better yet, go on to the gallery yourself. I can get myself there when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d he muttered, but her ears were sharp.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a keeper, Rogan Sweeney.\u201d She was breathless from struggling to reach the low zipper of her dress. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man so ruled by the hands of a clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never seen a woman more careless of time. Would you unlock this door? It\u2019s infuriating to have to shout through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d By nearly dislocating her arm, she managed to fasten the dress. She wriggled her feet into ridiculously high bronze heels, cursed herself for being fool enough to take Joseph\u2019s advice, then twisted the lock. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken so long if they made women\u2019s clothes with the same consideration they make men\u2019s. Your zippers are within easy reach.\u201d She stopped, tugged once on the short hem of the dress. \u201cWell? Is it all right or not?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing at all, only twirled his finger to indicate he wanted her to circle. Rolling her eyes to heaven, she complied.</p><p>The dress was strapless, nearly backless, with a skirt that halted teasingly at midthigh. It glittered, bronze, copper, gold, sparking fire at every breath. Her hair echoed the tone so that she seemed like a candle flame, slim and bright.</p><p>\u201cMaggie. You take my breath away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe seamstress wasn\u2019t generous with material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire her parsimony.\u201d</p><p>When he continued to stare, she lifted her brows. \u201cYou said we were in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted higher as he started toward her. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, if you get me out of this dress, it\u2019ll be your responsibility to get me back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs attractive as that sounds, it\u2019ll have to wait. I\u2019ve a present for you, and it seems that the fates guided my hand. I believe this will complement your dress nicely.\u201d</p><p>He reached into the inside pocket of his tux and took out a slim velvet box.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already bought me a present. That huge bottle of scent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was for me.\u201d He leaned over to sniff her bare shoulder. The smoky perfume might have been created with her in mind. \u201cVery much for me. This is for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since it\u2019s too small to be another answering machine, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d But when she opened the box, the chuckle died in her throat. Rubies, square flames of them, simmered with white-hot diamonds in a three-tiered choker tied together by twists of glinting gold. No delicate bauble, but a bold flash, a lightning flash of color and heat and gleam.</p><p>\u201cSomething to remember Paris by,\u201d Rogan told her as he slipped it from the box. The necklace ran like blood and water through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s diamonds. Rogan, I can\u2019t wear diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d He brought it to her throat, his eyes on hers as he fastened the clasp. \u201cNot alone perhaps. They\u2019d be cold and wouldn\u2019t suit you. But with the other stones...\u201d He stepped back to take in the effect. \u201cYes, exactly right. You look like a pagan goddess.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop her hand from reaching up, from running across the gems. They felt warm against her skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay thank you, Rogan. It\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rogan.\u201d Her smile bloomed and spread. \u201cIt\u2019s a great deal more than lovely. It\u2019s dazzling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you.\u201d He leaned into the kiss, then patted her bottom. \u201cNow get a move on, or we\u2019ll be late. Where\u2019s your wrap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical,\u201d he murmured, and pulled her out the door.</p><p>Maggie thought she handled her second showing with a great deal more panache than she had the first. Her stomach wasn\u2019t nearly as jittery, her temper not nearly as short. If she did, once or twice, think wistfully of escape, she covered it well.</p><p>And if she pined for something she couldn\u2019t have, she reminded herself that success sometimes had to be enough in itself.</p><p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>She turned from the heavily accented ramblings of a Frenchman whose eyes had rarely left her cle**age and stared dumbstruck at her sister.</p><p>\u201cBrianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly is.\u201d Smiling, Brianna gathered her astonished sister in an embrace. \u201cI would have been here an hour ago, but there was a delay at the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how? How are you here at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan sent his plane for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan?\u201d Baffled, Maggie scanned the room until she found him. He only smiled at her, then at Brianna, before returning his attention to an enormous woman in fuchsia lace. Maggie nudged her sister to a corner of the room. \u201cYou came on Rogan\u2019s plane?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought I would have to let you down again, Maggie.\u201d More than a little overwhelmed by the sight of Maggie\u2019s work glittering in a roomful of exotic strangers, Brianna slipped her hand into her sister\u2019s. \u201cI was trying to think of how to manage it. Mother\u2019s fine with Lottie, of course, and I knew I could leave Con with Murphy. I even asked Mrs. McGee if she\u2019d look after Blackthorn for a day or two. But then there was the how to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to come,\u201d Maggie said softly. \u201cYou wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. I wanted nothing more than to be with you. But I never imagined it would be like this.\u201d Brie stared at the white-coated waiter who offered her champagne from his silver tray. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it mattered to you.\u201d To clear the emotion from her throat, Maggie drank deeply. \u201cI was, just now, standing here thinking I wished it mattered to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Maggie, so proud. I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe you. Oh God.\u201d She felt the tears well up and blinked them furiously away.</p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself, thinking so little of my feelings,\u201d Brie scolded.</p><p>\u201cYou never showed any interest,\u201d Maggie fired back.</p><p>\u201cI showed all the interest I could. I don\u2019t understand what you do, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t make me proud that you do it.\u201d Coolly, Brianna tipped back her glass. \u201cOh,\u201d she murmured, staring at the bubbling wine, \u201cbut that\u2019s lovely. Who\u2019d have thought anything could taste like that?\u201d</p> <p>With a hoot of laughter, Maggie kissed her sister hard on the mouth. \u201cJesus save us, Brie, what are we doing here? The two of us, drinking champagne in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI for one am going to enjoy it. I have to thank Rogan. Do you think I could interrupt him for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019ve told me the rest. When did you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, he called me. A week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and before I could wish him good morning, he was telling me what I would do and how I would do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d be sending the plane, and that I was to meet his driver at the airport in Paris. I tried to get a word in, but he rolled right over me. The driver would take me to the hotel. Have you ever seen the like of that place, Maggie? It\u2019s like a palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly swallowed my tongue when I walked in. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I was to get myself ready, and the driver would bring me here. Which he did, though I thought for certain he\u2019d kill me along the way. And there was this in the hotel room, with a note from him telling me it would please him if I\u2019d wear it.\u201d She brushed a hand down the misty blue silk of the evening suit she wore. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken it, but he put the request in such a way I\u2019d have felt rude not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good at that. And you look wonderful in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel wonderful in it. I confess, my head\u2019s still spinning from planes and cars and all this. All of this,\u201d she said again, staring around the room. \u201cThese people, Maggie, they\u2019re all here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you are. Shall I take you around so you can charm them for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re charmed already, just seeing the two of you.\u201d Rogan stepped beside them and took Brianna\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s delightful to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to you for arranging it. I can\u2019t begin to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just have. You don\u2019t mind if I introduce you around? Mr. LeClair\u2014there, the rather flamboyant-looking man by Maggie\u2019s Momentum? He\u2019s just confessed to me that he\u2019s fallen in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly falls easily, but I\u2019ll be pleased to meet him. I\u2019d like to wander about as well. I\u2019ve never seen Maggie\u2019s work shown like this.\u201d</p><p>It took only minutes before Maggie was able to draw Rogan aside again. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I need to circulate,\u201d she said before he could do just that. \u201cI have something I need to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you say it quickly. It doesn\u2019t do for me to monopolize the artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long for me to tell you that this was the kindest thing anyone has every done for me. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the distraction of the rapid French a woman chattered at his shoulder and took Maggie\u2019s hand to his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you unhappy again, and it was the simplest thing in the world to arrange for Brianna to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have been simple.\u201d She remembered the ragged artist he\u2019d escorted up the elegant steps of the gallery. That, too, had been simple. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it any less kind. And to show you what it means to me, I\u2019ll not only stay through the whole evening, until the last guest toddles out the door, I\u2019ll talk to every one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely. No matter how often I hear the word visceral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cNow get to work.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>IF Paris had staggered her, the south of France with its sweep of beaches and snow-covered mountains left Maggie awestruck. There was no rattle of traffic here in Rogan\u2019s sparkling villa overlooking the searing blue waters of the Mediterranean, no crowds bustling toward shops or caf\u00e9s.</p><p>The people who dotted the beach were no more than part of the painting that encompassed water and sand, bobbing boats and an endless, cloudless sky.</p><p>The countryside, which she could see from one of the many terraces that graced the villa, spread out in neat square fields bordered by stone fences like the ones she saw from her own doorway in Clare. But here, the ground rose up in terraced slopes, from orchards on sunny embankments to the higher green of the forests and on to the foothills of the magnificent Alps.</p><p>Rogan\u2019s grounds were lush with blooms and flowering herbs, exotic with olive and box trees and the sparkle of fountains. The quiet was disturbed only by the call of gulls and the music of falling water.</p><p>Content, Maggie lounged in one of the padded chaises on a sun-washed terrace and sketched.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d Rogan stepped out and dropped a kiss, both casual and intimate, on the top of her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to stay inside on such a day.\u201d She squinted up at him until he took the shaded glasses she\u2019d tossed on a table and slipped them on her nose. \u201cDid you finish your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d He sat beside her, shifting so as not to block her view. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so long. One call seemed to lead to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter. I like being on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d He peeked into the sketchbook. \u201cA seascape?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s irresistible. And I thought I\u2019d draw some of the scenery, so Brie could see it. She had such a wonderful time in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry she could only stay one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne lovely day. It\u2019s hard to believe I strolled along the Left Bank with my sister. The Concannon sisters in Paris.\u201d It still made her laugh to think of it. \u201cShe\u2019ll not forget it, Rogan.\u201d Tucking her pencil behind her ear, Maggie took his hand. \u201cNeither will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve thanked me, both of you. And the truth is I did nothing more than make a few calls. Speaking of calls, one that kept me away just now was from Paris.\u201d Reaching over, Rogan selected a sugared grape from the basket of fruit beside them. \u201cYou\u2019ve an offer, Maggie, from the Comte de Lorraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDe Lorraine?\u201d Lips pursed, she searched her memory. \u201cAh, the skinny old man with a cane who talked in whispers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rogan was amused to hear her describe one of the wealthiest men in France as a skinny old man. \u201cHe\u2019d like to commission you to make a gift for his granddaughter\u2019s wedding this December.\u201d</p><p>Her hackles rose instinctively. \u201cI\u2019ll take no commissions, Rogan. I made that clear from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, yes.\u201d Rogan took another grape and popped it into Maggie\u2019s mouth to keep her quiet. \u201cBut it\u2019s my obligation to inform you of any requests. I\u2019m not suggesting you agree, though it would be quite an impressive feather in your\u2014and Worldwide\u2019s\u2014cap. I\u2019m simply fulfilling my duties as your manager.\u201d</p><p>Eyeing him, Maggie swallowed the grape. His tone, she noted, was as sugarcoated as the fruit. \u201cI\u2019ll not do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour choice, naturally.\u201d He waved the entire matter away. \u201cShall I ring for something cold? Lemonade perhaps, or iced tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maggie took the pencil from behind her ear, tapped it on her pad. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in made-to-order.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd why should you be?\u201d he responded, all reason. \u201cYour Paris showing was every bit as successful as the one in Dublin. I have every confidence that this will continue in Rome and beyond. You\u2019re well on your way, Margaret Mary.\u201d He leaned down and kissed her. \u201cNot that the comte\u2019s request has anything to do with made-to-order. He\u2019s quite willing to leave it completely in your hands.\u201d</p><p>Cautious, Maggie tipped down her glasses and studied him over the tip. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to sweet-talk me into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d But, of course, he was. \u201cI should add, however, that the comte\u2014a very well-respected art connoisseur, by the way\u2014is willing to pay handsomely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d She shoved her glasses in place again, then swore. \u201cHow much is handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to the equivalent of fifty thousand pounds. But I know how adamant you are about the money angle, so you needn\u2019t give it a thought. I told him it was unlikely you\u2019d be interested. Would you like to go down to the beach? Take a drive?\u201d</p><p>Before he could rise, Maggie snagged his collar. \u201cOh, you\u2019re a sneaky one, aren\u2019t you, Sweeney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen needs be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be whatever I choose to make? Whatever came to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would.\u201d He traced a finger over her bare shoulder, which was beginning to turn the color of a peach in the sun. \u201cExcept...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, here we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue,\u201d Rogan said, and grinned. \u201cHe wants blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue, is it?\u201d The laugh began to shake her. \u201cAny particular shade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as his granddaughter\u2019s eyes. He claims they are as blue as the summer sky. It seems she\u2019s his favorite, and after he saw your work in Paris, nothing would do but that she have something made for her alone from your lovely hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis words or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit of both,\u201d Rogan answered, kissing one of those lovely hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped you would.\u201d No longer concerned with blocking her view, he leaned over to nibble at her lips. \u201cBut think about it later, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcusez-moi, monsieur.\u201d A bland-faced servant stood on the edge of the terrace, his hands at his sides and his eyes discreetly aimed toward the sea.</p><p>\u201cOui, Henri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVous et mademoiselle, voudriez-vous d\u00e9jeuner sur la terrasse maintenant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, nous allons d\u00e9jeuner plus tard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTr\u00e8s bien, monsieur.\u201d Henri faded away, silent as a shadow into the house.</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that about?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know if we wanted lunch. I said we\u2019d eat later.\u201d When Rogan started to lean down again, Maggie stopped him with a hand slapped to his chest. \u201cProblem?\u201d Rogan murmured. \u201cI can call him back and tell him we\u2019re ready after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to call him.\u201d It made her uneasy to think of Henri, or any of the other servants, lurking in a corner, waiting to serve. She wriggled off the chaise. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever want to be alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are alone. That\u2019s exactly why I wanted to bring you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone? You must have six people puttering around the house. Gardeners and cooks, maids and butlers. If I were to snap my fingers right now, one of them would come running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly the purpose in having servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want them. Do you know one of those little maids wanted to wash out my underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s her job to tend to you, not because she wanted to riffle your drawers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tend to myself. Rogan, I want you to send them away. All of them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rose at that. \u201cYou want me to fire the help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for pity sakes, I\u2019m not a monster, tossing innocent people out on the street. I want you to send them off, that\u2019s all. On a holiday, or whatever you\u2019d call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can certainly give the staff a day off, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a day, the week.\u201d She blew out a breath, seeing his puzzlement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to you, and why should it? You\u2019re so used to them, you don\u2019t even see them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis name was Henri, the cook is Jacques, the maid who so cheekily offered to wash your lingerie is Marie.\u201d Or possibly, he thought, Monique.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t after starting a quarrel.\u201d She came forward, her hands reaching for his. \u201cI can\u2019t relax as you do with all these people hovering about. I\u2019m just not used to it\u2014I don\u2019t think I want to be. Do this for me, please, Rogan. Give them a few days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here a moment.\u201d</p><p>When he left, she stood on the terrace, feeling foolish. Here she was, she mused, lounging in a Mediterranean villa with anything she could ask for within her reach. And she still wasn\u2019t satisfied.</p><p>She\u2019d changed, she realized. In the few short months since she met Rogan, she had changed. She not only wished for more now, she coveted more of what she didn\u2019t have. She wanted the ease and the pleasure money could bring, and not just for her family. She wanted it for herself.</p> <p>She\u2019d worn diamonds and had danced in Paris.</p><p>And she wanted to do so again.</p><p>Yet, deep within her, there remained that small, hot need to be only herself, to need nothing and no one. If she lost that, Maggie thought with a whip of panic, she would have lost everything.</p><p>She snatched up her sketch pad, flipped pages. But for a moment, a terrifying moment, her mind was as blank as the sheet in front of her. Then she began to draw frantically, with a violent intensity that burst from her like a gale.</p><p>It was herself she drew. The two parts, twisted together, pulled apart and so desperately trying to meet again. But how could they, when one was so completely opposed to the other?</p><p>Art for art\u2019s sake, solitude for sanity, independence for pride. And on the other side\u2014ambition, hungers and needs.</p> <p>She stared at the completed sketch, dumbfounded that it had poured out of her so swiftly. And now that it had, she was oddly calm. Perhaps it was those two opposing forces that made her what she was. And perhaps if she were ever really at peace, she\u2019d be less than she could be.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone.\u201d</p><p>Her mind still drifting, she looked blankly up at Rogan. \u201cWhat? Who\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>On a half laugh, he shook his head. \u201cThe staff. That\u2019s what you wanted, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe staff? Oh.\u201d Her mind cleared, settled. \u201cYou\u2019ve sent them off? All of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, though God alone knows how we\u2019ll eat over the next few days. Still\u2014\u201d He broke off when she leaped into his arms. As she\u2019d shot at him like a bullet from a gun, he staggered back, overbalancing to keep them from crashing through the beveled-glass door behind him and nearly tumbling them over the railing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful man, Rogan. A prince of a man.\u201d</p><p>He shifted her in his arms and looked wearily at the drop over the rail. \u201cI was nearly a dead man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone? Completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are, and I\u2019ve earned the undying gratitude of everyone from the butler down. The parlor maid wept with joy.\u201d As he supposed she should, with the holiday bonus he\u2019d given her and the rest of the servants. \u201cSo now they\u2019re off to the beach or to the country or to wherever their hearts lead them. And we\u2019ve the house to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, hard. \u201cAnd we\u2019re about to use every inch of it. We\u2019ll start with that sofa in the room just through there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we?\u201d Amused, he made no protest as she began unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re full of demands today, Margaret Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe business with the servants was a request. The sofa\u2019s a demand.\u201d</p><p>He cocked a brow. \u201cThe chaise is closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is.\u201d She laughed as he lowered her to it. \u201cSo it is.\u201d</p><p>Over the next few days they sunned on the terrace, walked on the beach or swam lazy laps in the lagoonlike pool to the music of the fountains. There were ill-prepared meals to be eaten in the kitchen and afternoon drives through the countryside.</p><p>There were also, to Maggie\u2019s mind, entirely too many telephones.</p><p>It might have been a holiday, but Rogan was never farther than a phone or a fax away from business. There was something about a factory in Limerick, something else about an auction in New York, and unintelligible mutters about property he was looking for in order to add another branch to Worldwide Galleries.</p><p>It might have annoyed her if she hadn\u2019t begun to see that his work was as much a part of his identity as her work was to hers. All differences aside, she could hardly complain about him spending an hour or two closeted in his office when he took her absorption in her sketches in stride.</p><p>If she had believed in a man and woman finding the kind of harmony that was needed to last a lifetime, she might have believed she\u2019d found it with Rogan.</p><p>\u201cLet me see what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>With a contented yawn, Maggie offered him her sketchbook. The sun was setting, drowning colors sweeping the western sky. Between them the bottle of wine he\u2019d chosen from his cellar nestled in a silver bucket frosty with ice. Maggie lifted her glass, sipped and settled back to enjoy her last evening in France.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be busy when you get home,\u201d Rogan commented as he studied each sketch. \u201cHow will you choose which one to work on first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will choose me. And as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed being lazy, I\u2019m itching to get back and fire up my furnace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have the ones you\u2019ve drawn up for Brianna matted and framed. For simple pencil sketches they\u2019re quite good. I particularly like...\u201d He trailed off when he turned a page and came across something entirely different from a sketch of the sea or a landscape. \u201cAnd what have we here?\u201d</p><p>Almost too lazy to move, she glanced over. \u201cOh, yes, that. I don\u2019t do portraits often, but that one was irresistible.\u201d</p><p>It was himself, stretched over the bed, his arm flung out as if he\u2019d been reaching for something. For her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taken by surprise and not entirely pleased, he frowned down at the sketch. \u201cYou drew this while I was asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to wake you and spoil the moment.\u201d She hid her grin in her glass. \u201cYou were sleeping so sweetly. Perhaps you\u2019d like to hang that one in your Dublin gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNude is the word, I\u2019ll remind you. When it\u2019s art. And you look very artistic nude, Rogan. I\u2019ve signed it, you see, so you may get a nice price for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>She tucked her tongue in her cheek. \u201cAs my manager it\u2019s your duty to market my work. You\u2019re always saying so yourself. And this, if I do say so, is one of my finest drawings. You\u2019ll note the light, and the way it plays on the muscles of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said in a strangled voice. \u201cAnd so would everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be modest. You\u2019ve a fine form. I think I captured it even better in this other one.\u201d</p><p>His blood, quite simply, ran cold. \u201cOther one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Let\u2019s see now.\u201d She reached over to flip pages herself. \u201cHere we are. Shows a bit more...contrast when you\u2019re standing, I think. And a bit of that arrogance comes through as well.\u201d</p><p>Words failed him. She\u2019d drawn him standing on the terrace, one arm resting on the rail behind him, the other cupping a brandy snifter. And a smile\u2014a particularly smug smile\u2014on his face. It was all he was wearing.</p><p>\u201cI never posed for this. And I\u2019ve never stood naked on the terrace drinking brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtistic license,\u201d she said airly, delighted that she\u2019d flummoxed him so completely. \u201cI know your body well enough to draw it from memory. It would have spoiled the theme to bother with clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe theme? Which is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster of the house. I thought that\u2019s what I\u2019d title it. Both of them actually. You might offer them as a set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be selling them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? I\u2019d like to know? You\u2019ve sold several of my other drawings that aren\u2019t nearly as well done. Those I didn\u2019t want you to sell, but I\u2019d signed on the dotted line, so you did. I want you to market these.\u201d Her eyes danced. \u201cIn fact, I insist, as I believe is my right, contractually speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy them myself, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your offer? My dealer tells me my price is rising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing me, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d She toasted him then sipped more wine. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to meet my price.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the sketch again before firmly closing the book. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see now.... I think if I was taken upstairs and made love to until moonrise, we might have a deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a shrewd business sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned it from a master.\u201d She started to stand, but he shook his head and scooped her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI want no slipping through loopholes on this deal. I believe your terms were that you be taken upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight you are. I suppose that\u2019s why I need a manager.\u201d She wound a lock of his hair around her fingers as he carried her into the house. \u201cYou know, of course, if I\u2019m not satisfied with the rest of the terms, the deal\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201d</p><p>At the top of the stairs he stopped to kiss her. Her response was, as always, fast and urgent, and as always, it quickened his blood. He stepped into the bedroom, where the softened light of sunset swam through the windows. Soon the light would go gray with dusk.</p><p>Their last night alone would not be spent in the dark.</p><p>Thinking this, he laid her on the bed, and when she reached for him, he slipped away to light candles. They were scattered through the room, some stubs, some slim tapers, all burned down to varying lengths. Maggie knelt on the bed while Rogan struck the flames and sent the light dancing gold.</p><p>\u201cRomance.\u201d She smiled and felt oddly touched. \u201cIt seems a spot of blackmail\u2019s been well worth the effort.\u201d</p><p>He paused, a flaring match between his fingers. \u201cHave I given you so little romance, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only joking.\u201d She tossed back her breeze-ruffled hair. His voice had been much too serious. \u201cI\u2019ve no need for romance. Honest lust is quite good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what we have?\u201d Thoughtfully he set the match to the wick then shook it out. \u201cLust.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she held out her arms. \u201cIf you\u2019d stop wandering about the room and come over here, I\u2019ll show you exactly what we have.\u201d</p><p>She looked dazzling in the candle glow with the last colors of day bleeding through the windows beside the bed. Her hair afire, her skin kissed by her days in the sun and her eyes aware, mocking and unquestionably inviting.</p><p>On other days and other nights he would have dived into that invitation, accepted it, reveled in it and the firestorm they could make between them. But his mood had shifted. He crossed slowly to her, taking her hands before they could tug him eagerly into the bed with her, lifting them to his lips as his eyes watched her.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the bargain, Margaret Mary. I was to make love to you. It\u2019s time I did.\u201d He kept her hands in his, drawing her arms down to her sides as he leaned forward to toy with her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s time you let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat foolishness is that?\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t steady. He was kissing her as he had once before, slowly, gently, and with the utmost concentration. \u201cI\u2019ve done more than let you a great many times before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d He felt her hands flex against his, her body draw back. \u201cAre you so afraid of tenderness, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get her breath, yet she could hear it, feel it coming slow and heavy through her lips. Her whole body was tingling, yet he was barely touching her. Something was slipping away from her. \u201cRogan, I don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be seduced?\u201d He took his lips from hers, let them roam leisurely over her face.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d But her head tilted back as he skimmed his mouth down her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to be.\u201d</p><p>He released her hands then to draw her closer. No fevered embrace this time, but an inescapable possession. Her arms seemed impossibly heavy as she wound them round his neck. She could do no more than cling as he stroked her hair, her face, with gentle fingertips that felt no more substantial than a whisper on the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth came back to hers in a moist, deep, sumptuous kiss that went on endlessly, endlessly, until she was as pliant as wax in his arms.</p><p>He\u2019d cheated both of them, Rogan realized as he laid her back on the bed. By letting only the fire take them, he\u2019d kept them both from experiencing all the warm, waiting wells of tenderness.</p><p>Tonight it would be different.</p><p>Tonight he would take her through a labyrinth of dreams before the flames.</p> <p>The taste of him seeped into her, stunning her, staggering her with tenderness. The greed that had always been so much a part of their lovemaking had mellowed into a lazy patience she could neither resist nor refuse. Long before he opened her blouse and skimmed those smooth, clever fingertips over her skin, she was floating.</p><p>Limply her hands slid from his shoulders. Her breath caught and expelled as he laved his tongue over her, seeking small secret tastes, lingering over them. Savoring. Drifting on that slow sweep of sensation, she was aware of every pulse point he awakened, of the long, quiet pull from deep inside her. So different from an explosion. So much more devastating.</p><p>She murmured his name when he cupped a hand under her head and lifted her melting body to his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Maggie. No one else will ever take you here.\u201d</p><p>She should have objected to this new demand for exclusivity. But she couldn\u2019t. For his mouth was journeying over her again as if he had years, decades, to complete the exploration.</p> <p>The candlelight flickered dreamily against her heavy lids. She could smell the flowers she\u2019d picked only that morning and had placed in a blue vase by the window. She heard the breeze heralding the Mediterranean night with the scents of blossoms and water in its wake. Beneath his fingers and lips her skin softened and her muscles quivered.</p><p>How could he not have known he\u2019d wanted her like this? All the fires banked, only glowing embers and drifting smoke. She moved under his hands helplessly, unable to do anything but absorb what he gave her, follow where he led. Even as the blood pounded in his head, in his loins, he kept the caresses light, teasing, waiting for her, watching her slide from one into the next melting sensation.</p><p>When she trembled, when a new sighing moan slipped through her lips, he took her hands again, braceleting them in one of his so that he was free to urge her over the first edge.</p><p>Her body bowed, her lashes fluttered. He watched as that first velvet fist took her breath. Then she went fluid again, languid and limp. Her pleasure welled inside of him.</p><p>The sun sank. Candles guttered. He guided her up again, a higher peak that made her cry out weakly. The sound echoed away into sighs and murmurs. When her heart was so full that it, too, seemed to weep, he slipped into her, taking her tenderly while the moon rose.</p><p>Perhaps she slept. She knew she dreamed. When she opened her eyes again, the moon was up and the room was empty. Languid as a cat, she considered curling up again. But even as she nuzzled into the pillow she knew she would not sleep without him.</p> <p>She rose, floating a little as though her mind was dazed with wine. She found a robe, a thin swatch of silk that Rogan had insisted on giving her. It settled smoothly against her skin as she went to find him.</p><p>\u201cI should have known you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>He was in the kitchen, standing shirtless in front of the gleaming stove in the brilliant white-and-black kitchen. \u201cThinking of your stomach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of yours, my girl.\u201d He turned off the fire under the skillet before he turned. \u201cEggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d It was all either of them could competently cook. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019re cackling when we get back to Ireland tomorrow.\u201d Because she felt unexpectedly awkward, she raked a hand through her hair once, then twice. \u201cYou should have made me get up and fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade you?\u201d He reached up for plates. \u201cThat would be a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, I\u2019d have done it. After all, I don\u2019t feel I did my part before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUpstairs. In bed. I didn\u2019t exactly do my share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bargain\u2019s a bargain.\u201d He scooped eggs into plates. \u201cAnd from my point of view, you did very well indeed. Watching you unravel was an incredible pleasure for me.\u201d One he intended to experience again, very soon. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down and eat. The moon\u2019ll be up for some time yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it will.\u201d More at ease, she joined him at the table. \u201cAnd this may just give me my energy back. Do you know,\u201d she said with her mouth full. \u201cI\u2019d no idea that sex could make you so weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just sex.\u201d</p><p>Her fork paused halfway to her lips at his tone. There was hurt beneath the sharp annoyance, and she was sorry to have caused it. Amazed that she could. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way, Rogan. Not so impersonally. When two people are fond of each other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a great deal more than fond of you, Maggie. I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>The fork slipped from her fingers and clattered on the plate. Panic tore at her throat in sharp, hungry fangs. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He said it calmly, though he was cursing himself for making his declaration in a brightly lit kitchen over badly cooked eggs. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014you can\u2019t tell me what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can when you\u2019re too foolish to say so yourself. What\u2019s between us is far more than physical attraction. If you weren\u2019t so pigheaded, you\u2019d stop pretending it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pigheaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, but I find that\u2019s one of the things I like about you.\u201d He was thinking coolly now, pleased to be back in control. \u201cWe might have discussed all this under more atmospheric circumstances, but knowing you, it hardly matters. I\u2019m in love with you, and I want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>MARRIAGE? The word stuck in her throat, threatened to choke her. She didn\u2019t dare repeat it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve considered the possibility.\u201d He picked up his fork and ate with the appearance of sanity. But the hurt, unexpected and raw, scraped at him. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn, often rude, more than occasionally self-absorbed and not a little temperamental.\u201d</p><p>For a moment her mouth worked like a guppy\u2019s. \u201cOh, am I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou most certainly are, and a man would have to have taken leave of his senses to want that sort of baggage for a lifetime. But\u201d\u2014he poured out the tea he\u2019d had steeping\u2014\u201cthere you are. I believe it\u2019s customary to use the bride\u2019s church, so we\u2019ll be married in Clare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCustomary? Hang your customs, Rogan, and you with them.\u201d Was this panic she felt, skidding along her spine like jagged ice? Surely not, she told herself. It had to be temper. She had nothing to fear. \u201cI\u2019m not marrying you or anyone. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. Of course you\u2019ll marry me. We\u2019re amazingly well suited, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA moment ago I was stubborn and temperamental and rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you are. And it suits me.\u201d He took her hand, ignored her resistance and tugged it to his lips. \u201cAnd it suits me beautifully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t suit me. Not at all. Perhaps I\u2019ve softened toward your arrogance, Rogan, but that\u2019s changing by the second. Understand me.\u201d She yanked her hand free of his. \u201cI\u2019ll be no man\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo man\u2019s but mine.\u201d</p><p>She hissed out a curse. When he only grinned at that, she took a hard grip on her temper. A fight, she thought, might be satisfying, but it would solve nothing. \u201cYou brought me here for this, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d thought to take more time before tossing my feelings at your feet.\u201d Very carefully, very deliberately, he shifted his plate aside. \u201cKnowing very well you\u2019d kick them back at me.\u201d His eyes stayed on hers, level, patient. \u201cYou see I know you very well, Margaret Mary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d Temper, and the panic she didn\u2019t want to admit, leaked out of her, leaving room for sorrow. \u201cI\u2019ve reasons for keeping my heart whole, Rogan, and for not ever considering the possibility of marriage.\u201d</p><p>It interested and soothed him to understand that it wasn\u2019t marriage to him that seemed to appall her, but marriage itself. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze to her cup. After a moment\u2019s hesitation she added her usual three cubes of sugar and stirred. \u201cYou lost your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His brow furrowed. This certainly wasn\u2019t the tack he\u2019d expected her to take. \u201cAlmost ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard losing family. It strips away a whole layer of security, exposes you to the simple cold fact of mortality. You loved them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much. Maggie\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d like to hear what you have to say about this. It\u2019s important. They loved you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it?\u201d She drank now, holding the cup in two hands. \u201cWas it because they gave you a good life, a fine home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had nothing to do with material comfort. I knew they loved me because I felt it, because they showed it. And I could see they loved each other as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was love in your house. And laughter? Was there laughter, Rogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit of it.\u201d He could remember it still. \u201cI was devastated when they died. So sudden, so brutally sudden...\u201d His voice tapered off, then strengthened again. \u201cBut after, when the worst of it had passed, I was glad they\u2019d gone together. Each of them would have been only half-alive without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no notice how lucky you are, what a gift you were given growing up in a loving, happy home. I\u2019ve never known that. I never will. There was no love between my parents. There was anger and blame and guilt and there was duty, but no love. Can you imagine what it was like, growing up in a house where the two people who had made you cared nothing for each other? Were only there because their marriage was a prison barring them in with conscience and church law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d He covered her hand with his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI swore, when I was still a girl, I swore I\u2019d never be locked in a prison like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage isn\u2019t only a prison, Maggie,\u201d he said gently. \u201cMy own parents\u2019 was a joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you may make one for yourself one day. But not I. You make what you know, Rogan. And you can\u2019t change what you\u2019ve come from. My mother hates me.\u201d</p><p>He would have protested, but she\u2019d said it so matter-of-factly, so simply, he could not.</p><p>\u201cEven before I was born she hated me. The fact that I grew inside her ruined her life, which she tells me as often as possible. All these years I never knew how deep it truly went, until your grandmother told me my mother had had a career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA career?\u201d He cast his mind back. \u201cThe singing? What does that have to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. What choice did she have but to give up her career? What career would she have had left as a single, pregnant woman in a country like ours? None.\u201d Cold, she shivered and let out a shaky breath. It hurt to say it aloud this way, to say it all aloud. \u201cShe wanted something for herself. I understand that, Rogan. I know what it is to have ambitions. And I can imagine, all too well, what it would be like to have them dashed. You see, they never would have married if I hadn\u2019t been conceived. A moment of passion, of need, that was all. My father more than forty, and she past thirty. She dreaming, I suppose, of romance and he seeing a lovely woman. She was lovely then. There are pictures. She was lovely before the bitterness ate it all away. And I was the seed of it, the seven-month baby that humiliated her and ruined her dreams. And his, too. Aye and his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can hardly blame yourself for being born, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that. Don\u2019t you think I know? Up here?\u201d Suddenly fierce, she tapped her head. \u201cBut in my heart\u2014can\u2019t you see? I know that my very existence and every breath I take burdened the lives of two people beyond measure. I came from passion only, and every time she looked at me, it reminded her that she\u2019d sinned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not only ridiculous, it\u2019s foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is. My father said he\u2019d loved her once, and perhaps it was true.\u201d She could imagine him, walking into O\u2019Malley\u2019s, seeing Maeve, hearing her and letting his romantic heart take flight.</p><p>But it had crashed soon enough. For both of them.</p><p>\u201cI was twelve when she told me that I hadn\u2019t been conceived within marriage. That\u2019s how she puts it. Perhaps she\u2019d begun to see that I was making that slow shift from girl to woman. I\u2019d begun to look at boys, you see. Had practiced my flirting on Murphy and one or two others from the village. She caught me at it, standing by the hay barn with Murphy, trying out a kiss. Just a kiss, that was all, beside the hay on a warm summer afternoon, both of us young and curious. It was my first kiss, and it was lovely\u2014soft and shy and harmless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd she found us.\u201d When Maggie shut her eyes, the scene played back vividly. \u201cShe went white, bone white, and screamed and raged, dragged me into the house. I was wicked, she said, and sinful, and because my father wasn\u2019t home to stop her, she whipped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhipped you?\u201d Shock had him rising out of his chair. \u201cAre you telling me she hit you because you\u2019d kissed a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe beat me,\u201d Maggie said flatly. \u201cIt was more than the back of her hand that I\u2019d been used to. She took a belt and laid into me until I thought she\u2019d kill me. While she did she shouted scripture and raged about the branding of sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had no right to treat you so.\u201d He knelt in front of her, cupped her face in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no one has such a right, but it doesn\u2019t stop them. I could see the hate in her then, and the fear, too. The fear, I came to understand, was that I would end up as she had, with a baby in my belly and emptiness in my heart. I\u2019d known always that she didn\u2019t love me as mothers were meant to love their children. I\u2019d known that she was easier, a bit softer on Brie. But until that day, I hadn\u2019t known why.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t sit any longer. Rising, she went to the door that led out to a little stone patio decked with clay pots filled with brilliant geraniums.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to talk about this anymore,\u201d Rogan said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish.\u201d The sky was studded with stars, the breeze a gentle whisper through the trees. \u201cShe told me that I was marked. And she beat me so that the mark would be on the outside as well, so that I would understand what a burden a woman bears because it\u2019s she who carries the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s vile, Maggie.\u201d Unable to clamp down on his own emotions, he whirled her around, his hands hard on her shoulders, his eyes icy blue and furious. \u201cYou were just a girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I was, I stopped being one that day. Because I understood, Rogan, that she meant exactly what she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a lie, a pitiful one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to her. To her it was sterling truth. She told me I was her penance, that God had punished her for her night of sin, with me. She believed that, fully, and every time she looked at me she was reminded of it. That even the pain and misery of birthing me wasn\u2019t enough. Because of me she was trapped in a marriage she despised, bound to a man she couldn\u2019t love and mother to a child she\u2019d never wanted. And, as I\u2019ve found out just recently, the ruin of everything she really wanted. Perhaps the ruin of everything she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one who should have been whipped. No one has the right to abuse a child so, and worse to use some warped vision of God as the strap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, my father said nearly the same thing when he came home and saw what she\u2019d done. I thought he would strike her. It\u2019s the only time in my life I\u2019d ever seen him close to violence. They had a horrible fight. It was almost worse than the beating to listen to it. I went up to the bedroom to get away from the worst of it, and Brie came in with salve. She tended to me like a little mother, talking nonsense all the while the shouts and curses boomed up the stairs. Her hands were shaking.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t object when Rogan drew her into his arms, but her eyes remained dry, her voice calm. \u201cI thought he would go then. They said such vicious things to each other, I thought no two people could live under the same roof after. I thought if he\u2019d just take us with him, if Brie and I could just go with him, anywhere at all, it would be all right again. Then I heard him say that he was paying, too. That he was paying for ever having believed that he loved and wanted her. That he\u2019d go to his grave paying. Of course, he didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie pulled away again. Stepped back. \u201cHe stayed more than ten years longer, and she never touched me again. Not in any way. But neither of us forgot that day\u2014I think neither of us wanted to. He tried to make up for it by giving me more, loving me more. But he couldn\u2019t. If he\u2019d left her, if he taken us and left her, it would have changed things. But that he couldn\u2019t do, so we lived in that house, like sinners in hell. And I knew no matter how he loved me that there were times he must have thought if it hadn\u2019t been\u2014if I hadn\u2019t been, he\u2019d have been free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly blame the child, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sins of the fathers...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cOne of my mother\u2019s favorite expressions that. No, Rogan, I don\u2019t blame the child. But it doesn\u2019t change the results.\u201d She took a deep breath. She was better for having said it all. \u201cI\u2019ll never risk locking myself in that prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too smart a woman to believe what happened to your parents happens to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to everyone, no. One day, now that she\u2019s not hobbled by my mother\u2019s demands, Brie will marry. She\u2019s a woman who wants family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said, but the words sounded hollow. \u201cI\u2019ve my work, and a need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>He caught her chin in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I am, I\u2019ve a right to be.\u201d She shook free of him. \u201cWhat kind of wife or mother would I make with what I\u2019ve come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019ve just said your sister will be both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt affected her differently than it did me. She has as much need for people and for a home as I have to do without them. You were right enough when you said I was stubborn and rude and self-absorbed. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve had to be. But that\u2019s not all you are, Maggie. You\u2019re compassionate and loyal and loving. It\u2019s not just part of you I fell in love with, but the whole. I want to spend my life with you.\u201d</p><p>Something trembled inside her, fragile as crystal struck by a careless hand. \u201cHaven\u2019t you listened to a word I\u2019ve said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word. Now I know that you don\u2019t just love me. You need me.\u201d</p><p>She dragged both hands through her hair, fingers digging in and pulling in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. You\u2019re afraid to admit it, but that\u2019s understandable.\u201d He was sorry, bitterly, for the child she\u2019d been. But he couldn\u2019t allow that to change his plans for the woman. \u201cYou\u2019ve locked yourself in a prison, Maggie. Once you admit those needs, the door will open.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with the way things are. Why do you have to change them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want more than a few days a month with you. I want a life with you, children with you.\u201d He skimmed a hand over her hair to cup the back of her neck. \u201cBecause you\u2019re the first and only woman I\u2019ve ever loved. I won\u2019t lose you, Maggie. And I won\u2019t let you lose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given you all I can give, Rogan.\u201d Her voice was shaky, but she held her ground. \u201cIt\u2019s more than I\u2019ve given anyone else. Be content with what I\u2019m able to give, for if you can\u2019t, I\u2019ll have to end it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>His hand squeezed once at the base of her neck, then released and fell away. \u201cStubborn,\u201d he said with a trace of amusement to hide the ache. \u201cWell, so am I. I can wait for you to come to me. No, don\u2019t tell me you won\u2019t,\u201d he went on as she opened her mouth to protest. \u201cIt will only make it more difficult on you when you do. We\u2019ll leave things as they are, Maggie. With one alteration.\u201d</p><p>The relief she\u2019d felt shifted into wariness. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He pulled her into his arms, covered her mouth with his. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get used to hearing it.\u201d</p><p>She was glad to be home. At home she could savor the solitude, enjoy her own company and the long, long days where the light clung to the sky until ten. At home, she didn\u2019t have to think of anything but work. To prove it, she gave herself three days in her glass house, three days without interruption.</p> <p>She was productive, pleased with the results she saw cooling in the annealing oven. And she was, for the first time in her memory, lonely.</p><p>That was on his head, she thought as she watched the twilight grow and deepen and slip beautifully toward night. He\u2019d tricked her into enjoying his company, into enjoying the whirl of cities and people. He\u2019d made her want too much.</p><p>She wanted him too much.</p><p>Marriage. The thought made her shudder as she gathered what she wanted from the kitchen table. That, at least, he could never make her want. She was certain, given a little time, he would see it her way. If not...</p><p>She stepped outside, shut the door. It was best not to think about any if-nots. Rogan was, above all, a sensible man.</p><p>She took the walk to Brianna\u2019s slowly as night settled around her. A slow mist gathered at her feet, and a breeze holding a warning chill whispered through the trees.</p> <p>Like a welcoming beacon, the light in Brianna\u2019s kitchen glowed against the night. Maggie shifted the sketches she\u2019d framed and quickened her steps.</p><p>As she approached, a low growl sounded out of the shadows of the sycamore. Maggie called out softly and was answered by a happy bark. Con leaped out of the shadows, through the mist, and would have jumped on her to show his love and devotion had she not held out a hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not be knocked over, thank you.\u201d She rubbed his head, his neck, while his swinging tail tore the thin fog like rags. \u201cGuarding your princess tonight, are you? Well, let\u2019s go in and find her.\u201d</p><p>The moment Maggie opened the kitchen door, Con shot through in a blur of fur and muscle. He paused across the room at the door that led into the hallway, tail thumping.</p><p>\u201cOut there, is she?\u201d Maggie set the sketches aside and walked to the door. She heard voices through it, a soft laugh, a British accent. \u201cShe has guests,\u201d she said to Con, and disappointed the dog thoroughly when she backed away from the door. \u201cWe won\u2019t disturb her, so you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d To make the prospect a bit more hopeful, she went to the cupboard where Brianna kept Con\u2019s biscuits. \u201cWell, what trick will you do for me, boy-o?\u201d</p><p>Con eyed the biscuit she was holding, smacked his lip. With restrained dignity he padded to Maggie, sat and lifted a paw.</p><p>\u201cWell done, lad.\u201d</p><p>Once he had the treat between his teeth, Con pranced to the rug in front of the kitchen hearth, circled three times, then settled down with a sigh to enjoy himself.</p> <p>\u201cI could do with something myself.\u201d</p><p>A quick snoop around the kitchen revealed a treasure. A square of gingerbread, half-gone, rested under a protecting cloth. Maggie ate one slice while the kettle was heating, and sat down to another with a homey pot of tea.</p><p>When Brianna came in, Maggie was scraping crumbs from the plate.</p><p>\u201cI wondered when you\u2019d come by.\u201d Brianna reached down to pet the dog, who\u2019d risen to press himself against her legs.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been sooner, if I\u2019d known this was waiting. You\u2019ve guests, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a couple from London, a student from Derry and two sweet ladies down from Edinburgh. How did you enjoy your holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful place, hot, sunny days, warm nights. I drew you some pictures so you\u2019d see for yourself.\u201d She gestured to them.</p><p>Brie lifted the pictures and her face lit up with joy. \u201cOh, they\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like them more than a postcard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Thank you, Maggie. I\u2019ve some clippings about your show in Paris.\u201d</p><p>Maggie was surprised. \u201cOh, how did you get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Rogan to send them to me. Would you like to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, no. They\u2019ll just give me a nervous stomach, and my work\u2019s going too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be going to Rome when the show moves on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought about it. All that part of it seems a long way from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a dream.\u201d Brianna sighed as she sat down. \u201cI can hardly believe I was in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could travel more now, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Perhaps there were places she\u2019d like to see, but home held her. \u201cAlice Quinn had a boy. David they\u2019re calling him. He was christened just yesterday. He wailed all through the service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Alice probably fluttered around like a bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she held little David and soothed him, then took him off to nurse. Marriage and motherhood have changed her. You wouldn\u2019t think it was the same Alice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage always changes people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften for the better.\u201d But Brianna knew what Maggie was thinking. \u201cMother\u2019s getting along well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brianna said evenly. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you. Lottie\u2019s badgered her into sitting out in the garden every day, and into taking walks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking?\u201d Despite herself, Maggie\u2019s interest was snagged. \u201cMother, walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how she does it, but Lottie has a way with her. The last time I visited Mother was holding yarn while Lottie balled it. When I came in, she tossed it down and began to rant about how the woman would drive her into the grave. Claimed she fired Lottie twice, but Lottie wouldn\u2019t go. All the while Mother complained, Lottie rocked in her chair, smiling and rolling her yarn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the woman drives Lottie away\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, let me finish.\u201d Brianna leaned forward, her eyes dancing. \u201cI stood there, making excuses and apologies and waiting for the worst. And after a while Lottie stopped rocking. \u2018Maeve,\u2019 she said, \u2018stop pestering the girl. You sound like a magpie.\u2019 And she handed the yarn back to her and told me how she was after teaching Mothing to knit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching her to\u2014oh, that\u2019ll be the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing was, Mother kept muttering under her breath and arguing with Lottie. But she seemed to be enjoying it. You were right about her having her own place, Maggie. She may not realize it yet, but she\u2019s happier there than she\u2019s been most of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is she\u2019s out of here.\u201d Restless, Maggie rose to prowl around the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t want you deluding yourself into thinking I did it out of the goodness of my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d Brianna said quietly. \u201cIf you want no one but me to know it, that\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to talk about her, but to see how you were getting on. Have you moved into the room off the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It gives me another room upstairs free for guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gives you some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that. I\u2019ve a place for a desk in there so I can do the books and the paperwork. I like having a window right over the garden. Murphy said I could have a door put in, if I want, so I could come in and out without going through the rest of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Maggie lifted a jar of currants, set it down again. \u201cHave you enough for the labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve enough. It\u2019s been a good summer. Maggie, won\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing is,\u201d Maggie answered abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ve a lot on my mind, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you quarreled with Rogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be called a quarrel, she thought. \u201cWhy should you assume I\u2019d be thinking of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I saw you together, saw how much you care for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be enough, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Maggie demanded. \u201cI care for him and he for me. The business we have together is successful and will likely continue to be. That should be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that. Are you in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cHe thinks I am, but I can\u2019t be responsible for what the man thinks. Nor will I change my life for him, or anyone. He\u2019s already made it change.\u201d She hugged her arms close, feeling suddenly cold. \u201cAnd, damn him, I can\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo being what I was, what I thought I was. He\u2019s made me want more. I know I always did, but he\u2019s made me admit it. It\u2019s not enough for me to believe in my work, I need him to. He\u2019s made himself a part of it, and if I fail, I don\u2019t fail alone. When I succeed, the satisfaction isn\u2019t mine alone either. And I think I\u2019ve compromised myself because I\u2019ve given part of me, the best of me, into his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it your art you\u2019re talking about, Maggie, or is it your heart?\u201d Brianna stared hard at her sister as she asked the question.</p><p>Maggie sat again, defeated. \u201cI don\u2019t have one without the other. So it seems I\u2019ve given him a piece of both.\u201d</p><p>Rogan would have been surprised to hear it. He\u2019d decided, after a great deal of thought, to treat his relationship with Maggie as he would any business merger with a reluctant company. He\u2019d made his offer. Now it was time to stand back, to distance himself while the other party considered.</p><p>There was no professional reason to contact her. The show in Paris would remain for another two weeks before moving to Rome. The pieces had been chosen, the groundwork laid.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, she had her work and he had his. Any business contact could be made through his staff.</p><p>He would, in other words, let her stew.</p><p>It was important to his pride and his plans not to let her know how much her rejection of his feelings had hurt. Apart, they could each evaluate their future objectively. Together, they would simply end up in bed. That was no longer enough.</p><p>Patience and a firm hand was what was required. Rogan was sure of it. And if Maggie remained so foolishly obstinate after a reasonable amount of time, he\u2019d use whatever means were at his disposal.</p><p>Rogan knocked briskly on his grandmother\u2019s door. It wasn\u2019t their usual time for visiting, but after being back in Dublin for a week, he needed the comfort of family.</p><p>He nodded at the maid who opened the door. \u201cIs my grandmother at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Sweeney. She\u2019s in the front parlor. I\u2019ll tell her you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d He strode down the hall and through the open parlor doors. Christine rose immediately and opened her arms to him.</p><p>\u201cRogan! What a lovely surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a meeting canceled, so I thought I\u2019d drop in and see how you were.\u201d He drew her back, lifting a brow as he studied her face. \u201cYou look exceptionally well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel exceptionally well.\u201d She laughed and led him to a chair. \u201cShall I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have very long, and I only came for the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard how well it went in Paris.\u201d Christine sat beside him, soothed down the skirt of her linen dress. \u201cI had lunch with Patricia last week, and she told me it was a rousing success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Though I can\u2019t say how Patricia would know.\u201d He thought of his friend with a lingering trickle of guilt. \u201cShe\u2019s well?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, very. Blooming, you could say. And I believe she said Joseph had told her about the Paris business. She\u2019s working very hard on her day school, and Joseph is giving her a bit of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I haven\u2019t had much time at the gallery this past week, I\u2019m afraid. The fact is the expansion in Limerick is taking most of my efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough. I\u2019ve had some complications, so I\u2019ll have to take a trip down to sort them out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve hardly gotten back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take more than a day or two.\u201d He cocked his head, watching his grandmother tug at her skirt, brush at her hair. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled brightly and forced her hands to still. \u201cNot at all, though there is something I want to discuss with you. You see...\u201d She trailed off, calling herself a miserable coward. \u201cHow is Maggie? Did she enjoy France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful time of year to holiday at the villa. Was the weather good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was. Is it weather you want to discuss, Grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just\u2014are you sure you don\u2019t want that drink?\u201d</p><p>A trickle of alarm skidded down his back. \u201cIf something\u2019s wrong, I want you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong, darling. Nothing at all wrong.\u201d</p><p>To his amazement she blushed like a schoolgirl. \u201cGrandmother\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was interrupted by a clatter on the stairs and a shout. \u201cChrissy? Where have you gone off to, girl?\u201d</p> <p>Rogan stood slowly as a man popped into the doorway. He was burly of chest, bald as an egg and dressed in an ill-fitting suit the color of marigolds. His face was round and wrinkled. It beamed like a moon.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, my darling girl. I thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to ring for tea.\u201d Christine\u2019s blush deepened as the man strode into the room and kissed both her fluttering hands.</p><p>\u201cRogan, this is Niall Feeney. Niall, my grandson, Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this be himself.\u201d Rogan found his hand enveloped and pumped heartily. \u201cWell, it\u2019s delighted I am to be meeting you at long last. Chrissy\u2019s told me all about you, lad. Why, you\u2019re the very apple of her eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014pleased to meet you, Mr. Feeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, now, none of that formality between us. Not with all our family connections.\u201d He winked and laughed until his belly jiggled.</p><p>\u201cConnections?\u201d Rogan said weakly.</p> <p>\u201cAye, with me growing up no farther than a toad could spit from Chrissy here. Fifty years pass, begad, and now fate has it that you\u2019re handling all that pretty glass my niece makes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour niece?\u201d Realization struck like a fist. \u201cYou\u2019re Maggie\u2019s uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am indeed.\u201d Niall sat, very much at home, his substantial belly sagging over his belt. \u201cProud as a peacock of the girl, I\u2019ll say, though I don\u2019t understand a bloody thing about what she\u2019s doing. I have to take Chrissy\u2019s word that it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy,\u201d Rogan repeated in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely, Rogan?\u201d Christine\u2019s nervous smile hurt her face. \u201cIt seems Brianna wrote to Niall in Galway to tell him Maggie and you were working together. Of course, she mentioned that you were my grandson. Niall wrote me back, and one thing led to another. He\u2019s come to visit awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisit. In Dublin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine city it is, to be sure.\u201d Niall smacked a hand on the delicate arm of the sofa. \u201cWith the prettiest girls in all of Ireland.\u201d He winked at Christine. \u201cThough, in truth, I\u2019ve only eyes for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on with you, Niall.\u201d</p><p>Rogan stared at the pair of them, all but billing and cooing before his eyes. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll have that drink after all,\u201d he said. \u201cA whiskey.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>IT was a very subdued Rogan who left his grandmother\u2019s parlor and swung by the gallery just past closing. He didn\u2019t want to believe he\u2019d seen what he knew he\u2019d seen. Just as Maggie had once said, when a couple is intimate, they throw off signals.</p><p>His grandmother, for God\u2019s sake, was flirting with Maggie\u2019s moon-faced uncle from Galway.</p><p>No, he decided as he let himself into the gallery, it didn\u2019t bear thinking of. Signals there might have been, but undoubtedly he\u2019d read them incorrectly. His grandmother was, after all, over seventy, a woman of faultless taste, unblemished character, impeccable style.</p><p>And Niall Feeney was...was simply indescribable, Rogan decided.</p><p>What he needed was a couple of hours of perfect peace and quiet in his gallery office\u2014away from people and phones and anything remotely personal.</p><p>He shook his head as he crossed the room. He was sounding entirely too much like Maggie.</p><p>The raised voices stopped him before his hand met the knob. An argument was in full swing on the other side of the door. While manners might have urged him to retreat, curiosity turned the tide.</p><p>He opened the door on Joseph and Patricia in full steam.</p><p>\u201cI tell you, you\u2019re not using the head God gave you,\u201d Joseph shouted. \u201cI won\u2019t be the cause of an estrangement between you and your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a bloody pin for what my mother thinks,\u201d Patricia shouted right back, causing Rogan\u2019s mouth to fall open. \u201cThis has nothing to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you could say so proves my point. You\u2019re not using your head. She\u2019s\u2014Rogan.\u201d Joseph\u2019s furious face went still as a stone. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Rogan looked cautiously from Joseph to Patricia. \u201cI seem to have interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you can talk your way through that pride of his.\u201d Eyes glinting with emotion, Patricia tossed back her hair. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Rogan.\u201d Joseph\u2019s voice was quiet, with the steel of warning beneath.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, we mustn\u2019t let anyone know.\u201d The first tear spilled over. Patricia dashed it away. \u201cWe should keep sneaking around like\u2014like adulterers. Well, I won\u2019t do it any longer, Joseph. I\u2019m in love with you and I don\u2019t care who knows.\u201d She whirled on Rogan. \u201cWell? What do you have to say about it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held up a hand as if to regain his balance. \u201cI think I should leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d She fumbled for her purse. \u201cHe won\u2019t listen to me. It was my mistake to believe he would. That he was the only one who really would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatricia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Patricia me in that tone,\u201d she snapped at Joseph. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been told what to do and how to do it. What\u2019s proper, what\u2019s acceptable, and I\u2019m sick to death of it. I tolerated the criticism over opening my school, and the damnable unspoken belief of my friends and family that I\u2019d fail. Well, I won\u2019t fail.\u201d She whirled on Rogan again as if he\u2019d spoken. \u201cDo you hear, I won\u2019t fail. I\u2019ll do exactly what I wish, and I\u2019ll do it well. What I won\u2019t tolerate is criticism of my choice of lovers. Not from you, not from my mother, and most certainly not from the lover I\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p> <p>Chin up, she looked back at Joseph with tear-drenched eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me, then be honest and say so. But don\u2019t you dare tell me what\u2019s best for me.\u201d</p><p>Joseph stepped toward her, but she was already darting out the door. \u201cPatty! Damn it.\u201d Better to let her go, Joseph told himself. Better for her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rogan,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI would have found a way to have avoided that scene if I\u2019d known you were coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you didn\u2019t, perhaps you might explain it.\u201d Equally stiff, Rogan rounded his desk and sat, assuming the position of authority. \u201cIn fact, I insist.\u201d</p><p>Joseph didn\u2019t bat an eye at Rogan\u2019s seamless switch from friend to employer. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious I\u2019ve been seeing Patricia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the term she used was sneaking about.\u201d</p> <p>The color washed back into Joseph\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2014I thought it best if we were discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d A fire kindled in Rogan\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd treating a woman like Patricia like one of your casual affairs was your idea of discretion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was prepared for your disapproval, Rogan.\u201d Beneath his tailored jacket, Joseph\u2019s shoulders were rigid as steel. \u201cI expected it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd well you should have,\u201d Rogan said evenly.</p><p>\u201cSo I did, just as I expected the reaction I got from her mother when Patricia talked me into dining with them last evening.\u201d His hands tightened into fists. \u201cA gallery manager without a drop of blue in his blood. She might as well have said it, for it was in her eyes. Her daughter could do better. And by Christ she can. But I won\u2019t stand here and have you say that what\u2019s between us is a casual affair.\u201d His voice had risen to a shout by the time he was finished.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with her. I\u2019ve been in love with her since the first time I saw her, nearly ten years ago. But then there was Robert...and there was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never me.\u201d Baffled, Rogan rubbed his hands over his face. Was the world going mad? he wondered. His grandmother and Maggie\u2019s uncle, himself and Maggie and now Joseph and Patricia. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe week before you left for Paris.\u201d Joseph remembered those giddy hours, those wonderful days and nights before reality had set in. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan it, but that hardly changes anything. I realize you may want to make other arrangements now.\u201d</p><p>Rogan dropped his hands. \u201cWhat other arrangements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor managing the gallery.\u201d</p><p>What he needed, Rogan thought, was to go home and find a bottle of aspirin. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, and I hope you\u2019ll remain so. Your private life has nothing to do with your work here. Good Christ, do I look like some kind of monster who would fire you for claiming to be in love with a friend of mine?\u201d He indulged his now throbbing head a moment by pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes. \u201cI walk in here\u2014into my own office, I\u2019ll remind you\u2014and find the two of you snapping like terriers. Before I can take the next breath, Patricia\u2019s clawing at me for not believing her capable of running a school.\u201d He shook his head and dropped his hands. \u201cI never thought she was incapable of anything. She\u2019s one of the most intelligent women I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just got caught in the backlash,\u201d Joseph murmured, and gave in to the desperate need for a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems. You\u2019ve a right to tell me it\u2019s none of my business, but as someone who\u2019s known you for ten years, and Patricia longer than that, I do take an interest. What the devil were you fighting about?\u201d</p><p>Joseph huffed out smoke. \u201cShe wants to elope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElope?\u201d If Joseph had told him Patricia wanted to dance naked in St. Stephen\u2019s Square, he\u2019d have been no more staggered. \u201cPatricia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cooked up some mad scheme about us driving up to Scotland. It seems she had a row with her mother and came storming straight over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never known Patricia to storm anywhere. Her mother\u2019s not in favor of the relationship, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but.\u201d He offered a weak smile. \u201cThe truth is, she thinks Patricia should hang out for you.\u201d</p><p>Rogan was hardly surprised at this news. \u201cShe\u2019s doomed to disappointment there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve other plans. If it helps matters, I\u2019ll make them clear to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know as it could hurt.\u201d Joseph hesitated, then sat as he was used to, on the corner of Rogan\u2019s desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, then? It doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it? And as far as Anne\u2019s concerned, Dennis will bring her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Patricia said.\u201d Joseph studied the cigarette smoldering between his fingers, then pulled out his little flip-top ashtray and crushed it out. \u201cShe seemed to think if we just ran off and got married, her mother would soon fall in with the idea as if it had been hers all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d lay odds on it. She wasn\u2019t keen on Robbie at first either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t she?\u201d Joseph had the look of a man who was beginning to see the light.</p><p>\u201cNot at all sure he was good enough for her darling daughter.\u201d Speculating, Rogan rocked back in his chair. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for her to begin to dote on him. Of course, he didn\u2019t wear an earring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joseph\u2019s grin flashed as he lifted a hand to his ear. \u201cPatty likes it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d was all Rogan could think of to say. \u201cAnne might be a bit difficult.\u201d He ignored Joseph\u2019s rude snort. \u201cBut in the end, all she wants is her daughter\u2019s happiness. If you\u2019re the answer to that, Anne will want you as well. You know, we could manage well enough around here if you took a sudden trip to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour business, of course. But...\u201d Rogan stretched back in his chair again. \u201cIt seems to me a woman might find a wild ride over the border, a ceremony in some musty chapel and a honeymoon in the Highlands very romantic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to regret it.\u201d Joseph was beginning to sound less certain.</p><p>\u201cThe woman who walked out of here just now looked to me to know her own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, and she\u2019s come to know mine all too quickly.\u201d He pushed away from the desk. \u201cI\u2019d better go find her.\u201d He stopped at the door, tossed a grin over his shoulder. \u201cRogan, can you spare me for a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake two. And kiss the bride for me.\u201d</p><p>The wire that came three days later, telling Rogan that Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Donahoe were well and happy proved to him that he wasn\u2019t a hard-hearted man. In fact, he liked to believe he\u2019d done his part to speed the two lovers on their way.</p> <p>But there were two other lovers he\u2019d have given much to see go their separate paths. In fact, he fantasized daily about booting Niall Feeney all the way back to Galway. At first Rogan tried to ignore the situation. When more than a week had passed and Niall was still cozily ensconced in Christine Sweeney\u2019s home, he tried patience. After all, he told himself, how long would a woman of his grandmother\u2019s taste and sensibilities be duped by a charmless, borish west-county sharpie?</p><p>After two weeks, he decided it was time to try reason.</p><p>Rogan waited in the parlor\u2014the parlor, he reminded himself that reflected the style and breeding of a lovely, sensible and generous woman.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Rogan.\u201d Christine glided into the room looking, her grandson thought, entirely too attractive for a woman of her age. \u201cWhat a lovely surprise. I thought you were on your way to Limerick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve just stopped in on the way to the airport.\u201d He kissed her, glanced over her shoulder to the doorway. \u201cSo...you\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Niall\u2019s out running some errands. Do you have time for a bite to eat before you go? Cook\u2019s baked some lovely tarts. Niall\u2019s charmed her so, that she\u2019s been baking treats daily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharmed her?\u201d As his grandmother sat Rogan rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He\u2019s always popping into the kitchen to tell her what a way she has with soup, or the duck or some dish or other. She can\u2019t do enough for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly looks like a man who eats well.\u201d</p><p>Christine\u2019s smile was indulgent. \u201cOh, he loves his food, Niall does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it goes down easy, when it\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>The comment had Christine raising a brow. \u201cWould you have me bill a friend for a meal, Rogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. He\u2019s been in town some time now,\u201d he said, changing tacks. \u201cI\u2019m sure he must miss his home, and his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s retired. As Niall says, a man can\u2019t work all his life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s worked at all,\u201d Rogan said under his breath. \u201cGrandmother, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been nice for you to visit with a friend from your childhood, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has. It\u2019s been truly wonderful. Why, I feel young again.\u201d She laughed. \u201cLike a girl. Just last night we went dancing. I\u2019d forgotten what a fine dancer Niall is. And when we go to Galway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Rogan felt himself pale. \u201cWe go to Galway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, next week we\u2019re planning to take a long drive back to the west. A bit of nostalgia for me. Of course, I\u2019m interested in seeing Niall\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. It\u2019s absurd. You can\u2019t go traisping off to Galway with the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s\u2014you\u2019re my grandmother, for God\u2019s sake. I won\u2019t have you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t have me what?\u201d she asked very quietly.</p><p>The tone, reflecting the sort of anger she rarely directed at him, had Rogan reining in. \u201cGrandmother, I realize you\u2019ve let yourself be swept away by the man, by the memories. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no harm in it. But the idea of you going off with a man you haven\u2019t seen for more than fifty years is ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>How young he was, Christine thought. And how distressingly proper. \u201cI believe, at my age, I\u2019d enjoy doing something ludicrous. However, I don\u2019t believe taking a trip back to my childhood home with a man I\u2019m very fond of, a man I knew long before you were born, fits into that category. Now, perhaps,\u201d she said, holding up a hand before he could speak, \u201cyou find that the idea of my having a relationship, an adult, satisfying relationship with Niall, does fit that category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me\u2014you\u2019re not saying\u2014you haven\u2019t actually...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlept with him?\u201d Christine leaned back, tapping her well-manicured nails on the arm of the love seat. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly my business, isn\u2019t it? And I don\u2019t require your approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He heard himself beginning to babble. \u201cI\u2019m just concerned, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern is noted.\u201d She rose, regally. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re shocked by my behavior, but it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shocked\u2014damn, of course I\u2019m shocked. You can\u2019t just...\u201d He could hardly say the words, could he? In his grandmother\u2019s parlor. \u201cDarling, I know nothing about the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about him. I haven\u2019t any definite plans on how long we\u2019ll be in Galway, but we will be stopping in to see Maggie and her family on the way. Shall I give her your regards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have thought this through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my own mind and heart better, it seems, than you think. Have a safe trip, Rogan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dismissed, he had no choice but to kiss her cheek and leave. The moment he was in the car, he yanked at the phone. \u201cEileen, reschedule Limerick for tomorrow.... Yes, there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI have to go to Clare.\u201d</p><p>When the first touch of fall caressed the air and gilded the trees, it seemed a sin not to enjoy it. After two solid weeks of work, Maggie decided she deserved a day off. She spent the morning in the garden, weeding with a vigor that would have made Brianna proud. To reward herself, she decided to bike to the village for a late lunch at O\u2019Malley\u2019s.</p><p>There was a bite to the air, and the layered clouds to the west promised rain before nightfall. She pulled on her cap, pumped up her rear tire, which was going flat, then guided the bike around the house and through the gate.</p><p>She set off at a leisurely pace, dreaming a bit over the harvesting in the fields. The fuchsia continued to bloom in teardrops of red despite the threat of early frost. The landscape would change as soon as winter set it, become barren and swept by a bitter wind. But it would still be beautiful. The nights would lengthen, urging people to their fires. The rains would come, sweeping across the Atlantic with the wail of the wind.</p> <p>She looked forward to it, and to the work she would do in the chilly months ahead.</p><p>She wondered if she could convince Rogan to come west during the winter, and if she did, would he find charm in the rattling windows and smoky fires. She hoped that he would. And when he stopped punishing her, she hoped that they could go back to the way things had been before that last night in France.</p><p>He\u2019d see reason, she told herself, and leaned low over the bike against the wind. She\u2019d make him see it. She\u2019d even forgive him for being high-handed, overconfident and dictatorial. The moment they were together again, she would be calm and cool and sweet-tongued. They\u2019d put this foolish disagreement behind them, and\u2014</p><p>She had time to squeal, barely, and to swerve into the hedgerows as a car barreled around the curve. Brakes screamed, the car veered, and Maggie ended up bottom first in the blackthorn.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary and Joseph, what kind of a blind, ignorant fool is it who tries to run down innocent people?\u201d She shoved the cap back that had fallen over her eyes and glared. \u201cOh, of course. It would be you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Rogan was out of the car and beside her in an instant. \u201cDon\u2019t try to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can move, curse you.\u201d She batted his exploring hands away. \u201cWhat do you mean driving at that horrible speed? This isn\u2019t a raceway.\u201d</p><p>The heart that had lodged hard in his throat freed itself. \u201cI wasn\u2019t driving that fast. You were in the middle of the road, daydreaming. If I\u2019d come around that turn a second sooner, I\u2019d have flattened you like a rabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t daydreaming. Minding my own business was what I was doing, not expecting some jackeen to come speeding along in a fancy car.\u201d She brushed off the seat of her pants, then kicked her bike. \u201cNow see what you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve a puncture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky it\u2019s the tire that\u2019s flat and not yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m putting this excuse for transportation in the car.\u201d Once he\u2019d done so, he turned back to her. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll drive you back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going home. If you had any sense of direction, you\u2019d see I was going to the village, where I was going to have a meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d He took her arm in the proprietary manner she forgot she\u2019d found amusing.</p><p>\u201cOh, will it? Well, you can drive me to the village or nowhere at all, because I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you home,\u201d he said again. \u201cI have something to discuss with you, privately. If I\u2019d been able to get through to you this morning, I could have told you I was coming and you wouldn\u2019t have been riding that bike in the middle of the road.\u201d</p><p>With this, he slammed the car door behind her and skirted the hood.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d been able to get through this morning, and had had this nasty way about you, I\u2019d have told you not to bother to come at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a difficult morning, Maggie.\u201d He resisted the urge to rub at the headache drumming behind his temples. \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p> <p>She began to, then saw that he\u2019d said no more than the truth. There was trouble in his eyes. \u201cIs it a problem at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, I do have some complications with a project in Limerick. I\u2019m on my way there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019m not staying. But it isn\u2019t the factory expansion I need to speak with you about.\u201d He stopped at her gate, shut off the car. \u201cIf you\u2019ve nothing to eat, I\u2019ll run into the village and bring something back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I can make do.\u201d She relented enough to close a hand over his. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you, even though you nearly ran me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d He lifted the hand to his lips. \u201cEven though you nearly ran into me. I\u2019ll get your bike out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave it in front.\u201d After striding up the walk, she turned. \u201cHave you a proper kiss for me?\u201d</p><p>It was hard to resist that quick flash of smile, or the way she reached up to link her hands behind his head. \u201cI\u2019ve a kiss for you, proper or not.\u201d</p><p>It was easy to meet the heat, to draw the energy in. What was difficult was to check the need, that instant desire to back her through the door and take it all.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was daydreaming a bit before,\u201d she said, tugging on his lips. \u201cI was thinking of you, and wondering how much longer you\u2019d punish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy staying away from me.\u201d She spoke airily as she pushed through the door.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t punishing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust staying away, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistancing myself, to give you time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd time to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo miss me. And to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have missed you, but I haven\u2019t changed my mind or anything else. Why don\u2019t you sit? I need to get some more turf for the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Maggie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That stopped her, had her closing her eyes a moment before she turned back. \u201cI believe you might, Rogan, and though something in me warms to it, it changes nothing.\u201d She hurried out.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t come to beg, he reminded himself. He\u2019d come to ask her to help him with a problem. Though from her reaction, he believed things were changing more than she was ready to admit.</p><p>He paced to the window, to the sagging sofa, back again.</p><p>\u201cWill you sit?\u201d she demanded when she came back with her arms piled with turf blocks. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear out the floor. What\u2019s this business in Limerick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few complications, that\u2019s all.\u201d He watched as she knelt at the hearth and expertly stacked fuel. It occurred to him that he\u2019d never seen anyone build a turf fire before. A restful sight, he mused, that drew a man close to seek that warm red heart. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding the factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and what do you make at your factory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChina. For the most part the inexpensive sort that\u2019s fashioned into mementos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMementos?\u201d She paused at her work, leaned back on her haunches. \u201cSouvenirs, you mean? Not those little bells and teacups and such in the tourist shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very well done.\u201d</p> <p>She tossed back her head and laughed. \u201cOh, it\u2019s rich. I\u2019ve hired myself a man who makes little plates with shamrocks all over them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any idea what percent of our economy depends on tourism, on the sale of little plates with shamrocks on them, or hand-knit sweaters, linen, lace, bloody postcards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snorted behind her hand. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you can tell me, down to the pence. Tell me, Rogan, do you do much business in plaster leprechauns, or plastic shillelaghs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to justify my business to you, or to discuss the fact that this expansion\u2014which will allow us to manufacture some of the finest china produced in Ireland\u2014will create more than a hundred new jobs in a part of the country that desperately needs them.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand to stop him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve insulted you. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a rising need for thimbles and ashtrays and cups that say \u2018Erin Go Bragh.\u2019 It\u2019s just hard for me, you see, to picture a man who wears such wonderful suits owning a place that makes them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that I do makes it possible for Worldwide to subsidize and offer grants to a number of artists each year. Even if they are snobs.\u201d</p> <p>She rubbed the back of her hand over her nose. \u201cThat puts me in my place. And since I don\u2019t want to waste what time we have arguing, we\u2019ll say no more about it. Are you going to sit, or just stand there and glower at me? Not that you don\u2019t look fine, even with a scowl on your face.\u201d</p><p>He surrendered on a long breath. \u201cYour work\u2019s going well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She shifted, crossing her legs on the rug. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what\u2019s new before you go, if there\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a little behind at the gallery. I suppose I should tell you that Joseph and Patricia have eloped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019ve had a card from them.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem at all surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. They were crazy in love with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall you claiming Patricia was crazy in love with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. I said she was half in love with you, and I\u2019ll stand by that. I imagine she wanted to be in love with you\u2014it would have been so convenient after all. But it was Joseph all along. That\u2019s not what\u2019s troubling you, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I admit it took me by surprise, but it doesn\u2019t trouble me. I\u2019ve come to realize I took Joseph\u2019s skills for granted. He\u2019ll be back tomorrow, and I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had a letter from your uncle Niall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna has. She\u2019s the one who gets them, as she\u2019s the one who\u2019ll remember to answer back. He wrote to tell her he\u2019d be visiting Dublin and might pass through on his way back home. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen him?\u201d On a sound of disgust, Rogan pushed out of the chair again. \u201cI can\u2019t get near my grandmother without stepping all over him. He\u2019s settled himself in her house for two weeks past. We\u2019ve got to decide what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should we do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me, Maggie? They\u2019ve been living together. My grandmother and your uncle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat-uncle, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the devil he is to you, they\u2019ve been having a flaming affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they?\u201d Maggie let out a roar of approving laughter. \u201cWell, that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful? It\u2019s insane. She\u2019s been acting like some giddy girl, going dancing, staying out half the night, sharing her bed with a man whose suits are the color of fried eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you object to his taste in clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI object to him. I\u2019ll not have him waltzing into my grandmother\u2019s house and planting himself in the parlor as if he belongs there. I don\u2019t know what his game is, but I won\u2019t have him exploiting her generous heart, her vulnerability. If he thinks he\u2019ll get his hands on one penny of her money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that.\u201d She sprang up like a tiger. \u201c\u2019Tis my blood you\u2019re speaking of, Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is no time to be overly sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverly sensitive.\u201d She jabbed him in the chest. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking. You\u2019re jealous because your granny\u2019s got someone besides you in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true as the day. Do you think a man couldn\u2019t be interested in her, but for her money?\u201d</p><p>Familial pride stiffened his spine. \u201cMy grandmother is a beautiful, intelligent woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not disagree with that. And my Uncle Niall is no fortune hunter. He retired from his business most comfortably set. He may not have a villa in France or wear suits tailored by the bloody British, but he\u2019s done well enough and has no need to play gigolo. And I won\u2019t have you speak of me kin in such a way in me own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you. I\u2019ve come to you because, as their family, it\u2019s up to us to do something about the situation. Since they\u2019re planning a trip to Galway within the next few days, and passing by here on the way, I\u2019d hoped you might speak with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCertainly I\u2019ll speak with him.

Now, wouldn\u2019t it be a strange thing if they married? Then we\u2019d be in the way of cousins after all.\u201d Laughing, she slapped his back when he choked. \u201cCould you use a whiskey, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could. Maggie.\u201d He took several deep breaths. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he called again as she rummaged through in the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She came back, holding two glasses. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing that that kept me from bloodying your nose when you spoke so of Uncle Niall. Your gran\u2019s a fine woman, Rogan, and a wise one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d Finally, he said it aloud. \u201cShe\u2019s all I have left of my family.\u201d</p><p>Maggie\u2019s eyes gentled. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing her.\u201d</p><p>He let out a breath, stared into his glass. \u201cI suppose you think I\u2019m being a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2014exactly.\u201d She smiled when his eyes lifted to hers. \u201cA man can be expected to be a bit jittery when his granny takes on a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Rogan winced. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not let her be happy? If it eases your mind, I\u2019ll look the situation over when they stop here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something at least.\u201d He touched his glass to hers, and they tossed the whiskey back together. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hardly been here. Why don\u2019t you come to the pub with me and we\u2019ll have a meal together. Or\u201d\u2014she slipped her arms around him\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ll stay here and go hungry.\u201d</p><p>No, he thought as he lowered his mouth to hers. They wouldn\u2019t be hungry for long.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay.\u201d He set the empty glass aside to take her by her shoulders. \u201cIf I did we\u2019d only end up in bed. That wouldn\u2019t solve anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be anything to solve. Why must you make it complicated? We\u2019re good together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d He framed her face in his hands. \u201cVery good together. That\u2019s only one of the reasons I want to spend my life with you. No, don\u2019t draw away. Nothing you told me changes what we can have. Once you realize that, you\u2019ll come to me. I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just go, then stay away again? So, it\u2019s marriage or nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s marriage.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cAnd everything. I\u2019ll be in Limerick for almost a week. The office knows where to reach me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>He traced a thumb over her lips. \u201cBut you\u2019ll want to. That\u2019s enough for now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE being pigheaded, Maggie.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m tired of having that particular word applied to me.\u201d With goggles protecting her eyes, Maggie experimented with lamp work. For nearly a week everything she\u2019d free-blown had dissatisfied her. For a change of pace she had set up a half-dozen torches, three clamped to each side of a bench, and was heating a tube of glass in the cross fire.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s applied to you often enough, it may be true,\u201d Brianna shot back. \u201cIt\u2019s family. You can spare one evening for family.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a matter of time.\u201d She meant this, though for some reason, Maggie felt time was breathing down her neck like a snarling dog. \u201cWhy should I subject myself to having dinner with her?\u201d Carefully, brows knit, she began to pull and rotate the softened glass. \u201cI can tell you I have no appetite for it. Nor will she.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t just Mother who\u2019ll be coming. Uncle Niall and Mrs. Sweeney will be there. And Lottie, of course, It would be rude of you not to come.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m that, as well as pigheaded.\u201d As with everything else she\u2019d touched over the last few days, the glass refused to follow the vision in her head. The vision itself blurred, infuriating her as much as it frightened her. Pure obstinancy kept her working.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Uncle Niall since Da\u2019s wake. And he\u2019s bringing Rogan\u2019s grandmother, for heaven\u2019s sake. You told me you liked her very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Damn it, what was wrong with her hands? What was wrong with her heart? She fused one rod to the other, burned it off, returned, burned it off. \u201cPerhaps one of the reasons I don\u2019t want to be there is so she\u2019ll not be subjected to one of our happy family meals.\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm was as hot as one of Maggie\u2019s points of flame. Brianna faced it down with ice. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t cost you much to put aside your feelings for one night. If Uncle Niall and Mrs. Sweeney are going out of their way to visit us before going on to Galway, we\u2019ll welcome them. All of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop badgering me, will you? You\u2019re pecking away at me like a damn duck. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hardly do anything else, so it\u2019s necessary to interrupt you if I want a word. They\u2019ll be here shortly, Maggie, and I\u2019ll not make excuses for you.\u201d In a gesture similar to her sister\u2019s habitual stance, Brianna folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll stand right here and keep pecking until you do what\u2019s expected of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Jesus. I\u2019ll come to the damn dinner.\u201d</p><p>Brianna smiled serenely. She\u2019d never expected less. \u201cAt half seven. I\u2019m serving my guests earlier so we\u2019ll have a private family meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd oh, what a jolly time that will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go well enough if you promise to hold that nasty tongue of yours. I\u2019m only asking for the smallest of efforts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll smile, I\u2019ll be polite.

Is it a unicorn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, a unicorn\u2014only needs a touch of gold on the horn to make it complete.\u201d She laughed, turning the mythical figure in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke, Brie, a poor one. On me. It\u2019ll be swans next, I\u2019m sure. Or those little dogs with puffs for tails.\u201d She set her work aside, briskly turned off her torches. \u201cWell, that\u2019s that, I suppose. I\u2019ll hardly do anything worthwhile today, so I\u2019ll be along to your dinner party. God help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest awhile, Maggie? You look awfully tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I will, after I crate up a few pieces.\u201d She tossed the goggles aside, rubbed her hands over her face. She was tired, Maggie realized. Outrageously so. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry, Brie, you\u2019ll not have to send out the dogs for me. I\u2019ve said I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201d Brianna reached down to squeeze her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cI have to go back, make certain everything\u2019s in place. Half seven, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>She waved her sister out. To keep her mind on practical matters, she took one of the crates she\u2019d made and packed it with padding. After spreading bubble wrap over a table, she turned to the shelves at the back of the shop. There was only one piece there, the last she\u2019d completed before Rogan\u2019s visit.</p><p>Tall and sturdy, the trunk speared up, then curved, flooding down in slim, graceful limbs that almost seemed to sway. It would stand, she thought, like the willow that had inspired it. And it would bend, yielding, even as it remained true to itself. The color was a deep, pure blue that flooded up from the base and paled gently to the delicate tips.</p><p>She wrapped it carefully, for it was more than a sculpture. This was the last work she\u2019d been able to draw successfully from her heart. Nothing she had attempted since then had gelled. Day after day she had labored only to remelt and remelt. Day after day she came closer to releasing the panic that jittered inside her.</p><p>His fault, she told herself as she secured the top of the crate. His fault for tempting her with fame and fortune, for exposing her vanity to such a stunning and fast success. Now she was blocked, dried up. As hollow as the tube she\u2019d fashioned into a unicorn.</p><p>He\u2019d made her want too much. Want him too much. Then he had walked away and let her see, brutally, what it was like to have nothing.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t give up, nor would she give in. Maggie promised herself she would have her pride at least. While her furnace roared mockingly she sat in her chair, felt the familiarity of its shape.</p> <p>It was only that she\u2019d been working too hard, surely. She\u2019d been pushing herself to do better and better work with each piece. The pressure of holding on to success had blocked her, that was all. She couldn\u2019t suppress the idea that as the tour moved on from Paris it would be found wanting. That she would be found wanting.</p><p>That she would never again pick up the pipe just for herself, just for the pleasure of it. Rogan had changed all that. He had, as she\u2019d told him he would, changed her.</p><p>And how was it, she thought, closing her eyes, how could it be that a man could make you love him by going away?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well for yourself, haven\u2019t you, darling?\u201d Niall, stuffed into one of his bright-hued suits like a happy sausage, beamed at Brianna. \u201cI always said you were a clever lass. Takes after me dear sister, does Brianna, Chrissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely home.\u201d Christine accepted the glass Brianna offered. \u201cAnd your gardens are simply breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. They give me pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan told me how he enjoyed his brief stay here.\u201d Christine sighed, content with the warmth of the fire and the glow of the lamp. \u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got the touch.\u201d Niall gave Brianna a bone-crushing squeeze around the shoulders. \u201cIn the blood, you know. Blood runs true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo it seems. I knew your grandmother quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy was underfoot all the time.\u201d Niall winked. \u201cThought I didn\u2019t notice her. Shy was what I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had a shy moment in your life,\u201d Christine said with a laugh. \u201cYou thought I was a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I\u2019ve changed me mind.\u201d He leaned over and under Brianna\u2019s curious eye, kissed Christine firmly on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt took you more than fifty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Disconcerted, Brianna cleared her throat. \u201cI suppose I should check on...I believe that\u2019s Mother and Lottie,\u201d she continued when raised voices boomed down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou drive like a blind woman,\u201d Maeve complained. \u201cI\u2019ll walk back to Ennis before I get into that car with you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can do better, you should drive yourself. Then you\u2019d have a sense of independence.\u201d Obviously unconcerned, Lottie strolled into the parlor, unwrapping a thick scarf from around her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s a chilly night,\u201d she announced, rosy-cheeked and smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd you dragging me out in it\u2019ll put me in bed for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d Shoulders braced against embarrassment, Brianna helped Maeve off with her coat. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Mrs. Sweeney. Mrs. Sweeney, this is my mother, Maeve Concannon, and our friend Lottie Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted to meet you both.\u201d Christine rose to offer her hand to both women. \u201cI was a friend of your mother\u2019s, Mrs. Concannon. We were girls together in Galway. I was Christine Rogan then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe spoke of you,\u201d Maeve said shortly. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d Her gaze shifted to her uncle, narrowed. \u201cWell, Uncle Niall, is it? You haven\u2019t graced us with your presence for many a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt warms my heart to see you, Maeve.\u201d He enveloped her in an embrace, patting her stiff back with a beefy hand. \u201cI hope the years have been kind to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they?\u201d The moment she was freed, Maeve sat in a chair by the fire. \u201cThis fire\u2019s drawing poorly, Brianna.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t, but Brianna walked over to make minute adjustments to the flue.</p><p>\u201cStop fussing,\u201d Niall ordered with a casual wave of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s drawing fine. We all know Maeve lives to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she, now?\u201d Lottie spoke pleasantly while she pulled her knitting needles from the basket she\u2019d brought along. \u201cI pay no mind to it myself. But that comes from raising four children, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Unsure what step to take, Christine focused on Lottie. \u201cWhat lovely wool, Mrs. Sullivan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m partial to it myself. Had you a nice trip from Dublin, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lovely one, yes. I\u2019d forgotten how beautiful this part of the country was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but fields and cows,\u201d Maeve tossed out, annoyed that the conversation was circling out of her control. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to live in Dublin and pass through on a fine autumn day. Come winter, you wouldn\u2019t think it so lovely.\u201d She might have continued the theme, but Maggie came in.</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Uncle Niall, big as life.\u201d With a laugh, she went into his arms.</p><p>\u201cLittle Maggie Mae, all grown up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve been for some time.\u201d She stepped back, laughed again. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve lost nearly all of it now.\u201d She rubbed an affectionate hand over his head.</p><p>\u201cIt was such a fine head, you see, the good Lord saw no need to cover it with hair. I\u2019ve heard about how well you\u2019re doing, darling. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sweeney\u2019s telling you that so she can brag upon her grandson. It\u2019s lovely seeing you,\u201d Maggie said to Christine. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t let this one run you ragged in Galway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find I can keep up. I was hoping, if it\u2019s not inconvenient to you, that I could have a look at your glass house tomorrow before we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I\u2019d be glad to show you. Hello, Lottie, are you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFit as a fiddle.\u201d Her needles clacked musically. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d come by the house and tell us about your trip to France.\u201d</p> <p>This statement drew an audible sniff from Maeve. Schooling her features, Maggie turned. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret Mary. You\u2019ve been busy with your own doings, as usual, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna finds time to come by twice a week to see that I have all I need.\u201d</p><p>Maggie nodded. \u201cThen it isn\u2019t necessary for me to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll serve dinner now, if everyone\u2019s ready,\u201d Brianna cut in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always ready for a meal,\u201d Niall kept Christine\u2019s hand in his, using his free one to give Maggie\u2019s shoulder a squeeze as they went into the dining room.</p><p>There was linen on the table, and fresh flowers, with the warmth of candles flickering on the sideboard. The food was beautifully prepared and plentiful. It should have been a pleasant, congenial evening. But, of course, it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Maeve picked at her foot. The lighter the mood at the table became, the darker grew her own. She envied Christine her fine, well-cut dress, the gleam of pearls around her throat, the quiet, expensive scent that drifted from her skin. And the skin itself, soft and pampered by wealth.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s friend, Maeve thought. Her childhood playmate, class to class. The life Christine Sweeney had led should have been hers, she thought. Would have been hers, but for one mistake. But for Maggie.</p><p>She could have wept from the rage of it, from the shame of it. From the helpless loss of it.</p><p>All around her the conversation bubbled like some expensive wine, frothy and foolish talk about flowers and old times, about Paris and Dublin. About children.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely for you to have such a large family,\u201d Christine was saying to Lottie. \u201cI was always sorry that Michael and I couldn\u2019t have more children. Though we doted on our son, then on Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA son,\u201d Maeve muttered. \u201cA son doesn\u2019t forget his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s a special bond.\u201d Christine smiled, hoping to soften the harshness around Maeve\u2019s mouth. \u201cBut I confess, I always wanted a daughter of my own. You\u2019re blessed with two, Mrs. Concannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCursed, more like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry the mushrooms, Maeve.\u201d Deliberately Lottie spooned some onto Maeve\u2019s plate. \u201cThey\u2019re fried to a turn. You\u2019ve a fine hand, Brianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned the knack of these from my gran,\u201d Brianna began. \u201cI was always pestering her to show me how to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd blaming me because I didn\u2019t chose to strap myself to the stove,\u201d Maeve tossed back her head. \u201cI\u2019d no liking for it. I\u2019ll wager you don\u2019t spend much time in the kitchen, Mrs. Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a great deal, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Aware her voice had chilled, Christine made the effort to lighten it again. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to admit that none of my efforts there can come close to what you\u2019ve served us tonight, Brianna. Rogan was right to praise your cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes a living from it. Bedding and boarding strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone.\u201d Maggie spoke quietly, but the look in her eyes was as sharp as a shout. \u201cGod knows she bedded and boarded you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs was her duty. There\u2019s no one at this table would deny that it\u2019s a daughter\u2019s obligation to tend to her mother. Which is more than you\u2019ve ever done, Margaret Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr ever will do, so count your blessings that Brie tolerates you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a blessing to count, with my own children tossing me out of my own house. Then leaving me, sick and alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you haven\u2019t been sick a day, Maeve,\u201d Lottie said complacently. \u201cAnd how can you be alone when I\u2019m there, day and night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you draw a weekly wage to be there. It should be my own blood tending me, but no. My daughters turn their backs, and my uncle, with his fine house in Galway, pays no mind at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to see you haven\u2019t changed, Maeve.\u201d Niall regarded her with pity. \u201cNot a whit. I apologize, Chrissy, for my niece\u2019s poor behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll have our dessert in the parlor.\u201d Pale and quiet, Brianna rose. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to go in and sit, I\u2019ll serve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch cozier,\u201d Lottie agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll help you, Brianna.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Uncle Niall, Mrs. Sweeney, I\u2019d like a word with my mother before we join you.\u201d Maggie kept her seat, waiting until the room emptied out. \u201cWhy would you do it?\u201d Maggie asked Maeve. \u201cWhy would you spoil it for her? Would it have been so hard to give her the illusion for one evening that we were a family?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment only sharpened Maeve\u2019s tongue. \u201cI\u2019ve no illusions, and no need to impress Mrs. Sweeney from Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou impressed her just the same\u2014badly. It reflects on us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can be better than the rest of us, Margaret Mary? Better because you traipse off to Venice or Paris?\u201d With her knuckles whitening on the edge of the table, Maeve leaned forward. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been doing with that woman\u2019s grandson? Whoring yourself without an ounce of shame. Ah, he sees you\u2019ve got the money and the glory you always wanted. You\u2019ve only had to sell body and soul to get it.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie clasped her hands beneath the table to try to stem the shaking. \u201cMy work\u2019s what I sell, so perhaps you\u2019ve a point about my soul. But my body\u2019s mine. I\u2019ve given it to Rogan freely.\u201d</p><p>Maeve paled as her suspicions were confirmed. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll pay for it, as I did. A man of his class wants nothing more from the likes of you than what he finds in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about it. Nothing about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know you. What will happen to your fine career when you discover a baby in your belly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I found myself with a child to raise, I pray God I\u2019d do a better job than you. I wouldn\u2019t give everything up and wrap myself and the child in sackcloth for the rest of my days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that you know nothing about,\u201d Maeve said sharply. \u201cBut go on this way, and you will. You\u2019ll know what it\u2019s like to see your life stop and your heart break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t have to. Other musicians have families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was given a gift.\u201d To her own misery, Maeve felt tears burn her eyes. \u201cAnd because I was arrogant, as you are, it was taken from me. There\u2019s been no music in me since the moment I made you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere could have been,\u201d Maggie whispered. \u201cIf you\u2019d wanted it badly enough.\u201d</p><p>Wanted it? Even now Maeve could feel the old scar throb over her heart. \u201cWhat good is wanting?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAll your life you\u2019ve wanted, and now you risk having it taken away for the thrill of having a man between your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me,\u201d Maggie heard herself say.</p> <p>\u201cA man speaks easily of loving in the dark. You\u2019ll never be happy. Born in sin, live in sin, die in sin. And alone. Just as I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made hating me your life\u2019s work, and a fine job you\u2019ve done of it.\u201d Slowly, unsteadily, Maggie rose. \u201cDo you know what frightens me, frightens me down to the bone? You hate me because you see yourself when you look at me. God help me if you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She fled out of the room, and into the night.</p><p>The hardest pill to swallow was apology. Maggie postponed downing it, distracting herself by showing Christine and Niall her studio. In the cool light of morning, the nastiness of the previous evening blurred a little. She was able to soothe herself by explaining various tools and techniques, even, when Niall insisted, trying to coach him through blowing his first bubble.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a trumpet.\u201d Maggie clasped a hand on the pipe as he started to lift it high. \u201cShowing off like that will do no more than have hot glass spilling all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll stick with me golf.\u201d He winked and turned the pipe back to her. \u201cOne artist in the family\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really make your own glass.\u201d Christine wandered around the shop, in tailored slacks and a silk blouse. \u201cFrom sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a few other things. Sand, soda, lime. Feldspar, dolomite. A bit of arsenic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArsenic.\u201d Christine\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cAnd this and that,\u201d Maggie said with a smile. \u201cI guard my formulas closely, like a sorcerer with a spell. Depending on what color you want, you add other chemicals. Various colorants change in different base glasses. Cobalt, copper, manganese. Then there are the carbonates and the oxides. The arsenic\u2019s an excellent oxide.\u201d</p><p>Christine looked dubiously at the chemicals Maggie showed her. \u201cI\u2019d think it would be simpler to melt down used or commercial glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not yours then, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had to be a chemist as well as an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Maggie was always a bright one.\u201d Niall swung an arm over her shoulder. \u201cSarah was always writing me with how bright she was in school, how sweet Brianna\u2019s disposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was it,\u201d Maggie said with a laugh. \u201cI was bright, Brie was sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said Brie was bright as well,\u201d Niall said staunchly.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll wager she never said I was sweet.\u201d Maggie turned to nuzzle her face in his coat. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you again. I didn\u2019t realize how glad I would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve neglected you since Tom died, Maggie Mae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We all had our own lives, and Brie and I both understood that Mother didn\u2019t make it easy for you to visit. As to that...\u201d She pulled back, took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize for last evening. I shouldn\u2019t have provoked her, and I certainly shouldn\u2019t have left without saying good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for apologies from you, or from Brianna as I\u2019ve told her already today.\u201d Niall patted Maggie\u2019s cheek. \u201cMaeve had settled on her mood before she arrived. You provoked nothing. You\u2019re not to blame for the way she\u2019s chosen to go through life, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether I am or not, I\u2019m sorry the evening was uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have called it illuminating,\u201d Christine said calmly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it was,\u201d Maggie agreed. \u201cUncle Niall, did you ever hear her sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Lovely as a nightingale, to be sure. And restless, like one of those big cats you see caged in the zoo. She was never an easy girl, Maggie, happy only when the people would hush and listen to her music.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen there was my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there was Tom. From what I\u2019m told they were blind and deaf to everything but each other. Maybe to each other as well.\u201d He stroked the big hand down her hair. \u201cIt could be neither of them saw what was inside until they were bound. And when they did, what they saw was different than they\u2019d hoped. She let that sour her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think if they hadn\u2019t met, she\u2019d have been different?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little and kept his hand gentle. \u201cWe\u2019re tossed by the winds of fate, Maggie Mae. Once we end where they blow us, we make of ourselves what we will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for her,\u201d Maggie said softly. \u201cI never thought I could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve done well by her.\u201d He kissed Maggie\u2019s brow. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to make yourself what you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cVery hard on it.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied that the timing was right, Christine spoke up. \u201cNiall, would you be a darling and give me a moment with Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl talk, is it?\u201d His round face creased in smiles. \u201cTake your time, I\u2019ll go for a walk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow then,\u201d Christine began as soon as the door shut behind Niall. \u201cI have a confession. I didn\u2019t go into the parlor right after last night. I came back, thinking I might be able to smooth things over.\u201d</p><p>Maggie lowered her eyes to stare at the floor. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I did, rudely, was listen. It took all my control not to barge into that room and give your mother a piece of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would only have made things worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was why I didn\u2019t give in to the urge\u2014though it would have been greatly satisfying.\u201d Christine took Maggie by the arms, gave her a little shake. \u201cShe has no idea what she has in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she knows too well. I\u2019ve sold part of what I am because there\u2019s a need in me, just as there is in her, for more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve earned more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve earned it, or been given it as a gift, it doesn\u2019t change things. I wanted to be content with what I had, Mrs. Sweeney. I wanted so much to be, because otherwise I\u2019d be admitting there hadn\u2019t been enough. That my father had failed us, and he didn\u2019t. Before Rogan walked through that door, I was content, or I\u2019d talked myself into believing I could be. But the door\u2019s open now and I\u2019ve had a taste of it. I haven\u2019t done a decent hour\u2019s work in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pushed me into a corner, that\u2019s why. It can\u2019t be for myself anymore, I can\u2019t be for myself anymore. He\u2019s changed that. I don\u2019t know what to do. I always know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour work comes through your heart. That\u2019s plain for anyone who\u2019s seen in. Maybe you\u2019re blocking off your heart, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am, it\u2019s because I have to. I won\u2019t do what she did. Nor what my father did. I won\u2019t be the cause of misery, or the victim of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are the victim of it, my dear Maggie. You\u2019re letting yourself feel guilty for succeeding, guiltier yet for harboring the ambition to succeed. And I think you\u2019re refusing to let out what\u2019s in your heart, because once you do, you won\u2019t be able to take it back again, even though holding it in is making you unhappy. You\u2019re in love with Rogan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am, he brought it on himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll deal with it admirably.\u201d</p><p>Maggie turned away to shuffle tools on a bench. \u201cHe\u2019s never met her. I think I made sure he wouldn\u2019t so he couldn\u2019t see I was like her. Moody and mean, dissatisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely,\u201d Christine said softly, and drew Maggie\u2019s eyes back to hers. \u201cShe\u2019s a lonely woman, Maggie, through no one\u2019s fault but her own. It\u2019ll be no one\u2019s but yours if you\u2019re lonely, too.\u201d Coming forward, she took Maggie\u2019s hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your father, but there must be some of him in you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dreamed. So do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your grandmother, with her quick mind and ready temper. She\u2019s in you as well. Niall, with his wonderful lust for life. All of that\u2019s in you. None of it makes up the whole. Niall\u2019s right about that, Maggie. So right. You\u2019ll make yourself what you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had. I thought I knew exactly who I was and wanted to be. Now it\u2019s all mixed up in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your head won\u2019t give you the answer, it\u2019s best to listen to your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the answer it\u2019s giving me.\u201d</p><p>Christine laughed. \u201cThen, my dear child, you can be absolutely sure it\u2019s the right one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>BY midmorning, her solitude tucked around her, Maggie took up her pipe again. Two hours later the vessel she had blown was tossed back into the melt for cullet.</p><p>She pored over her sketches, rejected them, tried others. After scowling at the unicorn she\u2019d set on a shelf, she turned to her torches for lamp work. But she\u2019d hardly taken up a rod of glass before the vision faded. She watched the tip of the rod dip, melt, begin to droop. Hardly thinking of what she was doing, she began dropping the bits of molten glass into a container of water.</p><p>Some broke, others survived. She took one out by the tip to study. Though it had been formed by fire, it was cool now, shaped like a tear. A Prince Rupert\u2019s drop, no more than a glass artist\u2019s novelty, one a child could create.</p><p>Rubbing the one drop between her fingers, she took it to her polariscope. Through the lens the internal stresses in the drop exploded into a dazzling rainbow of colors. So much, she thought, inside so little.</p><p>She slipped the drop into her pocket, fished several more out of the bucket. Moving with studied care, she shut down her furnaces. Ten minutes later she was striding into her sister\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBrianna. What do you see when you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Blowing a stray hair out of her eyes, Brianna looked up and continued to knead her bread dough. \u201cMy sister, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Try for once not to be so literal-minded. What is it you see in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman who seems to be on the edge of something, always. One who has enough energy to tire me to the bone. And anger.\u201d Brianna stared down at her hands again. \u201cAnger that makes me sad and sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSelfishness?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Brianna glanced up again. \u201cNo, not that. Not ever. That\u2019s one flaw I\u2019ve never seen in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve enough of them. What, do you want to be perfect?\u201d</p> <p>The dismissive tone had Maggie wincing. \u201cYou\u2019re still upset with me about last evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, no.\u201d With renewed vigor Brianna began to pound the dough. \u201cWith myself, with circumstances, with fate, if you like. But not with you. It wasn\u2019t your doing, and God knows you warned me it wouldn\u2019t work. But I wish you wouldn\u2019t always leap to defend me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Brianna smoothed the dough into a mound and slipped it into a bowl for a second rising. \u201cShe was better behaved after you\u2019d gone. And a little embarrassed, I think. Before she left she told me I\u2019d cooked a nice meal. Not that she ate any of it, but at least she said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had worse evenings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s God\u2019s truth. Maggie, she said something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says lots of things. I didn\u2019t come to go over all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was about the candlesticks,\u201d Brianna continued, and had Maggie lifting both brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones I had on the sideboard, the ones you\u2019d made me last year. She said what pretty work they were.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, Maggie shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dreaming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was awake and standing in my own hallway. She looked at me, and she told me. And she kept standing there, looking at me until I understood that she couldn\u2019t say it to you herself, but she wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should she?\u201d Maggie said unsteadily.</p><p>\u201cI think it was a kind of apology, for whatever passed between you in the dining room. The best she could make. When she saw I understood her, she started in on Lottie again, so the two of them left the way they\u2019d come in. Arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Maggie had no idea how to react, how to feel. Restlessly, her fingers reached into her pocket to toy with the smooth glass drops.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small step, but a step it is.\u201d Brisk, Brianna began to dust flour on her hands in preparation for kneading the next loaf. \u201cShe\u2019s happy in the house you gave her, even if she doesn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be right.\u201d Her breath hitched a bit as she released it. \u201cI hope you are. But don\u2019t be planning any more family meals in the near future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna...\u201d Maggie hesitated, ended by looking helplessly at her sister. \u201cI\u2019m driving to Dublin today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll have a long day, then. You\u2019re needed at the gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to see Rogan. I\u2019m either going to tell him I\u2019m not going to see him again, or that I\u2019ll marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry him?\u201d Brianna bobbled the next ball of dough. \u201cHe\u2019s asked you to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last night we were in France. I told him no, absolutely no. I meant it. I might still. That\u2019s why I\u2019m driving, to give myself time to think it through. I\u2019ve realized that it has to be one or the other.\u201d She fingered the glass drops in her pocket. \u201cSo I\u2019m going, and I wanted to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie\u2014\u201d Brianna was left with her hands full of dough, staring at the swinging back door.</p><p>The worst part was not finding him home\u2014and knowing she should have checked before making the drive. At the gallery, his butler had said, but when she arrived there, cursing Dublin traffic all the way, he was already gone and on the way to his office.</p><p>Again, she missed him, by no more than five minutes, she was informed. He was heading to the airport and a flight to Rome. Would she care to put through a call to his car phone?</p><p>She would not, Maggie decided, stumble through one of the biggest decisions of her life over the telephone. In the end, she got back in her lorry and made the long, lonely drive back to Clare.</p><p>It was easy to call herself a fool. And to tell herself she was better off not having found him at all. Exhausted by the hours of driving, she slept like the dead until noon the next day.</p><p>Then she tried to work.</p><p>\u201cI want the Seeker in the forefront, and the Triad centered, precisely.\u201d</p><p>Rogan stood in the sun-washed showroom of Worldwide Gallery, Rome, watching his staff arrange Maggie\u2019s work. The sculptures stood up well in the gilded rococo decor. The heavy red velvet he\u2019d chosen to drape the pedestals and tables added a royal touch. Something he was sure Maggie would have complained about, but which suited the clientele of this particular gallery.</p><p>He checked his watch, muttered to himself under his breath. He had a meeting in twenty minutes. There was no help for it, he thought as he called out another order for a minute adjustment. He was going to be late. Maggie\u2019s influence, he supposed. She\u2019d corrupted his sense of time.</p><p>\u201cThe gallery opens in fifteen minutes,\u201d he reminded the staff. \u201cExpect some press, and see that they each receive a catalog.\u201d He scanned the room one last time, noting the placement of each piece, the fold of every drape. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>He stepped outside into the bright Italian sun, where his driver waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running late, Carlo.\u201d Rogan shifted into his seat and opened his briefcase.</p><p>Carlo grinned, tucked the chauffeur\u2019s cap lower on his brow and flexed his fingers like a concert pianist preparing to launch into an arpeggio. \u201cNot for long, signore.\u201d</p><p>To Rogan\u2019s credit, he barely lifted a brow as the car leaped like a tiger from the curb, snarling and growling at the cars it cut off. Bracing himself in the corner of the seat, Rogan turned his attention to a printout of figures from his Roman branch.</p><p>It had been an excellent year, he decided. Far from the staggering boom of the mideighties, but quite good enough. He thought perhaps it was best that the days when a painting could demand hundreds of millions of pounds at auction were over. Art, with so high a price tag, was too often hidden away in a vault until it was as soulless as gold bullion.</p><p>Still, it had been a profitable year. Profitable enough, he thought, that he could implement his idea of opening another smaller branch of Worldwide, one that displayed and sold only the works of Irish artists. It had been a germ in his mind for the last few years, but lately, just lately, it had grown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A small, even cozy gallery\u2014very accessible, from the decor to the art itself. A place that invited browsing, with good-quality art priced in a range that invited owning.</p><p>Yes, he thought the time was perfect. Absolutely perfect.</p><p>The car screeched to a halt, all but rearing up like a stallion. Carlo hurried out to open Rogan\u2019s door. \u201cYou are on time, signore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a magician, Carlo.\u201d</p> <p>Rogan spent thirty minutes with the head of the Roman branch, twice that in a board meeting, then granted back-to-back interviews to promote the Concannon tour. Several hours were devoted to studying Rome\u2019s proposed acquisitions and to meeting artists. He planned to fly to Venice that evening and lay the groundwork for the next stop of the tour. Gauging his time, he slipped away to place a few calls to Dublin.</p><p>\u201cJoseph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogan, how\u2019s Rome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunny. I\u2019ve finished up here. I should be in Venice by seven at the latest. If there\u2019s time, I\u2019ll go by the gallery there tonight. Otherwise, I\u2019ll do the preliminaries tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have your schedule here. You\u2019ll be back in a week?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSooner, if I can manage it. Anything I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiman was in. I bought two of his street sketches. They\u2019re reasonably good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve an idea we might be able to sell more of his work after the first of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA project I\u2019ll discuss with you when I get back. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your grandmother and her friend off to Galway.\u201d</p> <p>Rogan grunted. \u201cBrought him by the gallery, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to see some of Maggie\u2019s work\u2014in the proper setting. He\u2019s quite the character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and speaking of Maggie, she was by earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy there? In Dublin? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say. She sort of dashed in and out. I didn\u2019t even speak with her myself. She did send a shipment, with what seems to be a message for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat message?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018It\u2019s blue.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rogan\u2019s fingers paused on his notebook. \u201cThe message is blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, the message reads, \u2018It\u2019s blue.\u2019 It\u2019s a gorgeous piece, rather delicate and willowy. Apparently she thought you\u2019d know what she meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He smiled to himself, rubbing the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s for the Comte de Lorraine, Paris. A wedding present for his granddaughter. You\u2019ll want to contact him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, then. Oh, and it seems Maggie was by your office, and the house as well. I suppose she was looking for you for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d He debated a moment, then acted on instinct. \u201cJoseph, do me a favor? Contact the gallery in Venice. Tell them I\u2019ll be delayed a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to. Any reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know. Give Patricia my best. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Maggie drummed her fingers on a table in O\u2019Malley\u2019s, tapped her foot, blew out a long breath. \u201cTim, will you give me a bookmaker\u2019s sandwich to go with this pint? I can\u2019t wait for Murphy all bloody afternoon on an empty stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to do it. Got a date, do you?\u201d He grinned at her from over the bar, wriggled his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cHah. The day when I date Murphy Muldoon\u2019s the day I lose what\u2019s left of my mind. He said he had some business in the village and would I meet him here.\u201d She tapped the box on the floor with her. \u201cI\u2019ve got his birthday present for his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you made, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And if he\u2019s not here by the time I\u2019ve finished eating, he\u2019ll have to come fetch it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice Muldoon,\u201d said David Ryan, who sat at the bar puffing a cigarette. \u201cShe be living down to Killarney now, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would,\u201d Maggie agreed. \u201cAnd has been these past ten years or more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d seen her about. Married again, did she, after Rory Muldoon passed over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d Tim took up the story while he built a pint of Guinness. \u201cMarried a rich doctor name of Colin Brennan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKin to Daniel Brennan.\u201d Another patron picked up the tale, musing over his bowl of stew. \u201cYou know, he that runs a food store in Clarecastle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Tim shook his head as he walked over to serve Maggie her sandwich. \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t kin to Daniel Brennan but to Bobby Brennan from Newmarket on Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong about that.\u201d David pointed with the stub of his cigarette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wager two pounds on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. We\u2019ll ask Murphy himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he ever gets here,\u201d Maggie muttered, and bit into her sandwich. \u201cYou\u2019d think I have nothing better to do than to sit here twiddling my thumbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew a Brennan once.\u201d The old man at the end of the bar spoke up, paused, blew a lazy smoke ring. \u201cFrankie Brennan, he was, from Ballybunion, where I lived as a boy. One night he was walking home from the pub. Had a fill of porter, he did, and never had the head for it.\u201d</p><p>He blew another smoke ring. Time passed, but no one spoke. A story was in the making.</p><p>\u201cSo he went walking home, reeling a bit, and cut across a field to shorten the way. There was a fairy hill, and in his drunken state, he trod right over it. Well, a man should know better, drunk or sober, but Frankie Brennan got less than his share when the Lord passed out sense. Now, of course, the fairies had to teach him manners and respect, and so they tugged off all his clothes as he went staggering across the field. And he arrived home, stark naked, but for his hat and one shoe.\u201d He paused again, smiled. \u201cNever did find the other shoe.\u201d</p><p>Maggie gave an appreciative hoot of laughter and propped her feet on the empty chair across from her. They could keep Paris and Rome and the rest, she thought. She was just where she wanted to be.</p><p>Then Rogan walked in.</p><p>His entrance gained him some glances, appraisals. It wasn\u2019t often a man in so fine a suit strolled into O\u2019Malley\u2019s on a cloudy afternoon. Maggie, the pint glass nearly to her lips, froze like stone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood day to you.

Your work shows well there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be Rogan Sweeney, then?\u201d Tim slid the glass to Rogan.</p><p>\u201cI would, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m O\u2019Malley, Tim O\u2019Malley.\u201d After wiping his hand over his apron, Tim took Rogan\u2019s and pumped. \u201cI was a great friend of Maggie\u2019s father. He\u2019d have been pleased with what you\u2019re doing for her. Pleased and proud. We\u2019ve a scrapbook started, my Deirdre and I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can promise you you\u2019ll be adding to it. Mr. O\u2019Malley, for some time to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve come to see if I\u2019ve work to show you,\u201d Maggie called out, \u201cI haven\u2019t. And I won\u2019t if you breathe down my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t come to see your work.\u201d With a nod to Tim, Rogan walked to Maggie. He sat beside her, took her chin in his hand and kissed her softly. And kissed her long. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see you.\u201d</p><p>She let out the breath she\u2019d forgotten she was holding. A frowning glance at the bar had the curious onlookers turning their attention elsewhere. Or pretending to.</p><p>\u201cYou took your sweet time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime enough for you to miss me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve hardly worked at all since you left.\u201d Because it was difficult to admit, she kept her eyes trained on her glass. \u201cI\u2019ve started and stopped, started and stopped. Nothing\u2019s coming out the way I want it to. I don\u2019t care for this feeling, Rogan. I don\u2019t care for it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat feeling is that?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look from under her lashes. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you. I came to Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He toyed with the ends of her hair. It had grown a bit, he noted, and wondered how long it would be before she whacked away again with her scissors as she said she sometimes did. \u201cWas it so hard to come to me, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was. As hard as anything I\u2019ve done. Then you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>He was. And she wasn\u2019t sure she could speak for the pounding of her heart. \u201cThere are things I want to tell you. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She broke off as the door opened, and Murphy came in. \u201cOh, his timing\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Murphy signaled to Tim before heading toward Maggie. \u201cYou\u2019ve had lunch, then.\u201d In a casual gesture, he scraped up a chair and snatched one of her chips. \u201cDid you bring it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did. And you\u2019ve kept me waiting half the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely one o\u2019clock.\u201d Eyeing Rogan, Murphy ate another of Maggie\u2019s chips. \u201cYou\u2019d be Sweeney, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas the suit,\u201d Murphy explained. \u201cMaggie said how it was you dressed like every day was Sunday. I\u2019m Murphy Muldoon, Maggie\u2019s neighbor.\u201d</p><p>The first kiss, Rogan remembered, and shook hands as cautiously as Murphy. \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d Murphy leaned his chair on its back legs as he did his measuring. \u201cYou could almost say I\u2019m a brother to Maggie. As she\u2019s no man to look out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s not needing one,\u201d Maggie tossed out. She would have kicked Murphy\u2019s chair out from under him if he hadn\u2019t been quick enough to drop it in place again. \u201cI\u2019ll look out for myself very well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s often told me.\u201d Rogan addressed Murphy. \u201cBut need or not, she has one.\u201d</p><p>The message passed, male to male. After a moment\u2019s consideration, Murphy nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, then. Did you bring it or not, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I did.\u201d In an impatient move, she bent to grab the box from the floor and set it on the table between them. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my fondness of your mother, I\u2019d bash it over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be grateful you restrained yourself.\u201d As Tim plunked down another beer Murphy opened the box. \u201cThis is grand, Maggie. She\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d</p><p>Rogan imagined so. The pale pink bowl was as fluid as water, its sides waving up to end in delicate crests. The glass was so thin, so fragile, he could see the shadow of Murphy\u2019s hands through it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wish her a happy birthday for me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Murphy skimmed a callused finger over the glass before setting it back in the box. \u201cFifty pounds, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Maggie held out a hand, palm up. \u201cCash.\u201d</p><p>Feigning reluctance, Murphy scratched his cheek. \u201cIt seems mighty dear for one little bowl, Maggie Mae\u2014that you can\u2019t even eat from. But my mother likes foolish, useless things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking, Murphy, and the price\u2019ll go up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty pounds.\u201d Shaking his head, Murphy reached for his wallet. He counted out the bills in her outstretched hand. \u201cYou know I could\u2019ve gotten her a whole set of dishes for that. And maybe a fine new skillet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019d have knocked you in the head with it.\u201d Satisfied, Maggie tucked the bills away. \u201cNo woman wants a skillet for her birthday, and any man who thinks she does deserves the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy.\u201d David Ryan shifted on his stool. \u201cIf you\u2019ve finished your transaction there, we\u2019ve a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to answer it.\u201d Taking up his beer, Murphy rose. \u201c\u2019Tis a fine suit, Mr. Sweeney.\u201d He walked away to settle the wager of the Brennans.</p><p>\u201cFifty pounds?\u201d Rogan murmured, nodding toward the box Murphy had left on the table. \u201cYou and I are both aware that you could get more than twenty times that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Instantly defensive, she shoved her glass aside. \u201cIt\u2019s my work, and I\u2019ll ask for it what I please. You\u2019ve got your damned exclusive clause, Sweeney, so you can sue me if you like for breaking it, but you\u2019ll not have the bowl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave my word to Murphy,\u201d she barreled on. \u201cAnd a deal\u2019s done. You can have your cursed twenty-five percent of the fifty pounds. But if I choose to make something for a friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a complaint.\u201d He wrapped his hand around her fisted one. \u201cIt was a compliment. You have a generous heart, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>With the wind so successfully stripped from her sails, she sighed. \u201cThe papers say I\u2019m not to make anything that doesn\u2019t go to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe papers say that,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI imagine you\u2019ll go on snarling about it, and you\u2019ll go on slipping your friends gifts when it suits you.\u201d She shot him a look from under her lashes, so blatantly guilty, he laughed. \u201cI see I could have sued you a time or two over the last few months. We can make what we\u2019d call a side deal. I won\u2019t take my percentage of your fifty pounds, and you\u2019ll make something for my grandmother for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, lowered her lashes again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just about money, is it, Rogan? I\u2019m afraid sometimes that it is, that I\u2019ve let it be. Because I like the money, you see. I like it very much, and all that goes with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about money, Maggie. It\u2019s not just about champagne showings or newspaper clippings or parties in Paris. Those are just trimmings. What it\u2019s about really is what\u2019s inside you, and all that you are that goes into creating the beautiful, the unique and the startling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back, you see. I can\u2019t go back to the way things were, before you.\u201d She looked at him then, studying his face feature by feature while his hand lay warm over hers. \u201cWill you take a drive with me? There\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a car outside. I\u2019ve already put your bike in it.\u201d</p> <p>She had to smile. \u201cI should have known you would.\u201d</p><p>With a fall wind in the air, and the leaves a riot of color, they drove toward Loop Hea. Away from the narrow road, spilling back like the sea itself, were harvested fields and the deep, sweet green so special to Ireland. Maggie saw the tumbled stone sheds that looked no different than they had when she had traveled this road nearly five years before. The land was there, and the people tended it, as they always had. Always would.</p><p>When she heard the sea, smelled the first sharp sting of it on the air, her heart lurched. She squeezed her eyes tight, opened them again. And read the sign.</p><p>LAST PUB UNTIL NEW YORK.</p><p>Shall we sail over to New York, Maggie, and have a pint?</p><p>When the car stopped, she said nothing, only got out to let the wind slap cool over her skin. Reaching for Rogan\u2019s hand, she held it as they walked down the beaten path to the sea.</p> <p>The war continued, wave against rock in the echoing crash and hiss that was eternal. The mist had rolled in, so that there was no border between sea and sky, just a wide, wide cup of soft gray.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been here in almost five years. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d ever come again to stand like this.\u201d She pressed her lips together, wishing the fist around her heart would loosen, just a little. \u201cMy father died here. We\u2019d come out together, just us two. It was winter and bitter cold, but he loved this spot more than any other I can think of. I\u2019d sold some pieces that day to a merchant in Ennis, and we\u2019d celebrated in O\u2019Malleys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were alone with him?\u201d The horror of it slashed Rogan like a rapier. He could do nothing for her but pull her into his arms and hold on. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Maggie. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her cheek over the soft wool of Rogan\u2019s coat, caught the scent of him in it. She let her eyes close. \u201cWe talked, about my mother, their marriage. I\u2019d never understood why he stayed. Maybe I never will. But there was something in him that yearned, and that wanted for me and Brianna whatever that yearning was. I think I have the same longing, but that I might have the chance to grab hold of it.\u201d</p><p>She drew back so that she could look at his face as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve something for you.\u201d Watching him, she took one of the glass drops from her pocket, held it out in her palm.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a tear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d She waited while he held it to the light and studied it.</p><p>He rubbed a thumb over the smooth glass. \u201cAre you giving me your tears, Maggie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I am.\u201d She took another one out of her pocket. \u201cIt comes from dropping hot glass in water. When you do, some shatter right away, but others hold and form. Strong.\u201d She crouched and chose a rock. While Rogan watched she struck the glass with rock. \u201cStrong enough that it won\u2019t break under a hammer.\u201d She rose again, holding the undamaged drop. \u201cIt holds, you see. Does nothing more than bounce away from the blow and shine. But there\u2019s this thin end here and it only takes a careless twist.\u201d She took the slim, trailing end between her fingers. The glass turned to harmless dust. \u201cIt\u2019s gone, you see. Like it never was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tear comes from the heart,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cAnd neither should be handled carelessly. I won\u2019t break yours, Maggie, nor you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a long breath. \u201cBut we\u2019ll hammer away often enough. We\u2019re as different as that water and hot glass, Rogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as able to make something strong between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we might. Yet I wonder how long you\u2019d last in a cottage in Clare, or I in a house full of servants in Dublin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could move to the midlands,\u201d he said, and watched her smile. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve given that particular matter some thought. The idea, Maggie, is negotiation and compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the businessman, even at such a time.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019ve plans to open a gallery in Clare to spotlight Irish artists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Clare?\u201d Pushing back her windblown hair, she stared at him. \u201cA branch of Worldwide here in Clare? You\u2019d do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll spoil the heroics by telling you I\u2019d thought of the idea long before I met you. The conception had nothing to do with you, but the location does. Or I should say it has to do with us.\u201d As the wind picked up he pulled her jacket together and buttoned it. \u201cI believe I can live in a west-county cottage for part of the year, just as you could live with servants for the other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve thought this all through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, yes.

A lifetime term with no escape clauses.\u201d</p><p>The fist around her heart squeezed all the tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard bargainer, Sweeney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She looked out to sea again, the ceaseless rush of water, the indominable rock, and the magic they made between them. \u201cI\u2019ve been happy alone,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been unhappy without you. I never wanted to depend on anyone, or to let myself care so much I could be made unhappy. But I depend on you, Rogan.\u201d Gently she lifted a hand to his cheek. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>The sweetness of hearing it swarmed through him. He guided her palm over his lips. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And the fist, so tight around her heart, loosened. \u201cYou know.\u201d She laughed, shook her head. \u201cOh, it must be a fine thing to always be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been a finer thing.\u201d He lifted her off her feet, spun her around once before their lips met and clung. The wind swooped down, ribboned around them, smelling of the sea. \u201cIf I can make you unhappy, Maggie, then I can make you happy as well.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her arms tight around him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t I\u2019ll make your life hell. I swear it. God, I never wanted to be a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be mine, and glad of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be yours.\u201d She lifted her face to the wind. \u201cAnd glad of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
