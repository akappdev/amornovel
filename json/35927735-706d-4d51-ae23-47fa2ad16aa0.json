He sat for several moments, motionless as a statue. Then, with a great clenching of teeth, he stood to his feet and swept agitatedly through the house, ignoring tables and fragile items, disdaining the other inhabitants of his home.</p><p>There was only one person whom he wished to see.</p> <p>He strode quickly through the city streets, almost breaking into a run on his way to the river. He stood at the end of the bridge, their bridge, his moist eyes eagerly scanning the adjacent riverbank for the barest glimpse of his beloved.</p><p>She was nowhere to be found.</p><p>She would never return.</p><p>His beloved Beatrice was gone.</p><p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cAnd of that second kingdom will I sing</p><p>Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,</p><p>And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.\u201d</p><p>-Dante Alighieri, Purgatorio, Canto I.004-006.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Professor Gabriel Emerson was sitting in bed, naked, reading La Nazione, the Florentine newspaper. He\u2019d awoken early in the Palazzo Vecchio penthouse of the Gallery Hotel Art and ordered room service, but he couldn\u2019t resist returning to bed to watch the young woman sleep. She was on her side facing him, breathing softly, a diamond sparkling on her ear. Her cheeks were pink from the warmth of the room as their bed was bathed in sunshine from the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p> <p>The bed covers were deliciously rumpled, smelling of sex and sandalwood. His blue eyes glimmered, traveling lazily over her exposed skin and long, dark hair. As he turned back to his newspaper, she shifted slightly and moaned. Concerned, he tossed the paper aside.</p><p>She brought her knees up to her chest, curling into a ball. Low murmurings came from her lips, and Gabriel leaned closer so he could decipher what she was saying. But he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>All of a sudden, her body twisted and she let out a heart-wrenching cry. Her arms flailed as she wrestled with the sheet that shrouded her.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d He placed a gentle hand on her bare shoulder, but she cringed away from him.</p><p>She began muttering his name, over and over again, her tone growing progressively more panicked.</p><p>\u201cJulia, I\u2019m here,\u201d he raised his voice. Just as he reached for her again, she sat bolt upright, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Gabriel moved closer, resisting the urge to touch her. She was breathing roughly, and under his watchful gaze, she fanned a shaking hand over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p> <p>After a long, tense minute, she looked at him, eyes wide.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed loudly. \u201cA nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the woods behind your parents\u2019 house, back in Selinsgrove.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows knit together behind his dark-rimmed glasses. \u201cWhy would you dream about that?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled, drawing the sheet over her exposed breasts and up to her chin. The linen was full and white, swallowing her petite frame whole before billowing cloudlike over the mattress. She reminded him of an Athenian statue.</p><p>He ran his fingers gently over her skin. \u201cJulianne, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed under his piercing blue eyes, but he would not let her go. \u201cThe dream began beautifully. We made love under the stars, and I fell asleep in your arms. When I woke up you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dreamed I made love to you, then abandoned you?\u201d His tone cooled to mask his discomfort.</p><p>\u201cI woke up in the orchard without you once,\u201d she reproached him softly.</p><p>The fire in his belly was instantly quenched. He thought back to the magical evening six years ago when they first met, when they simply talked and held each other. He\u2019d awoken the following morning and wandered away, leaving a sleeping teenage girl all alone. Surely her anxiety was understandable if not pitiable.</p><p>He unwound her clenched fingers one by one and kissed them repentantly. \u201cI love you, Beatrice. I\u2019m not going to leave you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would hurt so much more to lose you now.\u201d</p><p>With a frown he wrapped an arm around her shoulder, pressing her cheek to his chest. A myriad of memories crowded his mind as he thought back to what had transpired the evening before. He\u2019d gazed on her naked form for the first time and initiated her into the intimacies of lovemaking. She\u2019d shared her innocence with him, and he thought he\u2019d made her happy. Certainly it had been one of the best evenings of his life. He pondered that fact for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you regret last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m glad you were my first. It\u2019s what I wanted since we met.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand on her cheek, tracing her skin with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have been your first.\u201d He leaned forward, his eyes unblinking. \u201cBut I want to be your last.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and lifted her lips to meet his. Before he could embrace her, the chimes of Big Ben filled the room.</p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he whispered fiercely, his arm stretching across her body, pushing her to recline beneath him.</p><p>Her eyes darted over his shoulder to where his iPhone lay on the desk. \u201cI thought she wasn\u2019t going to call you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not answering, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He kneeled between her legs and lifted the sheet from her body. \u201cIn my bed, there\u2019s only us.\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes as he began to bring their naked bodies into closer contact.</p><p>Gabriel leaned forward to kiss her, but she turned her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t brushed my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d He lowered his lips to her neck, kissing across her quickening pulse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to clean up first.\u201d</p><p>He huffed in frustration, leaning on one elbow. \u201cDon\u2019t let Paulina ruin what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She tried to roll out from under him and take the sheet with her, but he caught hold of it. He gazed over the rims of his glasses, his eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>\u201cI need the sheet to make the bed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes traveled from the white fabric that was clutched between her fingers, to his face. He looked like a panther waiting to pounce. She glanced over the side of the bed at the pile of clothes on the floor. They were beyond her reach.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked, stifling a grin.</p><p>Julia blushed and gripped the material more tightly. With a chuckle, he released the sheet and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be shy. You\u2019re beautiful. If I had my wish, you\u2019d never wear clothes again.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to her earlobe, gently touching the diamond stud. He was certain his adoptive mother, Grace, would have been happy that her earrings found their way to Julia. With another brief kiss, he turned away, sliding over to sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>She slipped into the washroom but not before Gabriel caught sight of her alluring back as she dropped the sheet just outside the door.</p><p>While brushing her teeth, she thought about what had transpired. Making love with Gabriel had been a very emotional experience, and even now her heart felt the aftershocks. That wasn\u2019t surprising considering their history. She\u2019d wanted him since she spent a chaste night with him in an orchard when she was seventeen, but he\u2019d been gone when she awoke the next morning. He\u2019d forgotten her in the aftermath of a drunken, drug-induced haze. Six long years passed before she saw him again, and then, he didn\u2019t remember her.</p><p>When she encountered him again on the first day of his graduate seminar at the University of Toronto, he was attractive but cold, like a distant star. She hadn\u2019t believed then that she\u2019d become his lover. She hadn\u2019t believed it possible that the temperamental and arrogant Professor would reciprocate her affection.</p><p>There were so many things she hadn\u2019t known. Sex was a kind of knowledge, and now she knew the sting of sexual jealousy in a manner she\u2019d never experienced before. The mere idea of Gabriel doing what they\u2019d done with some other woman, and in his case many other women, made her heart ache.</p><p>She knew that Gabriel\u2019s trysts were different from what they\u2019d shared\u2014that they were assignations not brought about by love or affection. But he\u2019d undressed them, seen them naked, and entered their bodies. After being with him, how many of those women craved more? Paulina had. She and Gabriel had maintained contact over the years since they conceived and lost a child together.</p><p>Julia\u2019s new understanding of sex changed her view of his past and made her more sympathetic to Paulina\u2019s plight. And all the more guarded against losing Gabriel to her or to any other woman.</p><p>Julia gripped the edge of the vanity as a wave of insecurity washed over her. Gabriel loved her; she believed this. But he was also a gentleman and would never reveal that their union had left him wanting. And what of her own behavior? She\u2019d asked questions and talked when she expected that most lovers would have been silent. She\u2019d done very little to please him, and when she tried he\u2019d stopped her.</p><p>Her ex-boyfriend\u2019s words came screaming back at her, swirling in her mind with condemnation:</p><p>You\u2019re frigid.</p><p>You\u2019re going to be a lousy lay.</p><p>She turned away from the mirror as she contemplated what might happen if Gabriel was dissatisfied with her. The specter of sexual betrayal reared its maleficent head, bringing with it visions of finding Simon in bed with her roommate.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders. If she could persuade Gabriel to be patient and to teach her, then she was confident she could please him. He loved her. He would give her a chance. She was his as surely as if he\u2019d branded his name on her skin.</p><p>When she stepped into the bedroom she caught sight of him through the open door to the terrace. On her way, she was distracted by a beautiful vase of dark purple and paler, variegated irises sitting on top of the desk. Some lovers might have purchased long-stemmed red roses, but not Gabriel.</p><p>She opened the card that was nestled amongst the blossoms.</p><p>My Dearest Julianne,</p><p>Thank you for your immeasurable gift.</p><p>The only thing I have of value is my heart.</p><p>It\u2019s yours,</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>Julia reread the card twice, her heart swelling with love and relief. Gabriel\u2019s words didn\u2019t sound like they were penned by a man who was dissatisfied or frustrated. Whatever Julia\u2019s worries, Gabriel didn\u2019t seem to share them.</p><p>Gabriel was sunning himself on the futon, his glasses off, his chest gloriously exposed. With his muscular, six-foot-two frame, it was as if Apollo himself had deigned to visit her. Sensing her presence on the terrace, he opened his eyes and patted his lap. She joined him, and his arms enveloped her as he kissed her passionately.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello there,\u201d he murmured, brushing a stray tendril back from her face. He peered at her closely. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Thank you for the flowers. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips against hers. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But you look troubled. Is it about Paulina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset that she\u2019s calling you, but no.\u201d Julia\u2019s expression brightened. \u201cThank you for your card. It said what I desperately wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d He squeezed her more closely. \u201cTell me what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She toyed with the belt to her bathrobe for a moment, until he took her hand in his. She looked at him. \u201cWas last night everything you\u2019d hoped for?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel exhaled sharply, for her question had taken him by surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it had to be different for you. I wasn\u2019t very...active.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActive? What are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do much to please you.\u201d She blushed.</p><p>He stroked the flushing skin lightly with the tip of his finger. \u201cYou pleased me a great deal. I know you were nervous, but I enjoyed myself tremendously. We belong to one another now\u2014in every way. What else is troubling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI demanded that we switch positions when you would have preferred me on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t demand, you asked. Frankly, Julianne, I\u2019d like to hear you demand things of me. I want to know that you want me as desperately as I want you.\u201d His expression relaxed, and he drew a circle or two around her breast. \u201cYou dreamed about your first time being a certain way. I wanted to give that to you, but I was worried. What if you were uncomfortable? What if I wasn\u2019t careful enough? Last night was a first for me too.\u201d</p><p>He released her, pouring coffee and steamed milk from two separate carafes into a latt\u00e9 bowl and spreading the tray of food between them on the banquette. There were pastries and fruit, toast and Nutella, boiled eggs and cheese, and several Baci Perugina Gabriel had bribed a hotel employee to run out and purchase along with the extravagant bouquet of irises from the Giardino dell\u2019Iris.</p> <p>Julia unwrapped one of the Baci and ate it, eyes closed with pure pleasure. \u201cYou ordered a feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI awoke ravenous this morning. I would have waited for you but...\u201d He shook his head as he picked up a grape and fixed her with a sparkling eye. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, and he popped the grape inside, tracing his finger temptingly across her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must drink this, please.\u201d He handed her a wine glass filled with cranberry juice and soda.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re overprotective.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThis is how a man behaves when he\u2019s in love and he wants his sweetheart healthy for all the sex he plans on having with her.\u201d He winked smugly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask how you know about such things. Give me that.\u201d She grabbed the glass from his hand and downed it, her eyes focused on his, as he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable.\u201d</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him before fixing herself a breakfast plate.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel this morning?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s face grew concerned.</p><p>She swallowed a piece of Fontina cheese. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together firmly, as if her answer displeased him.</p><p>\u201cMaking love changes things between a man and a woman,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cUm, aren\u2019t you happy with, uh, what we did?\u201d The pink of her cheeks faded immediately, leaving her pale.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m trying to find out if you\u2019re happy. And based upon what you\u2019ve said so far, I\u2019m worried that you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia picked at the fabric of her robe, avoiding Gabriel\u2019s probing gaze. \u201cWhen I was at college the girls on my floor would sit around and talk about their boyfriends. One night they told stories about their first times.\u201d She nibbled at the tip of one of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few of the girls had good things to say. The other stories were awful. One girl had been molested as a child. Some of the girls had been forced by a boyfriend or a date. Several of them said that their first times were completely awkward and unfulfilling\u2014a boyfriend grunting and finishing quickly. I thought, if that\u2019s all I can hope for, I\u2019d rather stay a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>She fixed her eyes on the breakfast tray.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be loved. I decided it would be better to have a chaste affair of the heart and mind through letters than a sexual relationship. I had my doubts that I would ever find anyone who could give me both. Certainly, Simon didn\u2019t love me. Now I\u2019m in a relationship with a sex god, and I can\u2019t give him anything like the pleasure he gives me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cSex god? You\u2019ve said that before, but believe me, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him, looking him straight in the eye. \u201cTeach me. I\u2019m sure last night was not as, um...fulfilling as it usually is for you, but I promise that if you are patient with me, I will improve.\u201d</p><p>He cursed obliquely. \u201cCome here.\u201d He pulled her around the breakfast tray and into his lap again, wrapping his arms around her. He was quiet for a moment, before sighing deeply.</p><p>\u201cYou assume that my previous sexual encounters were completely fulfilling, but you\u2019re wrong. You gave me what I\u2019ve never had\u2014love and sex together. You\u2019re the only one who has ever been my lover in the true sense.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her gently in solemn confirmation of his words. \u201cThe anticipation and the allure of a woman are crucial to the experience. I can safely say that your allurements and my anticipation were like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. Add to that the experience of making love for the first time...Words fail me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but something about her movement disquieted him.</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019m not flattering you.\u201d He paused as if he were pondering his next words carefully. \u201cAt the risk of being Neanderthal, I should probably tell you that your innocence is tremendously erotic. The thought that I can be the one to teach you about sex...that someone so modest is also so passionate...\u201d His voice trailed off as he looked at her intently. \u201cYou could become more skilled in the art of love by learning new tricks and new positions, but you can\u2019t become more attractive or more sexually fulfilling. Not to me.\u201d</p><p>Julia leaned over and kissed him. \u201cThank you for taking such good care of me last night,\u201d she whispered, her cheeks turning pink.</p><p>\u201cAs for Paulina, I\u2019ll deal with her. Please put her out of your mind.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned her attention back to her uneaten breakfast, resisting the urge to argue with him. \u201cWill you tell me about your first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>She busied herself with a pastry as she tried to think of a safer subject. The financial woes of Europe came readily to mind.</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes with both hands, covering them briefly. It would be far too easy to lie, he knew, but after all she\u2019d given him, she deserved to know his secrets. \u201cYou remember Jamie Roberts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lowered his hands. \u201cI lost my virginity to her.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyebrows shot up. Jamie and her domineering mother had never been very pleasant to Julia, and she had always disliked them. She had no idea that Officer Roberts, who had investigated Simon\u2019s attack on her a month previous, had been Gabriel\u2019s first.</p><p>\u201cIt was not the greatest of experiences,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIn fact, I would say it was scarring. I didn\u2019t love her. There was some attraction, of course, but no true affection. We went to Selinsgrove High School together. She sat next to me in History one year.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe flirted and messed around after school and eventually...</p><p>\u201cJamie was a virgin but lied and said she wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t attentive to her at all. I was selfish and stupid.\u201d He cursed. \u201cShe said it didn\u2019t hurt much, but there was blood afterward. I felt like an animal and I\u2019ve always regretted it.\u201d Gabriel cringed, and Julia felt the guilt radiating from him. His description made her almost ill, but it also explained a great deal.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cIs that why you were so worried last night?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe misled you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for my behavior, before or afterward.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cShe assumed we were in a relationship, but I wasn\u2019t interested. That made it worse, of course. I graduated from being merely an animal to being an animal and an asshole. When I saw her at Thanksgiving, I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in years. I asked her to forgive me. She was remarkably gracious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always felt guilty for treating her badly. I\u2019ve stayed away from virgins ever since.\u201d He swallowed noisily. \u201cUntil last night.</p><p>\u201cFirst times are supposed to be sweet, but seldom are. While you were worrying about pleasing me, I was worrying about pleasing you. Perhaps I was too careful, too protective, but I couldn\u2019t have borne it if I\u2019d hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Julia put her breakfast aside and stroked his face. \u201cYou were very gentle and very generous. I\u2019ve never known such joy, and that\u2019s because you loved me with more than just your body. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>As if to prove her point, he kissed her deeply. Julia hummed as his hands tangled through her hair, and she wrapped her arms about his neck. He slid his hands between them to the front of her robe, parting it hesitantly. He lifted his head, his eyes questioning.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He began whispering kisses against her neck and drew his mouth up to tug at her earlobe. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she whispered as his lips skimmed down to her throat.</p><p>He moved so he could see her face while one of his hands traveled to rest atop her lower abdomen. \u201cAre you sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his lips curling up into his signature seductive smile. \u201cDid you mean what you said last night about making love out here?\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the way his voice inflamed her but returned his smile, winding her fingers in his hair, tugging him closer. He opened her robe and began to explore her curves with both hands before dropping his mouth to kiss her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou were shy with me this morning.\u201d He pressed a reverent kiss over her heart \u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>Julia brushed against the hint of a dimple in his chin. \u201cI will probably always be a little shy about being naked. But I want you. I want you to look into my eyes and tell me you love me as you move inside me. I will remember that as long as I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep reminding you,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>He divested her of her robe and positioned her on her back. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you\u2019re holding me,\u201d she whispered, smiling. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather have me on top? I\u2019d like to try it.\u201d</p><p>He threw off his robe and boxer shorts quickly and covered her body with his own, placing a hand on either side of her face. \u201cSomeone might see you out here, darling. And I can\u2019t have that. No one gets to see this beautiful body except me.</p><p>\u201cAlthough the neighbors and passersby might be able to hear you...for the next hour or so...\u201d He chuckled as she inhaled sharply, a tremor of pleasure coursing all the way down to her toes.</p><p>He kissed her, pushing her hair away from her face. \u201cMy goal is to see how many times I can please you before I can\u2019t hold back anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grinned. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. So let me hear you.\u201d</p><p>The blue sky blushed to see such passionate lovemaking, while the Florentine sun smiled down, warming the lovers despite the gentle breeze. Beside them, Julia\u2019s coffee and milk grew stone cold and sullen at being ignored.</p><p>After a brief nap, Julia borrowed Gabriel\u2019s MacBook to send an email to her father. She had two important messages in her inbox. The first was from Rachel.</p> <p>Jules!</p><p>How are you? Is my brother behaving himself? Have you slept with him yet? Yes, it is COMPLETELY inappropriate for me to ask that question, but come on, if you were dating anyone else you would have told me already.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to volunteer any advice. I\u2019m trying not to think too much about it. Just let me know you\u2019re happy and he\u2019s treating you properly.</p><p>Aaron sends his best.</p><p>Love you,</p> <p>Rachel.</p><p>PS. Scott has a new girlfriend. He\u2019s been secretive about her so I\u2019m not sure how long they\u2019ve been dating. I keep bugging him to introduce me but he won\u2019t.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s a professor.</p><p>Julia snickered, glad that Gabriel was showering and not reading over her shoulder. He\u2019d be annoyed at his sister for posing such personal questions. She took a few moments to phrase her response before typing her reply.</p><p>Hi Rachel,</p><p>The hotel is beautiful. Gabriel has been very sweet and gave me your mother\u2019s diamond earrings. Did you know about that?</p> <p>I feel guilty about it, so please let me know if this upsets you.</p><p>As to your other question, Yes. Gabriel treats me well, and I am VERY happy.</p><p>Say hi to Aaron for me. Looking forward to Christmas.</p><p>Love, Julia. XO</p><p>PS. I hope Scott\u2019s girlfriend is a professor. Gabriel will never let him hear the end of it.</p><p>Julia\u2019s second email was from Paul. It could be said that he pined for her, but also he was grateful to have maintained their friendship. He would rather keep his longings to himself than to lose her entirely. And he had to admit that since she\u2019d begun seeing her boyfriend Owen, her very skin glowed.</p><p>(Not that he would have mentioned it.)</p><p>Hey Julia,</p> <p>Sorry I didn\u2019t get the chance to say good-bye before you went home. I hope you have a good Christmas. I have a gift for you. Would you give me your address in Pennsylvania so I can send it?</p><p>I\u2019m back at the farm trying to find time to work on my dissertation in between large family gatherings and getting up early to help my dad. Let\u2019s just say my daily routine involves a lot of manure...</p><p>Can I bring you something from Vermont?</p><p>A Holstein of your very own?</p><p>Merry Christmas,</p><p>Paul.</p><p>P.S. Did you hear that Christa Peterson\u2019s dissertation proposal was accepted by Emerson?</p><p>I guess Advent really is the season of miracles.</p><p>Julia stared at the computer screen, reading and re-reading Paul\u2019s postscript. She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. It was possible, she thought, that Gabriel accepted Christa\u2019s proposal because she threatened him.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t want to bring up such an unpleasant topic during their vacation, but the news troubled her. She typed a short reply to Paul, giving him her address, then she emailed her father, telling him that Gabriel was treating her like a princess. She closed the laptop and sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a happy Julianne.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice sounded behind her.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to ignore my email for the rest of our trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>She turned to find him standing in front of her, wet from the shower, hair tousled, a white towel wound around his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she blurted before thinking.</p><p>He chuckled and pulled her to her feet so he could embrace her. \u201cDo you have a thing for men in towels, Miss Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe for one particular man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d He raised his eyebrows expectantly, his expression hungry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little uncomfortable. But it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou need to tell me if I\u2019m hurting you, Julianne. Don\u2019t hide things from me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cGabriel, it doesn\u2019t hurt; it\u2019s merely uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t notice it during because there were other things on my mind\u2014several other things. You were very distracting.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed her neck loudly. \u201cYou need to let me start distracting you in the shower. I\u2019m tired of showering alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>He pretended to ponder her question. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014loud, hot sex with my beloved inside and outside...Yes, I\u2019d say I\u2019m great.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her close, and the cotton of her robe absorbed some of the water droplets from his skin. \u201cI promise it won\u2019t always be uncomfortable. In time, your body will recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already recognizes you. And misses you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Gabriel moved the top of her robe aside so he could kiss the slope of her shoulder. With a gentle squeeze, he walked to the bed, retrieving a bottle of ibuprofen and handing it to her.</p><p>\u201cI have to run over to the Uffizi for a meeting, then I have to pick up my new suit at the tailor\u2019s.\u201d He appeared concerned. \u201cWould you mind shopping for a dress by yourself? I\u2019d go with you, but my meeting won\u2019t leave me with much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can be ready in half an hour, we can walk out together.\u201d</p><p>Julia followed Gabriel into the bathroom, all thoughts of Christa and Paul forgotten.</p><p>After her shower, she stood in front of one of the vanities, drying her hair while Gabriel stood at the other. She found herself glancing over at him, watching as he carried out his shaving preparations with military precision. Finally, she gave up putting on lipstick and simply leaned against the sink, staring.</p><p>He was still naked to the waist, the towel now low on his hips, as he painstakingly shaved in the classical style. His brilliant blue eyes narrowed in concentration behind his black glasses, his damp hair impeccably combed.</p><p>Julia suppressed a laugh at the degree to which his quest for perfection was manifested. Gabriel used a shaving brush with a black wooden handle to mix European shaving soap into a thick lather. After spreading the foam on his face with the brush, he shaved using an antiquated safety razor.</p><p>(For some professors, disposable razors simply aren\u2019t good enough.)</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned, noticing that she was perilously close to ogling him.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cI love you too, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only non-British person I\u2019ve ever heard use the term darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard used to call Grace that.\u201d Gabriel gave her a sad look.</p><p>\u201cRichard is old-fashioned, in the best sense.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI love the fact that you\u2019re old-fashioned too.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted and continued shaving. \u201cI\u2019m not so old-fashioned, or I wouldn\u2019t be making mad passionate love with you outside. And fantasizing about introducing you to some of my favorite positions from the Kama sutra.\u201d He winked at her. \u201cBut I am a pretentious old bastard and a devil to live with. You\u2019ll have to tame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how shall I do that, Professor Emerson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever leave.\u201d His voice dropped, and he turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about losing you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her forehead. \u201cThen you have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Julia stepped out of the bedroom, feeling nervous. Gabriel had made arrangements for her to shop on his account at the local Prada boutique, and she\u2019d chosen a Santorini-blue V-necked, sleeveless dress made of silk taffeta. Its A-line shape boasted a full pleated skirt and was reminiscent of the kind of dress worn by Grace Kelly in the 1950s. It suited Julia perfectly.</p><p>However, the boutique manager had wanted the accessories to modernize the dress, and thus she chose a sleek silver leather clutch and a pair of tangerine patent leather stilettos that Julia found perilously high. To complete the ensemble, a black cashmere wrap was provided.</p><p>She stood hesitantly in the sitting room, her hair long and loosely curled, her eyes bright and shining. She wore Grace\u2019s diamond earrings and her string of pearls.</p><p>Gabriel had been seated on the sofa in the living room, making last minute changes to his lecture notes. When he saw her he took off his glasses and stood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stunning.\u201d He kissed her cheek and twirled her so he could admire her dress. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it. Thank you, Gabriel. I know it cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to her shoes.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat as his attention remained riveted to her feet.</p><p>\u201cUm...your shoes...they\u2019re\u2014ah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Aren\u2019t they?\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a good deal more than nice.\u201d His voice grew thick.</p><p>\u201cWell, Professor Emerson, if I like your lecture, perhaps I\u2019ll continue wearing them after...\u201d</p><p>Gabriel straightened his tie a little and gave her a cocky grin. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll see that you like my lecture, Miss Mitchell. Even if I have to deliver it to you personally, between the sheets. And it isn\u2019t my bedroom, it\u2019s our bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, and he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he said, pressing a kiss to her hair.</p><p>\u201cWait. I have a present for you.\u201d She disappeared and returned with a small box that had Prada emblazoned across the top.</p><p>He seemed surprised. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled and carefully lifted the lid. He pulled back the tissue paper to find a lightly patterned Santorini-blue silk tie.</p><p>\u201cI like it. Thank you.\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt matches my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow everyone will know that we belong to each other.\u201d He immediately removed his green tie, tossing it onto the coffee table, and began tying Julia\u2019s gift around his neck.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s new suit had been custom made by his favorite local tailor. It was black and single-breasted with side vents. Julia admired the suit a great deal, but even more so, she admired the attractive figure in it.</p><p>There is nothing sexier than watching a man put on a tie, she thought.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d she offered, as Gabriel struggled in the absence of a mirror.</p><p>He nodded and bent forward, placing his hands around her waist. She adjusted his tie and fixed his collar, running her hands down his sleeves until they rested on the cufflinks at his wrists.</p><p>He gazed at her curiously. \u201cYou straightened my tie when I took you to Antonio\u2019s. We were sitting in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sexier than having the woman you love fix your tie.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since that first night.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to kiss him, taking care not to sully his masculine mouth with her lipstick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He brought his lips to her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to keep the Florentine men at bay this evening. You\u2019ll have to stay very close to me.\u201d</p><p>Julia squealed as he put his arms around her, lifting her so he could kiss her properly, which required Julia to reapply her lipstick and both of them to check their appearance in the mirror before they left their room.</p><p>Gabriel held her hand during the short walk to the Uffizi and even after they were whisked to the second floor by a rather pudgy gentleman wearing a paisley bow tie who introduced himself as Lorenzo, Dottore Vitali\u2019s personal assistant.</p><p>\u201cProfessore, I\u2019m afraid we have need of you.\u201d Lorenzo glanced between Gabriel and Julia, his eyes darting to their conjoined hands.</p> <p>Gabriel tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the\u2014how you say\u2014on the screen? PowerPoint?\u201d Lorenzo gestured to the room behind them where guests were already congregating.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell has a reserved seat,\u201d said Gabriel pointedly, irritated that Lorenzo was ignoring her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Professore. I shall accompany your fidanzata personally.\u201d Lorenzo nodded respectfully in Julia\u2019s direction.</p><p>She opened her mouth to correct his characterization, but Gabriel pressed a kiss to the back of her hand, murmuring a promise against her skin. Then he was gone, and Julia was escorted to her place of honor in the front row.</p> <p>She took in her surroundings, noting the presence of what looked like members of Florence\u2019s glitterati mingling with academics and local dignitaries. She smoothed the skirt of her dress, enjoying the whispering sound of the taffeta beneath her fingers. Given the appearance of the other guests, along with the presence of a bevy of photographers, she was glad that she was well-dressed. She didn\u2019t want to embarrass Gabriel on this most important occasion.</p><p>The lecture was being delivered in the Botticelli room, which was devoted to the finest of his works. In fact, the lectern was situated in between the Birth of Venus and the Madonna of the Pomegranate, while Primavera hung to the audience\u2019s right. The artwork on the wall to the audience\u2019s left had been removed, and a large screen had been hung, on which Gabriel\u2019s PowerPoint slides would be projected.</p><p>She knew how unusual it was to have a lecture in such a special space and silently said a prayer of thanks for this incredible blessing. When she\u2019d spent her junior year in Florence she\u2019d visited the Botticelli room at least once a week and sometimes more often. She found his art both soothing and inspiring. As a shy American undergraduate, she never would have imagined that, two years later, she would be accompanying a world-renowned Dante specialist as he lectured in that very room. She felt as if she\u2019d won the lottery a thousand times over.</p><p>More than one hundred people crowded into the room, some even spilling into the standing area at the back. Julia watched Gabriel as he was introduced to various important looking guests. He was a very attractive man, tall and ruggedly handsome. She especially admired his glasses and the way his sleek, dark suit fit perfectly.</p><p>When he was blocked from her view by other people, she focused her attention on picking out his voice. He chatted amiably, switching seamlessly from Italian to French to German and back to Italian again.</p><p>(Even his German was sexy.)</p> <p>She grew warm as she remembered what Gabriel looked like under his suit, his form naked and strained above her. She wondered if he was having similar thoughts whenever he looked at her, and in the midst of her private musings, he made eye contact and winked. His momentary display of playfulness put her in mind of their interlude on the terrace that morning, and a pleasant tremor traveled up and down her spine.</p><p>Gabriel sat politely through Dottore Vitali\u2019s introduction, which took no less than fifteen minutes as he painstakingly rehearsed the professor\u2019s accomplishments. To the casual observer, Gabriel appeared relaxed, almost bored. His nervousness was telegraphed by the way he unconsciously shuffled his lecture notes, notes that were merely an outline to the remarks that would come from his heart. He\u2019d made a few last minute changes to his lecture. He couldn\u2019t speak of muses, love, and beauty without acknowledging the brown-eyed angel who\u2019d bravely given herself to him the evening before. She was his inspiration, and she\u2019d been so since she was seventeen. Her quiet beauty and generous goodness had touched his heart. He\u2019d carried her image with him as a talisman against the dark demons of addiction. She was everything to him, and by God, he\u2019d say so publicly.</p><p>After much flattery and applause, he took his place behind the podium and addressed the crowd in fluid Italian. \u201cMy lecture this evening will be somewhat unusual. I am not an art historian, yet I will be speaking to you about Sandro Botticelli\u2019s muse, La Bella Simonetta.\u201d At this, his eyes sought Julia\u2019s.</p><p>She smiled, trying to suppress the blush that threatened her cheeks. She knew the story of Botticelli and Simonetta Vespucci. Simonetta was referred to as the Queen of Beauty in the court of Florence, prior to her death at the tender age of twenty-two. To be compared to Simonetta by Gabriel was very high praise, indeed.</p><p>\u201cI am tackling this controversial topic as a professor of literature, choosing Botticelli\u2019s artwork as a representation of various female archetypes. Historically speaking, there have been many debates as to how close Simonetta was to Botticelli and to what degree she was the actual inspiration for his paintings. I hope to skirt some of those disagreements in order to focus your attention on a straightforward visual comparison of a few figures.</p><p>\u201cI shall begin with the first three slides. In them, you will recognize pen and ink illustrations of Dante and Beatrice in Paradise.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t help but admire the images himself, transported as he was to the first time he\u2019d welcomed Julianne into his home. That was the night he\u2019d realized how much he wanted to please her, how beautiful she looked when she was happy.</p><p>As he gazed at the quiescence of Beatrice\u2019s expression, he compared her countenance with Julia\u2019s. She sat with rapt attention, her lovely head turned in profile as she admired Botticelli\u2019s handiwork. Gabriel wanted to make her look at him.</p> <p>\u201cNotice Beatrice\u2019s face.\u201d His voice grew soft as his eyes met those of his sweetheart. \u201cThe most beautiful face...</p><p>\u201cWe begin with Dante\u2019s muse and the figure of Beatrice. Although I\u2019m sure she needs no introduction, allow me to point out that Beatrice represents courtly love, poetic inspiration, faith, hope, and charity. She is the ideal of feminine perfection, at once intelligent and compassionate, and vibrant with the kind of selfless love that can only come from God. She inspires Dante to be a better man.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel paused a moment to touch his tie. It did not need straightening, but his fingers lingered against the blue silk. Julia blinked at the gesture, and Gabriel knew that he\u2019d been understood.</p><p>\u201cNow consider the face of the goddess Venus.\u201d</p><p>All eyes in the room except Gabriel\u2019s focused on the Birth of Venus. He looked over his notes eagerly as the audience admired one of Botticelli\u2019s greatest and largest works.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that Venus has Beatrice\u2019s face. Once again, I\u2019m not interested in a historical analysis of the models for the painting. I\u2019m simply asking you to note the visible similarities between the figures. They represent two muses, two ideal types, one theological and one secular. Beatrice is the lover of the soul; Venus is the lover of the body. Botticelli\u2019s La Bella has both faces\u2014one of sacrificial love or agape, and one of sexual love or eros.\u201d</p><p>His voice deepened, and Julia found her skin warming at the sound.</p><p>\u201cIn the portrait of Venus, the emphasis is on her physical beauty. Even though she represents sexual love, she maintains a venerable modesty, clutching part of her hair in order to cover herself. Notice the demure expression and the placement of her hand across her breast. Her shyness increases the eroticism of her portrayal\u2014it doesn\u2019t diminish it.\u201d He removed his glasses for dramatic effect and fixed Julia with an unblinking eye. \u201cMany people fail to see how modesty and sweetness of temper compound erotic appeal.\u201d</p><p>Julia fidgeted with the zipper on her purse, resisting the urge to squirm in her seat. Gabriel replaced his glasses.</p><p>\u201cEros is not lust. According to Dante, lust is one of the seven deadly sins. Erotic love can include sex but is not limited to it. Eros is the all-consuming fire of infatuation and affection that is expressed in the emotion of being in love. And believe me when I say that it far outstrips the rivals for its affections, in every respect.\u201d</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t help but notice the dismissive way with which he\u2019d pronounced the word rivals, punctuating his expression with a wave of his hand. It was as if he were casting aside all previous lovers with a mere gesture, while his blazing blue eyes fixed on her.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who has ever been in love knows the difference between eros and lust. There\u2019s no comparison. One is an empty, unfulfilling shadow of the other.</p><p>\u201cOf course, one might object that it is impossible for one person, one woman, to represent the ideal of both agape and eros. If you will allow my indulgence for a moment, I will suggest that such skepticism is a form of misogyny. For only a misogynist would argue that women are either saints or seductresses\u2014virgins or whores. Of course, a woman, or a man for that matter, can be both\u2014the muse can be lover to both soul and body.</p><p>\u201cNow consider the painting behind me, Madonna of the Pomegranate.\u201d</p><p>Again, the eyes of the audience shifted to one of Botticelli\u2019s paintings. Gabriel noticed with satisfaction the way Julia intentionally fingered one of her diamond earrings, as if she understood his revelations and received them gladly. As if she knew he was revealing his love for her through art. His heart swelled.</p><p>\u201cOnce again, we see the same face repeated in the figure of the Madonna. Beatrice, Venus, and Mary\u2014a trinity of ideal women, each wearing the same face. Agape,eros, and chastity, a heady combination that would make even the strongest man fall to his knees, if he was fortunate enough to find one person who manifests all three.\u201d</p><p>A cough that sounded suspiciously as if it were covering a derisive remark echoed throughout the room. Angry at being interrupted, Gabriel scowled in the general direction of the second row, over Julia\u2019s shoulder. The cough was repeated once more for dramatic effect and a testosterone fueled staring contest began between a clearly annoyed Italian and Gabriel.</p><p>Conscious of the fact that he was speaking into a microphone, Gabriel resisted the urge to curse and, with a scathing look at his detractor, continued.</p><p>\u201cSome have argued that it was a pomegranate and not an apple that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden. With respect to Botticelli\u2019s painting, many have argued that the pomegranate symbolizes the blood of Christ in his suffering and his subsequent new life through the resurrection.</p><p>\u201cFor my purposes, the pomegranate represents the Edenic fruit, the Madonna as the second Eve and Christ as the second Adam. With the Madonna, Botticelli hearkens back to the first Eve, the archetype of femininity, beauty, and female companionship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go further, by asserting that Eve is also the ideal of female friendship, the friend of Adam, and thus she is the ideal of philia, the love that emerges out of friendship. The friendship between Mary and Joseph manifests this ideal, as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice caught, so he took a moment to sip some water before continuing. Something about the comparison between Julia and Eve made him feel vulnerable, naked, hearkening back to the night he\u2019d given her an apple and held her in his arms under the stars.</p><p>The audience began murmuring, wondering why a polite pause to take a drink had extended into a break. Gabriel\u2019s color deepened as he raised his eyes to look at his beloved once again, desperate for her understanding.</p><p>Her ruby lips parted into an encouraging smile. Instantly, Gabriel exhaled.</p><p>\u201cBotticelli\u2019s muse is a saint, a lover, and a friend, not a cardboard cut-out of a woman or an adolescent fantasy. She is real, she is complicated, and she is endlessly fascinating. A woman to worship.</p> <p>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the preciseness of the Greek language allows one to speak more perspicuously about the different kinds of love. A modern treatment of this discussion can be found in C.S. Lewis\u2019s The Four Loves, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and smiled winningly at the room.</p><p>\u201cFinally, consider the painting to my left, Primavera. One might expect to see the face of Botticelli\u2019s muse reflected in the central figure in the painting. But consider the face of Flora, on the right. Once again, she bears a similarity to Beatrice, Venus, and the Madonna.</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, Flora appears twice in the painting. As we move from the center of the painting to the right, you see Flora pregnant, swollen with Zephyr\u2019s child. Zephyr is on the far right, hovering amongst the orange trees with the second depiction of Flora, as a virgin nymph. Her expression is marked with fear. She\u2019s fleeing the arms of her prospective lover and gazing back at him in panic. However, when she\u2019s pregnant, her countenance is serene. Her fear is replaced by contentment.\u201d</p><p>Julia flushed as she remembered how kind Gabriel had been to her the night before. He\u2019d been tender and gentle, and in his arms she\u2019d felt worshipped. Remembering the myth of Flora and Zephyr she shuddered, wishing that all lovers would be as tender with their virgin partners as Gabriel had been.</p> <p>\u201cFlora represents the consummation of physical love and motherhood. She is the ideal of storge, or familial love, the kind of love manifested from a mother to her child, and between lovers who share a commitment that is not based solely on sex or pleasure, but is between married partners.\u201d</p><p>No one but Julia noticed the white knuckling as he held the edge of the podium with two hands. No one but Julia noticed the slight tremor in his voice as he pronounced the words pregnant and motherhood.</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed as he collected himself, shuffling his papers for a moment. Julia recognized his vulnerability for what it was, fighting the urge to go to him and embrace him. She began tapping one of her tangerine colored stiletto heels in anticipation.</p><p>Gabriel caught her sudden movement and swallowed hard before continuing. \u201cIn early writings on Primavera, Flora was asserted to be the likeness of La Bella Simonetta, Botticelli\u2019s muse. If that is true, just on visual inspection alone, we can assert that Simonetta is the inspiration for Beatrice, Venus, and the Madonna, for all four ladies share the same face.</p><p>\u201cThus, we have the icons of agape, eros, philia, and storge all represented by a single face, a single woman\u2014Simonetta. To put this another way, one could argue that Botticelli sees in his beloved muse all four types of love and all four ideals of womanhood: saint, lover, friend, and spouse.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, however, I must return to where we began, with Beatrice. It is no accident that the inspiration behind one of Italy\u2019s best-known literary works was given Simonetta\u2019s features. Faced with such beauty, such goodness, what man wouldn\u2019t want her by his side not just for a season, but for a lifetime?\u201d</p> <p>He gazed around the room gravely.</p><p>\u201cTo quote the Poet, now your blessedness appears. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>As Gabriel ended his lecture to enthusiastic applause, Julia blinked back tears, overcome with emotion.</p><p>Dottore Vitali retook the podium, extending his thanks to Professor Emerson for an illuminating discussion. A small group of local politicians presented him with several gifts, including a medallion depicting the city of Florence.</p><p>Julia remained in her seat for as long as possible, hoping that Gabriel would come to her. But he was deluged with members of the audience, including several officious art historians.</p><p>(For it was considered brash if not egotistical for a mere literature professor to analyze the crown jewels of the Uffizi\u2019s collection.)</p><p>Reluctantly, she trailed behind him as several members of the media plied him with questions. She caught his eye, and he gave her a tight, apologetic smile before posing for pictures.</p><p>Frustrated, she wandered around some of the adjoining rooms, admiring the paintings until she arrived at one of her favorites, Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Annunciation. She was standing close, too close really, noting the detail in the marble pillar, when a voice sounded in her ear in Italian.</p> <p>\u201cYou like this painting?\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up into the eyes of a man with black hair and very tanned skin. He was taller than her, but not overly, and was of a muscular build. He wore a very expensive black suit, with a single red rose pinned to his lapel. She recognized him as one of the guests who sat behind her during the lecture.</p><p>\u201cYes, very much,\u201d she responded in Italian.</p><p>\u201cI have always admired the depth that da Vinci gives to his paintings, particularly the shading and detail on the pillar.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and turned back to the painting. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was studying, along with the feathers on the angel\u2019s wings. They\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman bowed. \u201cPlease allow me to introduce myself. I am Giuseppe Pacciani.\u201d</p><p>Julia hesitated, for she recognized his last name. He shared it with the man suspected of being Florence\u2019s most famous serial killer.</p><p>The man appeared to be waiting for her to respond to his greeting, so she suppressed the urge to run.</p><p>\u201cJulia Mitchell.\u201d She extended her hand in a polite gesture, but he took her by surprise when he grasped it between both of his hands and drew it to his lips, looking up at her as he kissed it.</p><p>\u201cEnchanted. And may I say that your beauty rivals that of La Bella Simonetta. Especially in light of this evening\u2019s lecture.\u201d</p><p>Julia averted her eyes and swiftly removed her hand.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to provide you with a drink.\u201d He quickly flagged down a waiter and took two champagne flutes from his tray. He clinked their glasses together and toasted their health.</p><p>Julia sipped the Ferrari spumante gratefully, as it gave her a distraction from his intense stare. He was charming, but she was wary of him, not least because of his name.</p><p>He smiled at her hungrily.</p><p>\u201cI am a professor of literature at the university. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI study Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, il Poeta. My specialization is Dante, also. Where do you study? Not here.\u201d His eyes wandered from her face to her body to her shoes, before traveling to her face again.</p><p>She took a generous step back. \u201cAt the University of Toronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! A Canadian. One of my former students is studying there right now. Perhaps you are acquainted.\u201d He stepped closer.</p><p>Julia elected not to correct him about her citizenship and stepped back once again. \u201cToronto is a large university. Probably not.\u201d</p><p>Giuseppe smiled, showing very straight white teeth that glinted strangely in the museum light.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Piero di Cosimo\u2019s Perseus Frees Andromeda?\u201d He gestured to one of the adjacent paintings.</p><p>Julia nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are Flemish elements in his work, do you see? Also, notice the figures standing in the crowd.\u201d He gestured to a grouping on the right side of the painting.</p><p>Julia stepped to one side so she could take a better look. Giuseppe stood beside her, a good deal too close, watching her study the painting.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I prefer Botticelli.\u201d Stubbornly, she kept her eyes on the painting, hoping he would tire of standing closer to her and move away.</p><p>(Preferably across the Arno.)</p><p>\u201cAre you a student of Professor Emerson\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Julia swallowed noisily. \u201cNo. I\u2014I study with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is considered to be good by North American standards, which is why he was invited here. However, his lecture was an embarrassment. How did you come to discover Dante?\u201d</p><p>Julia was about to argue with Giuseppe about his characterization of the lecture, when he reached out to touch her hair.</p><p>She flinched and immediately retreated, but his arms were long and his hand followed her. She opened her mouth to reprove him when someone growled nearby.</p><p>Giuseppe and Julia turned their heads slowly to see Gabriel, sapphire eyes flashing, hands on hips, flaring out his open suit jacket like the plumes of an angry peacock.</p><p>He took a menacing step closer.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve met my fidanzata. I suggest you keep your hands to yourself, unless you\u2019re prepared to lose them.\u201d</p><p>Giuseppe scowled before his face smoothed out into a polite smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve been speaking for several minutes. She never mentioned you.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t wait for Gabriel to rip Giuseppe\u2019s arms from his sockets, thus sullying the Uffizi\u2019s pristine floors with his blood. Instead, she stood between the two men and placed a hand on Gabriel\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, this is Professor Pacciani. He\u2019s also a Dante specialist.\u201d</p><p>A look passed between the two men, and Julia realized that Pacciani was the man who\u2019d rudely interrupted Gabriel\u2019s lecture by muttering and coughing.</p><p>He lifted his hands in mock surrender.</p><p>\u201cA thousand apologies. I should have realized from the way you looked at her during your...speech that she was yours. Forgive me, Simonetta.\u201d His eyes moved to hers and rested there, his mouth parting in a sneer.</p><p>At the sound of his sarcasm, Gabriel took a step closer, his fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cDarling, I need to find somewhere to put my glass.\u201d Julia shook her empty champagne flute, hoping it would distract him.</p><p>Gabriel took the glass and handed it to Pacciani. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know where to put this.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Julia\u2019s hand and quickly pulled her away. The guests parted like the Red Sea in front of them as they made their way through the Botticelli room.</p><p>Julia saw person after person stare at them and she blushed even more deeply.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He led her into the adjoining tiled corridor and began walking toward the end of it, far beyond earshot of the other guests. Pushing her into a dark corner, he positioned her between two large marble statues perched high atop plinths. She was dwarfed by the towering forms.</p><p>He grabbed her purse and tossed it aside. The sound of the leather hitting the floor echoed down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing with him?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes flamed, and his cheeks were slightly red, which for him was a rare occurrence.</p><p>\u201cWe were just making small talk before he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled her into a searing kiss, one hand tangling in her hair and the other sliding down her dress. The force of the contact propelled her until she felt the cold wall of the Gallery against the naked skin of her upper back. His hard body aligned with hers forcefully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see another man\u2019s hands on you again.\u201d</p><p>He parted her mouth roughly, penetrating with his tongue, while his hand slid over the curve of her backside, massaging the flesh with his fingers.</p><p>Julia realized instantly that he\u2019d been careful with her every other time he\u2019d touched her. He wasn\u2019t careful now. Part of her was inflamed, desperate for him. Another part of her was wondering what he would do if she said stop...</p><p>He lifted her left leg, pulling her thigh around his hip and pressing against her.</p> <p>She felt him through the fabric of her dress, hearing the silk taffeta rustle like a breathless woman. The dress clearly wanted more.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to make you mine?\u201d he groaned, mouth against mouth.</p><p>\u201cI am yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, it seems.\u201d He tugged her lower lip backwards into his mouth, nipping it with his teeth. \u201cDidn\u2019t you understand my lecture? Every word, every painting was for you.\u201d His hand slid up her dress, teasing the skin of her thigh until it reached the string that stretched across her hip.</p><p>He pulled back to see her face. \u201cNo garters tonight?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s this?\u201d His fingers tugged at the very thin string.</p><p>\u201cPanties,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His eyes glinted in the semi-darkness. \u201cWhat kind of panties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thong.\u201d</p><p>He smiled dangerously before pressing his lips to her ear. \u201cAm I to assume that you wore this for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly for you. Always.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Gabriel lifted her, pressing her against the cold wall. His lips on her neck, he pushed their hips closer. The long, thin heels of Julia\u2019s tangerine stilettos caught the curves of his ass. He fixed her with wild, blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want you. Right now.\u201d</p><p>With one hand, he tugged at the string until it tore. Suddenly, she found herself bare. He reached back to stuff the thong in his jacket pocket, and her heels shifted, digging into his ass so much that he winced.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how difficult it was for me to control myself after the lecture? How I longed to take you in my arms? Conducting small talk was torture when all I wanted was this.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could see how sexy you are with your back against the wall and your legs wrapped around me. I want you like this, except I want you panting my name.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dipped his tongue in the hollow at the base of her throat and Julia\u2019s eyes closed. Her passions were struggling with her mind, which urged her to push him away and take a moment to think. In a mood such as this, Gabriel was dangerous.</p><p>All of a sudden, Julia heard voices echoing down the hallway. Her eyes flew open.</p> <p>The sound of footsteps and merry laughter grew closer. Gabriel lifted his head, bringing his mouth to her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound,\u201d he whispered. She could feel his lips curve up into a smile as they pressed against her.</p><p>The footsteps stopped a few feet away, and Julia heard two male voices conversing in Italian. Her heart continued to race as she strained her hearing for any sign of movement. Gabriel kept stroking her gently, swallowing her sounds with his mouth. From time to time, he\u2019d whisper sensual things to her\u2014phrases that made her flush.</p><p>One of the male voices laughed loudly. Julia lifted her head in surprise, while Gabriel took that opportunity to kiss her throat, nibbling at the delicate skin.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t bite me.\u201d</p><p>The murmuring voices echoed around them. It took a moment, but eventually the import of her words sliced through his aroused, frantic state. He lifted his face from her neck.</p><p>With their chests pressed so tightly together, he could feel her heart. He closed his eyes, as if entranced by its staccato rhythm. When he opened them again, most of the fire was gone.</p><p>Julia had carefully concealed Simon\u2019s bite mark with makeup, but Gabriel found it with his finger, tracing its perimeter lightly before kissing it. He exhaled slowly, very slowly, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only woman who has ever said no to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying no.\u201d</p><p>He looked over his shoulder and spied two older gentlemen, deep in conversation. They were close enough to see him if they looked in his direction.</p><p>He turned back to Julia and gave her a sad smile. \u201cYou deserve better than a jealous lover taking you against a wall. And I\u2019m not in favor of being caught by our host. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her and traced below her swollen lower lip with his thumb, removing the slight smear of crimson lipstick from her pale skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to undo the trust I saw in your eyes last night. When I\u2019m in my right mind and we have the museum all to ourselves...\u201d His expression darkened as he fantasized. \u201cAnother time, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>He removed her heels from his backside and placed her on her feet, leaning over to straighten the skirt of her dress. The taffeta rustled breathlessly at his touch and then forlornly, was silent.</p><p>Fortunately, Dottore Vitali and his companion chose that moment to return to the party, their footsteps growing fainter and fainter as they walked away.</p><p>\u201cThe banquet is supposed to begin shortly. I can\u2019t insult them by leaving. But when I get you home...\u201d His eyes fixed on hers. \u201cThe wall just inside our room will be our first stop.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, relieved that he wasn\u2019t angry anymore. Truthfully, she was somewhat nervous but very excited about the prospect of wall sex.</p><p>He adjusted himself through his trousers and buttoned up his suit jacket, willing his body to calm. He tried to smooth his hair but only succeeded in making it look more like he had dragged his lover into a dark corner for museum sex.</p><p>Museum sex is a peculiar compunction of certain academics. (But it should not be disdained without trying it.)</p><p>Julia fixed his hair and straightened his tie, checking his face and collar for lipstick. When she was finished, he picked up her clutch and her sweater, handing them to her with a kiss. Smirking, he adjusted her panties in his suit pocket so they were no longer visible.</p><p>She took an experimental step forward, finding the absence of her panties surprisingly liberating.</p><p>\u201cI could drink you like champagne,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She reached up on tiptoe to kiss his cheek. \u201cI wish you\u2019d teach me your tricks of seduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you will teach me how to love as you love.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel escorted her through the empty corridor and down the stairs to the first floor, where the banquet was just beginning.</p><p>Professor Pacciani stumbled back to his apartment by the Pitti Palace in the wee hours of the morning. This was not an unusual occurrence.</p><p>He fumbled with his keys, cursing as he dropped them, and entered the flat, closing the door behind him. He walked to the small room in which his twin four-year-old sons were asleep, kissing them before shuffling to his study.</p><p>He smoked a leisurely cigarette as he waited for his computer to boot up, then he logged into his email. He ignored his inbox and composed a short message to a former student and lover. They had not been in contact since her graduation.</p><p>He mentioned meeting Professor Emerson and his very young Canadian fidanzata. He mused that although he\u2019d been impressed with Emerson\u2019s monograph with Oxford University Press, the Professor\u2019s lecture smacked of a pseudo-intellectualism that truly had no place in a professional academic lecture. One should either be intellectual and academic, or one should be a public speaker and entertaining, but not both. Pacciani queried churlishly if this was what passed for excellence in North American universities.</p><p>He ended his email with an explicit and detailed suggestion of a prospective sexual rendezvous, possibly in the late spring. Then he finished his cigarette in the darkness and joined his wife in their matrimonial bed.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Christa Peterson had a privileged upbringing, so really, there was no excuse for her vicious nature. She had two parents who loved each other and their only daughter very much. Her father was a well-respected oncologist in Toronto. Her mother was a librarian at Havergal College, an elite, private girl\u2019s school that Christa attended from kindergarten through grade twelve.</p><p>Christa went to Sunday school. She was confirmed as an Anglican. She studied Thomas Cranmer\u2019s Book of Common Prayer, but none of these actions touched her heart. And when she was fifteen years old she discovered the immense power of female sexuality. Once she discovered it, it became not only her currency but her weapon of choice.</p><p>Her best friend, Lisa Malcolm, had an older brother called Brent. Brent was handsome. He looked like so many other graduates of Upper Canada College, a private boy\u2019s school that catered to Canada\u2019s old moneyed families. He had blond hair and blue eyes and was tall and fit. He was a rower for the University of Toronto\u2019s men\u2019s team and could easily have starred in a J.Crew commercial.</p><p>Christa had admired Brent from afar but because of the four-year age difference, he\u2019d never noticed her. But then, late one night while sleeping over at Lisa\u2019s house, Christa ran into Brent on her way to the bathroom. He\u2019d been extremely taken by her long dark hair, big brown eyes, and youthful, nubile form. He\u2019d kissed her gently in the hallway and brushed tentative fingers across her breast. Then he\u2019d taken her hand and invited her to his room.</p><p>After thirty minutes of making out and feeling one another through their clothes, he was eager to take things further. Christa hesitated, because she was a virgin, so Brent began making wild and extravagant promises\u2014gifts, romantic dates, and finally, a Baume &amp; Mercier stainless steel watch that had been a present from his parents on his eighteenth birthday.</p><p>Christa had admired his watch. She knew it well, for Brent treasured it. In truth, she wanted it almost more than she wanted him.</p><p>Brent fastened the watch on her wrist, and she stared at it, marveling at the coolness of the steel against her flesh and the way it slid easily up and down her narrow forearm. It was a token. A sign that he desired her so intensely, he was willing to give her one of his most prized possessions.</p><p>It made her feel wanted. And powerful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. But God, I want you. And I promise I\u2019ll make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>Christa smiled and let him place her on his narrow bed like an Incan sacrifice on an altar and gave her virginity up to him in exchange for a three-thousand-dollar watch.</p><p>Brent kept his word. He was gentle. He went slowly. He kissed her and softly explored her mouth. He paid homage to her breasts. He prepared her with his fingers and tested her to ensure that she was ready for him. When he entered her, he did so carefully. There was no blood. Just large hands rubbing circles on her hips and a low voice that murmured instructions on how to relax, until her discomfort disappeared.</p><p>As promised, he made her feel good. He made her feel beautiful and special. And when it was over he held her closely all night. For he was not an entirely vicious soul, driven as he was by carnal needs.</p><p>They would repeat this act many times over the next three years, despite other romantic entanglements. Before Brent entered her, he would always place a gift in her hand.</p><p>He was soon followed by Mr. Woolworth, Christa\u2019s grade-eleven Math teacher. Christa\u2019s encounters with Brent taught her much about men, how to read their wants and desires, how to tantalize and provoke, and how to string along and tease. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She teased Mr. Woolworth unmercifully until the man cracked and begged her to meet him at a hotel after school. Christa liked it when men begged. In the plain hotel room, her teacher surprised her with a silver necklace from Tiffany. He placed the delicate links around her neck and kissed her flesh softly. In exchange, Christa let him explore her body for hours until he fell asleep, exhausted and sated.</p><p>He was not as attractive as Brent, but he was far more experienced. For every subsequent gift, she would allow him to touch her in old and new ways. By the time their affair ended and Christa moved to Quebec to attend Bishop\u2019s University, she\u2019d amassed an enormous amount of jewelry and an extensive knowledge of sexual relations. Moreover, Christa had become one of few women who viewed the role of the man-eating seductress as something to emulate.</p><p>When Christa completed her master\u2019s degree in Renaissance Studies at the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze, her pattern of relationships was fixed. She preferred older men, men in positions of power. She was excited by forbidden affairs\u2014the more remote, the more improbable, the better.</p><p>She tried for two years to seduce a priest who was assigned to the Duomo in Florence, and right before graduation, she succeeded. He took her in the single bed of his tiny apartment, but before he touched her, he wrapped her long, warm fingers around a tiny icon that had been painted by Giotto. It was priceless. But so, she reasoned, was she. Christa would allow men to have her, but only at a price. And she\u2019d always bedded the men she wanted\u2014eventually.</p> <p>Until her first year of PhD coursework at the University of Toronto when she met Professor Gabriel O. Emerson. He was by far the most attractive and sensual of all the men she\u2019d ever met. And he appeared very sexual. His raw, smoldering carnality oozed from every pore. She could almost smell it.</p><p>She watched him hunt at his favorite bar. She noted his stealthy, seductive approach and the way women reacted to him. She studied him the way she studied Italian, and she put her knowledge to good use.</p><p>But he spurned her. He never looked at her body. He would gaze into her eyes coldly, as if she wasn\u2019t even female.</p><p>She began to dress more provocatively. He never glanced below her neck.</p><p>She tried to be sweet and self-deprecating. He was impatient.</p> <p>She baked him cookies and took to leaving anonymous culinary treats in his mail box at the department. The treats would remain untouched for weeks until Mrs. Jenkins, the departmental secretary, threw them into the garbage, worried about a potential infestation of vermin.</p><p>The more Professor Emerson rejected her, the more she wanted him. The more she became obsessed with having him, the less she cared about receiving gifts in trade. She would give herself to him freely if he would only look at her with desire.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>So in the fall of 2009, when she had the opportunity to meet him at Starbucks and discuss her dissertation, she was eager to see if their meeting could turn into dinner and possibly a visit to Lobby. She would be on her best behavior, but she would be alluring. Hopefully, he would stop resisting her.</p><p>In preparation for her meeting, she spent six hundred dollars on a black Bordelle chemise, along with garters and black silk stockings. She disdained the matching panties. Every time the garters pulled across the surface of her skin, she felt inflamed. She wondered how it would feel when Professor Emerson released her stockings from their bonds, preferably with his teeth.</p><p>Unfortunately for Christa, Paul and Julia had chosen to inhabit the same Starbucks at the same time. Christa knew without doubt that any impropriety on her part would be eagerly watched and noted by her fellow students. The Professor would know this too, and thus be far more professional than usual.</p> <p>So when Christa confronted Paul and Julia, she was beyond pissed. She wanted to insult the two of them so they would leave before the Professor arrived. She did her damnedest to make sure that happened. Nevertheless, her attempt at intimidating her fellow graduate students went horribly awry. Professor Emerson arrived earlier than expected and overheard her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Peterson.\u201d Gabriel pointed toward an empty table far away from Paul and Julia and indicated that Christa should follow him.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson, I bought you a venti latt\u00e9 with skim milk.\u201d She tried to hand it to him, but he waved it aside.</p><p>\u201cOnly barbarians drink coffee with milk after breakfast. Haven\u2019t you ever been to Italy? And by the way, Miss Peterson, skim milk is for wankers. Or fat girls.\u201d</p><p>He spun on his heel and walked over to the counter to order his own coffee while Christa tried valiantly to hide her rage.</p><p>Damn you, Julianne. This is all your fault. You and the monk.</p><p>Christa sat in the chair that Professor Emerson had pointed out, feeling almost defeated. Almost, for from her vantage point, she had a lovely view of Professor Emerson\u2019s ass in his gray flannel trousers. Rounded like two apples. Two ripe, delicious apples.</p><p>She wanted to take a bite out of them.</p> <p>At length, the professor returned with his own damn coffee. He sat as far away from her as possible, while still technically sitting at the same table, and gazed at her harshly.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to you about your behavior. But before I do, let me make one thing clear. I agreed to meet you here today because I desired a coffee. In the future, we will meet in the department as we normally do. Your transparent attempts at engineering social engagements between the two of us will be unsuccessful. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne word from me and you\u2019ll be finding yourself a new dissertation director.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIn the future you will address me as Professor Emerson, even when speaking of me in the third person. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Professor Emerson.\u201d Ohhhh, Professor. You have no idea how much I want to scream your name. Professor, Professor, Professor...</p><p>\u201cMoreover, you will refrain from making personal remarks about my other students, especially Miss Mitchell. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>Now Christa was beginning to seethe a little, but she kept her reaction to herself. She placed all the blame on Julia. She wanted to drive Julia out of the program. She simply wasn\u2019t sure how to do that. Yet.</p><p>\u201cFinally, anything you hear from me about another student or person connected with the university will be deemed to be confidential, and you will not repeat it or else you will find yourself another dissertation director. Do you think you are intelligent enough to comply with these very simple instructions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Professor.\u201d She bristled slightly at his condescension, but truth be told, she found his grumpiness sexy. She wanted to tease it out of him. To seduce him into doing unspeakable things to her, to\u2014</p><p>\u201cAny more abuse directed toward MA students will be brought to the attention of Professor Martin, the department chair. I believe you are well aware of the regulations governing the behavior of graduate students. I don\u2019t need to remind you about the prohibitions against hazing, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t hazing Julia, I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sniveling. And I doubt that Miss Mitchell gave you permission to use her first name. You will address her properly or not at all.\u201d</p><p>Christa bowed her head. Threats of the sort he was making were not sexy. She\u2019d worked very hard to get into the PhD program at the University of Toronto, and she wasn\u2019t about to let it all slip through her fingers. Not for some pathetic little bitch who had something cooking with the Professor\u2019s research assistant.</p><p>Gabriel saw her reaction but said nothing, slowly sipping his espresso. He felt no remorse and was beginning to wonder what else he could do to make her cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident you are well aware of the university\u2019s policies governing harassment. Those policies work both ways. Professors can file a complaint if they believe they are being harassed by a student. If you cross the line with me, I\u2019ll drag you to the Dean\u2019s Office so quickly your head will spin. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Christa lifted her chin and gazed at him with wide, frightened eyes. \u201cBut we\u2014I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing!\u201d Gabriel snapped. \u201cUnless you\u2019re delusional, you\u2019ll realize that there is no we. I won\u2019t repeat myself. You know where you stand.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Julia and Paul one last time. \u201cNow that we have dispensed with today\u2019s pleasantries, I\u2019d like to tell you what I thought about your last dissertation proposal. It was rubbish. In the first place, your thesis is derivative. In the second, you\u2019ve made no attempt to provide a literature review that comes close to being adequate. If you cannot amend your proposal to address these issues, you will need to find another director. If you choose to submit a revised proposal, you will need to do so within two weeks. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a meeting that is actually worth my time. Good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel departed Starbucks abruptly, leaving a rather shell-shocked Christa staring off into space.</p><p>She heard part of his speech, of course, but her mind was focused on other things. First, she was going to do something to get back at Julia. She didn\u2019t know what and she didn\u2019t know when. But she was going to shank that bitch (metaphorically speaking) and cut her (also metaphorically speaking).</p><p>Second, she was going to rewrite her dissertation proposal and hopefully win Professor Emerson\u2019s academic approval.</p><p>Third, she was going to redouble her efforts at seduction. Now that she had seen Professor Emerson angry, there was nothing she desired more than to see him angry with her\u2014whilenaked. She was going to change his mind. She was going to break through his harsh exterior. She was going to see him kneeling before her, begging for her, and then...</p><p>Clearly, the four-inch heels and the Bordelle lingerie weren\u2019t enough. Christa was going to head over to Holt Renfrew, and she was going to buy herself a new dress. Something European. Something sexy. Something by Versace.</p><p>Then she was going to Lobby to set her third scheme in motion...</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>In the penthouse of a boutique hotel in Florence, clothes had been tossed haphazardly across a sitting room floor, trailing like breadcrumbs from the doorway toward a wall that was no longer blank. Groans and obvious rhythms floated in the air, wafting over a man\u2019s fine handmade shoes, a black bra, a tailored suit tossed wantonly over a coffee table, a taffeta dress puddled into a Santorini-blue pool...</p><p>If one were a detective, one would notice that the lady\u2019s panties and shoes were missing.</p><p>The air was thick with the smell of orange blossoms and Aramis, mingled with the musk of sweat and naked flesh. The room was dark. Not even the moonlight streaming in from the terrace reached the wall where two nude bodies clung to one another. The man stood upright, supporting the woman, who had her legs wrapped around his hips.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s plea was punctuated by a cacophony of sound\u2014skin sliding over skin, desperate cries muffled by lips and flesh, quick gulps of oxygen, and the slight thud of Julia\u2019s back against the wall.</p><p>She could hear him as he groaned with every thrust, but her ability to speak had withdrawn as she focused on a single sensation\u2014pleasure. Every movement of her lover pleased her, even the friction between their chests and the grip of his hands as he held her aloft. She danced on the very edge of satisfaction, breathless with anticipation that the next movement would push her over.

Gabriel felt it, of course, and followed soon after; two deep thrusts and he cried her name into the crook of her neck, his body shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou worried me,\u201d he whispered afterward. He lay on his back in the center of the large, white bed while his sleepy beloved curled into his side, her head resting over the surface of his tattoo.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t open your eyes. You wouldn\u2019t speak. I was worried I was too rough.\u201d</p><p>She moved her fingers along his abdomen to the few hairs that trailed down from his navel, tracing the texture lazily.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me. It felt different this time\u2014more intense. Every time you moved, the most incredible feeling passed through me. I couldn\u2019t open my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled to himself in relief and pressed his lips to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThat position is deeper. And don\u2019t forget all our foreplay at the museum. I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off you during dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you knew I\u2019d lost my panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I want you. Always.\u201d He offered her a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cEvery time with you is better than the last,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His expression grew wistful. \u201cBut you never say my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say your name all the time. It\u2019s a wonder you haven\u2019t come up with a pet name you\u2019d rather I use, such as Gabe, or Dante, or The Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I mean you never say my name\u2014when you come.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her chin so she could see his face. His expression matched his tone, wistful and momentarily vulnerable. The confident mask had slipped.</p><p>\u201cFor me, your name is synonymous with orgasm. I\u2019m going to start calling them Emgasms.\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly, a hearty, chest-bouncing chuckle that required Julia to sit up. She joined him in his laughter, grateful that his moment of melancholy had passed.</p><p>\u201cYou have quite the sense of humor, Miss Mitchell.\u201d He tilted her chin upwards so he could worship her lips once more before relaxing into the pillows and drifting off to sleep.</p><p>Julia stayed awake a little longer as she contemplated the anxious, insecure little boy who revealed himself at rare and unexpected moments.</p><p>The following morning Gabriel treated Julia to her preferred breakfast at Caf\u00e9 Perseo, a fine gelateria in the Piazza Signoria. They sat inside because normal December temperatures had returned and it was rainy and cool.</p><p>One could sit by the square all day, every day, and watch the world walk by. There were old buildings on the perimeter\u2014the Uffizi was around the corner. There was a tremendously impressive fountain and beautiful statues, including a copy of Michelangelo\u2019s David and a statue of Perseus holding the dismembered head of Medusa in front of a lovely loggia.</p><p>Julia avoided looking at Perseus as she ate her gelato. Gabriel avoided looking at the legions of beautiful Florentine women in order to watch his beloved. Hungrily.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t like a taste? Raspberry and lemon are great together.\u201d She held out a spoon where the two flavors commingled.</p><p>\u201cOh I want a taste. But not of that.\u201d His eyes glinted. \u201cI prefer something a trifle more exotic.\u201d He nudged his espresso aside so he could take her hand in his. \u201cThank you for last night and this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one who should be thanking you, Professor.\u201d She squeezed his hand and busied herself with her breakfast, such as it was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t an outline of my body vaporized onto the wall of our room.\u201d She giggled, holding out a small spoonful of the frozen treat.</p><p>He allowed her to feed him, and when his tongue darted out to lick his lips, she found herself light-headed. A bevy of images from earlier that morning flashed through her mind. And one remained.</p><p>O gods of sex-god boyfriends who enjoy pleasuring their lovers, thank you for this morning.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cYou know, that was my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be your last. I promise.\u201d Gabriel licked his lips provocatively, eager to make her squirm.</p><p>She leaned over to give him a peck on the cheek. But he was having none of that. He snaked a hand to the back of her neck and pulled her closer.</p><p>Her mouth was sweet with gelato and the unique taste that was Julia. He groaned when he released her, wishing he could take her back to the hotel for a repeat of last night\u2019s performance, or perhaps to the museum...</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d She busied herself with her bowl so she didn\u2019t have to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say that I was your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFidanzata has multiple meanings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe primary meaning is fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRagazza doesn\u2019t express the depth of my attachment.\u201d Gabriel wiggled his toes in his new, tight shoes. His mouth twitched as he contemplated what to say next, if he should say anything at all. He elected to remain silent, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>Julia noticed what she perceived to be his physical discomfort. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about my heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the marks on your backside when you were getting dressed this morning. I didn\u2019t mean to injure you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned wickedly. \u201cOccupational hazard for those obsessed with high-heeled shoes. I wear my love scars with pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be more careful next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you damn well won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes grew wide at the sudden flash of passion in his eyes.</p><p>He captured her lips with his before whispering in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy you a pair of boots with even higher heels, then I\u2019m going to see what you can do with them.\u201d</p><p>As they strolled across the Ponte Vecchio under a shared umbrella, Gabriel persisted in pulling her into shop after shop, trying to tempt her into accepting an extravagant gift of jewelry\u2014Etruscan reproductions, Roman coins, gold necklaces, etc. But she would only smile and decline, pointing to Grace\u2019s diamond earrings and saying that they were more than enough. Her lack of attachment to material things only made him want to heap them at her feet.</p><p>When they reached the center of the bridge, Julia tugged at his arm and led him to the edge so they could gaze out over the Arno.</p><p>\u201cThere is something you could buy for me, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He peered over at her curiously, the crisp Florentine air flushing her cheeks. She was goodness, light and warmth and softness. But terribly, terribly stubborn.</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>Julia paused to run her hand over the barrier that separated her from the edge of the bridge. \u201cI want my scar removed.\u201d</p><p>He was almost surprised. He knew that she was ashamed of Simon\u2019s bite mark. He\u2019d walked in on her applying concealer that morning, and she\u2019d grown teary when he asked about it.</p><p>She avoided his eyes and continued. \u201cI don\u2019t like looking at it. I don\u2019t like the fact that you have to look at it. I want it gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could find a plastic surgeon in Philadelphia, while we\u2019re home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur time at home is so short. I couldn\u2019t do that to my dad. Or to Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shifted the umbrella to his other hand and pulled her into a hug. He kissed her, trailing down to her neck until he made contact with the mark.</p><p>\u201cI will gladly do this for you and more. You just have to ask. But I would like you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like you to talk to someone. About what happened.\u201d</p><p>Julia lowered her eyes. \u201cI talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant someone who isn\u2019t an ass. I can hire a doctor who will remove the scar from your skin, but no one can remove the scars on the inside. It\u2019s important for you to realize that. I don\u2019t want you to be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be. And stop calling yourself names. It upsets me.\u201d</p><p>He conceded her point with a nod of the head. \u201cI think it would help if you had someone to talk to\u2014about everything. Tom, your mother, him, and me.\u201d He gave her a pained look. \u201cI am a difficult man. I know that. I think if you had someone to talk to, it would help.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI will, but only if you agree to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>She opened her eyes, speaking quickly. \u201cI know that you don\u2019t want to, and believe me, I understand. But if I\u2019m going to do this, you need to do it too. You were really angry last night, and even though I know you weren\u2019t angry with me, I had to bear the brunt of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to make up for it afterward.\u201d He gritted his teeth.</p><p>She reached up to stroke his agitated jaw. \u201cOf course. But it bothered me that you were so upset over an unsolicited pass from a stranger. And that you thought that sex would relieve your anger and mark me as yours.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face registered shock, for he had never interpreted his actions in that way.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d He squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked upset, and the panic in his eyes didn\u2019t abate when Julia reached up to pet his hair a little.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re quite a pair, aren\u2019t we? With our scars and histories and all our problems. A tragic romance, I suppose.\u201d She smiled and tried to make light of their situation.</p><p>\u201cThe only tragedy would be losing you,\u201d he said, kissing her lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only lose me if you stop loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lucky man then. I\u2019ll be able to keep you forever.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her once more before wrapping his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cTherapy was required when I went into rehab. I continued meeting with a therapist for a year or so afterward, in addition to going to weekly self-help meetings. It isn\u2019t as if I haven\u2019t gone down that road.\u201d</p><p>Julia frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re in recovery and you don\u2019t go to meetings. I haven\u2019t said much about it before, but that\u2019s a serious problem. On top of that, you still drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a cocaine addict, not an alcoholic.\u201d</p><p>She paused, searching his eyes. It was as if she\u2019d uncovered an old medieval map that outlined the edge of the world with the words here there be dragons.</p><p>\u201cWe both know that Narcotics Anonymous strongly suggests that addicts don\u2019t drink.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAs much as I will try to help, some things are beyond me. As much as sex with you pleases me, I don\u2019t want to become your new drug of choice. I can\u2019t fix things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think? That I use sex to fix things?\u201d His question was in earnest, and so Julia resisted the urge to respond with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cI think that you used to use sex to fix things. You said as much to me once, remember? You used sex to combat your loneliness. Or to punish yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A dark shadow passed over Gabriel\u2019s features. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like that with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when a person is upset, old patterns of behavior emerge. It\u2019s true of me too, except my coping mechanisms are different.\u201d She kissed him softly but long enough for his panic to recede and for him to kiss her back.</p><p>When they pulled apart they stood wrapped around one another until Julia decided to break the silence. \u201cYour lecture last night reminded me of something.\u201d She pulled her phone from her purse and quickly scrolled through some pictures. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He took the phone from her hand and gazed at an exquisite painting. In it, St. Francesca Romana cradled an infant child with the assistance of the Virgin Mary, while an angel looked on.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d He returned her phone.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLook at the painting.\u201d</p><p>He did. And the strangest feeling passed over him.</p><p>She began to speak in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this painting. I thought it was because there are similarities between Gentileschi and Caravaggio. But it\u2019s more than that. St. Frances lost some of her children to the plague. This painting is supposed to portray one of her visions of what happened to those children.\u201d</p><p>She searched Gabriel\u2019s eyes to see if he grasped her meaning. But he hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I look at this painting, I think of your baby, Maia. Grace is holding her, surrounded by angels.\u201d Julia pointed to the figures in the painting. \u201cSee? The baby is safe and loved. That\u2019s what Paradise is like. You don\u2019t have worry.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up into his face. His pained, beautiful face. Gabriel had tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I was trying to comfort you.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his neck, gripping him tightly.</p><p>Eventually, he wiped at his eyes. He hid his face in her hair, feeling grateful and relieved.</p><p>The following afternoon, the rain stopped. So the couple took a taxi up to the Piazzale Michelangelo, which provided a sweeping view of the city. They could have taken a city bus like regular people, but Gabriel was not like regular people.</p><p>(Few Dante specialists are.)</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Rachel say in her email?\u201d he asked as they admired the tiled roof of the Duomo.</p><p>Julia fidgeted with her fingernails. \u201cShe and Aaron said hello. They wanted to know if we were happy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThey said that Scott had a girlfriend. That was about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for Scott.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWas there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head to one side. \u201cBecause I can tell when you\u2019re hiding something.\u201d</p><p>He began to run his fingers up and down the soft flesh at her waist, a particularly ticklish spot.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to do that in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes I am.\u201d He grinned and began moving his fingers with purpose, trying to tickle her.</p><p>She started giggling and trying to wriggle out of his grasp, but he held her close.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Julianne. Tell me what Rachel said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop tickling,\u201d she gasped, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stilled his hands.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cShe wanted to know if we\u2019d, um, slept together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d His lips turned up into a half-smile. \u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the truth.\u201d</p><p>He searched her eyes. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she hoped you were behaving yourself and that I was happy. And I said yes\u2014on both counts.\u201d She waited for a moment, thinking about whether or not she should mention the email from a certain Vermont farm boy.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something else. Go ahead.\u201d He was still smiling indulgently.</p><p>\u201cWell, Paul emailed me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day of your lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention this before?\u201d he fumed.</p><p>\u201cBecause of this.\u201d She gestured to the irritation visible on his face. \u201cI knew it would upset you, and I didn\u2019t want to do that when you had to speak in front of a room full of important people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that you passed Christa\u2019s dissertation proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wished me a Merry Christmas and said that he was sending something to me in Selinsgrove.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s my friend. It\u2019s probably maple syrup, which I will gladly give to my dad. Paul knows that I have a boyfriend and that I am very, very happy. I\u2019ll forward the email to you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s lips thinned visibly.</p><p>Julia crossed her arms in front of her chest. \u201cYou were eager to have me spend time with Paul when Professor Pain was around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different. And I don\u2019t particularly wish to discuss her ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You don\u2019t keep running into people I\u2019ve slept with.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glared.</p><p>Julia clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was a terrible thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you may recall, I have run into at least one person with whom you\u2019ve been sexually involved.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked away, approaching the edge of the lookout. She gave him a moment or two to himself, then she stood beside him and cautiously wrapped her little finger around his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cThank you for rescuing me from Simon.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cYou know that I have a past. Do you intend to keep bringing it up?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze to her shoes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remark was beneath you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He kept his eyes trained on the city that was spread out before them. Red tiled roofs shone in the sun, while Brunelleschi\u2019s dome dominated the view.</p><p>Julia decided to change the subject. \u201cChrista was behaving strangely at your last seminar. She seemed resentful. Do you think she knows about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sour because I haven\u2019t welcomed her outrageous advances. But she met the deadline for her revised proposal and her work was acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she wasn\u2019t\u2014blackmailing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every woman is your rival for me,\u201d he snapped, pushing away her hand.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cThat remark was beneath you.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, the anger seemed to seep out of him. His shoulders slumped. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not waste our time together arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. But I don\u2019t like the idea of Paul emailing you. Although I suppose you could be friends with worse persons.\u201d Gabriel sounded unusually prim.</p><p>She smiled and pressed her lips to his cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s the Professor Emerson I know and love.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his phone so he could take her picture against the background of the beautiful view. Julia was laughing, and he was taking picture after picture when his phone began to ring. The not so dulcet tones of London\u2019s Big Ben sounded between them.</p><p>Julia gave him a challenging look.</p><p>He grimaced and pulled her into an intense kiss. He cupped her face with his hand, determinedly parting her lips with his own and gently slipping his tongue inside.</p><p>She kissed him back, wrapping her arms around his waist to pull him closer. And all the while, Big Ben chimed.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to answer it?\u201d she finally got a chance to ask.</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you earlier, I wasn\u2019t going to speak to her.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to Julia\u2019s once again, but only briefly.</p><p>\u201cI feel sorry for her,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she created a child with you. Because she still wants you, but she\u2019s lost you. If I were to lose you to someone else, I\u2019d be devastated.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel huffed impatiently. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to lose me. Stop that.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled weakly. \u201cUm, I need to say something.\u201d</p><p>He moved back.</p><p>\u201cThis is coming from my concern for you. I want you to know that.\u201d She looked at him in earnest. \u201cI feel sorry for Paulina, but it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s been holding what happened over your head in order to keep you in her life. I\u2019m wondering if she gets into trouble just so you\u2019ll rescue her. I think it\u2019s time for her to develop an emotional attachment to someone else. Someone she can fall in love with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she can\u2019t be happy until she lets you go? You let her go and you found me. It would be a mercy on your part for you to let her go so she can find her own happiness.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded grimly and kissed her forehead but refused to say anything more on the subject.</p><p>The rest of their stay in Florence was a happy one, a counterfeit honeymoon of a sort. They frequented various churches and museums during the day, in between returns to their hotel, where they would make love sometimes slowly and sometimes madly. Every evening Gabriel would choose a different restaurant for dinner, and they would walk home afterward, pausing on one of the bridges to make out like teenagers in the cool evening air.</p><p>On their last evening in Florence, Gabriel took Julia to Caff\u00e9 Concerto, one of his favorite restaurants, which was positioned on the banks of the Arno. They spent several hours over a multi-course dinner, leisurely talking about their holiday and their burgeoning sexual relationship. They both confessed that the past week had been an awakening of sorts\u2014for Julia, an awakening to the mysteries of eros; for Gabriel, an awakening to the mysteries of the four loves intertwined.</p><p>In conversation, he finally revealed his surprise. He\u2019d rented a villa in Umbria for their second week of holidays. He promised to take her to Venice and Rome on their next vacation, possibly in the summer after they visited Oxford.</p><p>After dinner, Gabriel led her one last time to the Duomo. \u201cI need to kiss you,\u201d he whispered, pulling her body close to his.</p><p>She was going to reply, she was going to tell him to take her to the hotel and mark her body in a deeper way, but she was interrupted.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful lady! Some money for an old man...\u201d A voice called to her in Italian from the front steps of the Duomo.</p><p>Unthinkingly, Julia leaned around Gabriel to discover who was speaking. The man continued, begging for money so he could buy something to eat.</p><p>Gabriel caught her arm before she could approach the steps. \u201cCome away, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s hungry. And it\u2019s so cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police will come around and carry him off. They don\u2019t like panhandlers in the city center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are free to come and sit on the steps of a church. Sanctuary...\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cThe medieval concept of sanctuary no longer exists. Western governments abolished it, starting with England in the seventeenth century.\u201d Gabriel grumbled as she opened her purse and withdrew a twenty Euro note. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo much?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I have. And look, Gabriel.\u201d She gestured to the man\u2019s crutches.</p><p>\u201cA clever ruse,\u201d he complained.</p><p>Julia fixed her lover with a very disappointed look. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be hungry.\u201d She took a step in the beggar\u2019s direction but Gabriel pulled her back.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll spend the money on wine or drugs. It isn\u2019t going to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven a drug addict deserves a little kindness.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel flinched.</p><p>She looked over at the beggar. \u201cSt. Francis of Assisi didn\u2019t make his charity conditional. He gave to whoever asked.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rolled his eyes. There was no way he was going to win an argument with Julianne when she invoked St. Francis. No one could win against that kind of argument.</p> <p>\u201cIf I give him something, he will know that someone cared enough to help him. No matter what he does with the money that will be a good thing. Don\u2019t deprive me of an opportunity to give.\u201d She tried to step around Gabriel but he blocked her path. He took the bill from her hand and added something to it from his own pocket, then he handed the money to the beggar.</p><p>The two men had a quiet exchange in Italian, and the poor man blew kisses to Julia and tried in vain to shake Gabriel\u2019s hand.</p><p>He retreated, taking her arm and leading her away.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to thank the angel for her mercy.\u201d</p><p>Julia stopped him so she could kiss at his frown until it morphed into a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the angel he was referring to,\u201d he growled, kissing her in return.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The next morning, a limousine met the happy couple at the train station in Perugia. The driver conveyed them down the winding roads to an estate near Todi, a medieval village.</p><p>\u201cIs this the villa?\u201d Julia was in awe as they traveled up the long, private drive to what looked like a mansion on a hill. It was a three-story stone structure that sat on several acres of land dotted with cypress and olive trees.</p><p>As they drove, Gabriel pointed out a large mixed-fruit orchard that in warmer weather grew figs, peaches, and pomegranates. Nestled beside the villa was an infinity pool surrounded by a bed of lavender. Julia could almost smell the fragrance from inside the car, and she vowed at that moment to gather a few sprigs to perfume the sheets of their bed.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d He searched her face eagerly, hoping that she would be pleased.</p><p>\u201cI love it. When you said you were renting a villa, I didn\u2019t think it would be so opulent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till you see inside. They have a fireplace and a hot tub on the upstairs balcony.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a bathing suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about needing a bathing suit?\u201d He moved his eyebrows suggestively, and Julia laughed.</p><p>A black Mercedes sat in the driveway so they could visit the neighboring villages, including Assisi, which was a destination of particular interest for Julia.</p><p>The housekeeper of the villa had stocked the kitchen with food and wine in anticipation of their arrival. Julia rolled her eyes when she discovered several bottles of imported cranberry juice in the pantry.</p><p>Professor Gabriel \u201cOverprotective\u201d Emerson strikes again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, settling his hands on her waist as they stood together in the large, fully equipped kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried you wouldn\u2019t like being in the middle of Umbria. But I thought it would be good for us to spend some quiet time together.\u201d</p><p>Julia arched an eyebrow. \u201cOur times together usually aren\u2019t quiet, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you drive me mad with desire.\u201d He gave her an impassioned kiss.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay in tonight. We can cook together, if you like, and maybe relax by the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d She kissed him once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry the luggage upstairs while you explore the house. The hot tub is on the terrace just outside the master bedroom. I\u2019ll meet you there in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>She acquiesced with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, and, Miss Mitchell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clothes for the rest of the evening.\u201d</p><p>She squealed and scampered up the stairs.</p><p>Not only was the house tastefully decorated in various shades of cream and white, but it boasted a very romantic master bedroom on the second floor that was punctuated by a canopy bed. Julia found herself trying the bed out just for a moment before taking her toiletry case into the washroom.</p><p>She unpacked her makeup and placed her shampoo and bath gel in the large, open shower. She pinned her hair up and took off all her clothes, wrapping herself in an ivory towel. She\u2019d never skinny dipped before, but she was looking forward to it.</p><p>As she folded her clothes and placed them on the vanity, she heard music coming from the bedroom. She recognized the song \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d by Norah Jones. Gabriel thought of everything.</p><p>His voice outside the bathroom door reconfirmed that. \u201cI brought up some antipasti and a bottle of wine, in case you\u2019re hungry. See you outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d she called.</p><p>Julia looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyes were bright with excitement, and her cheeks were a healthy pink. She was in love. She was happy. And she was (she thought) about to christen the hot tub with her beloved underneath a darkening Umbrian sky.</p><p>On her way to the terrace, she saw Gabriel\u2019s discarded clothes hanging over the back of a chair. The cold evening breeze wafted in through the open door, ruffling her hair, making the pink of her skin pinker still. Gabriel was naked and waiting for her.</p><p>She walked out onto the terrace and waited until she had his complete attention. Then she dropped the towel.</p><p>Near Burlington, Vermont, Paul Virgil Norris was wrapping Christmas presents at his parents\u2019 kitchen table: presents for his family, for his sister, and finally, for the woman for whom his heart pined.</p><p>It was, perhaps, surprising to see a two-hundred-pound rugby player with bolts of Christmas wrap and Scotch tape, painstakingly measuring before he put scissors to paper. A bottle of maple syrup, a stuffed toy Holstein, and two figurines were proudly arranged in front of him. The figurines were a curiosity, something he\u2019d found in a comic book store in Toronto. One was supposed to be Dante, dressed as a crusading soldier with St. George\u2019s cross on his chain mail chest, while the other was a blond-haired, blue-eyed anachronism of a Beatrice in the garb of a medieval princess.</p><p>Sadly, the toy company neglected to make a Virgil action figure. (Virgil, apparently, was not worthy of action.) Paul begged to differ, and so he decided to write to the toy company to alert them to their regrettable oversight.</p><p>He wrapped each item carefully and placed them in a cardboard box with bubble wrap. He signed a Christmas card with a few words, trying desperately to sound casual in order to disguise his growing feelings, and taped the box shut, neatly addressing it to Miss Julianne Mitchell.</p><p>After a very enjoyable time in the hot tub, Gabriel prepared an Umbrian dinner. Bruschetta con pomodoro e basilico, tagliatelle with olive oil and black truffles from the villa\u2019s estate, and a cheese course with local artisan cheeses and bread. They ate their fill, laughing and drinking a fine white wine from Orvieto in the candlelight. After dinner, Gabriel made a nest of blankets and pillows on the floor in front of the living room fireplace.</p><p>He plugged his iPhone into the sound system so they could continue enjoying his Loving Julianne playlist. Then he took her into his arms as they sat on the floor, finishing their wine, while the sounds of medieval chant swirled around their heads. They were naked, wrapped in blankets, and unashamed.</p><p>\u201cThe music is beautiful. What is it?\u201d She closed her eyes as she focused on the female voices, which were singing a cappella.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Gaudete\u2019 by The Mediaeval Baebes. It\u2019s a Christmas song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the name for a music group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very talented. I saw them live the last time they came to Toronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smirked at her. \u201cAre you jealous Miss Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My arms are full. Completely.\u201d</p><p>Their talking ceased against the backdrop of celestial voices as their kisses began. Soon their bodies were tangling naked next to the fire.</p><p>In the glow of the orange flames, Julia pushed Gabriel down on his back and straddled his hips. He grinned as he let her lead, welcoming her newfound confidence. \u201cIt isn\u2019t so scary, being on top, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m more comfortable with you now. I think the wall sex back at the hotel shook loose my inhibitions.\u201d</p><p>He wondered silently what other inhibitions he could shake loose with various kinds of sex\u2014shower sex, for example. Or perhaps, the holy grail of domestic coupling\u2014kitchen table sex.</p><p>Her voice interrupted his thoughts. \u201cI want to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. So much.\u201d</p><p>She reached a hand behind her and lightly touched the top of his groin. \u201cWith my mouth. I feel badly that I haven\u2019t been able to reciprocate. You\u2019ve been so generous.\u201d</p><p>His body reacted to her low whisper and hesitant hand. \u201cJulianne, there\u2019s no quid pro quo here. I do things with you because I want to.\u201d His lips curled up into a half-smile. \u201cBut since you\u2019re offering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know men prefer it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGreat sex will always be better. In comparison, everything else could only be an amuse bouche.\u201d He winked at her wickedly, squeezing her hip for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cIs this position okay? With you lying down or...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered, his eyes suddenly alight.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s better than me on my knees.\u201d She watched his reaction from the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I, on the other hand, am happy to kneel before my Princess in order to pleasure her. As I have already demonstrated.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed softly. Then her smile disappeared. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>He gazed up at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI have a gag reflex.\u201d</p><p>A furrow appeared between his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019d be worried if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julianne avoided his probing expression as her hand slipped lower. \u201cMine is kind of strong.\u201d</p><p>His hand closed over hers.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be an issue, darling. I promise.\u201d He squeezed her hand.</p><p>She moved farther down, and he began to weave her hair around his fingers, tugging playfully.</p><p>Julia froze.</p><p>For an oblivious moment, he toyed with her long, silken hair. Then he realized that she wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hold my head down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d He sounded perturbed.</p><p>She remained perfectly still, waiting. For what, he didn\u2019t know. He let go of her hair so he could lift her chin. \u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s only because Idon\u2019twanttothrowuponyou.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014thrown up\u2014before.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her incredulously. \u201cWhat...after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel was silent for some time, then his eyes narrowed. \u201cWere you sick because of a gag reflex, or because that bastard held you down?\u201d</p><p>She cringed, her head moving in the slightest of nods.</p><p>Gabriel swore, his anger burning blue. He sat up swiftly, rubbing his face with his hands.</p><p>In the past, he hadn\u2019t been tender with his sexual conquests, although he\u2019d prided himself on maintaining some vestige of good manners. Less so when he was doing cocaine. Despite the Bacchanalia that he\u2019d participated in, parties that had approximated the decadence of Rome on occasion, he\u2019d never, ever held a girl\u2019s head down until she vomited. Nobody did that. Not even the drug dealers and addicts he used to hang around with did that, and they had no boundaries or moral compunctions at all. Only an incredibly sick, twisted, misogynistic motherfucker would get his kicks from humiliating a woman that way.</p><p>To do such a thing to Julianne\u2014with her gentle eyes and beautiful soul. A shy creature who was ashamed of having a gag reflex. The senator\u2019s son was lucky he was hiding in his parents\u2019 house in Georgetown under a suspended sentence and a restraining order, or Gabriel would have appeared on his doorstep in order to continue their previous altercation. And he would have ended their conversation with more than a few punches.</p> <p>He shook the murderous thoughts from his head, lifting Julia to her feet and wrapping her in a blanket. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t sit here after what you just told me.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s cheeks reddened with shame, and her large eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Gabriel pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault. Do you understand? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>She smiled thinly, but it was clear that she didn\u2019t believe him.</p> <p>He led her upstairs and through the bedroom to the en-suite, ushering her in before closing the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, something nice.\u201d He traced the curve of her cheek with his thumb.</p><p>Gabriel turned on the shower, testing the temperature of the water until he was satisfied. He adjusted the flow until it was gently falling from the tropical rain showerhead. He slowly removed the blanket from her body and held the shower door open, waiting for her to step inside before he followed her.</p><p>She looked confused.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you that I love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWithout taking you to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cThen our evening won\u2019t be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur evening isn\u2019t ruined,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be damned if anyone hurts you again.\u201d He used both hands to caress her hair, parting and moving it so every strand grew wet.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar from it.\u201d He took her hand and pressed it over the tattoo on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the closest thing to an angel I\u2019ll ever touch.\u201d His eyes held hers without blinking. \u201cBut I think we both need to wash away the past.\u201d</p><p>He moved her hair to one side, pressing a kiss to her neck. Stepping back, he poured some of her vanilla-scented shampoo into his palm. His fingers worked the liquid into her scalp, rubbing slowly, and eventually sliding down the locks to the ends. He was careful in his movements. If he ever had one moment, one act, to demonstrate that his love for her was much deeper than a sexual infatuation, now was that moment.</p><p>As Julia began to relax, she thought back to one of the few happy memories she had of her mother. She was a little girl and her mother washed her hair in the bathtub. She remembered the two of them laughing. She remembered her mother smiling.</p><p>Having Gabriel wash her hair was far better. It was a deeply affectionate, deeply intimate experience. She was naked before him, as he washed away her shame.</p><p>He was naked too, but was careful not to crowd her, or to allow his slightly embarrassed arousal to brush up against her. This was not about sex. This was about making her feel loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so emotional.\u201d Her voice was quiet.</p><p>\u201cSex is supposed to be emotional. You don\u2019t have to hide your feelings from me.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her waist, hugging her. \u201cI feel very deeply about us as well. These past few days have been the happiest of my life.\u201d</p><p>He rested his chin on her shoulder. \u201cYou were shy when you were seventeen, but I don\u2019t remember you being so wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have dumped him the first time he was cruel.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t stand up for myself and things got worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI stayed with him. I held onto the times when he was charming or thoughtful, hoping the bad times would disappear. I know that what I told you made you sick, but believe me, Gabriel, no one could be as disgusted with me as I am with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d he groaned, turning her to face him. \u201cI\u2019m not disgusted with you. I don\u2019t care what you did; no one deserves to be treated that way. Do you hear me?\u201d His eyes flamed a brilliant, dangerous blue.</p><p>She covered her face with her hands. \u201cI wanted to do something for you. But I couldn\u2019t even get that right.\u201d</p><p>He pulled at her wrists, lowering her hands. \u201cListen to me. Because we love each other, everything between us, including sex, is a gift. Not a right, or an entitlement or an exaction\u2014a gift. You have me now. Let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still hear his voice in my head.\u201d She brushed away a stray tear.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head, shifting them so they stood in the center of the downpour, the hot water spilling over them. \u201cDo you remember what I said in my lecture about Botticelli\u2019s Primavera?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSome people think that Primavera is about sexual awakening\u2014that part of the painting is an allegory for an arranged marriage. At first, Flora is a virgin and she\u2019s afraid. When she\u2019s pregnant, she appears serene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Zephyr raped her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel clenched his jaw. \u201cHe did. He fell in love with her afterward and married her, transforming her into the goddess of flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a very good allegory for marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d He swallowed noisily. \u201cJulia, even though some of your sexual experiences were traumatic, you can still have a fulfilling sexual life. I want you to know that you\u2019re safe when you\u2019re in my arms. I don\u2019t want you to do anything you don\u2019t enjoy, and that includes oral sex.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wrapped an arm around her waist, watching the hot water as it traveled over their naked bodies before splashing to the tile at their feet. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been sleeping together for a week. We have our whole lives to love each other, in multiple ways.\u201d</p><p>He silently and lovingly soaped the nape of her neck and across her shoulders with a sponge. Then he traced the lines of her shoulders and the individual bumps of her spine, pausing regularly to place his lips where the soap had been rinsed away.</p><p>He washed her lower back and the two little dimples that marked the transition to her backside. Without hesitation, he soaped each cheek and massaged the backs of her legs. He even washed her feet, grasping her hand and placing it on his shoulder to steady her as he soaped between her toes.</p><p>Julia had never felt more cared for in her life.</p><p>He attended the front of her neck and the slope of her shoulders. He washed and caressed her breasts with his hands, putting the sponge to one side as he kissed them. Then he was gently touching between her legs, not sexually but reverently, rinsing the suds that accumulated among her dark curls and finally pressing his mouth there as well.</p><p>When he was finished, he took her into his arms and kissed her like a shy teenager, chastely and simply. \u201cYou are teaching me to love, and I suppose I\u2019m teaching you to love too, in a way. We aren\u2019t perfect, but we can have happiness. Can\u2019t we?\u201d He pulled back so he could read her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Gabriel clutched her to his heart and buried his face in her neck as the water rained down on them.</p><p>Emotionally exhausted, Julianne slept until noon the following day. Gabriel had been so kind, so loving. He\u2019d foregone what Julia had always thought was a man\u2019s basic need\u2014oral sex\u2014and given her what could only be described as a cleansing of shame. Gabriel\u2019s love and acceptance had its intended, transformative effect.</p><p>As she opened her eyes, she felt lighter, stronger, happier. Carrying the secrets of how he humiliated her had proved to be a very heavy burden. With the weight of guilt lifted, she felt like a new person.</p><p>She thought it was probably blasphemous to compare her experience with that of Christian in The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, but she saw an important resemblance between their respective deliverances. Truth sets one free, but love casts out fear.</p><p>In her twenty-three years, Julia hadn\u2019t realized how pervasive grace was and how Gabriel, who considered himself to be a very great sinner, could be a conduit of that grace. This was part of the divine comedy\u2014God\u2019s sense of humor undergirding the inner workings of the universe. Sinners participated in the redemption of other sinners; faith, hope, and charity triumphed over disbelief, despair, and hatred, while the One who called all creatures to Himself watched and smiled.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Gabriel awoke in the middle of their last night in Umbria to an empty bed. Dazed, in a semi-dreamlike state, he extended his arm to Julianne\u2019s side. The sheets held no warmth.</p><p>He swung his legs to the floor, wincing as his bare feet touched the cold stone. He pulled on a pair of boxer shorts and made his way downstairs, scratching at his bed-mussed hair. The light was on in the kitchen, but no Julianne. A half-drunk glass of cranberry juice sat on the counter next to a remnant of cheese and a crust of bread. It looked as if a mouse had been there for a nocturnal feeding but had been surprised and scurried off.</p><p>Walking into the living room, he saw a dark head resting on the arm of an overstuffed chair next to the fireplace. In sleep, Julianne looked younger and very peaceful. Her skin was pale, but her cheeks and lips had a rosy hue. Gabriel would have loved to compose a poem about her mouth and resolved to do so. In fact, her appearance reminded him of Frederick Leighton\u2019s Flaming June. She was clad only in an elegant ivory silk nightgown. One of the thin straps had fallen off her right shoulder, leaving the beautiful curve bare.</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t help himself as the pale, smooth skin called out to him. He kissed her shoulder and crouched near her head, floating a hand over her hair and petting her softly.</p><p>She stirred and opened her eyes, blinking twice before smiling at him.</p><p>Her slow, sweet smile set his heart aflame. He actually felt his breathing speed. He\u2019d never felt this way about anyone before, and the depth of feeling she drew from him consistently surprised him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he whispered, smoothing her hair away from her face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried when I reached for you and you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came down to get a snack.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows knit together, and he rested his hand lightly on the top of her head. \u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this before.\u201d He traced a finger across the neckline of her nightgown, skimming the tops of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI bought it for our first night together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Why haven\u2019t you worn it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wearing all those things you bought me in Florence. What did the clerk call them? Basques and body suits? Your taste in women\u2019s lingerie is surprisingly old-fashioned, Professor Emerson. Next you\u2019ll be buying me a corset.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled and kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll remember to look for one. You\u2019re right, I tend to favor items that leave more to the imagination. It makes the unwrapping so much more enjoyable. But you\u2019re equally lovely in everything and nothing.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached over to touch his face and pulled him close for a deeper kiss. She dragged her lips across his jaw line until she was whispering in his ear. \u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand and led him past the kitchen table, exchanging a saucy smirk with him before walking upstairs. She moved him to sit on the edge of the canopied bed while she stood before him, pausing.</p><p>She pushed the straps of her nightgown over her shoulders. It pooled at her ankles, leaving her naked.</p><p>In the semi-darkness of the room, he drank in her tempting curves. \u201cYou are an argument for God\u2019s existence,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour face, your breasts, your beautiful back. St. Thomas Aquinas would have had to add you as his Sixth Way if he\u2019d ever been blessed enough to see you. You must have been designed and not merely made.\u201d</p><p>Julia lowered her eyes and blushed.</p><p>He smiled at her pink cheeks. \u201cAm I making you shy?\u201d</p><p>As if in answer, she took a step closer and pulled one of his hands so it cupped her breast.</p><p>He squeezed her softly. \u201cLie beside me and I\u2019ll hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to love me.\u201d</p><p>He divested himself of his boxer shorts and moved so she could join him. Still cupping her breast, he began to kiss her, gently tangling his tongue with hers.</p><p>\u201cI breathe you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re everything. You\u2019re the air.\u201d He teased her breasts with his fingers and planted gentle kisses down her neck, feathering up and down while she urged him on with confident fingers.</p> <p>Julia pushed him to recline on his back and straddled his hips. He kissed between her breasts and took one of her nipples in his mouth as his hand glided across the surface of her skin, moving down to test her.</p><p>He released her breast in order to shake his head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you too. But I want to set your body on fire, first.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s desire was countered by Gabriel\u2019s commitment to see that each of their sexual encounters was pleasurable for both of them. He\u2019d rather delay entrance and satisfaction until she was mad with want, rather than speed along before her body was sufficiently aroused.</p><p>When they finally came together, she looked down into open blue eyes, their noses only a whisper apart. She moved atop him painstakingly slowly, her eyes closing as she focused on the pleasurable sensation, before opening again. It was an intense connection. Dark blue, heavy with emotion, gazed up unblinkingly into wide chestnut. Every movement, every yearning was reflected between the couple\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He nuzzled her with his nose as she gradually increased her pace.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u2014\u201d Her last word was interrupted by a low moan.</p><p>She reached down to catch his mouth as her movements sped. Their tongues explored one another, groans and confessions interrupting their connection. He touched her ribs and smoothed over her waist. He slipped his hands under the curve of her bottom so he could lift her slightly, increasing his leverage.</p><p>She\u2019d become addicted to this, to him. She adored the way he looked at her in these intimate moments and the way in which the world fell out of focus around them. She longed to feel him loving her, moving inside her, for he always made her feel beautiful. She would have said that any orgasm was an extra gift in addition to the way she felt when they were conjoined.</p><p>Making love, like music or breathing or the tempo of one\u2019s heartbeat, was based on a primordial rhythm. Gabriel had come to read her body and to know the pace that matched it, like a glove that fits a lady\u2019s hand. It was the sort of knowledge that was at once personal and primary, the kind of knowledge King James\u2019s translators had been referring to when they wrote of Adam knowing his wife. The mysterious sacred knowledge that a lover had for his beloved\u2014knowledge that was perverted and maligned in less holier couplings. Knowledge that deserved a marriage in more than name.</p><p>Julia put her new knowledge to good use, delighting Gabriel with her body again and again. And the way it felt when he was inside her\u2014warm and thrilling and tropical and perfect.</p><p>He was close, oh, so close. He searched her expression and saw that her eyes were opened. Every motion of hers was reciprocated by him. Every motion brought both of them pleasure.</p><p>As they stared, a great moan erupted from her chest, and then in a twinkling instant she was throwing her head back and calling his name. It was a glorious thing for him to see and hear. Julianne finally called his name. Soon he was falling, groaning aloud as his body tensed and then released, the veins in his forehead and neck straining and relaxing.</p><p>A joyful, tender coupling.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to let him go. She didn\u2019t want to feel him leave her body, and so she curled on top of him, watching his expression.</p><p>\u201cWill it always be like this?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel kissed her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But if Richard and Grace were any indication, it will only improve with time. I\u2019ll see the reflection of all our shared joys and experiences in your eyes, and you will see the same in mine. Our history will make it better, deeper.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at what he said and nodded; then her face grew sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about what will happen next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t get accepted into the PhD program at Toronto?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you applied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave me either, but Julianne, the Toronto program is not for you. You\u2019d have no one to work with. I can\u2019t supervise you, and I doubt Katherine would take on a multi-year commitment.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s countenance fell.</p><p>Gabriel stroked her cheek with his finger. \u201cI thought you wanted to go to Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a short flight.\u201d He looked at her thoughtfully. \u201cWe can see each other on weekends and holidays. I applied for a sabbatical. It\u2019s possible that I could come with you for the first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there for six years. Or more.\u201d She was close to tears now. Gabriel saw them swimming and shimmering in her eyes and his heart ached.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work,\u201d his voice grew rough. \u201cRight now, we need to enjoy the time we have together. Let me worry about the future. I\u2019ll make sure we aren\u2019t separated.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, but he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cThe advantage to dating an older, more established man is that he can give you room to focus on your own career. I\u2019ll find a way to make my job fit around yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be grossly unfair to expect you to give up your dream of being a professor or to have you enroll in a program that is subpar. I won\u2019t let you sacrifice your dreams for me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNow kiss me, and let me know that you trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel held her in his arms, sighing as she rested her head on his chest.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Christa Peterson sat in her parents\u2019 house in north Toronto, checking her email a few days before Christmas. She\u2019d been ignoring her inbox for a week. A relationship she had cultivated in addition to her pursuit of Professor Emerson had run its course, which meant that she wouldn\u2019t be skiing in Whistler, British Columbia, with her erstwhile lover over the Christmas holidays.</p><p>The banker in question had broken up with her via text message. This was in poor taste, to be sure, but what would be in even poorer taste would be the follow-up email that was sure to be waiting for her, like a ticking bomb lurking in her inbox.</p><p>Having steeled herself with a glass or two of vintage Bollinger champagne, which she had purchased as a gift for the schmuck who was supposed to take her skiing, she checked her account. And there, sitting in her email, was a bomb. However, it was not the bomb she\u2019d expected.</p><p>To say that she was surprised by the content of Professor Pacciani\u2019s email would have been an understatement. In fact, she felt as if the rug had been pulled out from under her.</p><p>The only Canadian woman she had ever seen Professor Emerson show even restrained affection to was Professor Ann Singer. Yes, Christa had seen Emerson with various women at Lobby, but never the same woman twice. He was friendly with other female professors and staff, but only professionally so, greeting them always and only with a firm handshake. Professor Singer, in contrast, was rewarded with a double kiss when he greeted her after his last public lecture.</p><p>Christa did not want to rekindle her relationship with Professor Pacciani. He was sorely lacking in a particular physical respect, and she had no wish to return to the previous intimate encounters that had always left her frustrated and wanting. She had standards, after all, and any man who did not measure up to at least the size of her personal service accessory was not worth screwing.</p><p>(And she would have said you could quote her.)</p><p>Since she wanted more information about Professor Emerson\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, she feigned interest in a spring rendezvous with Professor Pacciani and subtly asked for the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s name. Then she went downstairs and finished off the rest of the champagne.</p><p>The day before Christmas found Julia sitting at the counter of Kinfolks restaurant in Selinsgrove, having lunch with her father. Gabriel was doing some last minute shopping with Richard while Rachel and Aaron drove to the grocery store to pick up the turkey. Scott was still in Philadelphia with his girlfriend.</p><p>Tom had faithfully delivered Julia\u2019s gift from Paul. She\u2019d placed it on the floor at her feet, and now it was staring up at her, begging for attention like a puppy.</p><p>She opened it, deciding it was better to display its contents to her father than to her boyfriend. She gave the bottle of maple syrup to Tom with a smile, she giggled at the toy Holstein and kissed it, but when she unwrapped the Dante and Beatrice figurines her face grew pale. It was almost as if Paul knew. And yet, he couldn\u2019t have known that Gabriel and Julia were Dante and Beatrice, at least to each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Tom ate his blue plate special\u2014turkey with stuffing and mashed potatoes\u2014Julia opened Paul\u2019s card. It displayed children engaged in a snowball fight and the typical Merry Christmas emblazoned on the front. But it was the words that Paul wrote in his own hand that brought a lump to her throat.</p><p>Merry Christmas, Rabbit.</p><p>I know it was a rough first semester and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do a better job of helping you when you needed it. I\u2019m proud of you for not quitting. With a big Vermont hug</p><p>from your friend, Paul.</p> <p>P.S. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard Sarah McLachlan\u2019s \u201cWintersong,\u201d but part of it made me think of you.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t know the song that he was referring to, so the lyrics he omitted did not run through her mind as she examined the card\u2019s artwork more closely. In the center of the image of a snowball fight stood a little girl with long, dark hair in a bright red coat, laughing.</p><p>The quotation, the picture, the card, the gift\u2014Paul had tried to keep his feelings secret, she thought, but he\u2019d betrayed himself. It was all in the picture of the laughing girl and the song that she would listen to later.</p><p>Julia sighed and placed everything back in the box and set it at her feet.</p><p>\u201cSo, Gabriel treating you right?\u201d Tom broached the topic of Julia\u2019s relationship in between bites of turkey.</p> <p>\u201cHe loves me, Dad. He\u2019s very good to me.\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head as he reflected on how Simon had had the appearance of being good and Gabriel had the reality of being good\u2014and how he had failed to recognize the difference.</p><p>\u201cYou let me know if he isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, tasting the mashed potatoes.</p><p>Julia almost rolled her eyes. Yes, it was a bit late for Tom to play the part of the overprotective father, but better late than not at all.</p><p>\u201cWhen Gabriel and I drove into town this morning we went by the house. I saw the sign on the lawn.\u201d</p><p>Tom wiped his mouth on a napkin. \u201cI put it up for sale a couple of weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I can\u2019t live in a place where my daughter doesn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you grew up in that house. What about you and Deb?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and hid his expression behind a cup of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tom sipped his coffee stoically. \u201cWe had a difference of opinion. And her kids don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Julia fidgeted with her silverware, lining them up so their ends were even.</p><p>\u201cSo Deb sided with Natalie and Simon?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time coming. Truth is, I\u2019m relieved. It feels good to be a free agent.\u201d He winked at her conspiratorially.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking to buy a smaller house. I\u2019d like to use some of the money I make to pay for your education.\u201d</p><p>Julia was surprised. Then she was angry. Her conflict with him had cost her and her father so much\u2014too much to be remedied by a criminal record and some community service. She was scarred and her father lost his prospective wife and the Mitchell family home.</p><p>\u201cDad, you should use the money for your retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be enough for everything. And if you don\u2019t want to use my money for school, then use it to buy beer. From now on, it\u2019s just you and me kid.\u201d He reached out a hand to ruffle Julia\u2019s hair, his preferred gesture of affection.</p><p>He excused himself to use the men\u2019s room, leaving her alone to contemplate her half-eaten cheeseburger and her changed father. She was deep in thought, fingering the glass of ginger ale in front of her, when someone moved to occupy the stool next to her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jules.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Julia turned and found her former roommate, Natalie Lundy, sitting next to her.</p><p>There was a time when Julia had laughingly called her former friend Jolene, for her beautiful and voluptuous features perfectly matched those described in the song. But that was before Natalie had betrayed her. Now her beauty seemed harsh and cold.</p><p>As Julia stared at her, she noticed something painful about the way she was dressed\u2014the vintage designer coat with the slightly frayed cuffs, the expensive boots that were worn and second-hand. On first glance, she looked rich and well dressed. But Julia glanced twice and saw what others could not see\u2014the small town girl who was ashamed of her blue collar roots and wished to leave them far behind.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Natalie. What can I get for you?\u201d Diane, the waitress, leaned over the counter.</p><p>Julia watched as Natalie transformed from cold and sullen to cheerful and sunny, slipping into the local accent.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Diane. I\u2019ll just have coffee. I can\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>The waitress smiled and poured coffee, then moved to wait on a group of Tom\u2019s fellow volunteer firemen at the far end of the counter. As soon as her back was turned, Natalie\u2019s demeanor changed. She glared at Julia with hate-filled eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to say that I want to hear.\u201d Julia moved to stand, but Natalie subtly gripped her wrist.</p><p>\u201cSit down and shut up, or I\u2019ll make a scene.\u201d Her voice was low, barely above a whisper. She smiled artificially. No one would know by looking at her that she was threatening Julia, who swallowed noisily and sat back down.</p><p>Natalie released her arm with a punishing squeeze. \u201cWe need to talk about Simon.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes darted toward the men\u2019s room, hoping that her father would reappear.</p><p>Natalie continued. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that your recent misunderstanding with Simon was unintentional. You were upset; he said some things he shouldn\u2019t have, you called the police.</p><p>\u201cBecause of that misunderstanding, Simon now has a criminal record. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to explain why that record needs to disappear before he runs for state Senate. You need to fix the misunderstanding. Today.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiled and flipped her hair behind her shoulder, acting as if she and Julia were engaged in a friendly conversation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do,\u201d Julia mumbled. \u201cHe\u2019s already plea-bargained.\u201d</p><p>Natalie took a sip of her coffee. \u201cDon\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m stupid, Jules. I know that. Obviously, you need to tell the District Attorney that you lied. Explain that it was a lover\u2019s quarrel gone awry, you got your revenge, and now you feel bad about having made the whole thing up.\u201d She laughed a little too loudly. \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t understand how anyone believed that Simon could be interested in you. Look at you, for God\u2019s sake. You\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p><p>Julia bit back a harsh retort, deciding prudentially that silence was best.</p><p>Natalie leaned toward her, pulling the crewneck of Julia\u2019s sweater away from her throat with icy fingers. She examined Julia\u2019s neck carefully.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a mark on you. Show the D.A. your neck and tell him you lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Julia moved out of Natalie\u2019s reach, resisting the urge to show her the bite that she\u2019d slathered with concealer that morning. She pulled her sweater further up her neck, pressing a hand over the place where Simon had bitten her. It was a phantom pain, she knew, but she could still feel where his teeth had broken skin.</p><p>Natalie dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not asking\u2014I\u2019m telling you.\u201d She pulled her BlackBerry out of her large handbag and placed it on the counter between them. \u201cI hoped I wouldn\u2019t have to do this, but you leave me without a choice. I have pictures of you that Simon took. They\u2019re very...colorful.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes darted to the phone. She tried to swallow, but her mouth went dry. With a shaking hand, she lifted her glass to her lips, frantically trying not to spill her drink.</p><p>Natalie smiled, clearly enjoying the torture she was able to inflict on her former rival. She snatched up the cell phone eagerly, scrolling through the pictures. \u201cI could never figure out how he set up the shots without you knowing. Or maybe you knew but didn\u2019t care.\u201d She tilted her head to one side, narrowing her eyes at Julia. \u201cDo you care if everyone in Selinsgrove sees these pictures on the internet?\u201d</p><p>Julia scanned the eyes of the townspeople around them, hoping they hadn\u2019t heard Natalie\u2019s threat. At least no one was looking in their direction. Her first instinct was to run, to hide. But that strategy hadn\u2019t saved her from her mother when she was younger. Her mother always found her. It hadn\u2019t saved her from Simon, either. He\u2019d been stopped only because Gabriel hit him back.</p><p>Julia was tired of hiding. She felt her spine stiffen.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s record is your fault. He came to see me to get the pictures. But you\u2019ve had them all along.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiled sweetly, but didn\u2019t deny the accusation.</p><p>\u201cNow you want me to clean up your mess. But I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d</p><p>Natalie laughed. \u201cOh yes, you are.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the screen again, making a show of bringing it close to her eyes. \u201cGod, your tits are small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Senator Talbot wants to run for President?\u201d Julia blurted.</p><p>Natalie tossed her hair behind her shoulder. \u201cOf course I know. I\u2019m going to work for the Senator\u2019s campaign.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave Natalie a long look. \u201cNow I understand. Simon\u2019s record will be a problem for the Senator, so you need it to go away. You screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you release those photos, Simon will dump you so fast your head will spin. And you\u2019ll never get out of this town.\u201d</p><p>Natalie waved a dismissive hand. \u201cHe won\u2019t dump me. And the Senator will never know about the pictures.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her heart beginning to race. \u201cIf I\u2019m in those pictures, Simon is too. What will the Senator think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of a little program called Photoshop? I can edit Simon out and edit someone else back in. But I won\u2019t have to because you\u2019re going to be a good little girl and do the right thing. Aren\u2019t you, Jules?\u201d</p><p>Natalie flashed a patronizing smile as she placed her BlackBerry back in her purse and stood to leave, but Julia stopped her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never introduce you to his parents. He told me that. You can do better than being Simon\u2019s dirty secret.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s expression faltered, then hardened. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s going to give me exactly what I want and so are you. If you don\u2019t fix this problem today, I\u2019m posting the pictures online. Enjoy your Christmas.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk away but Julia called after her. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Natalie paused, looking at her former friend with undisguised contempt.</p><p>Julia took a deep breath and gestured to Natalie to come closer. \u201cTell Simon to make sure the Senator renews his subscription to The Washington Post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you release those pictures, I\u2019ll call Andrew Sampson at the Post. You remember him, don\u2019t you? He wrote an article last year about Simon\u2019s DUI arrest and how the Senator intervened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natalie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Julia clenched her fists stubbornly. \u201cIf you release the pictures, I have nothing to lose. I\u2019ll tell the newspapers that Simon assaulted me, then sent the girl he keeps on the side to blackmail me.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s green eyes grew very wide then narrowed into serpentine slits.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Natalie stared in furious surprise before setting her teeth. \u201cPeople have been walking all over you for years and you\u2019ve done nothing. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to call up a reporter and spill your guts.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her chin, fighting to keep her voice steady. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m tired of being walked over.\u201d She shrugged dramatically. \u201cIf you release the pictures, you\u2019ll never work for the Senator\u2019s campaign. You\u2019ll just be part of an embarrassing scandal they\u2019ll sweep under the rug.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s ivory skin flushed a deep, dark red.</p><p>Julia took advantage of her silence and continued. \u201cLeave me alone, and I\u2019ll forget about both of you. But I\u2019m never going to lie about what he did to me. I\u2019ve lied to cover for him too many times, and I\u2019m not doing it anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just angry that Simon chose me over you,\u201d Natalie spat, her voice becoming louder. \u201cYou were this pathetic, weak little girl who didn\u2019t even know how to give a decent blow job!\u201d</p><p>In the awkward silence that ensued, Julia realized that the other restaurant patrons had stopped talking. She looked around the room, utterly humiliated, as the townspeople stared. Everyone heard Natalie\u2019s crude revelation, including the Baptist minister\u2019s wife, who sat with her teenaged daughter in a quiet corner drinking tea.</p><p>\u201cNot so tough now, are you?\u201d Natalie hissed.</p><p>Before Julia could respond, Diane suddenly appeared at the counter. \u201cNatalie, go on home. You can\u2019t come into my restaurant and talk like that.\u201d</p><p>Angrily, Natalie withdrew a few steps but not before muttering a few choice curse words. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her chin. \u201cOh, yes, it is. You\u2019re too smart to jeopardize your future by doing something stupid. Go back to him and leave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie stared daggers at her before turning on her heel and storming out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tom suddenly appeared behind Julia. \u201cJules? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, Diane told him an extremely sanitized account of what happened.</p><p>Tom cursed and put his hand on his daughter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded reluctantly before running to the ladies\u2019 room. She wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d ever be able to face the townspeople after what Natalie had shouted. Fighting nausea, she grabbed the top of the vanity for support.</p><p>Diane followed Julia into the washroom. She dampened some paper towels with cold water and handed them to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jules. I should have slapped her upside the head. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d talk that kind of trash in my place.\u201d</p><p>Julia was quiet as she slowly wiped her face.</p><p>\u201cHoney, nobody heard a thing that girl had to say. It\u2019s noisy out there and everyone is talking about how the Santa Claus over at the mall got drunk on his lunch hour yesterday and tried to make out with one of the elves.\u201d</p> <p>Julia cringed.</p><p>Diane smiled at her sympathetically. \u201cYou want me to make you a cup of tea or something?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head and inhaled deeply as she tried to compose herself.</p><p>If any god is out there listening, please give all the people in Kinfolks restaurant amnesia, just concerning the past fifteen minutes.</p><p>A short time later she reassumed her place at the counter, next to her father. She kept her head down, refusing to make eye contact with anyone. It was too easy to imagine the entire restaurant whispering her sins and judging her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>He frowned and asked Diane for a fresh cup of coffee and a jelly doughnut. \u201cWhat are you sorry about?\u201d His voice was gruff.</p><p>Diane served them, patting Julia\u2019s arm sympathetically, and moved to wait on some tables in order to give them some privacy.</p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault\u2014Deb, Natalie, the house...\u201d She didn\u2019t want to cry, but somehow the tears welled up and she couldn\u2019t stop them. \u201cI\u2019ve embarrassed you in front of the whole town.\u201d</p><p>Tom leaned toward her. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to hear that kind of garbage. You have never embarrassed me. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d His voice broke slightly and he began coughing. \u201cIt was my responsibility to protect you, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia wiped a tear away. \u201cBut now your life is ruined.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that attached to my life anyway. I\u2019d rather lose the house and Deb than lose you. There\u2019s no contest. None.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the jelly doughnut in front of her and waited until she took a bite. \u201cWhen I met your mother, I was happy. We had a few good years together. But the best day of my life was the day you were born. I always wanted a family. I\u2019m never going to let anything or anyone separate me from my family again. You\u2019ve got my word on that.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled up into her father\u2019s face, and he leaned over and ruffled her hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to swing by Deb\u2019s place to talk to her about what just happened. She needs to explain to her daughter how to behave in public. Why don\u2019t you phone that boyfriend of yours and ask him to pick you up? I\u2019ll see you at Richard\u2019s house later on.\u201d</p><p>Julia agreed and wiped her tears away. She didn\u2019t want Gabriel to see her crying.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Tom cleared his throat roughly, without looking at her. \u201cMe too. Now finish your doughnut before Diane starts changing us rent.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Gabriel was only too glad to cut his Christmas shopping short. When he and Richard arrived at the restaurant, they walked over to the counter to join the Mitchells.</p><p>Julia stood up and hugged Gabriel tightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the Christmas blues.\u201d Julia noticed uncomfortably that some of the restaurant patrons were still staring.</p><p>\u201cWhat Christmas blues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d She began to tug him toward the door.</p><p>Richard took a moment to greet Tom, and while the two old friends were talking, Gabriel gently swept Julia\u2019s hair behind her ear in order to whisper something sweet.</p><p>A sudden flash caught Richard\u2019s attention\u2014Grace\u2019s earrings. Clearly, he\u2019d underestimated his son\u2019s new relationship. He knew that Grace would be happy that their son gave her earrings to Julia. Grace loved Julia liked a daughter and always considered her part of their family. Perhaps someday Gabriel would make Julia part of their family officially...</p><p>Gabriel and Tom exchanged polite greetings, and Gabriel picked up Julia\u2019s Christmas gift from Paul. To his credit, he resisted the urge to say something snide and carried the box without comment.</p><p>As the trio approached the door, Officer Roberts walked in. She was wearing her uniform.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jamie.\u201d Gabriel smiled, but his body tensed.</p><p>\u201cHi, Gabriel. Home for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>She greeted Julia and Richard, and turned back to Gabriel, noticing the way Julia\u2019s arm was tucked into his elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou look good. You look happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I am.\u201d He smiled genuinely.</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Julia and Gabriel thanked her and quietly exited the restaurant, reflecting privately on the way forgiveness made certain burdens lighter.</p><p>As they walked through the front door of the Clark house, Gabriel was plotting with Richard to enjoy Scotch and cigars on the patio. Julia was still feeling a little shell-shocked from her confrontation with Natalie, but she was so relieved to be home that she pushed all thoughts of her afternoon aside. She disappeared into the living room while Gabriel and Richard hung up their coats.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart? Can I take your jacket?\u201d Gabriel called. When she didn\u2019t answer, he followed her.</p><p>His next question died in his throat as he skidded to a stop. His beloved Julianne was frozen like a statue, staring at a woman who was sitting in the living room with Aaron and Rachel. Instinctively, Gabriel gripped Julia\u2019s waist and drew her backward to his chest.</p><p>He watched as the woman rose gracefully from her seat and floated over to them. She moved like a ballerina or a princess, a subtle air of old money clinging like perfume to her every movement.</p><p>She was tall, almost the same height as Gabriel, with long, straight blond hair and large, ice-blue eyes. Her skin was flawless, and she was model thin except for her generous and perfect breasts. She wore knee-high black suede stiletto boots, a black wool pencil skirt, and a pale blue cashmere sweater that hung provocatively off of her alabaster shoulders.</p><p>She was beautiful. And imperious. She took one look at the way Julia was tucked under Gabriel\u2019s arm and arched her back like a Russian blue cat.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, darling. I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d Her voice was rich and clear, with just a hint of a British accent. She embraced him tightly.</p><p>Julia wriggled away from them, none too keen to engage in a group hug.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d A myriad of emotions flashed across Gabriel\u2019s face as she pressed her full pink lips to both of his cheeks.</p><p>She kissed him slowly, oozing sensuality. To add insult to injury, she wiped her lipstick stain from his skin, chuckling softly as if it were a private joke.</p><p>His eyes fled to Julia\u2019s, and she returned his gaze, eyes tinged with disappointment.</p><p>Before he could say anything, Richard cleared his throat and stepped forward. She brushed his proffered hand aside and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cRichard. A pleasure as always. I was so sorry to hear about Grace.\u201d</p><p>He graciously accepted her embrace and walked over to Julia to assist her with her coat. After he\u2019d hung it up, he quietly persuaded Aaron and Rachel to join him in the kitchen, denying Paulina her audience.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had two sisters.\u201d She acknowledged Julia\u2019s existence with a frosty smile. She towered over Julia, who was wearing plain flat shoes, jeans, and a black cardigan. Beside her, Julia felt dowdy and small.</p><p>\u201cI have only one sister and you know it,\u201d Gabriel snapped. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Julia came to herself and bravely extended her hand, before Gabriel made a scene. \u201cI\u2019m Julia. We spoke on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Paulina kept a tight rein on her facial expression, but Julia saw what she was attempting to conceal\u2014the cold flames of resentment.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she laughed artfully. \u201cSurely you can\u2019t expect me to keep track of all the girls who\u2019ve answered Gabriel\u2019s phone over the years. Unless you were one of the girls I spoke with when I interrupted a m\u00e9nage? Remember that night, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>Julia withdrew her hand as if she\u2019d been smacked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI expect an answer to my question,\u201d Gabriel spoke, his voice stiff and cold as a frozen lake. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Julia tried to step away. The verbal picture Paulina had painted repulsed her, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could stomach the answer, whatever it might be. Gabriel caught Julia\u2019s arm, pleading with her with his eyes not to flee.</p><p>\u201cI came to see you, of course. You wouldn\u2019t return my calls, and Carson said that you\u2019d be with your family.\u201d Paulina sounded irritated.</p><p>\u201cAre you on your way to Minnesota?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know my parents don\u2019t speak to me. Anyway, Gabriel, I need to talk to you.\u201d She gave Julia a venomous look. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was conscious of the fact that the kitchen was still within hearing range of the living room. He took a step closer to Paulina, his voice hovering above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to remind you that you are a guest. I won\u2019t tolerate your disrespect for anyone, especially Julianne. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never treated me like a guest when you were in my mouth,\u201d Paulina muttered, eyes flashing.</p><p>Julia inhaled sharply, her stomach rolling. If she\u2019d met Paulina a few weeks ago, the encounter would have been awkward and uncomfortable. But meeting her now, after having spent hours in Gabriel\u2019s bed, was incredibly painful.</p> <p>Paulina knew what it was like to be intimate with him. She knew his sounds, his smell, the look on his face when he climaxed. She was taller, more sophisticated, and far more beautiful. And it was clear that unlike Julia, she had no hesitation about performing oral sex. Furthermore, and far more damaging, she\u2019d created a child with Gabriel, something he was now unable to do with anyone else.</p><p>Julia tore herself from Gabriel\u2019s grasp, turning her back on the former lovers. She knew it would be better if she and he maintained a united front. She also knew it would be better to stand her ground rather than retreat. But her spirit had taken a beating at Kinfolks restaurant, and she no longer had the energy to fight. Emotionally exhausted, she shuffled up the stairs without a backward glance.</p><p>Gabriel watched her walk away, and he felt his heart plummet to the soles of his feet. He wanted to go after her, but there was no way he was going to leave Paulina alone with his father and sister. He excused himself for a moment, disappearing into the kitchen to tell Rachel that Julia had fallen ill and to ask if she would check on her.</p><p>Rachel climbed the staircase and found Julia exiting the washroom on the second floor. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>When Rachel obligingly opened the door to Gabriel\u2019s old room, Julia disdained it and walked across the hall to enter the guest room. Rachel watched as her friend slowly removed her shoes, placing them on the rug next to the bed.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get you an aspirin or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that woman? And why is she here?\u201d</p><p>Julia spoke through clenched teeth. \u201cYou need to ask your brother.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s hand tightened on the doorknob. \u201cI will. But the fact that I don\u2019t know who she is tells me something. She can\u2019t have been very important if Gabriel never brought her home.\u201d She turned to leave. \u201cThat should tell you something too.\u201d</p><p>Julia reclined on the bed, hoping that sleep would take her quickly.</p><p>Gabriel walked into the kitchen three hours later and found Aaron and Rachel engaged in an argument over the correct way to make Grace\u2019s famous chicken Kiev.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you need to freeze the butter first. That\u2019s the way your mom used to do it.\u201d Aaron sounded exasperated.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know? She didn\u2019t say anything about freezing the butter.\u201d Rachel gestured to the recipe card.</p><p>\u201cGrace always froze the butter,\u201d said Gabriel, frowning. \u201cShe probably assumed everyone would know that. Where\u2019s Julia?\u201d</p><p>Rachel turned on him, wielding a very large wire whisk. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cOut. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs. Unless she decided to go back to her father\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d</p><p>Rachel turned her back on her brother and resumed beating a few eggs. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe because you went out with one of your ex-girlfriends and left her for three hours. I hope Julia dumps your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney...\u201d Aaron reproved her, touching her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She pushed his hand away angrily. \u201cGabriel, you\u2019re lucky Scott isn\u2019t here. Because he\u2019d have dragged you outside by now.\u201d</p><p>Aaron frowned. \u201cWhat about me? I could drag Gabriel outside, if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Rachel rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t. And right now, I need you to freeze the God damned butter.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel muttered something unintelligible and walked away. He took his time as he climbed the stairs, trying desperately to formulate an apology that would be worthy of her.</p><p>(Not that it was possible, even with his silver tongue.)</p><p>He stood outside the door while he gathered his bearings, inhaling deeply before entering. But the bed was empty.</p><p>Puzzled, he searched the room. No Julia.</p><p>Returning to the hall, he wondered if she\u2019d sought refuge in Scott\u2019s room, but she hadn\u2019t. The bathroom, likewise, was unoccupied. His eyes alighted on the closed door of the guest room across the hall. He opened it.</p><p>Julia was lying in the center of the bed, sound asleep. He contemplated leaving her to her dreams but rejected the idea. They needed to talk, away from prying ears, and at least for the next little while his family was preoccupied.</p><p>Wordlessly, he removed his shoes and crawled into bed, spooning behind her. The surface of her skin was smooth but cool. He wrapped himself around her.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d She blinked sleepily at him. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix thirty.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone wake me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out. When I came back, Richard wanted to speak with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>He looked away guiltily.</p><p>\u201cWere you with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer driver\u2019s license is suspended because of the DUI. I dropped her off at a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you gone so long?\u201d</p><p>He paused, his expression conflicted. \u201cWe were talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking? At a hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upset about the turn her life has taken. Her appearance here was a desperate attempt to change direction.\u201d</p><p>Julia began curling in on herself, drawing her knees flush against her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he chanted, tugging her arms and knees away from her body, trying desperately to relax her defensive posture. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, and she won\u2019t be coming back. I told her again that I\u2019ve fallen in love with you. She has my money and she has my lawyers, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never been enough for her. She wants you, and she doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>He put his arms around Julia\u2019s unyielding body. \u201cI don\u2019t care what she wants. I\u2019m in love with you, and you are my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful. And sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s malicious and petty. I saw nothing beautiful in her today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a child together.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cNot by choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate sharing you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cYou will never have to share me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to share you with your past\u2014with Paulina, with Professor Singer, with Jamie Roberts\u2014with countless other women I\u2019m probably going to pass on the street in Toronto.\u201d</p><p>He set his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to protect you from such embarrassing encounters in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf I could change the past, I would. But I can\u2019t, Julianne, no matter how badly I wish I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave you what I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her body, his hand pressing down on the mattress next to her hip. \u201cIf you were thirsty and someone offered you water from the ocean, would you drink it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cBecause the water is salty and dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if someone gave you the choice between that water and a glass of Perrier, which would you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Perrier, of course. But I don\u2019t see what this has to do with her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He moved, bringing his chest to hers, kneeling in between her legs so he could press their hips together. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the comparison between you and her? This is my water.\u201d He pressed himself against her again. \u201cYou are my water. Making love with you is all I need to quench my thirst. Why would I throw this away for water from the ocean?\u201d</p><p>He moved against her as a reminder. \u201cShe has nothing to offer me.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his face so their noses were inches apart. \u201cAnd you are beautiful. Every part of you is a masterpiece, from the top of your head to the tip of your toes. You\u2019re Botticelli\u2019s Venus and Beatrice. Do you have any idea how much I adore you? You captured my heart when I first saw you, when you were seventeen.\u201d</p><p>Her body began to relax incrementally under his touch and his quiet words. \u201cHow was it left with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her dropping in on me and that she was never to do it again. She took it as well as could be expected.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was interrupted by a loud knock at the door. \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his side just as Rachel walked in.</p><p>\u201cDinner is on the table, and Tom and Scott are here. Are you two coming downstairs?\u201d She looked from her best friend to her brother and back again. \u201cDo I need to send Scott up here?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cDid he bring his girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s spending Christmas with her parents. I asked him to invite her but he gave me a big song and dance.\u201d Rachel looked annoyed. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s embarrassed by us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore likely he\u2019s embarrassed by her,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cShe\u2019s probably a stripper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessors in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u201d Rachel glared at her brother and stormed out.</p><p>Julia looked puzzled. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened. \u201cMy dear sister is less than impressed with Paulina\u2014and me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Jt was a different Christmas Eve than any of them had ever experienced. Grace\u2019s absence was felt most keenly by her husband and children, Aaron wished that he was already married, and Rachel wished that her chicken Kiev was even half as good as her mother\u2019s, frozen butter or not.</p><p>After dinner, Gabriel, Tom, and Richard retreated to the back porch to smoke cigars and drink Scotch while the rest of the family enjoyed coffee in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow was Italy?\u201d Aaron asked Julia as the two of them refilled their mugs from the coffee maker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was great. The weather was good, and we had a wonderful time. How are the wedding plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming along. When Rachel tried to rent one hundred doves to be released after the ceremony, I put my foot down. I think some of my gun-toting relatives might be tempted to shoot the damn things.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cHow are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good. Rachel has been including my mom in the wedding planning, so she\u2019s pretty excited. How are things with you and Gabriel?\u201d</p> <p>Julia hid her face as she opened the fridge to look for the cream. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for his ex showing up.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at him, and he gave her a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Aaron toyed with a teaspoon. \u201cGabriel is different when you\u2019re around.\u201d He placed the spoon on the counter and rubbed his chin. \u201cHe seems happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe makes me happy too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA happy Gabriel is about as rare as a hobbit. We\u2019re all glad to see it. As far as the ex is concerned, well, I doubt they were serious. Not like the way he is with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aaron.\u201d</p><p>The two friends exchanged a quick hug.</p><p>Later that evening, Julia and Gabriel retired to their room at a bed and breakfast. She was washing her face in the bathroom when she heard the strains of \u201cLying in the Hands of God\u201d wafting from the bedroom.</p><p>Gabriel came to stand behind her, wearing nothing but a pair of navy-blue silk boxer shorts and a smile.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t Barry White, but it\u2019s ours.\u201d He watched her for a moment or two, his expression becoming heated. He nuzzled her neck, pushing her hair aside as he fluttered his lips against her skin.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands underneath her T-shirt, exposing the flesh of her abdomen above the band of her yoga pants.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you change into one of those pretty things you bought in Toronto? Or maybe the blue basque. You know it\u2019s my favorite.\u201d His voice was low as his mouth moved seductively to her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cNot here, love. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re ready to watch us in a mirror. Although I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>When he began to remove her T-shirt, she pulled away. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his arms to his sides, watching her.</p> <p>She avoided his eyes as she went back to washing her face.</p><p>Gabriel frowned and walked away, silencing the stereo in a huff. Apart from their interlude in the Uffizi, she\u2019d never turned him down. Of course, they\u2019d only been together a little over two weeks. But still...</p><p>Professor Emerson was not used to being rejected by a lover. He was sure she had her reasons\u2014or at least one reason beginning with P and ending with A. He flopped onto the bed, bringing his arm to rest across his face. Understandably, Julianne was still upset about Paulina\u2019s reappearance. Sex would be the last thing on her mind. Not to mention the fact that something troublesome had happened to her at Kinfolks restaurant that afternoon.</p><p>Being turned down made him crave her all the more. The scent of her hair, the feel of her satin skin under his fingertips, the way she closed her eyes tightly just before she came, the sensation of her moving underneath him, with him...</p><p>He needed to make love to her to know that it was all right\u2014that they were all right.</p><p>Yes, sex was his apple a day, and he needed it. He needed to show her not with words but with actions that he loved her, worshipped her, would do anything for her. He needed to know that she still wanted him, to hear her whisper his name.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t seem to need him. Certainly, she didn\u2019t want him. Not tonight.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s depressed musings continued until she joined him in bed. She rested on her side, watching him, but he didn\u2019t acknowledge her. He simply turned off the lamp on the bedside table.</p><p>In the darkness, they were both silent as a cold and invisible barrier sat between them.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to explain something to you.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly, expelling all the air from his lungs. \u201cI understand, Julianne. Good night.\u201d He tried to keep the strain out of his voice but failed, miserably. He rolled away from her.</p><p>Julia winced. Now the invisible barrier seemed more like a high, impenetrable wall.</p><p>Men have such fragile, eggshell egos.</p><p>She wanted to explain things to him and bring everything out into the open, but if he was going to be so easily offended, then she would wait until morning. Or later. Julia rolled over and shut her eyes, determined to forget the whole miserable day. She tried to suppress her sniffles, hoping that she could hold the hormonal tears back. The last thing she wanted was for him to catch her crying.</p><p>Boys are dumb.</p><p>She sniffled for a few minutes, then Gabriel was spooning behind her, pressing his naked chest to her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded, still sniffling.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be an ass.\u201d He propped himself up on his elbow. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a repentant smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been spoiled with all the times we\u2019ve made love over the past two weeks. But I know that there will be days when you\u2019re tired or you don\u2019t feel like it. I promise not to sulk\u2014too much.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly and reached up to kiss his pouty lower lip.</p><p>He wiped her eyes. \u201cWill you tell me why you were crying this afternoon at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her until her body relaxed in his arms. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hot bath? A massage?\u201d The look on his face was one of a little boy, eager to please. \u201cLet me touch you. I\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I can barely keep my eyes open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hug me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d gladly do that anyway.\u201d He kissed her once more before spooning behind her.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>A few hours earlier, a lone woman stepped into a taxi outside the Comfort Inn. She was crying.</p><p>The cabbie politely ignored her tears and turned the radio up, hoping to give her some privacy on their long drive to Harrisburg. The song that was playing was catchy, so catchy in fact that they both found themselves humming.</p><p>As she hummed she thought of the parcel she\u2019d given to the hotel\u2019s night manager, Will. She\u2019d given him five crisp twenty-dollar bills in exchange for his promise to deliver said package to a particular address in Selinsgrove by nine o\u2019clock the following morning. Christmas morning.</p><p>When he\u2019d revealed (in typical small-town fashion) that he was acquainted with that address, having been a high school classmate of Gabriel\u2019s brother, Scott, the woman casually pressed him for information about Gabriel\u2019s new girlfriend.</p><p>Will responded enthusiastically, since his family had known Tom Mitchell and his daughter for years. In fact, Will reported, Tom had recently bragged that Julia was excelling in her graduate studies at the University of Toronto.</p><p>As soon as the woman learned this surprising fact, she decided to check out of the hotel and leave Selinsgrove. As she watched the snow-tipped trees pass by the cab\u2019s windows, she wondered how she could discover if Julianne was a student of Gabriel\u2019s when they began their affair.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Very early Christmas morning, Gabriel sat in his boxer shorts and glasses, debating whether or not to wake Julianne. He could have returned to the light of the living room of their suite, where he\u2019d played Santa Claus only an hour before. But he preferred to be near her, even in the dark.</p><p>Richard\u2019s conversation with him from the day before plagued his mind. His adoptive father had asked about Paulina, and he\u2019d said about as much on the topic as he dared, emphasizing that Paulina was his past and Julia his future. Richard, who was a compassionate man, encouraged his son to make professional counseling a necessary condition for Paulina\u2019s continued access to her trust fund, pointing out that she clearly needed help.</p><p>Once Gabriel agreed, Richard smoothly changed the subject to Julia, asking if he was in love with her. Gabriel replied unequivocally in the affirmative, to which Richard responded by bring up the R-word, responsibility.</p><p>\u201cI am taking responsibility for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a student. What if she gets pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. \u201cI thought that once. Then we had Scott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already demonstrated that I more than take care of my responsibilities.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was glacial.</p><p>His adoptive father sat back in his chair, tenting his fingers reflectively.</p><p>\u201cJulia is like Grace in several ways\u2014not least of which is her willingness to sacrifice herself for those she loves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow her to sacrifice her dreams for me, you can be assured of that.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes flickered over to the picture of his wife that he always kept on his desk, a laughing, smiling woman with kind eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did Julia react to Paulina\u2019s visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t discussed it with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you abandon Julia, you will have a serious problem with your siblings, as well as with me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows knit together like thunderous clouds. \u201cI would never abandon her. And I won\u2019t live without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell her that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve only been together for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Richard raised his eyebrows in surprise, but elected not to interrogate his son over the semantic ambiguity of the phrase \u201cbeing together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my views on this. You should marry her. At the moment, you appear to be with her under false pretenses; your actions indicate that she is only a partner in a sexual affair, when your intentions are serious.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel bristled at the characterization. \u201cJulianne is not my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t make a commitment to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am committed to her. There\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Paulina appears, looking for you and making a spectacle in front of Julia and your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help that,\u201d Gabriel snapped.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d Richard pursed his lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to believe that a woman as intelligent as Paulina would simply arrive without any hope that her overtures would be accepted.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled, but didn\u2019t bother to argue.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you make some promises to Julia? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s anxious about what the future might hold. Marriage is a sacrament that exists partially to protect women from sexual exploitation. If you take that protection away from her, then she is little more than your mistress, no matter what you choose to call her. And she has seen what happened\u2014what is happening\u2014to Paulina.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen to Julianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does she know that?\u201d Richard tapped his fingers on the top of his desk. \u201cMarriage is more than a piece of paper. It\u2019s a mystery. In fact, there\u2019s a Midrash that suggests that marriage is made in heaven between soul mates. Don\u2019t you want to be with Julia forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is immaterial. I won\u2019t rush her into making a life-changing decision in the middle of the academic year,\u201d Gabriel muttered, rubbing at his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray that you don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late,\u201d Richard countered, gazing sadly at Grace\u2019s photograph.</p> <p>With these words, then, ringing in his ears, Gabriel sat watching his soul mate sleep on Christmas morning.</p><p>As if she could hear his thoughts, she stirred, a nameless anxiety wafting over her. A moment later she rolled toward him, her fingers making contact with the silk at his hip.</p><p>In the darkness of the room, Gabriel looked like a gargoyle\u2014a gray, motionless figure that stared back at her from behind his glasses in stony silence. It took a moment for Julia to recognize him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Her face creased in puzzlement. \u201cBut you\u2019re sitting half-naked in the dark.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a tentative smile. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for you to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can open presents. But it\u2019s early. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She slid closer to him, searching for and finding his hand. She kissed the back of it and pulled it toward her heart.</p><p>He smiled and pressed his palm flat against her chest so he could feel her heart beat. His face grew serious.</p> <p>\u201cForgive me for last night.\u201d He cleared his throat roughly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that sex is all I want. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>He moved his hand to stroke her eyebrows with his fingers. \u201cI desire you, obviously. It\u2019s difficult for me not to touch you, not to want to be with you that way.\u201d</p><p>His hand floated across her cheek, hesitantly. \u201cBut I love you, and I want you to be with me because you want to be. Not because you feel obligated.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t feel obligated. There were so many times when you could have pressured me, like the night we were in your old room and I\u2014I took my top off. But you were patient. And when it was our first time, you were wonderful. I\u2019ve been lucky to have you as my lover.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sleepy smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over here? I think we could both use some rest.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel slid under the covers and cuddled close to his beloved. When her regular breathing indicated that she\u2019d fallen asleep, he whispered a few promises to her in Italian.</p><p>When Julia awoke she was treated to breakfast in bed. Then she was nagged impatiently until she agreed to accompany Gabriel to the sitting room. He was so excited he was practically bouncing.</p> <p>(In a very dignified and professorial way, of course, despite his lack of shirt.)</p><p>A small, Charlie Brown Christmas tree had been conveniently \u201cborrowed\u201d from the bed and breakfast\u2019s parlor and was placed in the center of the room. Several brightly colored parcels rested beneath it. Two large, red stockings embroidered with the names \u201cJulianne\u201d and \u201cGabriel\u201d were each sitting in a corner of the loveseat.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d He kissed her forehead, feeling very proud of himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a stocking.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the loveseat and placed the stocking in her lap. It was filled with candy and panties that had Yuletide images on them. And in the toe was a flash drive that contained video of a certain tango against the wall at the Royal Ontario Museum.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you had a stocking before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon didn\u2019t always remember Christmas and my dad didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>He shook his head. He hadn\u2019t had stockings either, before he came to live with the Clarks.</p><p>Julia pointed to a couple of presents that were wrapped in red and green plaid and sitting on the coffee table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open your gifts first?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel beamed and sat on the floor by the tree, cross-legged. He picked up a small box and tore at the paper with abandon.</p><p>Julia laughed at the sight of him, this very proper professor sitting in his spectacles and underwear, attacking his presents like a four-year-old.</p><p>Gabriel opened the box and was very surprised at what he saw inside. Nestled in cream-colored silk was a pair of silver cufflinks. But these were no ordinary cufflinks. These cufflinks bore the shield of the city of Florence. He gazed at them in wonder.</p><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love them, Julianne. I\u2019m just surprised. How did you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you were at one of your meetings, I walked over to the Ponte Vecchio and bought them. I thought they would look good with your fancy shirts.\u201d She looked at the floor. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I bought them using some of my scholarship money. So really, you bought them for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rose to his knees and shuffled over to her, kissing her in gratitude. \u201cThat money is yours. You earned it. And the cufflinks are perfect. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the sight of him kneeling in front of her. \u201cThere\u2019s another gift for you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he found a second small, flat present. Underneath the wrapping paper he found a framed eight-by-ten inch reproduction of Marc Chagall\u2019s painting Lovers in the Moonlight.</p><p>Inside the enclosed card Julia had written a few sweet nothings, declaring her love and her gratitude at finding him again. She also added another, more important, gift.</p><p>I\u2019d like to pose for your photographs.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Your Julia.</p><p>XOXO</p><p>Gabriel was speechless. His eyes met hers with a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you had some photographs of us to hang on the walls of your bedroom. And I would like to do this for you. If that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He moved to join her on the love seat and kissed her deeply. \u201cThank you. The painting is lovely, but what is far more lovely is you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYour fondness for Chagall will be our inspiration. But I think we\u2019ll have to practice our poses first.\u201d</p><p>He moved his eyebrows suggestively, before leaning forward to tug her lower lip into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou are the greatest gift,\u201d he murmured. He felt her lips move into a smile beneath his mouth, and he pulled back to retrieve one of her gifts from under the tree.</p><p>She rewarded him with shining, eager eyes. When she opened the small box, she found a compact disc that he\u2019d recorded for her, entitled Loving Julianne.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the playlist that we listened to in Florence,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I was going to ask you for a copy of those songs. They\u2019ll bring back happy memories.\u201d</p><p>Underneath the jewel case she found a series of gift certificates for various spa treatments at the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto, some of which had various exotic sounding names such as Vichy shower and seaweed and salt body wrap.</p><p>She thanked him, reading the titles aloud until she came to the last certificate.</p><p>Arrangements have been made for you to see a plastic surgeon in Toronto as soon as we return. Based upon the information I provided, he\u2019s confident that your scar can be removed completely. You don\u2019t need to worry about it anymore,</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>He released the page from her tense fingers, smiling apologetically. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have included that in the box. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Julia caught his hand. \u201cThank you. I thought I would have to wait. But this is the best gift you could have given me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel exhaled deeply and leaned over to kiss the top of her head. \u201cYou are worth it,\u201d he declared, his eyes blazing.</p><p>She smiled a little and peered around him, gazing at a large box that was still underneath the Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more present. Is it for me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, can I open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you waited.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy? Do you want me to take it to Richard\u2019s house? To open it in front of your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair and gave her a half-smile. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just kind of\u2014ah\u2014personal. Would you wait and open it tonight? Please?\u201d</p><p>She looked at the gift curiously. \u201cJudging by the size of the box, it isn\u2019t a kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. Although if you wanted a pet, I\u2019d buy one.\u201d He looked suspiciously at the open box that was sitting by the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat was in your gift from Paul?\u201d</p><p>Julia shrugged, pretending that she hadn\u2019t known that question was coming. \u201cA bottle of maple syrup, which I gave to Dad, and a couple of toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToys? What kind of toys?\u201d</p><p>She appeared indignant. \u201cChildren\u2019s toys, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he give you a toy bunny a couple of months ago? I think he has some kind of rabbit fetish.\u201d</p><p>Angelfucker.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, you have a fetish for women\u2019s shoes. Professor Pot, meet Mr. Kettle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never denied my aesthetic appreciation for women\u2019s footwear. They\u2019re works of art, after all,\u201d he said primly. \u201cEspecially when a woman as lovely as you is wearing them.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cHe gave me a stuffed Holstein and a pair of Dante and Beatrice figurines.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face manifested a look of intense perplexity. \u201cFigurines?\u201d His mouth widened into a provocative smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean action figures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigurines, action figures. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they anatomically correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s being a child?\u201d</p><p>He reached over to trace the curve of her cheek. \u201cI was just wondering what kind of action they were capable of participating in\u2014privately, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante would be rolling over in his grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could re-enact that event by taking Paul\u2019s action figure and burying it in the back yard. But I\u2019d like to keep Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible.\u201d Julia couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThank you for my presents. And thank you for taking me to Italy, which was the best present of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands and searched her eyes for a moment before pressing their lips together.</p><p>What started as a shy, closed mouth kiss quickly escalated until feverish, needy hands pulled and grasped at one another. Julia stood on tiptoes, pressing against his naked chest. Gabriel groaned with frustration and gently pushed himself back. He moved his glasses so he could rub his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather continue what we were just doing, but Richard wants us to go to church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel replaced his glasses. \u201cWouldn\u2019t a nice Catholic girl like you prefer to go to Mass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same God. I\u2019ve gone to church with your family before.\u201d Julia searched his expression. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChurch is not the place for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gone in years. They\u2019ll...judge me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in earnest. \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners. If only non-sinners went to church, the churches would be empty. And I doubt very much that the people in Richard\u2019s church will judge you. Episcopalians are very welcoming.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and disappeared into the bedroom to lay out her clothes. He followed her into the bedroom and collapsed on the bed, watching her rifle through the hangers in the closet.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you still believe in God? Aren\u2019t you angry with him for all of the things that happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Julia paused what she was doing in order to regard him. He looked very unhappy.</p><p>\u201cBad things happen to everyone. Why should my life be any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re good.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at her hands. \u201cThe universe isn\u2019t based on magic\u2014there isn\u2019t one set of circumstances for the good and one for the evil. Everyone suffers sometime. The question is what you do with your suffering, right?\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her impassively.</p><p>She continued. \u201cMaybe the world would be a lot worse if God didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>He cursed softly, but didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>She sat next to him on the bed. \u201cDid you ever read The Brothers Karamazov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you know the conversation between Alyosha, the priest, and his brother Ivan.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snickered, but not unkindly. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m the rebellious free thinker, and you\u2019re the religious boy?\u201d</p><p>Julia ignored him. \u201cIvan gives Alyosha a list of reasons why either God doesn\u2019t exist or if he exists, that he\u2019s a monster. It\u2019s a very powerful discussion, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cBut remember how Ivan ends his discussion. He says he rejects God\u2019s creation, this world, and yet, there\u2019s one aspect of the world that he finds surprisingly beautiful\u2014the sticky little leaves he sees on the trees in the spring. He loves them even though he hates the world around them.</p><p>\u201cThe sticky little leaves aren\u2019t faith or salvation. They\u2019re the remnant of hope. They stave off his despair, demonstrating that despite the evil he has seen, there is at least one good and beautiful thing left.\u201d</p><p>She moved so she could see Gabriel\u2019s expression more clearly, and very tenderly, she placed a hand on either side of his face. \u201cGabriel, what are your sticky little leaves?\u201d</p><p>Her question took him entirely by surprise. So much so he simply sat there, staring at the pretty brunette in front of him. It was in moments like this that he remembered why he\u2019d initially thought she was an angel. She had a compassion about her that was rare in human beings. At least, in his experience.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never thought about it before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine was Grace. And you.\u201d She smiled at him shyly. \u201cAnd even before that, there were the Salvation Army workers back in St. Louis who were kind to me when my mother wasn\u2019t. They gave me a reason to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the suffering of the innocent? Of children?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was barely above a whisper. \u201cWhat about the babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why babies die. I wish they didn\u2019t.\u201d Julia wore a grave expression.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s wrong with the rest of us, Gabriel? Why do we allow people to abuse their children? Why don\u2019t we defend the sick and the weak? Why do we let soldiers round up our neighbors and make them wear a star on their clothing and cram them into boxcars? It isn\u2019t God who\u2019s evil\u2014it\u2019s us.</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants to know where evil comes from and why the world is riddled with it. Why doesn\u2019t anyone ask where goodness comes from? Human beings have a tremendous capacity for cruelty. Why is there any goodness at all? Why are people like Grace and Richard so kind? Because there\u2019s a God, and he hasn\u2019t allowed the earth to be entirely corrupted. There are sticky little leaves, if you look for them. And when you recognize them, you can feel his presence.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes, drinking in her words with her touch, knowing in his heart that she had spoken a very deep, very profound truth.</p><p>Try as he might, he could never stop believing; even in his darkest days the light had not gone out. He\u2019d had the guidance of Grace, and providentially, when she died, he met his Beatrice again, and she\u2019d shown him the rest of the way.</p><p>He kissed her chastely, and when she left him to shower, he marveled at her quiet brilliance. She was far more intelligent than he, since her intellect was marked with a true creative originality that he only dreamed of having. Despite everything that had happened to her, she had not lost faith or hope or charity.</p><p>She is not my equal; she is my better.</p><p>She is my sticky little leaf.</p><p>An hour later Julia and Gabriel drove to All Saints Episcopal Church. Gabriel wore a black suit and white shirt, proudly displaying Julia\u2019s cufflinks, while she wore a plum-colored dress that skimmed the bottom of her knees, and tall black boots that he\u2019d purchased for her in Florence.</p><p>A sea of awkwardness. That\u2019s how Gabriel would have described the atmosphere as he sat with Julianne at the end of the family pew.</p><p>He was grateful for the liturgy, the order, and the way in which Scripture and music were used in the service. He found himself contemplating his life and the steps that led him to the beautiful woman who held his hand throughout the service.</p><p>Christmas was a celebration of birth\u2014one birth in particular. All around him he saw babies and children: the manger scene at the front of the church, the banners and stained glass windows, and the glowing skin of the pregnant woman who was seated across the aisle.</p><p>In one brief moment, Gabriel realized that he regretted his sterilization, not just for himself and the fact that he was no longer able to father a child, but also for Julianne. He imagined lying in bed with a very pregnant Julia and placing his hand on her stomach in order to feel their child kick. He thought about holding their infant son in his arms, shocked by the array of dark hair on his head.</p><p>His imaginings startled him. They marked a shift in character and priority, away from the guilt and selfishness that had marked his life up until the reappearance of his Beatrice. A shift toward the permanence of a commitment to a woman with whom he wanted to create a family, with whom he wanted to create a child. His love for Julianne had changed him in multiple ways. He hadn\u2019t been aware of how dramatic the changes were until he gazed at the pregnant stranger with a kind of wistful envy.</p><p>Those were the thoughts that occupied his mind as he held Julianne\u2019s hand until it was time to participate in the Eucharist. He was the only one in the family pew who didn\u2019t stand and file to the center aisle in order to walk to the communion rail.</p><p>There was something comforting about church, he thought. Although he found the overall experience, especially the homily, convicting. He had wasted a good deal of his life\u2014years that he could never get back.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told Grace the things he\u2019d wanted to tell her before she died. He hadn\u2019t treated Paulina or Julianne with the dignity that they deserved. He hadn\u2019t treated any of the women with whom he\u2019d been involved with respect.</p><p>In thinking of Paulina, Gabriel tore his eyes away from the dark haired woman in the pretty plum dress and hung his head, praying almost unconsciously for forgiveness and also for guidance. He was walking a tightrope, he knew, between taking responsibility for his past indiscretions and eliminating Paulina\u2019s dependence on him. He prayed that she would be able to find someone who would love her and help her put the past behind her.</p><p>Gabriel was so deep in prayer that he didn\u2019t notice his family squeeze past him to retake their seats, or Julia\u2019s warm hand snake through the crook at his elbow, pressing herself soothingly to his side. And he didn\u2019t notice the moment in the service, just before the benediction, when his father broke down into silent, shoulder-shaking tears, and Rachel placed her arm around him, leaning her blond head to his shoulder.</p><p>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a family, thought Julia, as she watched Rachel and Scott hug their father. Where love and forgiveness replace tears and suffering.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>After lunch, Rachel marshaled her family into helping her prepare the large turkey dinner. Julia spoke briefly to Tom on the phone, exacting his promise that he would arrive around three o\u2019clock in order to participate in the gift exchange, then she and Rachel parked themselves in the kitchen to peel apples for a pair of pies.</p><p>Rachel had cheated and bought the pastry, but had removed it from its Pillsbury packaging and placed it in between layers of plastic wrap in the refrigerator so no one would know.</p><p>\u201cHey, pretty girls.\u201d Scott entered the kitchen, wearing an overly large grin, and began rummaging in the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you so happy?\u201d asked his sister, peeling an apple.</p><p>\u201cThe Christmas season.\u201d He chuckled as Rachel stuck her tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cI hear you met someone,\u201d prompted Julia.</p><p>Scott began assembling a plate of leftovers, ignoring her comment.</p><p>Rachel was about to reprove her brother for his bad manners when the telephone rang. She answered it, disappearing into the dining room when she discovered it was her future mother-in-law.</p><p>Scott turned around immediately and gave Julia an apologetic look. \u201cHer name is Tammy. I\u2019m not ready for everyone to give her the third degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Julia gave him a small smile and returned to the apple she was peeling.</p><p>\u201cShe has a kid,\u201d he blurted. He leaned his large body back against the counter, crossing his arms in front of his chest.</p><p>Julia put her paring knife down. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s three months old. They live with her parents. She couldn\u2019t come without him because she\u2019s breastfeeding.\u201d Scott\u2019s voice was low, just above a whisper, and his eyes kept traveling to the doorway that led to the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhen you introduce her to your family, you should bring him too. They\u2019ll welcome both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Scott looked very uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be happy to have a baby around. Rachel and I will fight over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think if your son came home with a girlfriend who was a single mother? And the baby belonged to another guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents adopted Gabriel. I don\u2019t think your dad would object.\u201d Julia exhaled slowly, giving Scott a searching look. \u201cUnless your girlfriend is married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Her ex-boyfriend left her when she was pregnant. We\u2019ve been friends for a while.\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair, pulling on it so it almost stood straight on end. \u201cI\u2019m worried my Dad will think it\u2019s weird for me to be dating a woman with a newborn.\u201d</p><p>Julia pointed in the direction of the manger scene that was displayed under the Christmas tree in the next room.</p><p>\u201cJoseph and Mary had a similar story.\u201d</p><p>Scott looked at her as if she\u2019d sprouted a second head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he chuckled, turning back to his sandwich. \u201cThat\u2019s a good point, Jules. I\u2019ll have to remember that.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon, the family gathered around the Christmas tree to open gifts. The Clarks were a generous family, and there were lots of presents, some serious, some in jest. Julia and her father each received their fair share.</p><p>When everyone was admiring their gifts and drinking egg nog, Rachel plunked the last present on Gabriel\u2019s lap. \u201cThis arrived for you this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it from?\u201d He eyed it in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave Julia a hopeful look, but she shook her head.</p><p>Eager to uncover the mystery, he began to rip off the wrapping paper. He slid his fingers in between the cover of the white box and its bottom, separating the two, lifted the lid of the box carefully, and peeled back the layers of white tissue paper.</p><p>Before anyone could see what he\u2019d uncovered, he shoved the box aside, springing to his feet. Without a word, he strode quickly to the back door, slamming it behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Scott\u2019s voice broke the silence.</p> <p>Aaron, who witnessed what had just transpired from the hallway, entered the room. \u201cI bet it\u2019s from his ex. I\u2019d lay money on it.\u201d</p><p>Julia stumbled to the kitchen and across the back porch, following her lover\u2019s retreating form.</p><p>\u201cGabriel? Gabriel! Wait.\u201d</p><p>Large, fat snowflakes fell like feathers from the sky, blanketing the grass and trees in cold whiteness. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cGabriel!\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into the woods without a backward glance.</p> <p>She hastened her pace. If she lost sight of him she\u2019d have to return to the house. She wouldn\u2019t risk being lost in the woods again without a coat. Or a map.</p><p>She began to panic, remembering her recurrent nightmare about being trapped in the woods, alone. \u201cGabriel! Slow down.\u201d</p><p>Pushing her way into the trees, she traveled a few feet before she saw him, pausing in front of a tall pine.</p><p>\u201cGo back to the house.\u201d The arctic tone of his voice matched the falling snow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>She walked a few more steps. At the sound of her approach, he turned around. He was clad in a suit and tie, wearing expensive Italian shoes that were now ruined.</p><p>One of her high heels caught on a branch, and she pitched forward, breaking her fall by clinging to the trunk of a tree.</p><p>Gabriel was at her side in an instant. \u201cGo back to the house before you get hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her hair was long and curling over her shoulders, arms now crossed in front of her chest because of the cold. A light dusting of white covered her head and her plum dress.</p><p>She looked like a snow angel\u2014a figure one might find in a fairy tale or a snow globe, the dancing flakes hovering around her like friends. He was reminded of the time he surprised her in his library carrel and a ream of paper had been tossed into the air, falling all around her.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d He was momentarily distracted by the sight of her. The warmth of his mouth caused his words to form clouds in the air between them.</p><p>She held out her pink and naked hand. \u201cCome back with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never going to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to start a new life. She needs your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d He glared at her. \u201cYou want me to help her? After she got on her knees and tried to take my pants down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He clenched his teeth, cursing his own stupidity. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a desperate attempt by a desperate woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! What do you take me for?\u201d His eyes flamed a dangerous blue.</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised?\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in his jaw. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Julia closed her hands so tightly her nails dug into her palms. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glanced at the trees behind her, unwilling to answer her question.</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d she repeated, her voice growing louder.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is what she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes or did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIf I have to explain it to you, then we are more damaged than I thought.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to answer her. His recalcitrance was telegraphed by his eyes, his face, even his body.</p><p>She gave him a piercing stare.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes flickered over her shoulder, into the distance, almost as if he were looking for an escape. Then he looked at her again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d show up on occasion and we\u2019d...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>Julia felt ill. She screwed her eyes shut. \u201cWhen I asked if Paulina was your mistress, you said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was never my mistress.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cDon\u2019t play word games with me! Especially about your fuck buddies.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together. \u201cThat\u2019s beneath you, Julianne.\u201d</p><p>She laughed without amusement. \u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s beneath me to tell the truth. But you can lie through your teeth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lied to you about Paulina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. No wonder you were so angry when I called her your fuck buddy in the Dante seminar. I was right.\u201d Julia gave him a shattered look. \u201cWere you with her in your bed? In the bed we slept in together?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lowered his eyes.</p><p>She began to back away from him. \u201cI am so angry with you right now, I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she called, walking away from him. \u201cWhen was the last time you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>He followed her quickly, reaching out to grasp her arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d She pulled back, stumbling over a tree root.</p><p>Gabriel caught her before she fell. \u201cJust wait a minute, okay? Give me a chance to explain.\u201d Satisfied that she was on surer footing, he released her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I met you in September, things with Paulina had ended. I hadn\u2019t been with her since last December, when I told her that we needed to stop once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou led me to believe that you ended things with her at Harvard. Do you have any idea how much this hurts? Do you have any idea how stupid this makes me feel? She traipses into your parents\u2019 house as if she belongs there\u2014as if I\u2019m the fuck buddy. And no wonder! You\u2019ve been sleeping with her for years.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shifted his shoes in the snow. \u201cI was trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTread very carefully, Gabriel. Tread very, very carefully.\u201d</p><p>He froze. He\u2019d never heard her use that tone before. All at once, he felt himself losing her. The mere idea was crippling.</p><p>He began speaking very quickly. \u201cWe only saw each other once or twice a year. As I said, I haven\u2019t been with her since last December.\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cDid you expect me to catalogue each and every sexual encounter I\u2019ve ever had? I told you I had a past.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes met hers. He held her gaze, taking a tenuous step forward.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the night I told you about Maia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me I could find forgiveness. I wanted to believe you. I thought if I told you how I gave in to Paulina again and again, I\u2019d lose you.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you lying to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was skeptical. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He took another cautious step in her direction, but she held her hand up.</p><p>\u201cSo you slept with her for years\u2014after you made a child with her and she had a nervous breakdown\u2014but you didn\u2019t love her?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He saw tears shimmering in her big, dark eyes and watched as she fought them, her pretty face marred with sadness. He closed the distance between them, removing his suit jacket and tenderly placing it around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch pneumonia. You should go back to the house.\u201d</p><p>She clutched his jacket, bringing the lapels up to her neck.</p><p>\u201cShe was Maia\u2019s mother,\u201d Julia whispered. \u201cAnd look how you treated her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stiffened. Maia\u2019s mother.</p><p>Julia and Gabriel stood silently, noticing briefly that the snow had ceased falling.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hesitated, his heart beating a furious tattoo in his chest. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he would say until the words escaped his lips.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and began to walk in the direction she thought would lead back to the house.</p><p>\u201cJulia, wait!\u201d He came after her, tugging at her arm.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to touch me!\u201d She pulled her arm back, glaring at him furiously.</p><p>\u201cYou made it clear that you didn\u2019t want to know the details of what I was like before we met. You said you forgave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I was lustful,\u201d he reproved her, softly.</p><p>\u201cClearly, I thought there were limits.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel recoiled, for her remark had cut him. \u201cI deserved that,\u201d he said, the temperature of his voice rivaling that of the snow on the ground. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you everything and I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the Christmas gift from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cAn ultrasound picture.\u201d</p><p>Julia inhaled roughly, making a wheezing sound as the bracing winter air filled her lungs. \u201cWhy would she do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina assumes I\u2019ve kept everything secret. She\u2019s right, of course, when it comes to my siblings. But she assumes I haven\u2019t told you. This was her way of ensuring I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used her.\u201d Julia\u2019s teeth began chattering. \u201cNo wonder she won\u2019t let you go. You fed her with scraps, like a dog. Would you treat me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I know that I treated Paulina abominably. But that doesn\u2019t give her the right to hurt you. You\u2019re innocent in all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did. Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>Julia was quiet for a moment, rubbing her hands together against the cold. \u201cHave you ever asked Paulina to forgive you?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou toyed with her heart. I know what that\u2019s like. I can have compassion for her because of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met you first,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give you license to be cruel.\u201d Julia coughed a little as the cold air burned her throat.</p><p>He pressed a light hand to her shoulder. \u201cPlease go back. You\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave and Gabriel reached out to catch her hand.</p><p>\u201cI felt something for her, but it wasn\u2019t love. There was guilt and lust, and some affection, but never love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arm around her waist, drawing her into his side. \u201cI\u2019ll resist the urge to react to the present she left and try my damnedest to make things up to you. You\u2019re who I want. I\u2019m so sorry to have injured you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>He held her more tightly, his expression fierce. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I have ever loved.\u201d</p> <p>When Julia didn\u2019t respond, he began walking with her toward the house. \u201cI would never be unfaithful, I swear it. As far as what Paulina tried to do yesterday...\u201d He squeezed her waist. \u201cThere was a time when I could have been led astray. But that was before I found you. I would rather spend the rest of my life drinking your love, then emptying all the oceans of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour promises are meaningless when they aren\u2019t accompanied by honesty. I asked if she was your mistress, and you played a word game with me.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tire of me eventually. And when you do, you\u2019ll go back to what\u2019s familiar.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stopped. He turned to face her. \u201cPaulina was never familiar. We have a history, but we were never compatible. And we were never good for each other.\u201d</p> <p>Julia simply stared at him skeptically.</p><p>\u201cI wandered in the darkness looking for something better, something real. I found you, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, surveying the trees and the path she thought led to the orchard. \u201cMen get bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if they\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dark, narrowed with concern and worry. He blinked a little under her gaze, before frowning. \u201cDo you think that Richard would have cheated on Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a good man. Because he loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make no claim to being a good man, Julia. But I love you. I\u2019m not going to cheat.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not so wounded that I can\u2019t say no to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you weren\u2019t.\u201d Gabriel looked grim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying no to you now. If you lie to me again, it will be the last time.\u201d Her voice held a warning.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled slowly, unclenching her fists.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t sleep with you in the bed you shared with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have everything redone before we return to Toronto. I\u2019ll sell the damn place, if you want.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to sell your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen forgive me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGive me a chance to show you that I am worthy of your trust.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>He stepped toward her and took her in his arms. She accepted him reluctantly, and they stood under the falling snow, in a darkening wood.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Late that evening Gabriel and Julia sat together in their pajamas on the floor next to their Charlie Brown Christmas tree. Julia encouraged Gabriel to open Paulina\u2019s gift, so all the secrets could be revealed. He didn\u2019t want to do it, but for Julia\u2019s sake, he did.</p><p>He picked up the ultrasound picture in his hand and grimaced. Julia whispered a request to look at it, and he gave it to her with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cThis picture can\u2019t hurt you. Even if Rachel and Scott found out, they would be sympathetic.\u201d She traced a finger across the curve of the baby\u2019s little head. \u201cYou could keep this somewhere private, but she shouldn\u2019t be kept in a box. She had a name. She deserves to be remembered.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel placed his head in his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s morbid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything morbid about babies. Maia was your daughter. Paulina meant this picture to hurt you, but really, it\u2019s a gift. You should have this picture. You\u2019re her father.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was too choked up to respond. To distract himself, he placed the rest of Paulina\u2019s gifts by the door. He was returning them to her as soon as possible.</p><p>Julia followed him. \u201cI look forward to wearing your Christmas gift.\u201d She pointed toward the black corset and shoes that were still sitting in their box under the tree.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to give myself a pep talk first, but I think it\u2019s feminine and very pretty. I love the shoes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s shoulders relaxed. He wanted to ask her to try his gifts on. He wanted to see her in those shoes\u2014perhaps perched atop the bathroom counter with him between her legs\u2014but he kept his desires to himself.</p><p>\u201cUm, I need to explain something.\u201d Julia took his hand, weaving their fingers together. \u201cI can\u2019t wear it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that after the past two days wearing something like that would be the last thing you\u2019d want to do.\u201d Gabriel stroked the back of her hand with his thumb. \u201cEspecially with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a little while before I can wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He began to extricate his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI tried to explain this to you last night but, uh, I didn\u2019t quite finish.\u201d</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m having my period.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s mouth dropped open slightly. Then he closed it. He pulled her into his arms, embracing her warmly.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the reaction I was expecting.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was muffled by his chest. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo last night\u2014it wasn\u2019t because you didn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back in surprise. \u201cI\u2019m still upset about what happened with Paulina, but of course I want you. You always make me feel special when we make love. Right now, I\u2019m not going to go there. Or actually, have you go there. Uh, you know what I mean.\u201d She grew flustered.</p><p>Heaving a sigh of relief, Gabriel kissed her forehead. \u201cI have other plans for you.\u201d</p><p>He led her by the hand to the spacious washroom, pausing to press play on the stereo. The strains of Sting\u2019s \u201cUntil\u201d began to fill the room as they disappeared through the door.</p><p>Paulina sat up, wide-awake in a strange bed in Toronto, covered in a cold sweat. No amount of repetition made the dream vary in its events or its terror. No amount of vodka or pills could remove the ache in her chest or the tears from her eyes.</p><p>She reached for the bottle by the bed, knocking the hotel\u2019s alarm clock off the nightstand. A few shots and a few small, blue pills and she would fall asleep again, letting the darkness take her.</p><p>She could not be comforted. Other women could have a second child to assuage the loss of their first. But she would never bear a child. And the father of her lost baby no longer wanted her.</p><p>He was the only man she\u2019d ever loved, and she\u2019d loved him from afar and then she\u2019d loved him close by, but he\u2019d never loved her. Not really. But he was too noble to cast her off like the used piece of goods she was.</p><p>As she sobbed into her pillow, her head spinning, she mourned a double loss aloud\u2014</p><p>Maia.</p><p>Gabriel...</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Professor Giuseppe Pacciani wasn\u2019t virtuous, but he was clever. He didn\u2019t believe Christa Peterson when she declared that she was willing to meet him for a sexual rendezvous. In order to ensure that their liaison actually happened, he withheld the name of Professor Emerson\u2019s Canadian fidanzata on condition that Christa meet him in Madrid in February.</p><p>Christa was unwilling to wait that long or to sleep with him again in order to ferret out the information, so she didn\u2019t respond to his last email. She decided to regroup and find an alternative way of discovering the name of Professor Emerson\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>It could be said that she was jealous and that this was her primary reason for wondering who had successfully captured the Professor\u2019s attention when she had failed (inexplicably). It could be said that she\u2019d begun to nurse a suspicion about a certain doe-eyed brunette, ever since Professor Emerson had almost come to blows with that student over a mistress called Paulina.</p><p>But perhaps the most accurate explanation was her new and rather prurient fascination with the rumors she\u2019d heard about Professor Singer and her not-so-secret lifestyle. When Professor Emerson embraced her after his lecture at the University of Toronto, it set a good number of tongues wagging. Christa\u2019s tongue was among them.</p><p>Perhaps Giuseppe was wrong. Perhaps the Professor did not have a fidanzata after all. Perhaps he had a Mistress.</p><p>In order to solve this very juicy mystery, Christa contacted an old flame from Florence who wrote for La Nazione, hoping that he would provide her with information about Professor Emerson\u2019s personal life. While she waited for a response, she focused on an information source closer to home. In the Vestibule, all sins would be revealed.</p><p>Professor Emerson\u2019s marked absence from Lobby began the evening she tried to seduce him. So, she reasoned, his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e must have begun around that time. Previously, he hadn\u2019t cared who he hooked up with or when. Or perhaps he and his fianc\u00e9e had been involved only causally until that fateful night. It was possible that the Professor was far from monogamous in his relationship and that he\u2019d had a fianc\u00e9e all along, although such an attachment would have likely made the rounds of the rumor mill.</p><p>(Toronto is, after all, a small town.)</p><p>Christa\u2019s way forward was clear. It was likely that the Professor and his fianc\u00e9e had visited Lobby sometime over the course of the winter semester, since it appeared to be his watering hole of choice. All she needed to do was to find someone who worked at the club and pump him for information.</p><p>Late on a Saturday night, Christa stalked the staff at Lobby, trying to discover the weakest link. She sat at the bar, absolutely ignoring the tall, blond American woman who was there for the same purpose, having just flown in from Harrisburg. Christa\u2019s full, red lips curled back in disgust when the woman pulled out her iPhone and spoke very loudly in Italian to a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 called Antonio.</p><p>As the night wore on, Christa soon realized her options were few. Ethan had a serious girlfriend, which meant that he wouldn\u2019t be ripe for the picking. More than one of the bartenders were gay, and all the servers were women. Which left Lucas.</p><p>Lucas was a computer geek (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that) who assisted Ethan with security at the club, in a technical capacity. Lucas had access to the video recordings from the security cameras, and it was he who rather enthusiastically agreed to let Christa into the club after hours so they could sift through CD upon CD of footage, starting with September 2009.</p><p>And that was how Christa found herself sitting on the vanity in the women\u2019s washroom with Lucas pounding into her on a Sunday morning when she should have been in church.</p><p>Gabriel and Julia arrived back in Toronto late in the evening on January first. They went to Julia\u2019s apartment so she could drop off some things and retrieve some clean clothes. Or so Gabriel thought. With the taxi waiting at the curb for them to return, he stood in the middle of her cold and shabby apartment expecting her to pack an overnight bag. She didn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is my home, Gabriel. I\u2019ve been gone for three weeks. I need to do laundry, and I need to work on my thesis tomorrow. Classes start on Monday.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew very dark very quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m aware of when classes begin.\u201d His tone was clipped. \u201cBut it\u2019s freezing in here. You don\u2019t have any food, and I don\u2019t want to sleep without you. Come home with me, and you can return tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d have the master bedroom redone, and it has been. The bed, the furniture, it\u2019s all new.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThey even painted the walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not ready.\u201d She turned her back on him and began unpacking her suitcase. He took one look at her activities and strode through the apartment door, closing it somewhat loudly behind him.</p><p>Julia sighed.</p><p>He was trying, she knew. But his revelations had scorched holes in her already fragile self-confidence, a self-confidence that had only begun to be rebuilt during their time in Italy. She knew herself well enough to know that her fear of losing him was grounded in her parents\u2019 divorce and in Simon\u2019s betrayal. Although she knew all these things, it was very difficult to will herself to disregard them and to believe that Gabriel\u2019s love would never wane.</p><p>She\u2019d just walked to her door to bolt it when he walked in, suitcase in hand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeeping you warm,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>Gabriel placed his suitcase down and disappeared into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He emerged a few minutes later with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned, muttering something about having successfully turned on her damned electric heater.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not accustomed to sleeping without you. In fact, I\u2019m about ready to sell the damn condo and all my furniture and buy something else.\u201d He shook his head and proceeded to undress unashamedly without further conversation.</p><p>While Julia used the bathroom, Gabriel examined some of the items she\u2019d displayed on her card table\u2014the book containing the Botticelli reproductions he\u2019d given her for her birthday, a pillar candle, a book of matches, and the photo album of pictures he\u2019d taken of her.</p><p>As he leafed through the album, he found himself aroused. She\u2019d promised to pose for him again. She wanted him to photograph her. A month earlier he never would have believed that such a thing could come to pass. She\u2019d been so timid, so nervous.</p> <p>He recalled the look she had in her eyes when he took her to his bed after their horrible argument in his seminar. Thinking of Julianne\u2019s eyes, large and terrified, and the way her body trembled under his hands, diminished his arousal. He didn\u2019t deserve her. He knew that. But her own perceived unworthiness prevented her from seeing the truth.</p><p>He flipped through the pictures before focusing on one\u2014Julianne in profile with his hand on her shoulder, his other hand holding up her hair, while he pressed his lips to her shapely neck.</p><p>She was unaware of the fact that he had a copy of that picture hiding in his closet. He\u2019d never displayed it, for he was worried about her reaction. When he returned to his newly redecorated bedroom, hanging that photograph would be his first task.</p><p>The thought alone was more than enough to fuel his desire, so he took the candle and struck a match to light it, placing it on the card table before turning out the lights. A romantic glow fell over the photographs and the bed just as Julia entered the darkened space.</p><p>He sat on the edge of her narrow bed, completely naked, while she stood clutching a pair of worn flannel pajamas. They had rubber duckies on them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He glanced at her sleepwear with barely disguised distaste.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stared. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>She walked over to him slowly.</p><p>He took the fabric from her, tossing it aside. \u201cYou don\u2019t need pajamas. You don\u2019t need to wear anything.\u201d</p><p>Julia carefully proceeded to disrobe in front of him, placing her clothes on one of the folding chairs.</p><p>He paused her movement toward the bed and placed his hands on top of her head, almost as if he were blessing her. Then he began to touch her, passing his fingers through her long hair to her face, where he caressed her eyebrows and cheekbones. His eyes remained stubbornly fixed on hers, the heat of their intensity searing into Julia\u2019s consciousness.</p><p>In her whole life, no one had ever looked at her like that. Like a blue tractor beam that froze her and pulled her in. Like she was the only woman in the room, in the world, the only woman ever. Like she was Eve.</p><p>Something of the old Professor Emerson was visible now, especially in his expression, which was sexual and raw. She closed her eyes briefly, and his hands moved from her neck to her face, pausing for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She opened them and gasped at the hunger reflected back to her. He was like a lion, eager to feed but still stalking his prey. He didn\u2019t want to scare her off. But she was helpless in her own desire for him.</p><p>\u201cHave you missed me touching you like this?\u201d he asked, his voice a scorching whisper.</p><p>Julia\u2019s affirmation escaped her mouth as a strangled groan. Gabriel\u2019s chest swelled with pride.</p><p>It was a long journey from her face to her knees, and he seemed to enjoy it, pausing slowly at different parts, his touch light but heated. She felt warm beneath his gentle fingers, despite the coldness of the room. As soon as she thought of the cold, she flinched.</p><p>Gabriel stopped his explorations immediately, and moved aside to allow her to crawl into bed, closest to the wall. He pressed his chest to her back, pulling the purple duvet over their naked bodies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed making love with you. It was as if one of my limbs was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his relief. \u201cI\u2019m very glad to hear that. It was tortuous to go a week without being able to touch you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was tortuous to go a week without being able to feel you touching me.\u201d</p><p>The stirrings of desire in her voice set fire to Gabriel\u2019s blood. He tightened his hold on her, squeezing gently. \u201cCuddling is a very important component to making love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never have pegged you as a cuddler, Professor Emerson.\u201d</p><p>He drew some skin from her neck into his mouth, sucking it lightly. \u201cI have become a great many things since you made me your lover.\u201d He placed his face in her hair, inhaling her vanilla scent deeply. \u201cSometimes I wonder if you realize how much you\u2019ve changed me. It\u2019s no less than miraculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no miracle worker. But I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d He was quiet for a moment or two, which surprised her. She had expected him to begin making love immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me what happened at Kinfolks restaurant the day before Christmas.\u201d Gabriel tried to sound relaxed, for he didn\u2019t want her to think he was scolding her.</p><p>In the hope of ending the conversation quickly so they could move on to other activities, Julia described her altercation with Natalie. She left out the part where Natalie had mocked her sexual encounters with him in front of everyone. Gabriel rolled her onto her back so he could see her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was too late for you to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, damn it! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina was waiting for us when we returned to the house.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cRight. So you threatened your former roommate with a newspaper article?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she believed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants out of Selinsgrove. She wants to be Simon\u2019s official girlfriend and hang on his arm at political events in Washington. She isn\u2019t going to do anything to jeopardize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she have all that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie is Simon\u2019s dirty little secret. Which is why it took me so long to figure out he was fucking her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel winced. Julia didn\u2019t use profanity often, and when she did, it was jarring.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He pressed his forearms into the mattress on either side of her shoulders.</p><p>She looked up into concerned blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he hurt you. I\u2019m also sorry I didn\u2019t do more damage to his face when I had the chance. But I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry he went after your roommate. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here with me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, his hand tracing the curve of her neck until she sighed contentedly into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou are my sticky little leaf. My beautiful, sad, sticky little leaf, and I want to see you happy and whole. I\u2019m sorry for every tear I\u2019ve made you shed. I hope that someday you\u2019ll be able to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She hid her face in the crook of his shoulder as she clutched him closer. Her hands explored his body until they were one. The silent air of her tiny studio was broken only by heavy breathing and muffled pants and her own voice moaning to a fevered pitch.</p><p>It was a subtle language\u2014this shared language of lovers: the reciprocation of sigh and groan, anticipation growing and feeding until groans became cries and cries became sighs once more. Gabriel\u2019s body covered hers completely, a delicious weight of man and sweat and naked skin upon naked skin.</p><p>This was the joy that the world sought\u2014sacred and pagan all at once. A union between two dissimilars into a seamless one. A picture of love and deep satisfaction. An ecstatic glimpse of the beatific vision.</p><p>Before Gabriel withdrew from her, he pressed one more kiss to her cheek. \u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for deceiving you about Paulina. For taking advantage of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t forgive you on her behalf. Only she can do that.\u201d Julia chewed at her bottom lip. \u201cNow, more than ever, you need to see that she gets help so she can move on with her life. You owe her that.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to say something, but somehow the strength of her goodness silenced him.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>As the semester unfolded, Julia was under tremendous pressure to complete her thesis, and Katherine Picton was pushing her to submit chapters more quickly. Quicker chapters would make it easier to speak more specifically about Julia\u2019s abilities to Greg Matthews, the Chair of the Department of Romance Languages at Harvard, should he follow up on her reference letter.</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t concentrate when Gabriel was around. Her voice grew soft when she told him why. Something about blue eyes and sexual pyrotechnics and a chemistry that vibrated in the air between them, all of which kept her from focusing on the tasks at hand. Gabriel was extremely flattered.</p><p>So the happy couple worked out a compromise. There would be telephone calls and texts and the occasional Gmail, but apart from a lunch or dinner during the week, Julia would stay at her apartment. On Friday afternoons she would arrive at Gabriel\u2019s in order to spend the weekend with him.</p><p>One Wednesday evening in mid-January, Julia called Gabriel after her homework was done.</p><p>\u201cI had a rough day,\u201d she said, sounding tired.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProfessor Picton is making me scrap about three-quarters of one of my chapters because she thinks I\u2019m offering a Romanticized version of Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates the Romantics, so you can imagine how annoyed she was. She went on and on about it. She makes me feel stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t stupid.\u201d Gabriel chuckled into the phone. \u201cProfessor Picton makes me feel stupid sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen me the first time I was summoned to her house. I was more nervous than I was on the day I defended my dissertation. I almost forgot to wear pants.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cI can only imagine that a pantless Professor Emerson would be very well received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully, I didn\u2019t have to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton told me that \u2018my strong work ethic makes up for my occasional lapses in reasoning.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s high praise coming from her. She thinks most people fail to reason at all. The way she describes the world today, most people are monkeys who happen to wear clothes. On occasion.\u201d</p><p>Julia groaned, rolling onto her stomach. \u201cWould it kill her to tell me that she likes my thesis? Or that I\u2019m doing a good job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine will never tell you that she likes your thesis. She thinks positive feedback is patronizing. This is simply the way those old, pretentious Oxonians are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t like that, Professor Emerson.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel found himself twitching at the mere change in her tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes I am, Miss Mitchell. You\u2019ve simply forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so,\u201d he whispered, his voice almost breaking. \u201cBut remember, you\u2019re my lover, not my student.\u201d He grinned wickedly. \u201cExcept in the ways of love.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and he found himself laughing with her.</p><p>\u201cI finished the book you lent me, A Severe Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was quick. How did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loneliest at night. I\u2019ve been reading to help me fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to be lonely. Take a cab to my place. I\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, Professor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Miss Mitchell. So how was the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why Grace liked it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a romantic love story. But when they became Christians, they decided their love for each other was pagan\u2014that they\u2019d made idols of one another. That made me sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it saddened you. I haven\u2019t read it, although Grace used to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could love be pagan, Gabriel? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me that question? I thought I was the pagan in this relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a pagan. You told me so yourself.\u201d</p><p>He sighed thoughtfully. \u201cSo I did. You know as well as I that Dante views God as the only thing in the universe who can satisfy the longings of the soul. This is Dante\u2019s implicit critique of Paolo and Francesca\u2019s sin. They forego a higher good\u2014the love of God\u2014for the love of a human being. Of course, that\u2019s a sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaolo and Francesca were adulterers. They shouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with each other in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But even if they were unmarried lovers, Dante\u2019s criticism would be the same. If they love one another to the exclusion of everything and everyone else, then their love is pagan. They\u2019ve made idols of one another and their love. And they\u2019re also very foolish, because no human being can ever make another human being completely happy. Human beings are far too imperfect for that.\u201d</p><p>Julia was stunned. Although there were aspects of Gabriel\u2019s explanation that she knew already, it truly surprised her to hear such words from his lips.</p><p>It appeared that she was a pagan about her love of Gabriel, and she hadn\u2019t even realized it. Moreover, if he actually believed what he was saying, then he had a much less exalted view of their attachment. She was shocked.</p><p>\u201cJulianne? Are you still there?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a theory. It has nothing to do with us.\u201d</p><p>He spoke the words, but the unease remained. He knew that he\u2019d made an idol of Julianne, his Beatrice, and no denial or sophisticated rhetoric could make that truth false. Given all the time he\u2019d spent in a twelve-step program that encouraged him to focus on a higher power and not himself, his lovers or his family, he knew better.</p><p>\u201cSo why did Grace like this book? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cMaybe when Richard swept her off her feet she viewed him as a savior. He married her, and they rode off into the sunset of Selinsgrove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard is a good man,\u201d Julia murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe is. But Richard is not a god. If Grace married him thinking that all her troubles would disappear because of his perfection, their relationship would not have lasted. She would have become disillusioned eventually, and she would have left him in order to find someone else to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the reason why Richard and Grace were so happily married was because they had realistic expectations; they didn\u2019t expect one another to meet all their needs. It would also explain why a spiritual dimension was so important to each of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. My book is a lot different from the Graham Greene novel you were reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour novel is about an affair and a man who hates God. I Wikied it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel resisted the urge to growl. \u201cDon\u2019t Wiki things, Julianne. You know that website is unreliable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Professor Emerson,\u201d she purred.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Greene\u2019s protagonist hates God? Because his lover gave him up for God. We both read a novel about pagans, Julianne. It\u2019s just the endings that were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure they were so different.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled in spite of himself. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit late for us to be having this conversation. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired, and I have some paperwork I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. Madly.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way her voice sounded in his ear made his heart quicken.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. I love you far too much, I\u2019m sure. But I don\u2019t know how to love you any other way.\u201d His final words were a whisper, but they burned in the air.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to love you any other way, either,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cThen God have mercy on us both.\u201d</p><p>If you were to ask Gabriel if he wanted to be in therapy, he would have said no. He didn\u2019t relish the idea of talking about his feelings or his childhood, or being forced to relive what happened with Paulina. He didn\u2019t want to talk about his addictions or Professor Singer and the myriad other women he\u2019d bedded.</p><p>But he wanted a future with Julia, and he wanted her to be healthy\u2014to bloom fully and not just partially. He privately worried that he was somehow impairing her ability to blossom, just because he was, well, Gabriel.</p><p>So he vowed to do everything in his power to support her, including changing his behavior for the best and focusing more on her needs. In so doing, he recognized that he could do with an objective evaluation of his own selfishness and some practical advice as to how to overcome it. Consequently, he was determined to brave the discomfort and embarrassment of admitting he needed help and see a therapist on a weekly basis.</p><p>As the days of January slipped by, it became abundantly clear that both Gabriel and Julia were very fortunate in their choice of therapists. Drs. Nicole and Winston Nakamura were a married couple who sought to work with clients on their psychological and personal issues with a view to integrating those considerations with both existential and spiritual pursuits.</p><p>Nicole was concerned about the nature of Julia\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend. She worried that the power differential between Julia and Gabriel, coupled with his strong personality and Julia\u2019s diminished self-confidence, would make their romantic relationship more of a mental health hazard to Julia than a help.</p><p>But Julia claimed to be in love with Gabriel and to be very happy with him, and it was clear that she derived a lot of pleasure and no small amount of security from their relationship. However, the strange account of how they met and then met again, when added to certain facts about Gabriel\u2019s past and his addictive personality, raised all sorts of red flags in Nicole\u2019s mind. The fact that Julia did not recognize these red flags showed more about her own psychological state than she could reasonably realize.</p><p>Winston pulled no punches, informing Gabriel that he was placing his recovery in jeopardy by continuing to drink alcohol and by failing to go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings. What was supposed to be an introductory meeting exploded into an angry confrontation, which resulted in Gabriel storming out of the office.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gabriel returned to his next session, promising that he would attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings. He attended one or two and never returned.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Snowfall in the city is very different from snowfall in the country, thought Julia, as she and Gabriel walked through the cascading flakes to his building so he could pick up his car. Tonight would be an evening of celebration at a fancy French restaurant, Auberge du Pommier.</p><p>Gabriel tugged on Julia\u2019s arm and pulled her into the doorway of a shop, kissing her firmly as he backed her into a wall of glass. She giggled breathlessly when he finished, and in return, dragged him out to the sidewalk so they could admire the falling snow.</p><p>In the country, you can hear the snow whispering around you, the large, fat flakes unfettered by skyscrapers and office buildings. In the city, the wind drives the snow in between the tall buildings, but the snowfall is lessened considerably by the many obstacles. Or so Julia thought.</p><p>When they arrived at Gabriel\u2019s building, she paused in front of the large china shop that dominated the first floor. But Julia wasn\u2019t interested in the great window of china that gazed out at her matrimonially. She was only interested in the handsome man beside her.</p><p>Gabriel wore a long black wool coat that boasted a black velvet collar and a Burberry scarf wrapped like an ascot at his neck. The hand that clasped hers was clad in black leather gloves. But it was his hat that fascinated her.</p><p>Professor Emerson wore a beret.</p><p>She found his choice of haberdashery strangely appealing. Gabriel had refused to succumb to the local custom of wearing knit caps or toques. A black wool beret to match his overcoat did nicely enough. And he was very elegant in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His face crinkled as he watched her watching his reflection, a slow smile playing about his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re handsome,\u201d she stammered, unable to take her eyes away from his striking figure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the attractive one, inside and out. A beautiful popsicle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her long and good in front of a hundred bone china place settings, and gently pecked her ear. \u201cLet\u2019s take a cab to dinner. Then I\u2019ll be able to devote my full attention to you. I\u2019ll run inside to take out some cash from the ATM and I\u2019ll be back in a minute. Unless you\u2019d rather join me.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cI want to enjoy the snow while it lasts.\u201d</p><p>He snorted loudly. \u201cThis is a Canadian winter. Believe me, the snow will last.\u201d He moved her scarf aside to kiss her neck, and he chuckled to himself as he disappeared into the Manulife Building.</p><p>She peered through the window at the display of china and began to admire one place setting in particular, wondering how it would look in Gabriel\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and came face to chest with Paul. He smiled at her and engulfed her in a warm hug. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she responded somewhat nervously, worrying that Gabriel would surprise them.</p><p>\u201cYou look great. Did you have a good Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. I brought you a souvenir from Pennsylvania. I\u2019ll put it in your mailbox in the department. How was your Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Busy, but fine. How are your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good. Professor Picton is keeping me busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she is.\u201d Paul chuckled. \u201cMaybe we can get coffee sometime next week and you can tell me all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Julia smiled back, resisting the urge to turn around and look for Gabriel, when all of a sudden Paul\u2019s smile slid off his face.</p><p>His dark brows came together, and he took a step closer, a scowl clouding over his usually benign features. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Julia looked down at her winter coat but saw nothing that would alarm him. And then she wiped at her face, wondering if Gabriel had smeared her lip-gloss across her cheeks.</p> <p>But Paul was looking elsewhere. He was looking at her neck.</p><p>He came closer still, so he was truly violating her personal space, and pulled the edge of her purple pashmina aside with his bear-like paw.</p><p>\u201cHoly God, Julia, what the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>She flinched as one of his work-roughened fingers tentatively skimmed the bite mark on her neck, cursing the fact that she\u2019d apparently forgotten to use concealer that morning when she applied her make up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She moved backwards and wrapped her pashmina around her neck twice, fussing with the ends so she wouldn\u2019t have to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI know what nothing looks like, and that ain\u2019t nothing. Did your boyfriend do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! He would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Paul cocked his head to one side. \u201cYou told me he hurt you before. I thought that was why you broke up the last time.\u201d</p> <p>Julia found herself wrapped in the coiled python grip of her lies. She opened her mouth to protest and quickly closed it, trying to think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cDid he bite you out of love? Or anger?\u201d Paul tried to keep his voice calm. He was furious with whoever had treated Julia so violently and more than willing to track down the offender and kick his ass. Several times.</p><p>\u201cOwen would never do something like that. He\u2019s never put a violent hand on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen damn it, Julia, what happened?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at his anger and found herself looking down at her boots.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t lie to me,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into my father\u2019s house during Thanksgiving and attacked me. That\u2019s how I got the scar. I know it\u2019s hideous. I\u2019m having it removed.\u201d</p><p>Paul was quiet for a moment as he considered what she said. \u201cA bite mark seems awfully personal for a burglar, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Julia chewed at the inside of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnd why should you be ashamed of being attacked? It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Paul fumed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell me. I get it.\u201d He reached out and took her hand in his, stroking the surface of her palm with his thumb. \u201cIf you need to get away from him, I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind, but the police caught him. He can\u2019t reach me here.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s shoulders softened. \u201cI\u2019m your friend, Rabbit. I care about you. Let me help you before something worse happens.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not a rabbit, and I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by the nickname.\u201d Paul offered her a repentant look. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Owen come to your rescue? I would have beaten the burglar to a pulp.\u201d</p><p>She began to tell him that Owen had, in fact, rescued her but swiftly thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cHe must not be a very good boyfriend if he allows you to be manhandled like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was home alone. No one could have known that someone would break in and attack me. I\u2019m not a damsel in distress, Paul, despite what you might think.\u201d Her eyes flashed.</p><p>Paul gazed at her sharply. \u201cI never said you were a damsel in distress. But that thing on your neck is not something a burglar would do. It\u2019s a fucking mark. And you have to admit that you\u2019ve been knocked around by a couple of people, even in the short time I\u2019ve known you. Christa, Professor Pain, Emerson...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve better than to be someone\u2019s punching bag.\u201d His voice was soft and it made Julia shiver. \u201cI\u2019d never treat you like that.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his kind, brown eyes and stood mutely, hoping Gabriel would not appear.</p><p>Paul thrust his hands into the pockets of his coat and shifted his weight back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m heading over to Yonge Street to meet some friends for dinner. Would you like to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out most of the day. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m running late, or I\u2019d walk you. Do you need money for a cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got it. Thanks.\u201d She fidgeted with her gloves, adjusting the fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d He gave her a pained smile and began walking away.</p><p>Julia turned to look through the glass doors of the building, but couldn\u2019t see Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d Paul called to her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and waved, watching as he turned and walked away.</p><p>At two o\u2019clock in the morning, Julia startled. She was in Gabriel\u2019s bed, and his room was dark. But she was alone.</p><p>After Paul disappeared, Gabriel returned to her side. If he\u2019d seen her exchange with Paul, he gave no sign of it, although he was somewhat quiet during their celebratory dinner. Later, when she was ready for bed, he\u2019d kissed her on the forehead and said he\u2019d join her soon. Hours later, he still hadn\u2019t come to bed.</p><p>She tiptoed down the hall. The apartment was swathed in darkness. Only the light from underneath Gabriel\u2019s study door was visible. She stood in the hallway, listening. When she finally heard a few clicks of the computer keys, she turned the doorknob and walked in.</p><p>To say that Gabriel was surprised would have been an understatement. His eyes swung to hers, narrowed and uneasy, from behind his glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He stood up immediately, placing a large Oxford dictionary on top of the papers that were scattered across his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014nothing.\u201d She hesitated, looking down at her bare legs. She wiggled her toes on top of the Persian carpet.</p><p>He was at her side in an instant. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come to bed. I was worried.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel removed his glasses, rubbing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll come to bed soon. I just have a few things to do that can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached up to kiss his cheek before turning to go.</p><p>\u201cWait. Let me tuck you in.\u201d He took her hand in his and led her down the dark hallway to their room.</p><p>Gone was the large medieval bed, the dark furniture, and ice blue silk fabrics from his bedroom. Gabriel had hired an interior designer to recreate the master bedroom he\u2019d shared with Julia in Umbria. Now the walls were cream-colored, and a large canopy bed hung with gauzy curtains sat in the center of the room. Julia had approved of the transformation and the inspiration behind it. The room was no longer his, but theirs.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams.\u201d He pressed an almost parental kiss to her forehead before closing the bedroom door behind him.</p><p>Julia lay awake for some time, wondering what he was hiding. She wrestled with the question of whether or not she should strive to find out or simply trust him. Without a satisfactory resolution, she fell into a troubled sleep.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t sleep. Had he been a melodramatic sort of person he would have described his restless evening as a dark night of the soul. But Paul was from Vermont and thus not melodramatic. Nonetheless, after a long evening over dinner and beer with players from his rugby team, Paul couldn\u2019t get the image of Julia\u2019s marked skin out of his mind.</p><p>He had well-defined views about how a man should treat a woman, views that had been shaped largely by his parents. His mother and father weren\u2019t overly demonstrative in their affection nor were they sentimental. But they always treated one another with respect. Paul\u2019s mother had encouraged him to treat girls like ladies, and his father had demanded the same, saying that if he ever heard of Paul treating a girl badly, he\u2019d have to answer for his behavior.</p><p>Paul thought back to his first keg party, during his freshman year at St. Michael\u2019s College, and how he\u2019d run into a girl in a torn shirt on his way to the bathroom. He\u2019d calmed her down and demanded that she point out who had attacked her. Paul cornered her assailant and held him until the campus police showed up, but not before roughing him up a little.</p><p>When his younger sister Heather was being tormented by boys in junior high school, boys who made lewd comments and snapped her bra strap against her back, he waited for the little fuckers after school and threatened them. Heather continued her education bully-free after that.</p><p>In Paul\u2019s romantic economy, violence against women was absolutely unthinkable, and he would have used his savings to get on a plane to track down the person who had marked Julia, if he only knew the asshole\u2019s name and location.</p><p>It was his own fault she wouldn\u2019t talk to him, he reasoned, as he stared at the wall of his simple apartment. He had gone all knight in shining armor on her, and she\u2019d retreated. If he\u2019d been less angry and more supportive, then perhaps she would have revealed what actually happened. But he\u2019d pushed her, and now it was unlikely that she\u2019d ever tell him the truth.</p><p>Should I respect her by staying out of it?Or should I try to help her no matter what she says?</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t know which arm of the dilemma he was going to choose, but one thing he knew for sure\u2014he was going to keep his eye on Julia, and he\u2019d be damned if anyone would injure her when he was around.</p><p>Shortly before eleven the next morning, Julia rolled out of bed from under Gabriel\u2019s arm. She pulled on one of his white Oxford button-down shirts and stood in front of the large black and white framed photograph of Gabriel kissing her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She loved the photograph but had been surprised to see it so prominently displayed on his wall and in so large a size. It made her think back to her first visit, when she studied the black and white photographs that used to grace his walls. And he\u2019d vomited all over her and his British-racing-green sweater.</p><p>Gabriel certainly had panache when it came to his clothing. He would have looked good wearing nothing but a brown paper bag. (Julia meditated on that thought for more than a few seconds.)</p><p>Leaving Gabriel to snore softly in peace, she walked to the kitchen. As she helped herself to breakfast, she thought back to his behavior the night before.</p><p>What had he been doing in his study on a Friday night?</p> <p>Before she could consider the implications of her actions, she found herself wandering into his office. She walked over to his desk and saw that his laptop was switched off. All the papers from the night before had been cleared away, the gleaming oak of the desktop almost bare. There was no way she was going to open his files and desk drawers in search of his secrets.</p><p>However, she found something on his desk that she had not expected\u2014a small, sterling silver frame with a black and white picture in it.</p><p>Maia.</p><p>She picked up the photo and held it in her hand, marveling that Gabriel had progressed so far as to have the ultrasound picture framed. Lost in thought, she stood looking at it for what seemed like a long time.</p><p>\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d</p> <p>She whirled around to find Gabriel leaning against the doorframe, arms across his chest, clad only in a T-shirt and a pair of striped boxer shorts.</p><p>He stared a little too long at the naked flesh that peeked out from between the top buttons and at her shapely legs. He glanced at the picture frame and his expression shifted.</p><p>Julia quickly replaced the frame on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel strode toward her. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided where to put it.\u201d He looked at the picture. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to keep it in a drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a beautiful frame,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cI found it at Tiffany.\u201d</p> <p>Julia cocked her head to one side. \u201cOnly you would buy a frame at Tiffany\u2019s. I would have gone to Walmart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Tiffany for quite a different purpose.\u201d He searched her face.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. \u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d</p><p>Now his eyes burned into hers. \u201cAbsolutely. But I found it long ago.\u201d</p><p>Julia blinked as if she were in some sort of fog until he leaned down to kiss her. It was a remarkable kiss. He placed his hands gently on either side of her face and then brought his lips to hers, pressing firmly before beginning his joyous movement. Within a moment, she\u2019d forgotten all about why she\u2019d wandered into the study.</p><p>He stroked her tongue tenderly with his, sliding his hands through her hair to rest on the back of her head. And when he withdrew, he kissed her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known you my whole life. I wish everything had been different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re together now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat we are, my lovely. You look beautiful in my shirt.\u201d His voice was gruff all of a sudden. \u201cI was planning to take you out for breakfast. There\u2019s a small cr\u00eaperie around the corner that I think you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand gladly as he led her back to the bedroom so they could shower together and begin their day.</p><p>Later that afternoon they worked in his study. Gabriel sat at his desk, reading an article, while Julia sat perched in his red velvet armchair, checking her email.</p><p>Dear Julia,</p><p>I owe you an apology. I\u2019m really sorry I upset you when I ran into you yesterday. I didn\u2019t mean to. I was worried about you.</p><p>If you ever need someone to talk to, I\u2019m just a phone call away.</p><p>Hoping we can still be friends,</p><p>Paul.</p><p>PS. Christa has been asking why Professor Picton is directing your thesis.</p><p>Julia looked over at Gabriel and found him lost in thought behind his eyeglasses. She quickly typed a response.</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Of course we\u2019re still friends. The incident in Selinsgrove was traumatic, and I\u2019m trying to forget about it.</p><p>I should mention that my boyfriend saved me\u2014in more ways than one.</p><p>Someday I\u2019d like to introduce you to him. He\u2019s wonderful.</p><p>Not sure why Christa cares who is directing my thesis. I\u2019m only an MA student.</p><p>Thanks for the warning.</p><p>I\u2019ll put your Christmas present in your mailbox in the department on Monday.</p><p>It\u2019s small but I hope you like it.</p><p>And thanks,</p><p>Julia.</p><p>Katherine Picton lived a reserved life. She owned a nice home in the Annex neighborhood of Toronto, which was within walking distance to the university. She spent her summers in Italy and Christmas holidays in England. And she spent most of her time publishing articles and monographs on Dante. In other words, she lived the life of the respectable academic spinster, except that she didn\u2019t garden or take lovers or own a bevy of cats. (Regrettably.)</p><p>Despite her age, she was very much in demand for public lectures and more than one university had attempted to lure her out of retirement with promises of extravagant salaries and modest teaching responsibilities. Katherine would rather have dug the Panama Canal with her fingernails while suffering from yellow fever than give up the time she could devote to research in order to maintain an office on campus and attend faculty meetings.</p><p>So when Greg Matthews of Harvard University telephoned her in January about an opening for an endowed chair in Dante studies, that\u2019s what she told him.</p><p>He reacted in stunned silence before fumbling over his next words. \u201cBut Professor Picton, we could arrange it so you wouldn\u2019t have to teach. All you would have to do would be to deliver a couple of lectures a semester, have a presence on campus, and supervise some doctoral students. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to move all my books,\u201d said Katherine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hire a moving company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll mix them up and it will take weeks to put them back in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hire special movers\u2014movers accustomed to moving libraries. They\u2019ll take your books off the shelf, pack them in order, and replace them on your shelves here in Cambridge exactly the way they were in Toronto. You wouldn\u2019t have to do a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving companies don\u2019t know how to catalogue books,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cWhat if they mis-shelve something? I have thousands of volumes in my library, and I might never be able to find what they misplace. And what if they lose something? Some of those books are irreplaceable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton, if you would accept the endowed chair, I\u2019ll come to Toronto and move your books personally.\u201d</p><p>Katherine paused for a moment until she realized that Greg was serious. Then she burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cHarvard sounds very accommodating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he muttered, hoping that she would change her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested. There are lots of younger persons you should be considering instead of a sixty-eight-year-old retiree. While we\u2019re on the subject of your department, I want to talk to you about my graduate student, Julianne Mitchell, and why I think you need to admit her to your doctoral program.\u201d</p><p>Katherine spent ten minutes telling Greg why it had been a mistake for him to fail to offer Julianne adequate funding the previous year. Then Professor Picton impressed upon him the need for Julianne to receive a lucrative fellowship beginning in September. Finally, when she finished scolding him and effectively telling him how to do the job of the Director of Graduate Studies (which was not, in fact, his job), she promptly hung up.</p><p>Greg stared at the phone in his hand with a look of incredulity.</p><p>During the last week of January, Julia was weightless, floating and happy, the skin on her neck now perfect through medical technology. Her scar removal was healed, and no one would ever know that she\u2019d been marked. Therapy was going well and so was her relationship with Gabriel, although on occasion he seemed distracted and she would have to call his name to bring him back to her.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished an amiable coffee with Paul, during which they discussed Christa\u2019s recent inexplicable good mood and was on her way to the library when she received a telephone call that would change her life. Greg Matthews offered her early acceptance into the doctoral program in Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard, on a very generous fellowship, for the fall semester.</p><p>The acceptance was conditional on the satisfactory completion of her MA at the University of Toronto, but as Professor Matthews pointed out, given her letters of recommendation and the glowing endorsement offered by Professor Picton, Julia should have no problem completing her degree. Professor Matthews was eager to hear Julia\u2019s acquiescence to the offer, but he knew that most graduate students would need a little time to think about it, and so he asked her to telephone him with her decision in seven days.</p><p>Julia was surprised at how calm and professional she sounded on the phone. Of course, she wasn\u2019t doing much talking. After the call ended, she texted Gabriel with trembling, nervous fingers.</p><p>Harvard just called\u2014they want me.</p><p>Conditional on my MA. Love, J.</p><p>A few minutes later, she received a reply.</p><p>Congratulations, darling. In a meeting.</p><p>My place\u2014one hour? G.</p><p>Julia smiled at her iPhone and quickly completed her library errands before walking to the Manulife Building. She was excited but worried. On the one hand, her admission to Harvard was the culmination of her dreams and hard work. On the other, Harvard represented separation from Gabriel.</p><p>Bolstered by Doctor Nicole\u2019s encouragement to be kind to herself, Julia decided to have a hot shower in order to allow herself a few minutes to think. She left a note on the hall table where Gabriel always dropped his keys and proceeded to make herself at home in his spacious bathroom. Fifteen minutes later she was half-asleep under the tropical rain showerhead.</p><p>\u201cThis is a welcome sight,\u201d Gabriel whispered, opening the door to the shower. \u201cA warm, wet, and naked Julianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s room for a warm, wet, and naked Gabriel too,\u201d she said, grasping his hand.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot right now. We should celebrate. Where would you like to go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>There was a time when Julia would simply have accepted Gabriel\u2019s suggestion because she wanted to make him happy. But on this occasion, she spoke up. \u201cCan we just stay in? I don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Let me change and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>By the time Gabriel returned, Julia was standing in the center of the bathroom, wrapped in a towel.</p><p>He handed her a flute of champagne and they clinked their glasses together.</p><p>\u201cI have something to give to you,\u201d he said, disappearing into the bedroom. He returned a moment later with something crimson in his hands. He held it up so she could read the lettering on the front.</p><p>\u201cThis was mine. I\u2019d like you to have it.\u201d He took her glass and placed it next to his on the vanity, then tugged at her towel until it dropped to the floor.</p><p>Julia pulled the hooded Harvard sweatshirt over her head, standing like a nearly naked sorority girl who had just rolled out of bed with her boyfriend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGorgeous,\u201d he whispered, wrapping her in his arms and kissing her enthusiastically. \u201cThis is quite an accomplishment, and I know that you\u2019ve worked very hard for it. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Julia grew a little teary at his praise, for apart from Grace, no one had ever expressed pride in her or her accomplishments. \u201cThank you. Are you sure you want to part with your sweatshirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my smart, smart girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m accepting their offer or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He pulled away, and his expression morphed into a scowl.</p><p>\u201cI just received the call today. I have a week to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to decide? You\u2019d be crazy not to accept it!\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted with her hands. She thought that Gabriel would be saddened at the idea of their separation. She hadn\u2019t thought that he would be so enthusiastic.</p><p>He paced back and forth. \u201cDidn\u2019t they offer you enough money? Because you know I\u2019ll cover the cost. I\u2019ll buy you an apartment near Harvard Square, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be kept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He turned his head, peering over at her sharply.</p><p>Julia squared her shoulders and lifted her chin. \u201cI want to pay my own way.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel groaned in frustration and cupped her face in his hands. \u201cJulianne, we will never be equals. You are my better.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his sincerity bringing a particular light to his blue eyes, and he kissed her, before pulling her into his chest. \u201cI have more vices and more money. I refuse to share my vices, but my money is yours. Take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen let me help you secure a loan. Please don\u2019t turn down this opportunity. Please. You\u2019ve worked so hard for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t the issue. Greg Matthews offered me a very generous fellowship, which will be more than enough to cover my expenses.\u201d</p><p>She grasped the hem of her sweatshirt, tugging it to cover more of her naked body. \u201cI\u2019m worried about what will happen to us if I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you lose me?\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in his chest. \u201cLong distance relationships are difficult. You\u2019re very handsome. Lots of women will try to take my place.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in lots of women. I\u2019m interested in you. I\u2019ve applied for a sabbatical. If that doesn\u2019t work, I could take a leave of absence. It wouldn\u2019t hurt for me to spend a year at Harvard finishing my book. We can go together, and that will buy me some time to figure out what I should do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that. Your career is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcademics take sabbaticals all the time. Ask Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you resent me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far more likely that you\u2019ll resent me\u2014being tied to an older man when you should be dating men your own age. And an older man who is a selfish know-it-all and can\u2019t stop bossing you around.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes. \u201cThe man I love is not the person you described. Not anymore. Besides, there\u2019s only a ten-year age difference between us.\u201d</p><p>He grinned wryly. \u201cThank you. We don\u2019t have to live together if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll be your neighbor. Of course, if you don\u2019t want me to go...\u201d He swallowed and waited for her response.</p><p>Julia threw her arms around his neck. \u201cOf course I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispered, pulling her into the bedroom.</p><p>After Julia returned to her apartment the following day, Gabriel spent the afternoon working in his home office. He was about to telephone her to ask if she wanted to meet for dinner when his cell phone rang. Realizing that it was Paulina, he refused to answer it.</p><p>A few minutes later his home telephone rang, its unique ring indicating that the call was coming from the security guard downstairs. He picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson, there is a woman here who says that she needs to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina Gruscheva.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cursed. \u201cTell her to go away.\u201d</p><p>The security guard lowered his voice. \u201cOf course, Professor. But you should know that she seems upset. And she\u2019s using your name rather loudly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he spat. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grabbed his keys and strode out of the apartment heading toward the elevator, cursing.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>With the relief that an early acceptance to Harvard brought, Julia was able to redouble her efforts on her thesis. When she and Gabriel were apart, she worked tirelessly, spending hours upon hours in the library or at her apartment writing.</p><p>As a reward, Gabriel decided to whisk her away to Belize for Valentine\u2019s weekend. It was a celebration of love, Julia\u2019s acceptance to Harvard, and other things that Gabriel was not yet ready to share.</p><p>On the day of their departure, Julia stood on the front porch of her building, checking her mailbox. She found a letter from Harvard, which she opened immediately. It was a formal offer of admission to the doctoral program, and it included the terms of her conditional acceptance and her fellowship.</p><p>She also found a business sized envelope with the University of Toronto insignia on it. The words Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies were printed above the return address. She quickly ripped open the envelope and read its contents. Then she dragged her luggage to Bloor Street, flagging a cab to Gabriel\u2019s condominium.</p><p>She flew into the lobby, past the security guards, and into the elevator that would take her to his floor. Tripping down the hall, she let herself in with her key.</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d Gabriel walked to the front door with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re early. I\u2019m flattered that you couldn\u2019t stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>She batted away his outstretched arms and shoved one of the letters into his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the letter.</p><p>February 5, 2010</p><p>Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies</p><p>University of Toronto</p><p>Toronto, Canada</p><p>Dear Miss Julianne Mitchell,</p><p>A complaint has been filed in our office alleging that you have violated the University of Toronto\u2019s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. In conjunction with this complaint, you are requested to appear in person at the Dean\u2019s office on February 19, 2010, for a preliminary interview. The Chair of Italian Studies, Professor Jeremy Martin, will also be in attendance.</p><p>You may bring an individual with you to this meeting. This individual may be a representative of the Graduate Student Association, a family member or friend, or an attorney.</p><p>This meeting is for information purposes only and does not constitute a hearing, nor has the Dean\u2019s office taken any position on the legitimacy of the complaint.</p><p>Please confirm with this office that you have received this letter and that you will be attending this meeting. If you do not attend, an investigation into the complaint will begin automatically.</p><p>Yours very truly,</p><p>David Aras, PhD</p><p>Dean of Graduate Studies</p><p>Gabriel looked down into Julia\u2019s panicked eyes and tried to find the words to reassure her that she had nothing to worry about\u2014but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Julia saw fear flash across Gabriel\u2019s eyes, but only for an instant. There was nothing more terrifying to her than the sight of Gabriel\u2019s fear.</p><p>He helped her take off her coat and urged her to sit down in the red chair next to the fireplace. Flipping a switch, which caused the flames to ignite, he walked to the other room. Julia leaned back in the chair and covered her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cDrink this.\u201d He nudged her hand with a glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaphroaig. Scotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne swallow, just to take the edge off.\u201d</p><p>She tipped the crystal glass to her lips and drank, feeling the burn of the alcohol in her mouth and throat. Coughing wildly, she handed the glass back. He downed the rest of the Scotch and sat on the sofa opposite her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the \u2018Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters\u2019?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the policy that governs any kind of scholastic infraction\u2014cheating, plagiarism, fraud, etc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone report me for academic fraud?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scrubbed at his face. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! You think I\u2019d keep this from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping something from me. That night you were working late in your office, you wouldn\u2019t tell me what you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was working on a job application,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cGreg Matthews called me the night that you and I went to Auberge for dinner. He invited me to apply for an endowed chair but told me they needed my portfolio right away. Preparing it took longer than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He averted his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to get your hopes up. The chances of me getting that job are slim. I\u2019m not a full professor and without a doubt they\u2019re recruiting senior people. But I had to try\u2014for your sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d told me. I imagined all kinds of things.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew to hers. \u201cI thought you trusted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I trust you. It\u2019s the women around you I don\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have kept my application a secret.\u201d He shuffled his feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to disappoint you when I don\u2019t get the position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to disappoint me, Gabriel, unless you keep secrets from me.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and disappeared into the dining room. When he returned, he was sipping another finger\u2019s worth of Scotch.</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting with Jeremy this week. I could ask him about you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou should stay out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what the complaint might be about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything but go to school and do my work since I got here. Except for having some conflict with Christa and that run in with Professor Pain\u2014Professor Singer. Do you think that she...?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel seemed to consider this possibility for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She was hauled in front of a Judicial Committee last year when Paul Norris filed a complaint. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t want to appear in front of them again. She isn\u2019t one of your instructors, so how would she know about your academic work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Julia paused and a look of horror came over her pretty face. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Katherine Picton reported me for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She wouldn\u2019t do that without confronting you first. And she\u2019d call me, as a courtesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the penalties for academic infractions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on the severity of the offense. They could reprimand you or give you a zero on an assignment or in a course. In extreme circumstances, they can expel you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia inhaled shakily. If she were expelled, she wouldn\u2019t be completing her MA. And that would mean that Harvard...</p><p>Gabriel fixed his gaze on her. \u201cWould Paul do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He wants to help me, not hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelfucker,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Christa?\u201d</p><p>He shifted against the leather of the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know she\u2019s a troublemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Christa, Gabriel? Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>He stood up and began pacing in front of the fireplace. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Julia grabbed the Dean\u2019s letter and walked to the front hall.</p><p>\u201cWait, what are you doing?\u201d He jogged after her.</p><p>\u201cI warned you not to lie to me. I guess I should have been more specific and told you not to be evasive, either.\u201d She retrieved her coat from the hall closet, pulling it on hastily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, eyes blazing. \u201cThen tell me about Christa.\u201d</p> <p>He pressed the heels of his hands over his eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel helped her take off her coat and escorted her back to the living room. She refused to sit down, choosing rather to stand in front of the fire, arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cIs Christa blackmailing you? Is that why you approved her thesis proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, looking out the window at the Toronto skyline. \u201cChrista Peterson has accused me of sexual harassment.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Julia stared at Gabriel, wide-eyed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrista filed a complaint with the sexual harassment officer, who referred the file to Jeremy. That\u2019s why I have to meet him this week.\u201d</p><p>Shakily, Julia lowered herself to sit in the red velvet chair. \u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in Gabriel\u2019s angular jaw. \u201cHe called me a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days ago?\u201d She clenched her teeth. \u201cHow long were you going to wait before you told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin our trip to Belize. I was going to tell you when we got back. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Julia glared at him angrily. \u201cI thought we weren\u2019t keeping secrets from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret\u2014I just wanted you to have a few days to relax before I gave you the bad news.\u201d With a sigh, he turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Christa accuse you of harassment? She\u2019s been harassing you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics of the allegations. I should have filed a complaint with the harassment officer, myself, but I didn\u2019t want to draw unwanted attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stared determinedly into the fire. \u201cI\u2019m going to call my lawyer, and we\u2019re going to see that both of these accusations are dealt with. Swiftly.\u201d</p><p>Julia stood up and clasped her hands around his waist, burying her face in his sweater.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it now, Emerson? I\u2019m in bed with a hot young law clerk from a competing firm.\u201d John Green answered his cell phone amidst the sounds of squealing and high-pitched giggles.</p><p>\u201cZip up your pants, John. This is going to take a while.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer cursed before covering his cell phone with one hand. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere, sugar.\u201d He addressed his female pelvic affiliate before scuttling off in his red bikini briefs to the washroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already on top of your harassment complaint, Emerson. You don\u2019t need to pester me. I was about to have the best sex of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to you about something else.\u201d Gabriel briefly summarized the contents of the Dean\u2019s letter to Julia.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel began to sputter and protest, but John ignored him.</p><p>\u201cListen, if they\u2019re dragging you in for sexual harassment and your twink\u2014ahem\u2014girlfriend in for some kind of academic infraction, I\u2019ll bet my Porsche that the two complaints are connected. Have you told her not to mention you during her conversation with the Dean?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gritted his teeth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should. You don\u2019t want to be drawn into anything through her. You have enough to worry about.\u201d</p><p>The Professor breathed in and out chillingly slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of cutting loose my friends, least of all Julianne. Is that clear? Or do I need to find myself another lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But she needs her own attorney. If these two matters are connected, it\u2019s likely to raise a conflict of interest for me. And I think the university might become suspicious if I represented both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d spat Gabriel. \u201cWho do you recommend?\u201d</p><p>John thought for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d recommend Soraya Harandi. She works for one of the Bay Street firms, and she has represented faculty against the university in the past. We had a thing a couple of years ago and she hates my guts. But she\u2019s good at what she does.\u201d</p><p>He grunted into the phone, apparently reaching for his BlackBerry. \u201cI\u2019ll text you her contact information. Ask your girlfriend to call Soraya\u2019s office and explain the situation to her secretary. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll jump at the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the likelihood of either complaint resulting in\u2014negative consequences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. It\u2019s possible the university will conduct an investigation and dismiss both complaints. But don\u2019t let her go in there without a lawyer, or this could turn around and bite both of you in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, John.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was laced with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019d like you to make a list of everything\u2014and I mean everything\u2014that is relevant to the harassment complaint. Any kind of evidence she might present, such as emails, texts, messages, and photographs. Send everything to me, and I\u2019ll start looking at it. And send me everything on your girlfriend too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like having to say, \u2018I told you so,\u2019 Gabriel. But I did. The university has a zero-tolerance policy with respect to fraternization, which means they can expel your girlfriend and fire you. Let\u2019s hope the two complaints are not connected and that someone reported her for failing to return her library books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure to speak with you,\u201d said Gabriel icily.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t think with your dick, you wouldn\u2019t be speaking with me. I just hope your girlfriend was worth it, because if the shit hits the fan, she\u2019s going to turn out to be an extremely costly lay.\u201d</p><p>Before John could say good-bye, Gabriel hurled the handset against the wall, watching it smash into several large pieces and falling to the hardwood floor below. Then he took several deep breaths so he could convince Julia they should simply enjoy their vacation.</p><p>That same afternoon, Dean David Aras sat in his office on St. George Street and looked at his telephone with surprise. Usually, his administrative assistant was much better at screening his calls. But Professor Katherine Picton was nothing if not persistent, and she usually received whatever she wanted. In this case, that was a conversation with the Dean of Graduate Studies at the University of Toronto.</p><p>He lifted the handset and pressed the button. \u201cHello, Professor Picton. To what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no pleasure at all, David. I demand to know why I received a letter from your office requiring me to be interviewed at one of your Stalinist proceedings.\u201d</p><p>David pressed his lips together in order to avoid biting back. She was famous, she was old, and she was a woman. He wasn\u2019t about to curse her out.</p><p>(Except in Lithuanian. Perhaps.)</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you a few questions. It will take ten minutes, tops, and you\u2019ll be on your way,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. It takes me ten minutes to walk down the front steps of my house in the winter. It will take forever to walk over to your office. I demand to know what I am being summoned to and why, or I\u2019m not coming. We can\u2019t all spend our afternoons having assistants screen our calls and make us coffee so we can dream up ways of making other people\u2019s lives miserable.\u201d</p><p>The Dean cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cA complaint has been made against the graduate student you\u2019re supervising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell? What sort of complaint?\u201d</p><p>In a very understated way, he explained the nature of the complaint that he\u2019d received.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s outrageous! Have you even met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a ridiculous complaint made against an innocent and hardworking female student. And need I remind you, David, that this is not the first time that a successful female graduate student has been slagged in a university proceeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quite aware of that. But there are related matters that I am not at liberty to discuss with you. I wish to interview you about your dealings with Miss Mitchell. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to lend any credence whatsoever to a witch hunt that is targeting my graduate student.\u201d</p><p>David frowned at her through the phone. \u201cWithout your testimony, it\u2019s quite possible a grave injustice might occur. You might be exactly what we need to clear Miss Mitchell\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCodswallop! It\u2019s your responsibility to see that justice is served. I\u2019m surprised that you have taken the complaint seriously. Quite surprised. And wipe that frown off your face, David. I can hear you sulking and I don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>The Dean suppressed a Lithuanian curse. \u201cProfessor Picton, are you refusing to answer my questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hard of hearing? Or has your quest for administrative power made you intellectually lazy? I\u2019ve said that I refuse to cooperate. I don\u2019t work for the university anymore. I am retired. Furthermore, I will be bringing this matter up over dinner tonight at the President\u2019s house. I\u2019m sure he and his guests will be most interested in how the administration of his own university is operating.</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way, the dinner party is being given in honor of Mary Asprey, the famous novelist. As an alumna, I know she takes an avid interest in the affairs of her alma mater, particularly the more patriarchal machinations. I wonder what she\u2019ll make of this?\u201d</p><p>And with that, Professor Picton hung up.</p><p>When Gabriel and Julia finally arrived at the Turtle Inn resort in Belize, it was late in the evening and the stars were already out. Julia explored their accommodations\u2014a private hut on a secluded beach\u2014while Gabriel ordered room service.</p><p>The walls of their hut were white, with the exception of a row of tall, teak panels that accordioned to open out onto the covered porch. The ceilings were a mixture of bamboo and thatch, and a large bed was centered in the room, shrouded in mosquito netting. Julia was particularly taken with the open air shower and bathtub that were located on a side veranda.</p><p>While Gabriel wrestled with the kitchen staff over the telephone, Julia quickly slipped out of her clothes and took a shower. The space was not completely closed, affording the bather a view of the ocean. But since it was dark out and they were on a private beach, there was no possibility of being surprised by anyone, apart from one\u2019s lover. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDinner will arrive in about an hour. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s going to take so long.\u201d Gabriel licked his lips as he took in the sight of Julia in her bathrobe.</p><p>In contrast, he\u2019d changed into a white linen shirt that was mostly unbuttoned with the sleeves rolled up to expose his forearms. He wore khaki pants with the hems rolled up, exposing his bare feet.</p><p>(Parenthetically, it should be noted that even his feet were attractive.)</p><p>\u201cWould you like to take a walk with me on the beach?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather do something else.\u201d She tugged him, smiling, toward the bed, and gave him a gentle push so he was seated on its edge.</p><p>He caught her by the belt of her robe. \u201cI\u2019d be content just to relax. It was a long trip.\u201d His face showed that he was in earnest, which somewhat surprised her.</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d Her voice dropped to a throaty whisper.</p><p>He pulled her so she was standing in between his knees and slid his hands to rest on her backside. \u201cWe could nap before dinner. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cGabriel, I want you to make love to me. If you\u2019re saying no, just tell me.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a very wide, very delighted grin. \u201cI\u2019d never say no to you, Miss Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Give me five minutes, Professor Emerson.\u201d</p><p>He sank down on his back, his feet still on the floor. Julia\u2019s newfound confidence was absolutely enticing. In a single sentence, she\u2019d aroused him so much that he was already suffering.</p><p>It seemed like forever, but it was really only a few minutes later when Julia emerged from the bathroom, wrapped in his Christmas gift. The black satin fabric accentuated the pink and cream of her skin, while the corset itself made her breasts look fuller and her waist smaller. Gabriel couldn\u2019t help but admire the exquisite hourglass that was Julia\u2019s now transformed figure.</p><p>His eyes hungrily regarded the merest glimpse of black lace panties, paired with black-silk stockings that were held up by a garter belt. Finally and gloriously, a pair of black pumps decorated her feet.</p><p>Gabriel nearly had a heart attack when he gazed at the shoes alone.</p> <p>\u201cBonsoir, Professeur. Vous allez bien?\u201d Julia purred.</p><p>It took a moment for him to figure out why she\u2019d made this linguistic choice, so taken as he was by her figure and her footwear.</p><p>Julia was wearing his beret.</p><p>When his eyes finally met hers, she watched him swallow hard. She pouted at him provocatively and removed her hat, tossing it at him. After he threw it aside, she walked slowly, very slowly, to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI really like my Christmas present, Professor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gulped, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the back?\u201d She pivoted her hips, watching him over her shoulder.</p><p>He reached out a finger to touch the laces that tied the corset, dragging his hand down to the panties that cut across her pert backside.</p> <p>\u201cEnough teasing, Miss Mitchell. Come here.\u201d He pulled her to him, bringing their mouths together in a forceful kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take my time unwrapping my gift\u2014with the exception of the shoes. I hope for your sake they\u2019re comfortable.\u201d</p><p>After ten minutes of knocking on the door, the room service waiter had to take their dinner back to the kitchen and await further instructions.</p><p>The instructions never came.</p><p>Long after midnight, beautiful music hung in the air from Gabriel\u2019s new playlist, including songs by Sarah McLachlan, Sting, and Matthew Barber. Julia was lying on her stomach amidst a tangle of linen sheets, drowsy and satisfied. Her back was exposed down to the two dimples that rested above the curve of her backside.</p><p>Gabriel had artfully placed part of the sheet over her bottom and retrieved his camera. He stood by the bed, snapping picture after picture until she yawned and stretched, like a sleepy cat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exquisite,\u201d he said, placing the camera to one side so he could sit by her.</p><p>She looked up with wide, happy eyes as he began running his long fingers down her spine, then gave a rueful smile. \u201cWhen you love something, you don\u2019t see its flaws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, I suppose. But you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She shifted so she could see him better, hugging her arms around a pillow. \u201cLove makes things beautiful.\u201d</p><p>A familiar tightness spread across Gabriel\u2019s lips. His hand stilled on her lower back, just over the dimples.</p><p>She read the unspoken question in his eyes. \u201cYes, Gabriel, you\u2019re beautiful to me. The more I know you, the more I see who you really are and the more beautiful you become.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, the light, appreciative kiss of a teenage suitor, and ran his fingers through her long, brown hair. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re hungry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at the door. \u201cI think we missed our dinner because we were feasting on\u2014ah\u2014other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what a feast it was, Professor. At least there\u2019s a fruit basket.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, wrapping the sheet around her torso, while he walked over to the large basket that was sitting on the coffee table. He found a Swiss army knife in the kitchenette, made an adjustment to the music, and brought a mango with him to bed.</p><p>\u201cI needed to match the song to the fruit,\u201d he said, his blue eyes sparkling. \u201cNow lie back.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart rate begin to increase.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need this.\u201d Boldly, he pulled the sheet away. Now they were both naked.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s singing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce Cockburn.\u201d</p><p>He began cutting the mango slowly, his eyes exploring Julia\u2019s body.</p><p>She gave him a quizzical look. \u201cNaked lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a naked midnight snack.\u201d</p><p>With deft fingers he cut a small slice of the fruit, juice dripping from his hands and onto her abdomen. She arched an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He peered at the juice with an impish expression. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take care of that.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth as he leaned forward to feed her. \u201cYou have a feeding fetish,\u201d she said, licking her lips and angling for more.</p><p>He bowed before her in obeisance, his tongue snaking out to capture the liquid from her stomach. \u201cPardon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Julia groaned incoherently.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a fetish so much as an act that gives me joy. I like to care for you, and there\u2019s something sensual about sharing food with a lover.\u201d He eschewed her lips to kiss her shoulder, the tip of his tongue tasting her skin. Withdrawing, he cut another slice of fruit. A few droplets fell like liquid sunshine on her left breast.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Forgive my mess.\u201d</p><p>He ran a sticky hand up and down her ribs, tantalizing one of his favorite erogenous zones, before placing his lips to her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d she managed as his wet mouth found her nipple.</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall saying that to you once. And you promised it would be a sweet death.\u201d</p><p>Julia opened her mouth to indicate her willingness to accept another piece. \u201cI should have said a sticky death.\u201d</p><p>He placed a piece of mango on her tongue before stroking her lower lip with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of that. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, she moved so she was straddling his lap and placed her hands on either side of his face, pulling him toward her. They kissed passionately for a moment before she took the mango and knife from his hand and placed a piece temptingly in her mouth.</p><p>He gave her a heated look before he brought their lips together, tugging the piece of fruit away with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d she hummed. \u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t think I ever saw the security video from our date at the museum.\u201d</p><p>She gently squeezed a piece of mango over his chest and began kissing and sucking across the droplet trail.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014ah \u2014\u201d Gabriel had trouble finding his words. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She sat back and languidly ate a piece of fruit in front of him, licking her fingers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show it to you later.\u201d He pulled her into a tight embrace, his hands sliding up and down her back. Then, when he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, he tossed everything aside so he could lift her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, slightly alarmed.</p><p>\u201cTo the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur beach is private.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose and carried her down to the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cSomeone will see us,\u201d she protested as he stepped into the sea.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only a little sliver of a moon. Anyone who came by would only see you in silhouette. And what a view.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her long and good, adoring her face and neck with his lips as the gentle tide lapped against them. Then he placed her on her feet so he could press every inch of his body to hers.</p><p>\u201cSee how we fit together?\u201d His voice was urgent. \u201cWe\u2019re a perfect match.\u201d</p><p>They cupped salt water in their hands, cleaning one another\u2019s flesh. Julia couldn\u2019t help but lean forward to kiss his tattoo, reveling in the way the taste of the sea mingled with the flavor of his skin.</p><p>He began kissing her neck and she could feel him smile against her. \u201cHave you ever seen the film From Here to Eternity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need to introduce you to it.\u201d He took her hand and led her to the beach, where he lowered himself to the sand. \u201cPlease,\u201d he beckoned, motioning that she should lie atop him.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Her heart thumped wildly in her chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, here. I want to be inside you, but I don\u2019t want the sand to scratch your skin.\u201d Gabriel pulled her down, and his mouth sought hers eagerly as the waves gently lapped at their legs. When they cried out their pleasure, the pale moon smiled.</p><p>A tropical rainstorm moved through the area the following morning. While the raindrops tapped against the roof of the hut, the couple made love slowly in a bed covered with mosquito netting. They found their rhythm in the steady dance of the rain.</p><p>When they were both blissful, he suggested that they rinse the sweat and humidity from their skin in the large bathtub on the veranda. Reclining in vanilla-scented bubbles, Julia leaned against his chest as he wound his arms around her middle. When she was in his arms she could almost forget the troubles that waited for them in Toronto.</p><p>She felt safe with Gabriel. It was not that he was a powerful man, although his wealth gave him some measure of strength. It was the way he\u2019d confronted her bullies\u2014first, Christa, then Simon. And the fact that he\u2019d excoriated her father for a lifetime of neglect.</p><p>The vulnerability of the lovers\u2019 bed was well-known to Julia now. She knew nakedness and intimacy, desire and burning need, and deep, deep satisfaction. But she also knew that Gabriel loved her and wished to protect her. In his arms, she felt safe, for the first time in her life.</p><p>\u201cSaturday mornings were my favorite when I was a child.\u201d Gabriel interrupted her musings with a wistful voice.</p><p>Julia traced his lifeline with a single finger. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was passed out. I could watch cartoons. This was before we lost our cable.\u201d He gave her a half smile, and Julia tried not to cry, thinking of Gabriel as a sad little boy whose only happiness was a few hours of cartoons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI used to make my own breakfast. Cold cereal or peanut butter on toast.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhen we ran out of milk, which we did frequently, I\u2019d use orange juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful. It wasn\u2019t even real orange juice\u2014it was Tang.\u201d He stroked her hair absentmindedly. \u201cI\u2019m sure a psychiatrist would have much to say about the connection between my childhood and my attachment to fine things.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively, Julia turned and threw her arms around his neck, causing a great tidal wave of water to slosh over the sides of the tub.</p> <p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>She buried her face into his shoulder. \u201cNothing. I just love you so much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her gently. \u201cThose things happened thirty years ago. Grace was more of a mother to me. I regret not being with her when she died. I didn\u2019t have the chance to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew, Gabriel. She knew how much you loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your childhood was far more painful.\u201d</p> <p>She sniffled against his shoulder but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf meanness makes people ugly, your mother must have been hideous. My mother was neglectful and indifferent, but never cruel.\u201d</p><p>He paused, wondering if he should broach the topic both of them had been avoiding since the advent of their vacation.</p><p>\u201cOnce I became acquainted with Christa Peterson, I thought that she was ugly. I owe you a debt for keeping me from sleeping with her. Although I\u2019d like to think that even intoxicated I have better taste than that.\u201d</p><p>Julia withdrew, sitting back slightly and toying with the end of a lock of her hair.</p><p>He lifted her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like thinking about you and Christa together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a mercy you saved me from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to end your career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth will out. You said yourself that Paul heard her aspirations with respect to me. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll wash out of the program and we\u2019ll both be rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to flunk,\u201d Julia said quietly. \u201cThen I\u2019d be just as ugly as her, taking pleasure in her misfortune.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression grew fierce. \u201cShe was mean to you on more than one occasion. You should have cursed her out when you had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old to call people names, whether they deserve it or not. We don\u2019t live in a nursery school.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tapped the end of her nose gently with his finger. \u201cAnd where does that wisdom come from? Sesame Street?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe benefits of a Catholic education,\u201d she muttered. \u201cOr maybe a little Lillian Hellman.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows crinkled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian Hellman wrote a play called The Little Foxes. In it a young girl tells her mother that some people eat the earth, like locusts, and others stand around and watch them do it. She promises her mother she isn\u2019t going to stand around and watch anymore. Instead of standing around and watching Christa\u2019s ugliness, we need to fight her with something stronger, like charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople underestimate you, Julianne. Nevertheless, it pains me when people fail to give you the respect that you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Julia shrugged. \u201cThere will always be Christas in this world. And sometimes, we become the Christas.\u201d</p><p>He placed his chin on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a Dantean, you\u2019re a Franciscan.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI doubt the Franciscans would approve of me having sex, unmarried, outside, in a bathtub.\u201d</p><p>He brought his mouth to her ear. \u201cIs that a promise?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head and stroked his eyebrows, one at a time. \u201cI like to think of you as a little boy, sweet and inquisitive.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t know how sweet I was, but I was definitely inquisitive. Especially about girls.\u201d He leaned over to kiss her, and when his lips left hers she smiled.</p><p>\u201cSee? Any boy who can kiss like that can\u2019t be all bad. St. Francis would approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell you, but your beloved Francis wasn\u2019t always right. There\u2019s a passage in the Inferno in which he argues with a demon over the soul of Guido da Montefeltro. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head, so Gabriel recited the text for her in Italian.</p><p>\u201cFrancesco venne poi com\u2019io fu\u2019 morto,</p><p>(Francis came afterward, when I was dead,)</p><p>per me; ma un d\u2019i neri cherubini</p><p>(for me; but one of the black Cherubim)</p><p>li disse: \u2018Non portar: non mi far torto.</p><p>(said to him: \u201cTake him not; do me no wrong.)Venir se ne dee gi\u00f9 tra \u2018 miei meschini</p><p>(He must come down among my servitors,)</p><p>perch\u00e9 diede \u2018l consiglio frodolente,</p><p>(because he gave the fraudulent advice,)</p><p>dal quale in qua stato li sono a\u2019 crini;</p><p>(from which time forth I have been at his hair;)ch\u2019assolver non si pu\u00f2 chi non si pente,</p><p>(For who repents not cannot be absolved,)</p><p>n\u00e9 pentere e volere insieme puossi</p><p>(nor can one both repent and will at once,)</p><p>per la contradizion che nol consente\u2019.\u201d</p><p>(because of the contradiction which consents not\u201d.) \u201cSo you see, Julia, even St. Francis was wrong about people on occasion. He thought Guido\u2019s soul belonged in Paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s like Francis to think the best of someone\u2014to think that Guido\u2019s repentance was real and to fight for his soul,\u201d she protested. \u201cEven if in the end he was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Francis gave up too quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at her intently. \u201cIf it were your soul I was after, all the dark Cherubim in Hell couldn\u2019t keep me from you.\u201d</p><p>A shiver snaked up and down Julia\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cI would have done whatever it took to save you.\u201d His voice and his expression were grave. \u201cEven if that meant I had to spend eternity in Hell.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel and Julia spent their last full day of vacation in and out of the ocean. They sunned themselves, then relaxed in the shade with a beer and an umbrella drink. Julia nodded off in her lounge chair, her large floppy hat discarded on the sand.</p><p>Gabriel loved to watch her sleep\u2014the way her chest rose and fell with her gentle breathing. The way her lips curled back with the occasional sigh. She looked so peaceful. Gabriel was convinced that Grace would have been delighted that he and Julianne were a couple. No doubt she would already be pressuring him to put a ring on her finger and pick out china patterns.</p><p>There had been so many moments during their Valentine\u2019s weekend that he had wanted to bend his knee and ask her to marry him. But not only was he worried about enacting a clich\u00e9, he was worried about her future. It was likely they were about to be embroiled in a scandal that could jeopardize his career and her admission to Harvard.</p><p>Even if the complaint against her was investigated and dismissed, she would need to be able to complete her MA free of other distractions. He was sure that she\u2019d want the full university experience at Harvard without the pressure of planning a wedding. And there was still the question of what he would do\u2014whether he would be able to take a sabbatical. That is, if he survived Christa Peterson\u2019s harassment complaint.</p><p>Despite the fact that he found the words marry me on his tongue on more than one occasion, he bit them back. There would be a time and a place for a proposal. That time and place should be in their orchard, sacred as it was to both of them. Not to mention the fact that it would be a polite gesture to alert Tom to his intentions before broaching the topic with Julianne. Without doubt, he wanted her to be his wife. And no matter what the next few months brought, he would make her his.</p><p>Later that evening, Gabriel found himself brimming with emotion, the fruit of much contemplation and the pleasure he always found in Julianne\u2019s company. They\u2019d just returned from the resort restaurant. Julia had planned on visiting the washroom to clean the makeup from her face, but he caught her wrist and wordlessly led her to the bed.</p><p>He kissed her softly and began to undress her, his eyes shining with worship and need. He took his time, adoring shoulders and arms and naked skin, his mouth beginning to make eager promises as she arched beneath his touch.</p><p>He pulled her astride him, gazing up with an expression of wonder mixed with desire. She moved her hips to taunt him a little, closing her eyes in order to let the feeling take center stage.</p><p>After a few minutes, Gabriel flipped her so she was on her back and he was kneeling between her legs. She let out a cry as he entered her.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmmm,\u201d she hummed. \u201cYou just surprised me.\u201d She brought her hands to rest on his back, urging him forward.</p><p>Gabriel liked her on top, she knew it. He would gaze up at her adoringly and touch and tease. He would praise her sexiness, for he knew that even after these few months she was slightly self-conscious at being so exposed. Julia was surprised that he moved them so his body was covering hers, his lips at her neck, when they\u2019d enjoyed that position several times already.</p><p>A few more kisses and he was pressing a hand to her face, his eyes dark and desperate.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d She searched his expression.</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head before opening them again.</p><p>Julia gaped at what she saw\u2014insecurity, passion, hope, want, and need. She threw back her head from time to time as groans of pleasure escaped her lips.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he whispered against her throat as his movements increased to a fevered pitch. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s response was lost in a series of pants as she grew closer and closer to her release.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014ah, hell.\u201d Gabriel cursed as he climaxed, knowing that Julia had yet to do so. He tried to keep moving, hoping that she would follow him, but it was not to be.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He hid his face against her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I enjoyed myself.\u201d She tangled her fingers in his hair, tugging playfully, before pressing a kiss to his face. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>A self-deprecating mumble escaped him. He moved to lie beside her and began to pet between her legs, but she pressed her knees together. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened with determination. \u201cYes, I do. Let me.\u201d</p><p>She stilled his hand. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to lose me if you fail to give me an orgasm now and then.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s life.\u201d She kissed his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to be perfect, in bed or out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless you for that.\u201d He kissed her slowly, sighing when she pulled away to nest in his arms. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you insist, there is something you could do for me...\u201d</p><p>Gabriel moved so quickly Julia was torn between shock and the urge to laugh. But as soon as he touched her, she stopped laughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Later that evening Gabriel lay on his back in the center of the bed, underneath the mosquito netting. Julia rested her head just below his pectorals, her arm wrapped around his waist.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d His voice came out of the candle-soaked darkness, as he ran his fingers over the top of her head and down to trace the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I ever thought I could be.\u201d</p> <p>Julia smiled against his chest and kissed the skin there.</p><p>\u201cThings seem\u2014different since we came back from Italy,\u201d he prompted, his hand still gliding across neck and shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to be grateful for. We have each other. I have Harvard. Doctor Nicole has been helping me. I feel like I\u2019m finally putting the pieces back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd the way that we make love, in general, you\u2019re happy with that?\u201d</p><p>Now Julia lifted her head so she could gaze up into his concerned blue eyes. \u201cOf course.\u201d She laughed quietly. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tell that I please your body. But your body is not your mind, or your heart.\u201d</p><p>He seemed embarrassed, and Julia repented of her decision to laugh.</p><p>\u201cTonight was an aberration. But even if it wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d work through it. Are you happy with the way that we make love?\u201d She sounded shy.</p><p>\u201cYes, very much. I feel it changing\u2014I feel the connection deepening.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI just wondered if you felt it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think this is a dream. Believe me, I\u2019m happy.\u201d She leaned up to kiss him and then rested her head on his chest again. \u201cWhy are you asking me these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you see yourself in the future?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be a professor. I want to be with you.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was on the quiet side, but remarkably assertive.</p><p>He began threading the sheet in between his fingers. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather find a nice man who could give you children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ask me if I\u2019m happy with one breath, and push me away with the next.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she gently took hold of his chin, forcing his eyes to hers.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to find a nice man to have a child with. I want a child with you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stared at her incredulously, his blue eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get to the point where we\u2019re healthy enough to open our home to a child. But if we do, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a little boy or girl who is supposed to be our child. Grace and Richard adopted you; we can do the same.\u201d</p><p>Her face grew pained. \u201cUnless you decide you don\u2019t want that. Or you don\u2019t want that with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I want you.\u201d The intensity of his voice matched his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like to make promises to you. But I want us to wait a little before we have that conversation. Does that trouble you?\u201d He reached out a finger to toy with the diamond in her ear.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t need a narrator to understand what his physical gesture meant. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that any hesitation on my part is due to lack of feeling.\u201d Gabriel gave voice to her unspoken fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours. All of me. And I\u2019m so glad we won\u2019t be apart next year. The thought of losing you was torturous.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if he understood.</p><p>\u201cNow come here, Julia, so I can worship you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell.\u201d The tall, dark-haired woman in the power suit strolled into the corner office, shook Julia\u2019s hand, and sat behind her large desk.</p><p>Miss Soraya Harandi was of Iranian descent, with light, unfreckled skin and cascades of blue-black hair. Her mouth was wide and full, and her dark eyes sparkled. She was not necessarily beautiful, but she was striking, and Julia could not help but stare.</p><p>Soraya chuckled.</p><p>Julia immediately looked down at her book bag and began to fidget with it.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s something you cannot do in front of the Dean. No matter what he says or does, you cannot look away. It makes you look guilty and weak.\u201d Soraya softened her criticism with a smile. \u201cLaw is as much about psychology as it is about precedent. Now, why don\u2019t you tell me what led up to the Dean\u2019s letter?\u201d</p><p>Julia took a deep breath and told her story, beginning when she was seventeen and ending with the letter from the Dean\u2019s office. She only left out a few details.</p><p>Soraya listened carefully, jotting down notes on her laptop and nodding on occasion. When Julia finished, Soraya was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a story. Since the Dean hasn\u2019t disclosed what the complaint is about, let\u2019s not assume it\u2019s about your boyfriend. Although we should prepare for that scenario. Was your relationship with Professor Emerson absolutely consensual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had a sexual relationship with one of your professors or teaching assistants before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible he seduced you solely for his own amusement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Gabriel loves me.\u201d</p><p>Soraya appeared relieved. \u201cGood. Well, good for you personally, not so good depending on the complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your relationship was consensual, then the university can pursue disciplinary action against both of you. If you were a victim, then they\u2019ll only pursue him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a victim. We are in a relationship, and we waited until after the semester was over before we became involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia was incredulous. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to your story, you had an amorous relationship with him beginning around the end of October. You waited until after the semester was over to sleep with him. But given the way the non-fraternization policy is written, you violated it. Who knows about your relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family. My father. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the student who accused your boyfriend of sexual harassment?\u201d</p><p>Julia gritted her teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she knows. But she hates me.\u201d</p><p>Soraya tapped her chin with her pen. \u201cIf you were accused of violating the non-fraternization policy, what kind of evidence, other than your testimony, could you offer for the fact that you weren\u2019t having a sexual relationship with him while you were his student?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think the complaint has to do with Gabriel? The academic conduct policy covers things like plagiarism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Dean Aras. He doesn\u2019t waste his precious time with plagiarism cases.\u201d</p><p>Julia sat back in her chair. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope someone is accusing you of a minor academic offense and that Dean Aras is simply taking a personal interest in your case. But just in case, what kind of evidence can you offer to prove you weren\u2019t trading sex for grades?\u201d</p><p>Julia flushed deeply. \u201cUm, there is something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a virgin before we went to Italy.\u201d</p><p>Soraya stared at her as if she was a mythical creature, such as, say, a heterosexual man who knew the difference between Manolo Blahniks and Christian Louboutins.</p><p>\u201cDo you have medical proof of that? Such as a doctor\u2019s note?\u201d</p><p>Julia squirmed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no point in bringing it up. Did anyone from the university see you and Gabriel together during the semester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as far as I know. Although we went to a dance club with his sister back in September.\u201d</p><p>Soraya pursed her lips. \u201cBringing up the fact that you are a friend of his family is not a good idea. It establishes a possible conflict of interest. And being seen in his company in a public venue was not an intelligent choice, Miss Mitchell. But frankly, he bears more blame than you because he should have known better.</p><p>\u201cSince we don\u2019t know the nature of the complaint, our strategy should be to gather as much information as possible from the meeting while giving nothing away. That will buy us time to prepare for any disciplinary proceedings, should they arise. Hopefully, they won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAt the meeting with the Dean, I will speak for you. Since they haven\u2019t disclosed the nature of the complaint, it\u2019s possible that the complaint is specious and that they know this. We won\u2019t add fuel to their funeral pyre.\u201d</p><p>Soraya looked at Julia\u2019s downcast face and frowned. \u201cYou have to have confidence. You have to believe that the complaint is frivolous and that you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. I\u2019ve had dealings with the university\u2019s judiciary before, and I was fairly successful. I will be successful with your case too.\u201d</p><p>Julia took small comfort in Soraya\u2019s confidence, but some comfort was better than nothing.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, I would like a list of anyone who might have filed a complaint against you and why, and a detailed account of all your interactions with Miss Peterson. I\u2019ll have one of my assistants perform some background checks. I\u2019ll also place a call to a contact of mine at the university and see what I can find out.</p><p>\u201cUntil this matter is settled, you and Professor Emerson need to cool it. Don\u2019t be seen in public together. Don\u2019t talk to him about what you and I discuss. If the complaint is about fraternization, he will have his own counsel, who will look after his interests. I don\u2019t want my defense of you compromised by your pillow talk.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes flashed with a momentary heat. \u201cGabriel is much more than just a boyfriend. If I\u2019m in danger so is he. Our relationship was consensual, and I have no interest in being defended at his expense. Any blame we have is equal between us.\u201d</p><p>Soraya gazed at Julia curiously.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s his position? You told my secretary that John Green is Gabriel\u2019s attorney. Why isn\u2019t John representing you, if you and Gabriel are determined to show a united front?\u201d</p><p>Julia opened her mouth to form an answer, but none occurred to her.</p><p>Soraya smiled sympathetically. \u201cListen, you aren\u2019t the first student to find herself in this situation. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s upsetting and confusing. But you need to realize that if the complaint against you and your boyfriend escalates, it\u2019s quite possible he will break things off with you in order to protect his job. You need to prepare yourself in case he decides to throw you to the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never do that. He loves me. We\u2019re talking about moving in together. And\u2014other things.\u201d</p><p>Soraya gave her a condescending look. \u201cLove can be easily killed, especially by unemployment. But let\u2019s take things one step at a time.</p><p>\u201cGabriel has sent over a retainer, which I will return. I think it\u2019s best for me to represent you pro bono.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded uncomfortably. She had forgotten about the legal fees. \u201cI will pay you, but it might take some time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point of taking a case for the good is so one can further the good. I don\u2019t see much good coming out of taking your money. You should be spending it on text books and moving expenses to Massachusetts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soraya\u2019s smile tightened. \u201cI am not a fan of the university\u2019s sexual inquisitions. Anything I can do to embarrass or humiliate Dean Aras is definitely for the good. Believe me, representing your interests will be one of the few pleasures I\u2019ve had recently. I should be paying you for the privilege.\u201d</p><p>Later that evening Julia was curled up into a ball, trying to sleep in Gabriel\u2019s bed. He was in his study, furiously researching all the university policies that applied to graduate students, trying to figure out what had possibly come to the attention of the Dean.</p><p>The thought of Gabriel having to do that for her\u2014the thought of his career possibly being threatened because of her, combined with the possibility of losing Harvard, made the tears come. It was all so overwhelming. And the worst part was not knowing what the specific danger was.</p><p>She wiped the tears away, willing herself to be strong. Gabriel walked into the bedroom to check on her, and upon seeing her face, slipped into bed behind her.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweetheart. Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d He paused. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have continued working if I\u2019d known you were so upset. We\u2019ve hired the best lawyer and we\u2019re going to fight this complaint. It\u2019s quite possible it\u2019s simply a misunderstanding and by Friday evening, it will all be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if this is about us?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel clenched his teeth. \u201cThen we\u2019ll deal with it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the harassment complaint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. You focus on your thesis and your studies, and you let me worry about myself. I\u2019m not going to let anyone hurt you. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled her onto her back and began sweeping soft kisses across her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Gabriel stroked her hair and pressed a kiss to the tip of her nose. \u201cI know. But no matter what, I won\u2019t let them keep you from Harvard. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d He gave her a pained look. \u201cWhat can I do, Julia? I don\u2019t know how to\u2014comfort you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel kissed her mouth\u2014the hesitant, light kiss of a boy who was unsure how the girl next door would react. He needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>Julia responded by wrapping his hair around her fingers and pulling his lips to hers, kissing him fiercely and coaxing his tongue into her mouth.</p> <p>He kissed her back but with restraint, then pulled away before pressing their foreheads together. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She tugged at him, running her hands across his broad shoulders and down the sinews of his back, pulling him toward her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make love to you while you\u2019re sad. I would feel like I was hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather I ran a hot bath or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking love with you makes me happy because it reminds me how much you love me. Please. I need to feel like you want me.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows knitted together. \u201cOf course I want you, Julia. I just don\u2019t want to take advantage.\u201d</p><p>She was not the sort of woman who made many demands, and what demands she made were almost always good. And almost always about what was good for him.</p> <p>Gabriel knew this, and it pained him to deny her and those large, sad brown eyes. But the trails of her tears had dampened his libido. He would far rather have held her tightly and tried to soothe her by being close, than to attempt an act he would not be able to perform.</p><p>Her face told him that she needed him, that she needed this and them and the conjunction of body and soul. While he stroked her hair, deciding what to do, he realized something about himself. No matter what his therapist had intimated, he was not a sex addict. He was not a wanton hedonist with a massive hunger who was willing to, as Scott had put it, screw anything female and attractive.</p><p>Julianne had changed him. He loved her. And even if she begged him, he couldn\u2019t become aroused while seeing her in pain.</p><p>She was still staring up at him, her fingers tracing up and down his naked back. He decided to give her part of what she wanted, to touch and caress her, focusing on distracting her with pleasurable feelings and sensations, hoping that it would be enough. He kissed her, slowing their pace to a gentle exploration. She ran her fingers through his hair, anchoring him to her as she softly scratched his scalp. Even in the midst of her sorrow and need, she was kind.</p><p>He feathered his lips to her neck and her ear where he whispered about how much she\u2019d changed him. How much happier he was now that she was his.</p><p>She began to sigh as he adored her neck, dipping a playful tongue into the hollow at the base of her throat before kissing it chastely. He nipped at her collarbones, gently pulling aside the thin strap of her tank top so the white slope of her shoulder was bare to his mouth.</p><p>She would have removed her tank top for him, exposing her breasts, but he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He wound their fingers together and kissed the back of her hand, extending her arm so he could draw the flesh of her inner elbow into his mouth, pausing when she began to moan. He kissed every inch of her, gliding strong hands across soft skin, taking his cue from the heat that shot across her flesh and the sounds that escaped her lips.</p><p>When he was satisfied that her tears had stopped and she was asking him for more, he cast their clothes aside and knelt between her legs.</p><p>Soon she was shaking and crying out his name. In itself, this was the moment he craved most, even beyond his own climax\u2014the sound of his name tripping from her lips amidst the waves of her satisfaction. She\u2019d been so shy the first few times they made love. Every time she said Gabriel in that ecstatic, breathy whisper, a precious warmth overtook him.</p><p>This is what love is, he thought. Being naked and bare before one\u2019s lover and unashamedly calling her name in need.</p><p>In his own orgasm, he reciprocated, telling her that he loved her. It was inextricably linked in his mind and experience\u2014sex and love and Julianne. The holy three.</p><p>He held her tightly while they caught their breath, smiling to himself. He was so proud of her, so happy she could give voice to her desires, even when she was sad. He kissed her softly and was grateful to see that her smile had returned.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Julianne, for teaching me how to love.\u201d</p><p>Paul walked into the departmental office on Wednesday and was shocked by what he saw.</p><p>Julia was standing in front of the mailboxes, her skin pale and dull, with dark circles under her eyes. As he made his way over to her, she lifted her head and smiled at him thinly. Her smile alone pained him.</p><p>Before he could ask her what was wrong, Christa Peterson breezed in, her large Michael Kors bag dangling from her wrist. She looked remarkably well rested, and her eyes were bright. She was wearing red. Not cherry red or blood red, but scarlet. The color of triumph and power.</p><p>She saw Paul and Julia together and cackled quietly.</p><p>Paul\u2019s dark eyes shifted from Julia to Christa and back again. He watched as Julia hid her face while she checked her mailbox.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I think I\u2019m coming down with a cold.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head. He would have pressed her, gently this time, but Professor Martin entered the office at that moment.</p><p>Julia took one look at him and quickly picked up her messenger bag and her coat, hoping to make a break for the door.</p><p>Paul stopped her. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee? I was going to walk over to Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m pretty tired. I think I need to go home.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes glanced down at her bare neck, her bare unmarked neck, and moved back to her face.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks, Paul. I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and watched her turn to leave, but before she could enter the hallway, he followed her. \u201cOn second thought, I should head home now too. I can walk with you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Julia bit her lip but nodded, and the two friends exited the building into the bone chilling winter air. She wrapped her Magdalen College scarf around her neck, shivering against the wind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an Oxford scarf,\u201d Paul observed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy it in Oxford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. It was a gift.\u201d</p><p>Owen, he thought. I guess he can\u2019t be a complete bonehead if he went to Oxford. Then again, Emerson went to Oxford...</p><p>\u201cI really like the Phillies cap you gave me. I\u2019m a Red Sox fan, but I\u2019ll wear it with pride, except when I\u2019m in Vermont. My dad would burn it if I wore it on the farm.\u201d</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t help but smile, and Paul mirrored her expression.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, a few days.\u201d She shrugged uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a cold. They wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>Paul stole glances at her while they walked past the Royal Ontario Museum, snowflakes swirling around them and the crystal monstrosity that was the north wall.</p><p>\u201cHas Christa been hassling you? You seemed upset when she walked into the office.\u201d</p><p>Julia stumbled in the ankle-deep snow, and Paul quickly reached out one of his large paws to steady her.</p><p>\u201cCareful. There could be black ice under there.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him and began to walk a little more slowly after he released her.</p><p>\u201cIf you slip again, grab hold of me. I don\u2019t go down. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him sideways, completely innocently, only to see him blush. Julia had never seen a rugby player blush before.</p><p>(It was rumored to be impossible.)</p><p>\u201cUm, what I meant is that I\u2019m too heavy. You wouldn\u2019t be able to pull me over.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t that heavy.\u201d</p><p>Paul smiled to himself at the perceived compliment.</p><p>\u201cHas Christa been rude to you?\u201d</p><p>Julia looked down at the snow-covered sidewalk in front of them. \u201cI\u2019ve been staying up late every night working on my thesis. Professor Picton is very demanding. Last week she rejected several pages of my Purgatorio translation. I\u2019ve been redoing it, and it just takes so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could help you. I mean, you could email your translations to me before you give them to her so I could check them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but you\u2019re busy with your own stuff. You don\u2019t have time for my problems.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking and placed a light hand on her arm. \u201cOf course I have time for you. You\u2019re working on love and lust, and I\u2019m working on pleasure. Some of our translations will overlap. It would be good practice for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not working on love and lust anymore. Professor Picton made me change my topic to a comparison between courtly love and the friendship between Virgil and Dante.\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged. \u201cSome of the translations will still overlap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re working on the same passage we could compare translations. I don\u2019t want to bother you with stuff that\u2019s unrelated to your project.\u201d She looked over at him tentatively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSend me what you have and what your deadlines are, and I\u2019ll look at it. No problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She appeared relieved.</p><p>He withdrew his hand, and they began walking again. \u201cDid you know that the Chair of Italian Studies sent out an email announcement about your admission to Harvard? He said that you won a pretty big fellowship.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cUm, no. I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it was sent to everyone else. Emerson made me print out the email and post it on the bulletin board next to his office, after he insisted that I highlight all the important information, including your name, with a bright yellow marker. Figures. He was nothing but rude to you while you were in his seminar, and now he\u2019s probably going to take credit for your admission to Harvard. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, but she didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She flushed slightly under his scrutiny. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, spit it out. What were you thinking just now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, I was just wondering if you\u2019d seen Christa hovering around the department? Or Professor Emerson\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank God. It looks as if she\u2019s moved on to someone else. She knows better than to talk to me. I\u2019m just waiting for her to give me a chance to tell her off.\u201d Paul winked and patted her shoulder fraternally. \u201cShe better not give you a hard time. Or I have a few stories I could tell.\u201d</p><p>On Thursday, Julia met with her therapist in preparation for her meeting with the Dean, which was scheduled for Friday morning.</p><p>Recognizing that Julia needed to discuss what was happening, Nicole set aside her goals for that session and listened patiently before offering her opinion. \u201cStress can be very destructive to our health, so it\u2019s important to deal with it adequately. Some people prefer to talk about their problems, while others prefer to think about them. How have you dealt with stress in the past?\u201d</p><p>Julia fidgeted with her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve kept quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you share your concerns with your boyfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can. But I don\u2019t want to upset him. He\u2019s worried about me as it is.\u201d</p><p>Nicole nodded sagely. \u201cWhen you care about someone, it\u2019s understandable that you would want to protect them from pain. And that\u2019s perfectly appropriate on some occasions. But on others, you run the risk of shouldering more than your fair share of stress or responsibility. Can you see why that might be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it when Gabriel keeps things from me. I feel like a child. I\u2019d rather have him share things than shut me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Gabriel feels the same way, that he worries about you shutting him out. Have you discussed this with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to. I\u2019ve told him I want to be equals, that I don\u2019t want to keep secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And what was his response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe either wants to take care of me or he\u2019s worried about disappointing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does that make you feel?\u201d</p> <p>Julia gestured with her hands as she tried to find the words. \u201cI don\u2019t want his money. It makes me feel poor and dependent and\u2014and helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gives me so much already, and I can\u2019t reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it important to you that your relationship be reciprocal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Nicole smiled kindly. \u201cNo relationship is absolutely reciprocal. Sometimes, when couples try to split everything in half, they discover that the relationship is not a partnership but a bean counting exercise. Striving for reciprocity in a relationship can be unhealthy.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand, striving to have a partnership in which each partner is valued equally and shares both burdens and responsibilities can be healthy. In other words, it isn\u2019t a problem if he makes more money than you. But he needs to understand that you want to contribute to the relationship, perhaps not financially but in other ways, and that those ways should be respected just as much as the money. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I like that idea. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for protecting one another...\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou could make a biological argument as to why men feel the need to protect their women and children. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s a fact. Men tend to find their self-worth in actions and accomplishments. If you refuse to let him do things for you, he\u2019ll feel useless and superfluous. He wants to know that he can take care of you and protect you, and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Partners should want to protect one another. But like any view, it has its extremes and it has its middle.</p><p>\u201cWhat you and your boyfriend should do is to strive for the middle. Allow him to take care of you in some ways, while exerting your independence in others. And you should impress upon him the need for you to take care of him too.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded. The concept of moderation appealed to her. She wanted to care for Gabriel, and she wanted him to care for her, but she didn\u2019t want to be a burden, and she didn\u2019t want him to look at her as if she was broken. But sorting all of that out practically was a different matter.</p><p>\u201cSome men have what I call chivalry syndrome\u2014they want to protect their women as if they were absolutely helpless. And this might be romantic and exciting for a time, but eventually reality will set in and it will become stifling and patronizing. When one partner does all the protecting and the other does all the receiving, it\u2019s unhealthy.</p><p>\u201cOf course, some women have the feminine equivalent of chivalry syndrome\u2014wounded duck attachment. They seek out men who are bad boys or broken and afflicted and attempt to fix them. But we\u2019ll table that discussion for another day.</p><p>\u201cAt his extreme, a chivalrous male can do all kinds of rash things to protect his woman, including riding into battle on his horse, or taking up arms against thousands of Persians, when he should be running in the opposite direction. Discretion is the better part of valor.\u201d She chuckled slightly. \u201cDid you see the film 300?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the Battle of Thermopylae, when three hundred Spartans held off two hundred and fifty thousand Persians before being defeated. Herodotus writes about it.\u201d</p><p>Julia regarded Nicole with no little interest. How many psychologists could cite Herodotus?</p><p>\u201cKing Leonidas was an extreme case. One could argue that his last stand was precipitated by political concerns rather than chivalry. But my point is that sometimes the chivalrous man ends up doing more damage through his protection than can be done by the force threatening his partner. Spartan women used to tell their husbands and sons to come home carrying their shields or on them. If you found yourself in that situation, you\u2019d probably prefer that Gabriel didn\u2019t die holding the line against thousands of Persians and came home to you, instead.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded in absolute agreement.</p><p>\u201cIn your conversations with Gabriel, you might want to talk about that\u2014how you feel about being protected to his own detriment, how you should share your risks and responsibilities, why you want to be a partner rather than a child or a helpless female.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Gabriel would be willing to attend joint sessions with us even though he isn\u2019t coming in privately.\u201d</p><p>Julia wasn\u2019t quite sure that she\u2019d heard Nicole correctly. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>Nicole smiled. \u201cI said that in your conversations with Gabriel, you might want to talk about how you feel protected\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Julia interrupted. \u201cI meant the last part. You said that Gabriel isn\u2019t coming in anymore?\u201d</p><p>Nicole froze. \u201cUm, that was very unprofessional of me. I shouldn\u2019t speak to you about another client and his counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he stop seeing Winston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t say.\u201d Nicole shifted in her seat. \u201cNow, we should probably discuss some ways in which you can deal with stress before your meeting tomorrow...\u201d</p><p>The Dean of Graduate Studies favored formality and refinement. For these reasons, he always conducted meetings in a large, wood-paneled conference room adjacent to his office on St. George Street. Professor Jeremy Martin, the Chair of Italian Studies, sat at his right in a large, high-backed chair that was vaguely medieval in style, behind an imposing, dark wood table that ran almost the width of the room.</p><p>Two small folding chairs were centered before the table, and that is where Soraya and her client sat most uncomfortably at the beginning of their meeting.</p><p>\u201cA moment for introductions.\u201d The Dean\u2019s rich, baritone voice rang out in the room.</p><p>\u201cMiss Julianne Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded, but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is your representative?\u201d His pale, cold blue eyes gave away nothing, but it was clear that he recognized the dark haired woman at Julia\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cSoraya Harandi, Dr. Aras. I will be representing Miss Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason why Miss Mitchell has elected to bring an attorney to this informal meeting?\u201d It was clear that he was already irritated.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Dr. Aras, my client was simply following your instructions. You suggested she retain a lawyer in your letter.\u201d Soraya\u2019s voice was deceptively sweet.</p><p>David resisted the urge to growl at her, for he did not like being made a fool. He gestured to the man beside him. \u201cThis is Professor Martin.\u201d</p><p>Julia took a moment to appraise the Chair\u2019s appearance. She knew that he would be meeting with Gabriel to discuss Christa\u2019s harassment complaint after this meeting concluded. She tried very hard to discern his disposition but found herself puzzled. His demeanor was decidedly neutral, at least toward her.</p><p>The Dean cleared his throat. \u201cWe have received a very serious complaint about you, Miss Mitchell. Our purpose in inviting you to speak to us today is solely for information purposes as we begin our investigation. We will ask a few questions, then you will have the opportunity to ask questions of us. I hope the meeting will terminate in about thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Julia inhaled slowly, watching him and waiting.</p><p>\u201cAre you having a romantic relationship with Professor Gabriel Emerson?\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes bugged out of her head, and her jaw dropped open. Before she could speak, Soraya jumped in.</p><p>\u201cMy client will not answer any questions until the substance of the complaint is revealed. The letter was understandably vague, given the policies of the university, but you have passed the point of vagueness with that question. Exactly what is the complaint against my client, what is the evidence for the complaint, and who is the complainant?\u201d</p><p>David tapped a finger at the glass water pitcher in front of him, making the slices of lemon dance to his drumming.</p><p>\u201cThat is not how these meetings work. I am the Dean. I ask the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Aras...\u201d Soraya\u2019s voice took on an almost patronizing tone. \u201cWe both know that the policies and procedures assumed by the university are governed by the principles of natural justice. My client deserves to know the specifics of the complaint, the nature and scope of the evidence against her, if any, and the identity of the complainant before she answers any questions. Otherwise, this is an unjust proceeding and I will have no choice but to file a complaint to that effect. Immediately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to agree with Miss Harandi,\u201d said Professor Martin quietly.</p><p>David gave Jeremy an annoyed look out of the corner of his eye. \u201cVery well. An allegation of graduate student misconduct reached our office concerning your client. It was alleged that she entered into a sexual relationship with one of her professors for the purpose of procuring academic favors.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes grew wide and round.</p><p>Soraya laughed. Loudly. \u201cThis is a farce. My client is an extremely talented student who was recently offered an early acceptance to Harvard, as you well know.\u201d She nodded in Professor Martin\u2019s direction. \u201cMy client doesn\u2019t need to prostitute herself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe allegation is not without precedent at this institution, Miss Harandi. And we take all complaints seriously, as dictated by our policies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why isn\u2019t the complaint being processed as a sexual harassment case? Surely, if a student initiates a transaction in which favors are exchanged for sex it would count as sexual harassment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat avenue of inquiry is also being explored,\u201d David snapped.</p><p>Soraya chuckled. \u201cFine, fine. What are the alleged favors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA high mark in a seminar in which the professor was the instructor, financial payments in the form of a bursary, and the procurement of an established, retired scholar to direct Miss Mitchell\u2019s thesis.\u201d</p> <p>Soraya waved a dismissive hand, almost yawning in boredom. \u201cI reiterate the fact that my client\u2019s academic merits speak for themselves. And who, pray tell, is the unfortunate professor?\u201d</p><p>David watched Julia closely. \u201cGabriel Emerson.\u201d</p><p>Soraya smiled widely. \u201cYour complainant has a wild imagination. He or she must be majoring in fiction. Did Professor Emerson file the complaint?\u201d</p><p>Julia held her breath, horrified, as she waited for David\u2019s answer.</p><p>He tapped the papers in front of him with the end of his pen. \u201cNo, he did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what was his testimony when you spoke with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe intend to speak with Professor Emerson once we have gathered more information. Our protocols dictate that faculty members who are a party to a complaint are brought in last, not first.\u201d Professor Martin spoke for the first time, his voice firm but calm.</p><p>Soraya fixed him with a stern eye. \u201cSo in the hierarchy of the university, female graduate students are preyed upon first? And only afterward the professor, whose testimony could exonerate her, is approached? I\u2019m shocked that you would drag my client in here without the courtesy of even attempting to speak to the other person involved. This entire matter could have been put to rest with two telephone calls. This is a disgrace.\u201d</p><p>David began to protest but Soraya interrupted him again. \u201cBefore we end this meeting, who is the complainant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe complainant is a person who I believe is known to Miss Mitchell. Her name is Christa Peterson.\u201d</p><p>Soraya received the news impassively, but Julia\u2019s eyes flew to Professor Martin\u2019s. It was one quick movement, but he noticed it and stared straight back at her with knitted brows.</p><p>Blushing, she looked down at her hands.</p><p>David held up two pieces of paper.</p><p>\u201cBased upon our preliminary investigation, it seems that Professor Emerson awarded a very high mark to Miss Mitchell in his graduate seminar. She was awarded the M. P. Emerson bursary, which was mysteriously donated by an American foundation after Miss Mitchell began the program. And Professor Martin has provided me with Miss Mitchell\u2019s academic file, in which it shows that Katherine Picton was approached by Professor Emerson last semester to replace him as Miss Mitchell\u2019s thesis supervisor.\u201d</p> <p>He passed a file over to Soraya.</p><p>\u201cAs you will see, Miss Harandi, that file contains additional evidence provided by Miss Peterson. It includes a series of photographs and news clippings from a Florentine newspaper showing Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson at a public event in Italy, where Professor Emerson is quoted as saying that Miss Mitchell is his fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cAnd there is a sworn statement by an employee of a local club who claims to possess security videos that show personal interactions between Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson at that club during the time that she was his student. These interactions appear to be of an intimate nature and certainly go well beyond the appropriate boundaries of a professional relationship.\u201d</p><p>He paused for effect. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the evidence provided by the complainant could be proof of more than one infraction. So for this reason, we are eager to hear Miss Mitchell\u2019s side of the story. So I ask you again, did you receive special academic favors from your professor because of your personal relationship with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Aras, I am astonished that a man of your stature would be persuaded to give credence to a complaint that not only strains credulity but is supported by the very flimsiest of evidence. Newspaper clippings from an Italian tabloid? Videos that cannot be authenticated? There is no prima facie case. None whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t question my competency, Miss Harandi.\u201d The Dean\u2019s swift temper got the best of him. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in higher education since you were in kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>Soraya raised her eyebrows at him and closed the file ceremoniously, tossing it onto his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of interest does the complainant have in making such an allegation?\u201d</p><p>David glared.</p><p>Soraya looked from the Dean to the chair and back again. \u201cPerhaps the complainant\u2019s true target is Professor Emerson. Why am I suddenly getting the impression that my client is collateral damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other matters are outside your purview, Miss Harandi.\u201d The Dean\u2019s chin began to wobble. \u201cEven if this office would prefer to ignore the supporting information filed with the complaint, we can\u2019t. The newspaper article demonstrates that Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson were romantically linked only days after the end of the semester. It appears to demonstrate the existence of a prior inappropriate relationship, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you summoned my client to listen to these bizarre accusations. The complainant is clearly unstable and living in a fantasy world. If she has an issue with Professor Emerson, she needs to pursue a complaint against him, not my client. Given what I have seen here today, I will advise my client that she is well within her rights to file a harassment complaint against Miss Peterson and to see that she is investigated for making a fraudulent and defamatory charge.\u201d</p><p>The Dean cleared his throat noisily. \u201cIf your position is such that Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson engaged in a consensual relationship, I will gladly make note of such a declaration and we can dispense with the charade. When did this consensual relationship begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only charade is the one your office is performing, in which you attempt to appear to be investigating an academic infraction but rather are engaging in some kind of prurient sexual McCarthyism. This meeting is over.\u201d Soraya closed her briefcase dramatically and stood to her feet.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Miss Harandi. If you had troubled yourself to take a closer look at Miss Mitchell\u2019s academic file, you\u2019d have seen a form signed by Professor Picton and dated in October, declaring that she would be supervising Miss Mitchell\u2019s thesis because Professor Emerson had a conflict of interest. What reason would he have to approach Professor Picton other than giving Miss Mitchell what she wanted? What kind of conflict of interest could there be, other than an inappropriate relationship?\u201d</p><p>Julia opened her mouth to answer him, to reveal the fact that she had known Gabriel since she was a teenager, but Soraya grabbed her forearm in a death grip.</p><p>\u201cYou sound as if you have already taken a position on the complaint, Dr. Aras. Perhaps your letter would have been less disingenuous if you had stated that your true purpose in this meeting was to poison the well against my client so you could punish her.\u201d</p><p>The Dean appeared to swallow his growing anger. He gestured to the paperwork in front of him. \u201cThe complaint alleges that academic favors were granted to Miss Mitchell for reasons other than academic performance.</p><p>\u201cThe complainant testifies that Professor Emerson and Miss Mitchell engaged in a lover\u2019s quarrel in front of a room full of witnesses during one of his seminars. Shortly after that embarrassing public display, Professor Picton signed the paperwork that allowed her to become Miss Mitchell\u2019s thesis advisor. Quid pro quo. Quod erat demonstrandum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNemo me impune lacessit, Dr. Aras.\u201d Soraya smiled at Professor Martin, before turning a stony gaze in David\u2019s direction. \u201cI started studying Latin when I was in kindergarten.</p><p>\u201cThe complaint is malicious and false. If the Provost decides to lay charges on the basis of this complaint, I will pursue other avenues of remedy against the complainant and this office.\u201d</p><p>Julia watched as the Dean gripped his pen rather tightly. \u201cAre you sure this is the position you wish to take, Miss Mitchell? An argument for leniency can be made if you cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve basically called my client a whore and accused her of sleeping with a professor to gain a preferment. I don\u2019t need to remind you of the laws regarding defamation of character. I believe we found ourselves in a similar situation last year. We don\u2019t give in to threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not threaten, we adjudicate. We will be interviewing witnesses and other relevant parties and then we will repeat this conversation. Jeremy, have you any further comments or questions?\u201d</p><p>Professor Martin measured Julianne with his gaze, then shook his head dispassionately.</p><p>The Dean closed his file. \u201cSince you refuse to answer my questions, Miss Mitchell, you are dismissed.\u201d</p><p>Soraya nodded at the two men and escorted Julia out of the room.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cThat meeting was a confederacy of dunces,\u201d announced Soraya, leaning against the banquette in the bar of the Windsor Arms Hotel.</p><p>Julia nodded, wondering if she was Ignatius Reilly, the protagonist of that book, or whether Gabriel was Ignatius and she was Myrna Minkoff.</p><p>The bartender delivered their martinis with a smile and a few dishes of tapas, \u201con the house.\u201d He winked at Soraya, who was a regular, and returned to the bar.</p><p>She took a long sip of her drink and settled herself in her seat. \u201cMy advice is to file a harassment complaint against Christa Peterson, citing malicious intent, as soon as possible. There are provisions in the university\u2019s academic policies that are supposed to protect students from fraudulent accusations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to antagonize her.\u201d</p><p>Soraya laughed darkly. \u201cWhat more could she do to you? Boil your bunny?\u201d</p><p>Julia cringed.</p><p>\u201cListen, a complaint against her would be a shot across the bow. We don\u2019t have to follow through on it, but it would give her and the Dean something to think about. You told me that she accused Gabriel of sexual harassment. Don\u2019t you want to strike back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want all of this to end. I don\u2019t understand how she can file a complaint against me when my situation has nothing to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBased upon what we learned today, I think it\u2019s pretty clear what she\u2019s doing. She accused you of sleeping your way to the top, and she accused your boyfriend of trying to make the same arrangement with her. It\u2019s clever, really, because she doesn\u2019t need her complaints to be successful in order to take both of you out at the same time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia blanched. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s forcing you into admitting that you had a relationship with your professor. Then the university can hit you and him with a fraternization charge. She\u2019s either brilliant or she\u2019s had some coaching.\u201d</p><p>Julia traced a finger up and down the side of her martini glass, fighting the urge to be sick.</p><p>Soraya sipped her cocktail once more. \u201cI need you to make a list of people the Dean might interview and anything they might say that would be damaging. The evidence he has is slight, but if you put it all together, it could be enough to convince a tribunal that Gabriel gifted you with favors because of your relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Julia began sawing on her lower lip with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, yet. Let\u2019s focus on beating this complaint and worry about everything else later. The administration is very cautious when it comes to matters involving faculty members because of their union. The university will continue the investigation until they\u2019re sure, and then they\u2019ll pounce.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, let me file a complaint against this Christa Peterson character. From now on, you and Gabriel need to stay out of the public eye. David will be investigating both of you this week, and we should assume he\u2019ll interview everyone who has come in contact with both of you.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head, a wave of nausea crashing over her as she thought of other faculty and students from the department being asked to give testimony in front of the Dean.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Soraya. File the complaint. I don\u2019t think it will accomplish anything other than to antagonize her, but you\u2019re the lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Soraya smiled widely and downed the rest of her dirty martini.</p><p>Later that afternoon Julia was exiting the elevator on Gabriel\u2019s floor. She passed his French Canadian neighbor as she walked down the long hallway, and they exchanged a brief but friendly nod. Then she let herself in with her key.</p><p>\u201cJulianne? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How was your meeting with the Chair?\u201d She quickly removed her coat and boots and was ready to walk into the living room when Gabriel met her in the front hall.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear about your meeting first.\u201d He placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her forehead. \u201cAre you all right? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked me a few questions and let me go.\u201d</p> <p>He let out an expletive and pulled her into his arms. \u201cIf anything ever happened to you...\u201d</p><p>She returned his embrace, exhaling slowly against his dress shirt. \u201cIt was Christa Peterson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He pulled back so he could see her face.</p><p>\u201cChrista accused me of exchanging sexual favors with you for academic benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>While Julia hurriedly described the nature of the complaint and David and Soraya\u2019s exchanges, Gabriel\u2019s expression grew darker and more dangerous. When she quoted David\u2019s final words, he took a large step away from her.</p><p>He reared back and thrust his fist through the wall. Then, for good measure, he withdrew, dragging fragments of plaster and dust with him, before punching through the wall twice more in rapid succession.</p><p>Julia stood, open-mouthed, as Gabriel trembled before her, eyes closed and chest heaving. Part of her wanted to run, but she found herself rooted to the spot.</p> <p>No matter how much she wanted to run at that moment, the sight of a few drops of blood dripping from his knuckles and onto the hardwood floor captured her attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to yourself?\u201d She looked up into his blazing eyes and pulled him toward the guest washroom. \u201cSit down.\u201d Once he was situated, she examined his knuckles and found the skin had split in more than one place.</p><p>\u201cYou might need stitches,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried you\u2019ve broken something.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel opened and closed his hand several times, wordlessly demonstrating that his hand wasn\u2019t broken.</p><p>\u201cI think you should have an x-ray, just in case.\u201d</p><p>His only response was to rub at his eyes with his uninjured hand and heave a deep, shuddering sigh.</p><p>She opened the medicine cabinet and removed a few first aid items. \u201cI\u2019ll try to clean this, but you should go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His voice was tight.</p><p>Using tweezers, she removed the bits of plaster from his wounds and cleaned them with iodine. Gabriel barely flinched as she bathed his knuckles, and she noticed that he was shaking, possibly from residual anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I upset you,\u201d Julia whispered.</p><p>\u201cI nearly brought a wall down, and you\u2019re apologizing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have told you when you were sitting down. Or after you\u2019d had a drink.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThen I really would have knocked the wall down. I\u2019m too angry to drink.\u201d</p><p>Julia continued her first aid until the wound was completely clean. When she was finished, she ghosted her lips over his bandaged knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel caught her hand in his. \u201cStop it. I seem to remember another time in this washroom when I was the one playing doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mortified. I wanted to make a good impression and then I smashed your crystal and sprayed your nice shirt with Chianti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident. I had to work up the courage to put iodine on your cuts. I was afraid of hurting you. And that was before I...\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and rubbed at them again. \u201cWhat happened to you today is my fault. I should have protected you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d Julia said, her voice a warning. She leaned over and took his face between her hands, forcing him to look at her. \u201cDon\u2019t. We knew the risks when we got involved. I don\u2019t care what they do to me.\u201d Her voice broke on the words, but she spoke them anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t care about Harvard or my PhD. I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>A strange fire illuminated Gabriel\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot even Hell could keep me from you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The lovers embraced desperately, drawing comfort from each other\u2019s very skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what happened with Professor Martin?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took Julia\u2019s hand and led her into the master bathroom where he began drawing a bath. \u201cYou relax, I\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for a bubble bath. I kind of feel like taking a crow bar to something.\u201d</p><p>(Something appalling and poorly made. Like domestic beer.)</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you need a bubble bath. I have to preserve the walls of my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Julia undressed and settled herself amongst the suds. He regarded her intensely\u2014the way her long hair was pinned up haphazardly on top of her head, the gentle contours of her breasts floating amidst the water like two white, pink tipped lilies, the way she bit at her lip until she realized he was staring at it.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the first time we bathed together?\u201d she asked as she watched him settle his tall form on a low stool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were worried I was hurting, and you carried me to the tub.\u201d She smiled shyly. \u201cThat was one of the kindest things you\u2019ve ever done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He gave her a peck on a cheek. \u201cBut I can\u2019t reminisce about happy things with you. I\u2019m far too angry for that. I\u2019d like to rip out David Aras\u2019s tongue and strangle him with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Professor Martin?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel paused, clearing his throat. \u201cIf Christa\u2019s complaint had stood alone, he would have interviewed me, perhaps spoken to a few others around the department, and concluded that her charge was fabricated. Her complaint against you, however, complicates things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your lawyer say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to meet with Jeremy alone.\u201d</p><p>Julia sat bolt upright, the water sloshing around her. \u201cWhat? I thought you told your lawyer about the complaint so he would accompany you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees.</p><p>\u201cJeremy hired me. I consider him a friend. I thought it was more likely that we could cut through the bullshit and deal with the issue if I didn\u2019t bring my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrista claims that I tried to initiate a sexual relationship with her on a number of different occasions, including meetings that we had on and off campus. She mentioned our interactions at Starbucks and at Lobby.\u201d His eyes shifted to Julia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also accusing me of punishing her by rejecting her thesis proposal and threatening to have her dismissed from the PhD program. She claims that after she spurned me, I made her life hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all lies. She was the one harassing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, and I said as much. Jeremy was quite cross. He told me that I should have come to him immediately and filed a complaint. Obviously, my claim is not very credible at this point, but there are a couple of things that Christa did not take into consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer academic file. Jeremy and I had at least two discussions about her poor progress over the course of last semester. He was well aware of the fact that she was struggling. Notes from those discussions, along with copies of her work, are in her file. Also, Paul was present during some of my interactions with Christa. I suggested that Jeremy speak with him, along with Mrs. Jenkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul was with me in Starbucks the day you met with Christa. She told us she was planning on persuading you to take her to Lobby\u2014that she was going to be exchanging more than names with you that evening.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that conversation, or I would have mentioned it earlier. Paul and I were having coffee and Christa came in before you arrived. She was bragging about how she was going to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stroked his chin, deep in thought. \u201cAnd Paul heard her say this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Julia, fighting a smile. \u201cI guess the Angelfucker might turn out to be a guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. What else did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. We saw you meet with Christa, but we were too far away to hear what you were saying. Her body language seemed pretty obvious. She was trying to flirt with you, and you scolded her. I could tell Professor Martin that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. You\u2019re too involved as it is.\u201d He scratched at his chin once again. \u201cJeremy asked that I not speak to Paul about Christa. The situation is a bit touchy because Paul is working for me, but Jeremy agreed to talk to him. It would be best if you didn\u2019t speak to Paul about this, either. The less said on the topic the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like Christa. One of the first things he ever said to me was that she wanted to become Mrs. Emerson. He knows she was after you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grimaced. \u201cI reminded Jeremy that I approved Christa\u2019s dissertation proposal back in December, after giving her numerous chances to fix it. Let\u2019s hope that when he talks to Paul, he\u2019s able to grasp a clear picture of what actually happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia closed her eyes, resting her head back in the bathtub. She knew that they could rely on Paul to tell the truth. Despite his antipathy to Professor Emerson, he wouldn\u2019t give credence to Christa\u2019s false allegations.</p><p>Gabriel stood up. \u201cThere\u2019s one other thing I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Julia asked, eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cJeremy asked if we were involved. And I said\u2014yes.\u201d</p> <p>She opened her eyes, staring up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him that we didn\u2019t get involved until the Christmas break.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expression grew tense.</p><p>\u201cDid he believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to, but he was angry. He told me I should have come to him immediately. He said that he was obligated to report me to the Dean for failing to follow university policy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Julia reached for Gabriel\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said that because of our other troubles, he isn\u2019t going to muddy the waters\u2014for now. But he was adamant in telling me that he wasn\u2019t going to cover things up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned over to kiss her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Jeremy. I\u2019ll handle him. While you\u2019re finishing your bath, I\u2019ll update my lawyer so we can plan our next move.\u201d He smiled and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, there is one more thing. Well, two more things, actually.</p><p>\u201cSoraya is filing a complaint against Christa, on my behalf, arguing that she targeted me maliciously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Maybe that will cause her to rethink her actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in my meeting with Nicole yesterday she mentioned that you weren\u2019t in therapy anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel saw Julia\u2019s expression, one of irritation mixed with sadness, and his shoulders slumped.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, Gabriel\u2019s failure to mention the fact that he\u2019d stopped going to therapy was unimportant. Or so Julia believed. They argued about it briefly, but both of them were too worried about their troubles with the university to do more than that.</p><p>Gabriel received a terse note from Jeremy the following week, indicating that he\u2019d interviewed both Mrs. Jenkins and Paul. Other than that, he and Julia didn\u2019t receive any communication from the university.</p><p>David Aras spent his Friday night alone in the office of his house with a bottle of Jameson whiskey. It was not unusual for him to do so. In his position as Dean of Graduate Studies he often brought work home. On this particular evening he found himself mired in a very tricky, very sensitive situation.</p><p>Miss Peterson\u2019s harassment complaint had been challenged by the testimony of more than one witness. However, the academic fraud complaint against Miss Mitchell had alerted him to a possible case of fraternization between Julia and Professor Emerson. The problem was that the evidence was contradictory.</p><p>According to the information passed on by Professor Martin, Paul Norris had painted a glowing picture of Miss Mitchell and her character. As the whiskey burned his throat, David wondered if all women Mr. Norris came in contact with had mysteriously sprouted wings or if he simply had a weakness for young women from Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania.</p><p>(Wherever the hell that was.)</p> <p>According to Mr. Norris and Mrs. Jenkins, Miss Mitchell was a timid young woman who was disliked by Professor Emerson. Mr. Norris went further to claim that the professor had fought openly with her in his seminar.</p><p>Subsequent to the confrontation in class, Emerson had approached Professor Picton to supervise Miss Mitchell\u2019s thesis, citing the fact that she was a friend of his family as the reason why he could no longer continue to supervise her. Here is where David was puzzled.</p><p>Professor Emerson hadn\u2019t objected to Miss Mitchell\u2019s admission to the program, knowing that he was the only professor who directed theses on Dante. If there was such an obvious conflict of interest, why hadn\u2019t he objected? Or declared the conflict of interest to Professor Martin at the beginning of the semester?</p><p>The files on Professor Emerson and Miss Mitchell did not make sense. And David did not like it when things did not make sense. (For his universe was nothing if not sensical.)</p><p>As he pondered the evidence, he inserted a flash drive into his computer. He opened the single folder on the drive and began scanning through the emails that had been culled obligingly from Professor Emerson\u2019s account by someone in the Information Technology office. He adjusted the parameters to include only those messages that had been sent to or received from Miss Mitchell, Miss Peterson, Mr. Norris, and Professor Picton.</p><p>In a few minutes, David found something that surprised him. On his screen, were emails that had been sent before the end of October 2009. The first email had been written by Professor Emerson to Miss Mitchell:</p><p>Dear Miss Mitchell,</p><p>I need to speak to you concerning a matter of some urgency.</p><p>Please contact me as soon as possible. You may telephone me at the following number: 416-555-0739 (cell).</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Prof. Gabriel O. Emerson,</p><p>Associate Professor</p><p>Department of Italian Studies/</p><p>Centre for Medieval Studies</p><p>University of Toronto</p><p>The second email was sent by Miss Mitchell to Professor Emerson in response to his message:</p><p>Dr. Emerson,</p><p>Stop harassing me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want you anymore. I don\u2019t even want to know you. If you don\u2019t leave me alone, I will be forced to file a harassment complaint against you. And if you call my father, I will do just that. Immediately.</p><p>If you think I\u2019m going to let an insignificant thing like this drive me from the program, then you are very much mistaken. I need a new thesis director, not a bus ticket home.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Miss J. H. Mitchell,</p><p>Lowly Graduate Student,</p><p>On-Knees-More-Than-The-Average-Whore.</p><p>P.S. I will be returning the M. P. Emerson bursary next week. Congratulations, Professor Abelard. No one has ever made me feel as cheap as you did Sunday morning.</p><p>The Dean straightened in his chair. He read the two emails once again, examining every word.</p><p>Although he had a vague memory of who Peter Abelard was, he indulged his curiosity and Googled him. He clicked on a reputable biography and began reading.</p><p>Quod erat demonstrandum, he thought.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Downtown, Jeremy Martin was reclining on his leather sofa, eyes closed, listening to Beethoven while his wife got ready for bed. As the Chair of Italian Studies, he was responsible for a number of people, including faculty and students. Gabriel\u2019s revelation that he was dating a former student troubled him.</p><p>He knew that Christa Peterson\u2019s complaint was malicious, but like any other complainant, she should be taken seriously. Given the fact that she was correct in surmising that Gabriel and Julianne were involved, it was quite possible that her allegation that Julianne had received special favors was also correct. Gabriel, his friend and colleague, had tried to keep the relationship secret. Now the Dean was asking questions, placing Jeremy in a hell of a bind.</p><p>Over the course of his career in the United States and now in Toronto, he\u2019d seen too many bright and promising graduate students become the playthings of their professors. His wife, for example, had been a graduate student in linguistics at Columbia University, only to have her career ruined by her professor/lover after she tired of his alcoholism. It had taken years for Danielle\u2019s wounds to heal, and even now she would have nothing to do with academia. Jeremy didn\u2019t want to see Julianne\u2019s career come to a similar end.</p><p>On the other hand, he would not allow the rising star of his faculty to be slandered and vilified for an infraction he hadn\u2019t committed. If the Dean investigated Professor Emerson and Miss Mitchell further, Jeremy would do his damnedest to ensure that justice was served. Failing that, he was determined to ensure that his department was protected. Which is why he was horrified to find copies of letters addressed to Professor Emerson and Miss Mitchell with his daily mail on the first Thursday in March.</p><p>Muttering expletives, he glanced at the contents quickly before making a discreet call to one of his contacts in the Dean\u2019s office. Half an hour later, he was placing a call to Professor Emerson\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cHave you checked your snail mail today?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a letter from the Dean indicating that you and Julianne are being investigated for engaging in an inappropriate relationship while she was your student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d said Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Are you sitting down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, take a seat. I just got off the phone with a friend who works in the Dean\u2019s office. Julianne has filed a harassment complaint against Christa Peterson, pursuant to the allegations against her. In retaliation, Christa has threatened the university with a lawsuit over the fact that Julianne received preferential treatment because she slept with you. Christa\u2019s allegations are now part of the investigation into you and Julianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, Gabriel, because the university takes complaints like this very seriously. The Provost\u2019s office has ordered the Dean and two others to form a committee and investigate the allegations. You and Julianne are being summoned to appear before them, together.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cursed. \u201cWho else is on the committee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy contact wouldn\u2019t tell me. The good news is that the meeting is only an investigatory hearing. Depending upon how the hearing officers decide the matter, it could be referred to the Provost\u2019s Office for charges to be laid, and then the two of you would have to appear before a disciplinary tribunal. I don\u2019t need to explain to you how deep the shit would be at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the Dean simply meet with me? All of this could be laid to rest in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. Allegations and complaints are piling up and you\u2019re at the center of all of them.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s heart almost stopped. \u201cYou think there are more allegations forthcoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my suspicions. But nothing has been confirmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d said Gabriel, rubbing his eyes roughly. \u201cJust how much trouble are we in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d stop thinking as a we and focus on I. That\u2019s what got you into this mess in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question, please.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy paused, flipping through the letters on his desk. \u201cSince there is some question about the integrity of your marking scheme with respect to Julianne, the Dean has suspended her grade in your seminar. That means that her transcript will be incomplete until the matter is resolved either with a dismissal or a tribunal and its outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t graduate,\u201d Gabriel whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s University policy to withhold a final grade until all academic infractions are dealt with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo depending on how long this takes, she won\u2019t be able to go to Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the matter is settled in her favor, they\u2019ll let the grade stand and backdate her graduation. But by that time, I would assume she\u2019d lose her place at Harvard. Unless she can persuade them to defer her admission.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer admission was conditional on the satisfactory completion of her MA. She can ask, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in a position to ask for a deferral. And if Harvard catches wind of this, they might withdraw their offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019d better pray this matter is settled in time for her to apply to graduate. And frankly, so should you. If you\u2019re found guilty of academic fraud, the Provost can strip you of your tenure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Gabriel slammed his hand down on his desk. \u201cWhen will we have to appear before the committee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursday, March twenty-fifth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat leaves them less than a month to sort everything out before she needs to apply for graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcademic procedures move at a glacial pace. You know that.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAren\u2019t you the slightest bit worried about your predicament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d Gabriel growled.</p><p>\u201cWell, you should be. And what\u2019s more, my primary concern is you, although I would be sorry to see Julianne\u2019s academic future threatened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not about to let one of my star professors be hung out to dry.\u201d Jeremy heaved a deep breath. \u201cUnder the policy you\u2019re suspected of violating, you bear more responsibility than her. You\u2019re under suspicion of evaluating a student with reference to a criterion that has nothing to do with academic merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous and you have the paper trail to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Jeremy began tapping his finger against the pages in front of him. \u201cI have a paper trail, but it\u2019s incomplete. You didn\u2019t notify me until recently that you were involved with her. Now my boss is starting to ask questions. Do you have any idea how embarrassing this is for me? I look like I just fell off the turnip truck and have no idea what the hell is going on in my own department!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel inhaled and exhaled slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that you fucked up, Gabriel, no matter how you look at it. And I\u2019m not about to jeopardize everything I\u2019ve worked for to cover your ass.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Emerson was stunned into silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were dating her? I hired you, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t think it was anyone\u2019s business who I was sleeping with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Jeremy muttered a curse. \u201cYou know the rules governing relationships with students. Since you kept your relationship secret from me and everyone else, you look guilty.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gritted his teeth. \u201cJeremy, can I count on your support or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can, but that might not be much. If I were you, I\u2019d notify the Faculty Association and make sure you bring your union representative to the hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a witch hunt that was started by a disgruntled graduate student. Christa Peterson is trying to have me fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right. But before you get on your soapbox, realize that you violated university policy. That makes it much easier for the administration to infer that you\u2019re guilty of other infractions. And by the way, I received an email from the Dean asking me about the M. P. Emerson bursary. For your sake, I hope your fingerprints aren\u2019t on it.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel let loose with a string of curses. Jeremy interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a lawyer, my friend, now would be the time to hire one.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel muttered something and hung up the phone, walking swiftly to his dining room to pour himself a drink.</p><p>Although Gabriel notified the Faculty Association of his situation, he declined their offer to accompany him to the hearing. John was of the opinion that his legal acumen was far more threatening than that of the union, but he was willing to admit that should the matter result in charges, it would be appropriate at that point to involve them.</p><p>John\u2019s advice was to stonewall, although he urged Gabriel to coach Julianne on what not to say. Failing that, he had every intention of arguing that she was an unstable, impressionable student who had become fixated on Gabriel at a young age and had seduced him.</p><p>Hoping that his client would follow instructions, John didn\u2019t bother to explain this strategy.</p><p>Soraya\u2019s advice paralleled that of John. She told Julia to say nothing and if pressed, to blame Gabriel for everything. Soraya almost cackled with glee at the prospect of arguing that he was the older, rakish professor who had seduced an innocent young woman with promises of a long and happy future. When Julia declared that she wanted to tell the truth, Soraya told her that that was a very bad idea. She planned to bring up Gabriel\u2019s promiscuous reputation and brushes with law enforcement.</p><p>Like John, she anticipated a cooperative client and thus didn\u2019t bother articulating the details of her strategy.</p><p>The night before the hearing, Julia was awakened mid-dream by the sound of something tapping against her apartment window. At first, she thought she was still dreaming. When the sound repeated, this time more loudly, she exited her bed and pulled aside the curtain. There, standing with his nose almost pressed against the glass, was Gabriel. He looked slightly wild, eyes frantic, wearing his beret and his winter coat, standing knee-deep in a snowdrift.</p><p>She quickly unlocked the window and stood aside as a gust of frozen air whooshed past him with his entrance into the room. He closed the window soundly, locked it, and drew the curtain.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t given the chance to finish her question as he wrapped her in his arms. She smelled the Scotch before she tasted it, as he pressed his lips to hers. His lips were freezing, it was true, but his mouth and tongue were warm and inviting. And the heat of his kiss, which was deep and sensual, began to blossom across her skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk? What happened?\u201d</p><p>He pulled away, but only for a moment, so he could divest himself of his hat and coat. Then he was embracing her once again, tracing icy fingers up and down her arms, unbuttoning her pajama top and slipping a hand inside to cradle her breast.</p><p>He moved her to the bed as he pulled his shirt out of his trousers, watching her slip off her pajamas as he carelessly dropped everything to the floor. Within an eye blink they were naked and he was pulling her into his arms, tugging her legs around his hips. They\u2019d never been this quick to undress and to love.</p><p>As he walked her to the closed door and pressed her back against it, his movements grew frantic and desperate. His cold fingers teased her while his mouth trapped her breast, sucking and nipping.</p><p>She was crying out already, still shocked at his speechless fervor.</p><p>A few moments later she was distracted by the difference in temperature between their bodies: the taut, hard coldness of his chest pressing against her soft, warm curves. When he felt with thawing fingertips that she was ready, he thrust up into her, grunting into the crook of her neck in preliminary satisfaction, his upper body relaxing slightly at the feel of her. There was no space between their bodies or air between their skin.</p><p>Julia moaned appreciatively at the sensation of being one with her beloved. Her hands immediately slid from his shoulders to his hips, and she pulled at his lower back to encourage him forward. It was a cacophony of unembarrassed sounds and noises, made far more animalistic by its lack of language and of course, the rhythmic bumping of Julia\u2019s back against the heavy wooden door.</p><p>Their coupling was loud and fast, perhaps the most intense physical connection they\u2019d ever had, topping even their sex against the wall in Florence. Soon they were exploding jointly into bliss, hearts racing and blood pumping, clutching one another and crying out. Then finally, finally, they collapsed into a tangle of flesh and limb in limpid satisfaction on Julia\u2019s narrow bed.</p><p>Gabriel was on top of her, but she would not let him move. He shifted slightly to distribute his weight to the mattress, but he too was unwilling to break the contact of skin against skin.</p><p>She petted his hair and told him how much she loved him as he buried his nose in the hollow of her throat, inhaling her scent. She told him that he didn\u2019t need to drink, that he could talk to her, instead.</p><p>Gabriel sighed against her neck. \u201cI am talking to you,\u201d he whispered, pressing insistent kisses across her shoulder. \u201cYou aren\u2019t listening.\u201d</p><p>Before Julia could argue, he began exploring her mouth. Further discussion was silenced as he enticed her to join with his body once more.</p><p>When she awoke the next morning the apartment was quiet. In fact, there was no sign of her evening visitor apart from an unlocked window and the scent of Gabriel and sex that clung to her body and the bed.</p><p>She searched the studio expecting a note, a message, something. But there was nothing, not even an email. A creeping sense of dread spread over her.</p><p>Julia wore her hair long the next morning, following Soraya\u2019s instructions, for it made her look sweet and innocent. At eleven o\u2019 clock sharp she met her lawyer in the hallway outside the boardroom.</p><p>Gabriel and John were already there, huddled next to the wall and talking in low, hurried tones. They were both dressed in dark suits and white shirts. But the similarity ended there. Gabriel wore a bow tie. The green of his tie contrasted sharply with the blue of his eyes.</p><p>He made eye contact with her briefly, enough for her to notice that he looked worried. He didn\u2019t smile or beckon to her. He seemed content to keep his distance.</p><p>She wanted to go to him, but Soraya pulled her to sit on a low bench just outside the door. Suddenly, the door swung open and a large, angry looking rugby player strode into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cPaul?\u201d Julia stood up.</p><p>He stopped, surprised.</p><p>\u201cJulia? Are you all right? Tell me it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mid-sentence and mid-stride Paul stopped as he saw the face of Soraya, who was now standing behind her. He stared at the two women, eyes wide and questioning at first, then narrowing. Muttering curses, he scowled and strode past both of them.</p><p>\u201cPaul?\u201d Julia called to him, but he disappeared down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d asked Soraya.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Soraya seemed incredulous.</p><p>Julia turned to face her. \u201cWhy? Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe filed a complaint last year against one of my clients. That\u2019s when I made an enemy of the Dean.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for the import of Soraya\u2019s revelation to sink into Julia\u2019s brain. But when it did, she sat down slowly.</p><p>Soraya was Professor Singer\u2019s attorney? What have I gotten myself into?</p><p>Her answer to that question was interrupted by the Dean\u2019s assistant, Meagan, who announced that the hearing officers would prefer to interview Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson, together.</p><p>After a quick consultation with their lawyers, Gabriel and Julia entered the boardroom, followed by John and Soraya. As soon as they arranged themselves on opposite sides of the aisle, Dr. Aras spoke. As was his practice, he introduced himself and the other members of the committee, Professors Tara Chakravartty and Robert Mwangi.</p><p>\u201cDr. Tara Chakravartty, Vice-President of Diversity.\u201d Professor Chakravartty was a beautiful and petite woman of Indian descent, with dark eyes and long, straight black hair. She was dressed in a black suit with a large persimmon-colored scarf swathed like a sari around her torso. She too, smiled at Julia, in between withering glances and the occasional scowl in David\u2019s direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDr. Robert Mwangi, Vice-President of Student Affairs.\u201d Professor Mwangi was a Kenyan Canadian who wore wire-rimmed spectacles and a button down shirt with no jacket and no tie. He was the most casually dressed of the four of them and the most obviously friendly. He smiled at Julia, and she smiled back.</p><p>The Dean proceeded with his opening remarks.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell, Professor Emerson, you have been notified by letter as to why your presence was required. Pursuant to our investigation of the allegation of academic misconduct against you, Miss Mitchell, we have talked to Professor Picton, Miss Peterson, Mrs. Jenkins, Professor Jeremy Martin, and Mr. Paul Norris.</p><p>\u201cDuring the course of our investigation, several facts emerged, facts that have been corroborated by more than one witness.\u201d The Dean stared at Gabriel, pursing his lips. \u201cFor this reason, the Provost\u2019s office ordered this committee be formed to investigate matters further.</p> <p>\u201cThe facts that have come to light so far are as follows: first, that a public argument with possible personal overtones took place between Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson during his graduate seminar on or about October twenty-eighth, two thousand and nine.</p><p>\u201cSecond, that on or about October thirty-first, Professor Picton agreed to supervise Miss Mitchell\u2019s MA thesis at the urging of Professor Emerson, who later notified Professor Martin about the change. Professor Emerson claimed that the switch was necessary due to a conflict of interest, namely, that Miss Mitchell was a friend of his family. Paperwork was filed in the School of Graduate Studies in November to effect this change.</p><p>\u201cThird, on December tenth, Professor Emerson gave a public lecture in Florence, Italy, to which he was accompanied by Miss Mitchell. Over the course of the evening, he introduced Miss Mitchell as his fianc\u00e9e. These facts are substantiated in print and in photographs, and they have also been corroborated by a Professor Pacciani who was present at the event.\u201d The Dean held up a piece of paper that appeared to be a hard copy of an email.</p><p>Gabriel glared darkly at the mention of Pacciani, mumbling an expletive under his breath.</p><p>The Dean fixed his gaze on Gabriel. \u201cDid Miss Mitchell harass you into participating in an amorous relationship with her?\u201d</p> <p>Julia nearly fell off her chair.</p><p>All eyes in the room focused on Gabriel, whose color deepened. His lawyer began whispering furiously in his ear but Gabriel waved him aside.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Are you currently engaged in an amorous relationship with Miss Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Aras, you\u2019ve offered no evidence of any policy infractions here. All you\u2019ve offered is a sketchy timeline that is open to interpretation and tabloid journalism from Italy. I will not allow you to railroad my client,\u201d John complained.</p><p>\u201cIf your client has nothing to hide, then he should answer our questions. When did the relationship between you, Professor Emerson, and your student begin?\u201d</p> <p>Before John could open his mouth to protest, Professor Chakravartty interrupted. \u201cI object to this line of questioning on the grounds that relationships between professors and students in the same department cannot be consensual. And I\u2019d like my objection minuted.\u201d</p><p>The Dean nodded at his assistant, Meagan, who was typing notes furiously on her laptop. \u201cDuly noted,\u201d he huffed. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that issue shortly. Professor Emerson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith respect, Dr. Aras, my client is not obligated to respond to supposition and speculation. Perhaps Miss Mitchell might take a different view.\u201d John cast a snide look at Soraya, then smiled innocently at the hearing officers.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Miss Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>Soraya glared at John before turning to face the committee.</p><p>\u201cMy client has already been subjected to a harassing experience by the Dean\u2019s office when she was forced to defend herself against a serious but entirely malicious complaint by another student. In view of the stress and emotional trauma that has already been inflicted on her, I ask you to direct your questions to Professor Emerson. He instigated the transfer of my client\u2019s thesis supervision to Professor Picton, it\u2019s his signature on the forms, and we have nothing to say on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Julia leaned over to protest in Soraya\u2019s ear, but Soraya waved her off.</p><p>Julia gritted her teeth.</p> <p>\u201cAh. A classic prisoner\u2019s dilemma emerges. I wonder if either of you realize the outcome you are headed toward if you continue in this manner.\u201d Dr. Aras cleared this throat. \u201cI can allow you a short recess in order for you to confer with your attorneys, Miss Mitchell and Professor Emerson, but I expect you to answer our questions expeditiously and truthfully.</p><p>\u201cIn the absence of any testimony at all, we reserve the right to decide the matter for ourselves, based upon the evidence we have been able to gather. And to refer the matter to the Provost\u2019s office so he can lay charges, if that is our recommendation. You have five minutes.\u201d The Dean\u2019s voice was cold and dispassionate.</p><p>\u201cSince relationships between professors and students in the same department cannot be consensual, I move that we excuse Professor Emerson so we can interview Miss Mitchell.\u201d Professor Chakravartty gave Julia a sympathetic look. \u201cLet me assure you that this is a safe space. There will be no reprisals from the Department of Italian Studies because of anything you disclose to us. If you\u2019ve been a victim of sexual harassment, we can help you.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s sympathy immediately morphed into disgust when she glanced in Gabriel\u2019s direction.</p><p>Julia quickly rose to her feet. \u201cI wasn\u2019t harassed by Professor Emerson.\u201d</p><p>Soraya clutched her arm, but Julia ignored her. So Soraya stood beside her, waiting for the appropriate moment to interrupt and to object.</p><p>Gabriel began shaking his head in agitation, but Julia couldn\u2019t see him, fixated as she was on the hearing officers.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved while I was his student. And our current relationship is consensual.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent for a moment, before the silence was broken by the sounds of the hearing officers\u2019 pens scratching against paper.</p><p>The Dean sat back in his chair, looking remarkably unsurprised.</p><p>This was Julia\u2019s first indication that something had just gone very, very wrong. She sat down slowly, ignoring the hiss of Soraya\u2019s voice in her ear and turned to look at Gabriel. He stared straight ahead, but she knew he could feel her looking at him, she could tell by the set of his jaw. He crossed his arms angrily over his chest, his eyes fixed on the Dean\u2019s like a cobra waiting to strike.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Mitchell. So the relationship is amorous.\u201d Dr. Aras glanced in Gabriel\u2019s direction before looking at Julia again.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve been so forthcoming, allow me a follow up question. When did you purchase the airline ticket to Italy, knowing that you would be traveling with Professor Emerson?\u201d</p><p>Julia gazed at the Dean blankly.</p><p>\u201cSurely the tickets would have been reserved before December eighth, which would place the purchase date squarely within the semester. So prior to his submission of your grade, you must have had a conversation about your intention to accompany him to Italy as his guest. That seems problematic for the professor-student relationship, does it not?\u201d</p><p>Julia opened her mouth to speak, but Soraya interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cWith respect, Dr. Aras, you\u2019re speculating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Miss Harandi, I\u2019m making a reasonable inference of a quid pro quo.\u201d The Dean\u2019s lips visibly thinned. \u201cMoreover, I\u2019m suggesting your client just perjured herself. She said she wasn\u2019t involved with Professor Emerson last semester. Are we to believe that they magically became involved the moment the semester ended?\u201d</p><p>Julia inhaled loudly, the sound echoing off the walls. Across the aisle, Gabriel\u2019s anxiety was telegraphed by the way he clenched and unclenched his fists, trying to hide them at his sides.</p><p>The Dean began to speak but he was interrupted by Professor Mwangi. \u201cMiss Mitchell, at this point I need to remind you of the penalties for perjury and also for the violation of the non-fraternization policy of this University.\u201d His calm and kind voice was a studied contrast to the Dean\u2019s impatient directness.</p><p>\u201cPerjury can result in expulsion or serious sanctions. A violation of the non-fraternization policy can jeopardize your academic standing in last semester\u2019s seminars.\u201d He shuffled a few papers on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou were writing your thesis with Professor Emerson until the beginning of November, about a month prior to your trip to Italy. You were registered in his Dante seminar for the entire fall semester, and awarded a mark of A.</p><p>\u201cThe non-fraternization policy exists to protect students from being preyed upon by their professors and to prevent any possibility of unfair preferments being dispersed. If you\u2019d dropped Professor Emerson\u2019s class, we would not be here today. But since you remained in his class, we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Professor Mwangi handed some papers to Meagan, who walked them obediently to Julia and Soraya. While Soraya glanced at the documents, Julia gaped in horror. She looked over at Gabriel once again, but he wouldn\u2019t return her gaze.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Martin testified before this committee that he has no recollection of any conversation with Professor Emerson about having Professor Picton grade your work in the Dante seminar. The Registrar\u2019s Office reports that it was Professor Emerson who submitted your grade via the online grading system. We have dated copies of those electronic documents, which you\u2019ve just received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Mwangi, since we are just receiving these documents now I\u2019d like a short recess in order to speak to my client.\u201d Soraya\u2019s voice broke through Julia\u2019s shock.</p><p>\u201cThose moments are past, Miss Harandi, since your client has already perjured herself.\u201d The Dean\u2019s voice was harsh.</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Professor Chakravartty interjected. \u201cMiss Mitchell might not be in the best position to judge whether or not she was the victim of coercion. Certainly, any perjury on her part would be excused if she\u2019s the victim of harassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton graded my work in the Dante seminar. I\u2019m sure she could clear up this misunderstanding.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice took on a stubborn tone that contrasted sharply with the tremor in her voice.</p><p>\u201cDean Aras, forgive me for interrupting, but I\u2019ve just received an email from Professor Picton.\u201d Meagan\u2019s voice broke in hesitantly. She walked over to the Dean and presented him with her laptop.</p><p>He scanned the screen quickly before waving her aside.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem that Professor Picton confirms your story, Miss Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>Soraya leaned forward in her chair. \u201cThen that should clear up any problems. Respectfully, we ask this committee to conclude the investigation and end this matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, Miss Harandi.\u201d Professor Mwangi looked between Gabriel and Julia curiously. \u201cIf the relationship truly is consensual, then why is Professor Emerson hiding behind his lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you\u2019ve done is present us with speculation and fantasy. Why should my client respond?\u201d John\u2019s tone was contemptuous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re entitled to come to our own conclusions with respect to evidence. I can\u2019t speak for my learned colleagues, but I\u2019ll state that in my opinion, your client and Miss Mitchell were involved last semester. Which means they violated the non-fraternization policy, and Miss Mitchell perjured herself.\u201d</p><p>John stood to his feet. \u201cIf this body intends to continue in this way, then we will be invoking the assistance of the University of Toronto\u2019s Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers, as well as pursuing all legal means. I would caution the hearing officers against slandering my client.\u201d</p><p>The Dean waved a dismissive hand in the air. \u201cSit down. We don\u2019t respond to threats.\u201d</p><p>He waited until John took his seat before he tossed his pen on the table in front of him. He removed his glasses and placed them next to the pen.</p> <p>\u201cSince we seem to have hit upon an iceberg here, perhaps it would be best if I suspend this hearing, pending further investigation.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gritted his teeth, knowing that any delay would further jeopardize Julia\u2019s admission to Harvard.</p><p>\u201cBefore we suspend the hearing, I think that Miss Mitchell should be given the opportunity to have her story heard without having to be in the same room as Professor Emerson.\u201d Professor Chakravartty nodded in Julia\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson is a powerful man. Perhaps, Miss Mitchell, you were worried about your status and he took advantage of that. Maybe you believe that the relationship is consensual now, but did you always feel that way? More than one witness has reported that he was very harsh with you last semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is outrageous! Dr. Aras, are you just going to sit there while my client is slandered by one of the hearing officers? I want my objection minuted, and I want it noted that I intend to file a complaint with the Provost about Dr. Chakravartty\u2019s unprofessional behavior.\u201d John was nearly apoplectic as he jumped to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cI want the professor to stay,\u201d said Julia, quietly.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Professor Chakravartty\u2019s voice softened. \u201cI\u2019m sure this situation is stressful and confusing. But you should know that the committee is already aware of the email you sent to Professor Emerson, in which you pleaded with him to stop harassing you. Once again, I want to reiterate that we are here to discover the truth.\u201d</p><p>Julia blinked as the room around her grew fuzzy. Muffled sounds assaulted her eyes, almost as if she were sinking in water. Everything slowed down, especially her mind, as the enormity of Dr. Chakravartty\u2019s revelation crept over her skin like a frozen finger.</p><p>Meagan passed a few sheets of paper to John and Soraya.</p><p>John glanced at them quickly, before tossing them aside. \u201cIt\u2019s completely out of order for you surprise us with documents that were not mentioned in the letter you sent to my client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a trial; it\u2019s merely an investigatory hearing. We aren\u2019t bound by the rules of discovery, Mr. Green. Professor Chakravartty, you may proceed.\u201d The Dean leaned back in his chair, giving Tara his full attention.</p> <p>\u201cI know that you didn\u2019t file a sexual harassment complaint against Professor Emerson. But it isn\u2019t too late to do so. If you wish, we can have him dismissed from the room so we can discuss this.\u201d</p><p>John shook his head. \u201cMy client unequivocally denies any harassment, sexual or otherwise, against Miss Mitchell. If anyone should be investigated for harassment, it should be Christa Peterson, who maliciously instigated this mess in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Peterson will be held accountable for her actions, don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Professor Mwangi\u2019s voice was smooth and direct. \u201cMiss Mitchell, I\u2019m also interested in the email exchange we have here, in which you direct Professor Emerson to stop harassing you. Can you give us the context in which you made that statement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was low, yet it echoed loudly in the room.</p><p>\u201cA mistake?\u201d Professor Chakravartty repeated.</p><p>\u201cWe had a\u2014misunderstanding. I should never have used the word harassment. I was angry. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Soraya began whispering in Julia\u2019s ear but she pulled away, wringing her hands.</p><p>\u201cThere was no harassment. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t file a complaint.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Chakravartty stared at Julia skeptically before addressing the Dean. \u201cI\u2019d like to move that we suspend this hearing. I have a lot of unanswered questions that I\u2019d like to pose to the other witnesses. And I\u2019d like to interview Miss Mitchell in a less hostile environment.\u201d She glared in Gabriel\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell denied the allegation. She hasn\u2019t filed a complaint against my client, and under paragraph ten of the university\u2019s policy on sexual harassment, she can\u2019t be compelled to do so. Can we move on?\u201d John objected.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me how to run this proceeding, Mr. Green,\u201d the Dean snapped. \u201cWe can take all the time we need to investigate any matter pursuant to the matters before us.\u201d</p><p>The Dean gestured to the other hearing officers to move closer to his chair so they could whisper among themselves. The mere mention of a delay caused Julia\u2019s heart to pound, and she fixed frightened eyes on Gabriel, whose face had turned very red.</p><p>A few minutes later, the Dean put on his glasses and looked around the room.</p><p>\u201cAs Professor Chakravartty has suggested, I\u2019m going to suspend this hearing. You\u2019ve been forthcoming, Miss Mitchell, and for that I thank you. But you, Professor Emerson, have told us nothing. Your lack of cooperation has left us with no choice but to go back and speak to all the other witnesses. In particular, I have a few questions I\u2019d like to put to the chair of your department, Professor Martin.</p><p>\u201cIf the relationship between you the two of you was consensual, you\u2019re both at risk of having violated the non-fraternization policy. And you, Miss Mitchell, have possibly perjured yourself about when the relationship truly began. On the other hand, the email that you sent to the professor is inconsistent with your other statements. There\u2019s also the issue of the M.P. Emerson bursary, which you mention in your email.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to allow this proceeding to rush to judgment. So a delay is in order for us to complete our investigation. This delay could take several weeks, depending upon the level of cooperation we receive. Of course, if you\u2019d rather not have a delay, you could simply answer our questions.\u201d At this, the Dean gave Gabriel and John a stern look.</p><p>Julia watched as Gabriel closed his eyes, his lips moving as if he were whispering something to himself. Then his eyes snapped open and he stood to his feet.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said.</p><p>Six pairs of eyes swung to stare at the angry looking professor as he glared defiantly at the hearing officers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for a delay. I\u2019ll cooperate.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s jaw was set, his blue eyes flashing.</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart sank.</p><p>\u201cIt appears we\u2019ve finally captured your attention, Professor Emerson, and persuaded you to come out from behind your lawyer,\u201d said Professor Mwangi sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cSuch a remark is beneath you.\u201d Gabriel waved a dismissive hand in the air.</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to answer the committee\u2019s questions?\u201d The Dean interrupted the staring match between the two men.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Once John got over his surprise, he stood at Gabriel\u2019s side. \u201cDr. Aras, my client has retained counsel. Can you give me a moment to consult with him?\u201d</p><p>The Dean nodded, and John began whispering hastily in Gabriel\u2019s ear.</p><p>Julia could see that he did not like what John was saying, and she watched him mouth the words \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, Gabriel dismissed John with a murderous look. \u201cI am willing to answer any and all questions, but not while Miss Mitchell is in the room. Some of the answers I wish to give are of a personal nature and for various\u2014ah\u2014reasons I prefer to keep those answers confidential.\u201d</p><p>The Dean measured Gabriel intently and nodded. \u201cVery well. Miss Mitchell, you are dismissed for the moment, but please don\u2019t leave the building. We might have need of you shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Professor Emerson is intending to malign my client, he can do so in front of us,\u201d Soraya protested.</p><p>\u201cThe collective agreement with the faculty union ensures confidentiality in all judicial proceedings.\u201d The Dean\u2019s voice grew very cold. He took a moment to consult with his colleagues, then nodded in Julia\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cIf Professor Emerson offers testimony that implicates your client, you will be given the opportunity for rebuttal. Any matters not bearing on your case, Miss Mitchell, will be kept confidential. Miss Harandi, Miss Mitchell, you are both dismissed for the present. My assistant will notify you when your presence is required.\u201d</p><p>Soraya shook her head but took Julia\u2019s arm and tried to pull her toward the door at the back of the room.</p><p>Julia planted her feet. \u201cOur relationship was consensual. I knew what I was doing and I don\u2019t regret it. At all. This is not a tawdry affair. There was no harassment.\u201d</p><p>The Dean couldn\u2019t help but notice as Professor Emerson began to rub his eyes and mouth, cursing silently.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell, you will have your chance for a rebuttal. Now if you please...\u201d</p><p>Soraya quickly pulled Julia out of the room. She tried in vain to catch Gabriel\u2019s eye before she exited, but he hung his head, eyes shut.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Professor Jeremy Martin almost shouted into his office telephone.</p><p>Across campus, Meagan, the Dean\u2019s assistant, turned her back on the hearing officers as she prepared to speak more loudly.</p><p>\u201cI said that the Dean would like to ask you a few questions about Professor Emerson and Julianne Mitchell. Professor Emerson just confessed to having broken several university policies with respect to her. Can you hold the line, please, while I put you on speaker phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d breathed Jeremy, blinking and gaping like a fish.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Martin? The hearing officers would like to speak to you now.\u201d Meagan turned and locked eyes with the Dean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there. Ask the Dean not to do anything until I arrive!\u201d Jeremy slammed the telephone down on his desk and quickly exited his office, forgetting to close and lock the door behind him. He jogged out of the building and across Queen\u2019s Park, pausing only to avoid being run over by downtown traffic. By the time he\u2019d traversed the few blocks to where the hearing committee sat, he was winded, disheveled, and incredibly annoyed at how out of shape he was.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he panted, bursting through the doors. He placed his hands on his knees so he could attempt to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cThank you for joining us, Professor Martin.\u201d The Dean\u2019s tone was sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cI came\u2014as fast\u2014as I could. What\u2019s\u2014going on?\u201d</p><p>The Dean gestured to his assistant to fetch the ailing professor a glass of water, which he drank gratefully. The beverage gave him a moment to find Gabriel, who was sitting stoically next to his lawyer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Dean frowned. \u201cIt appears that things are amiss in your department. Professor Emerson has just confessed to pursuing Miss Mitchell and engaging in an amorous relationship with her while she was his student. I\u2019d like to know how long you\u2019ve known about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Jeremy grabbed a chair and sat on it heavily.</p><p>\u201cYou told us Professor Emerson disclosed his relationship with Miss Mitchell to you this semester, but that you couldn\u2019t recall when. I\u2019m wondering if you had any inkling that they were involved last semester?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s eyebrows knitted together in confusion. \u201cI\u2014what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabriel Emerson tried to cover up his affair with his student by transferring her thesis supervision and seminar work to Katherine Picton,\u201d Professor Mwangi explained. \u201cWhat did you know about this and when?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s expression grew grim. \u201cWith respect, am I on trial here or is Gabriel? I was told that you wanted to ask me questions about a matter arising between Gabriel and Miss Mitchell. I was offered no indication that I was under suspicion, otherwise I would have informed the Faculty Association and brought my union representative.\u201d</p><p>Professor Mwangi abruptly closed his mouth.</p><p>\u201cJeremy, there\u2019s no need to be defensive. We\u2019re simply interested in whether or not you can shed any light on the account Professor Emerson has offered us. That\u2019s all.\u201d The Dean offered a withering look in Robert\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWe can return to the question of the timeline in a moment. I\u2019m interested in an email that Miss Mitchell sent to Professor Emerson in which she accused him of harassment and told him that she would be returning the M. P. Emerson bursary. What can you tell us about that?\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy\u2019s eyes slid over to Gabriel\u2019s.</p><p>He had no idea why Gabriel had confessed; it didn\u2019t make sense. He was far more likely to avoid any kind of discipline if he said nothing. Having confessed, he\u2019d handed his career to the Dean in an act that could only be described as academic hara-kiri. Moreover, he\u2019d implicated Jeremy with his confession, and that was something he did not appreciate, not one bit.</p><p>\u201cI know of no such harassment. In my position as Chair of Italian Studies, I have a spotless record of upholding university policies.\u201d He glanced in Meagan\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like my administrative record to be included as part of this proceeding.\u201d</p><p>The Dean waved a hand at his assistant, acquiescing to Jeremy\u2019s demand.</p><p>He looked at the hearing officers. \u201cHas Miss Mitchell filed a harassment complaint?\u201d</p><p>The hearing officers shook their heads.</p> <p>\u201cMay I see the email?\u201d</p><p>The Dean nodded to Meagan, and she quickly passed a piece of paper to Jeremy.</p><p>He used this opportunity to buy some time for his over-wrought brain, hoping to get some clue from Gabriel\u2019s body language as to what the devil he\u2019d been thinking. But still, Gabriel would not look at him, simply sitting stone-faced, clenching his fists.</p><p>\u201cSince Miss Mitchell never reported the harassment, I can only infer that she changed her mind. Perhaps she sent the email in haste and repented at leisure. It sounds as if she didn\u2019t hold his behavior against him.\u201d Jeremy handed the paper back to Meagan.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the bursary?\u201d asked Professor Chakravartty.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s eyes flitted to the Dean\u2019s. \u201cI advised the Dean in an email that donor services was approached by a philanthropic organization from the United States, whose name escapes me. The charity wished to bestow a bursary on the top MA student in my department. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the connection between Professor Emerson and the bursary?\u201d asked the Dean.</p><p>Jeremy shrugged. \u201cNone.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Mwangi clasped his fingers together on the table in front of him. \u201cI find that difficult to believe. There is a coincidence of name, department, and student. Miss Mitchell seems to have associated the bursary with Professor Emerson\u2014why else would she threaten to return it?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy smiled wryly. \u201cDo you remember what life was like when you were a grad student? Living on coffee and ramen noodles and going without sleep? Students engage in all kinds of erratic behavior under those conditions. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all seen worse.</p><p>\u201cI assure you\u2014\u201d At this, he nodded in Gabriel\u2019s direction. \u201cProfessor Emerson had nothing to do with the bursary. I\u2019m the one who awarded it, and I did so based on the fact that Miss Mitchell was the top master\u2019s student admitted into our program. You can speak to Tracy in donor services about the charity that made the donation and you can view her paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tried very hard to hide his surprise at the fact that his chair was defending him. He fidgeted in his seat, swiping a hand through his hair as he waited to see how the Dean would respond.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d The Dean took off his glasses and nibbled at one of the ends of the arms thoughtfully. \u201cAs you\u2019ve heard, Professor Emerson has confessed, taking upon himself full responsibility for his involvement with Miss Mitchell. By his own admission, he played on her vulnerability, promising her that \u2018he would take care\u2019 of their situation. His use of Professor Picton seems to bear that out, as does Miss Mitchell\u2019s nervous behavior during these proceedings.</p><p>\u201cSince Professor Emerson was in a position of power over Miss Mitchell, and since more than witness has testified that he was initially very harsh with her, we don\u2019t believe that their relationship was consensual.\u201d At this, his eyes met Professor Chakravartty\u2019s, who nodded triumphantly. \u201cConsequently, we are inclined to excuse her perjury, since it was clearly under duress, and we will dismiss any allegations against her. Unless you can suggest a reason why we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel caught Jeremy\u2019s eye with a stare so sharp, Jeremy almost winced.</p><p>\u201cI see no reason why Miss Mitchell should be punished, no.\u201d Jeremy tugged at his shirt collar uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWe will be encouraging Miss Mitchell to consider the possibility of filing a harassment complaint. Having said that, and given the fact that Professor Emerson has been forthcoming, I\u2019m not inclined to drag this matter out. However, I wonder if I should recommend to the Provost that your department be placed under scrutiny. We\u2019re facing a lawsuit from another of your students, Miss Peterson. And Miss Mitchell has filed a harassment complaint against her. That\u2019s several unfortunate events in one semester, Professor Martin. What is going on in your department?\u201d The Dean gave Jeremy a stern look.</p><p>He straightened his spine. \u201cI am as surprised and distressed as you are. But surely you can\u2019t blame me for failing to have a prurient interest in the personal lives of those in my department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we expect you to maintain a safe environment for students, especially females.\u201d Professor Chakravartty\u2019s tone was firm and disapproving.</p><p>The Dean nodded in her direction. \u201cNevertheless, I am cognizant of your spotless record and the reputation of your department. So I\u2019d like to ask for your input on what we should do in terms of consequences for these policy violations, and I invite you to meet with us while we discuss it.\u201d The Dean waved Jeremy over.</p><p>Jeremy cleared his throat. \u201cThank you. I\u2019d like a word with Professor Emerson first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis testimony has been minuted. Meagan will provide you with a transcript.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I am his supervisor, I\u2019d prefer to ask my own questions. I doubt you\u2019d deny me that right, as his Chair.\u201d</p><p>The Dean frowned. \u201cVery well. You have five minutes.\u201d</p><p>With a nod of his head, Jeremy walked to the door, waiting for Gabriel to join him.</p><p>Gabriel waved aside John\u2019s attempt at accompanying him and walked slowly strode toward his old friend, his shoulders sagging.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck have you done?\u201d Jeremy hissed, turning his back on the hearing officers.</p><p>Gabriel mirrored his position. \u201cThey were going to suspend the meeting and launch an extended investigation. Julianne would have lost her spot at Harvard, not to mention the fact that she was in danger of being punished for academic fraud and perjury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think is going to happen now? The Dean could dismiss you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I made my statement, my lawyer asked for leniency. The Dean agreed, provided I wasn\u2019t involved in any criminal activity.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy scrubbed at his face with his hands. \u201cSo you went ahead and admitted everything? Are you crazy? You should have kept your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin Julianne\u2019s life? Never!\u201d</p><p>Jeremy gave his colleague a long, cold look. \u201cThey could revoke your tenure. If you\u2019re dismissed, no university will touch you. Your career will be over.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do!\u201d Jeremy fumed. \u201cI\u2019m not about to lose one of my best professors over some grad student. With all the funding cuts being made in our division, I might not be able to replace you. It\u2019s bad enough we have only one Dante specialist. How am I supposed to run a decent department without one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t.\u201d Jeremy glared. \u201cYou and Julianne and\u2014and that Christa are crippling my department in one fell swoop. Even if I could get permission to replace you, who is going to want to work for me when news of Christa\u2019s lawsuit gets out? Not to mention your affair with Julianne!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an affair,\u201d Gabriel whispered, stubbornly. \u201cThe Dean promised complete confidentiality. That\u2019s why I agreed to speak on the record.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get it, do you? I\u2019m your friend. And you made me look like an imbecile in front of my boss. It\u2019s quite possible they\u2019re going to investigate me in order to discover what I knew and when. I\u2019ll have to appear before God knows how many committees and possibly in court!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Gabriel stiffly.</p><p>\u201cYou should be. I look like an idiot who allowed a predatory professor to wreak havoc on two female grad students. You\u2019re lucky Tara is on the committee and not the Chair of Women\u2019s Studies. She would have strung you up by your balls in the middle of campus.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel straightened his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them you knew nothing and take the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy took a step closer, staring his younger colleague straight in the eye. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that martyrdom bullshit. You\u2019re hurting a lot of people in your quest to protect your conquest. Now my ass is on the line. What do you think is going to happen to her if they fire you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they try to fire me, I\u2019ll sue them.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy put his hands on his waist. \u201cIt will be too late. As soon as you\u2019re dismissed, the people at Harvard will hear about it and Julianne\u2019s MA will be tainted. You\u2019ll ruin her and my reputation and the reputation of all the other professors and students in my department. We\u2019ll all be tarred with your brush.\u201d Jeremy shook his head. \u201cHow could you do this to us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel was silent, slowly clenching and unclenching his fists.</p><p>Jeremy swore loudly and was about to turn away when Gabriel caught his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize this would have implications for you and everyone else. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d Gabriel paused, a tortured look on his face. \u201cHelp us. Please.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy stared in disbelief. Professor Emerson looked panicked and desperate, which was an expression he\u2019d never seen before. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of damage trying to protect her. You should have denied everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the Dean would have punished her or dragged the investigation out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have re-applied next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd been turned down outright. The longer the investigation continued, the more likely that details would be leaked. It\u2019s a small academic community and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know it.\u201d Jeremy shook his head. \u201cAnd you knew better than to fuck a student.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s face reddened and he took a menacing step forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t fuck her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you didn\u2019t. Now we\u2019re all fucked,\u201d Jeremy snapped.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s nostrils flared as he held back an angry retort.</p><p>Jeremy gave his friend a long, searching look. \u201cMy first priority is to my department. But I don\u2019t want to see you or Julianne ruined. Enough young women have suffered at the hands of their professors, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was silent, his lips pressed together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you, but we\u2019re doing this my way. Do you understand? I\u2019m not risking everything so you can turn around and fuck it up again.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel paused. Then he nodded his agreement.</p><p>\u201cNow all I have to do is convince the Dean to be satisfied with an ounce of your flesh rather than a pound.\u201d</p><p>With barely an acknowledgement, Jeremy walked to the front of the room and joined the hearing officers in their deliberations.</p><p>Gabriel hung his head, breathing a restrained sigh of relief.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>By the time Meagan ushered the ladies back into the room, Julia\u2019s fingernails had been chewed to the quick and Soraya\u2019s adrenaline was at an all-time high.</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes were drawn immediately to Gabriel, and what she saw upset her. His shoulders were hunched, and he was leaning forward in his chair, hands clasped between his knees tensely, head lowered.</p><p>She stared at him, willing him to look at her.</p> <p>But he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Professor Martin sat next to Gabriel, arms crossed against his chest. He didn\u2019t appear happy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell, allow me to come straight to the point. In light of Professor Emerson\u2019s testimony, you are excused. We will be informing the Registrar\u2019s Office that the grade assigned to you in Professor Emerson\u2019s seminar should be allowed to stand.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s mouth opened in shock at the Dean\u2019s pronouncement.</p><p>\u201cWe will do our utmost to ensure that you are not victimized further.\u201d The Dean glared in Gabriel\u2019s direction. \u201cIf Professor Emerson troubles you in any way, or if you have concerns about the repercussions of your former involvement with him, please inform Professor Martin immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou are free to pursue a harassment complaint against Professor Emerson, but you must do so within sixty days of the submission of your final academic work in your program.\u201d</p><p>The Dean nodded at Soraya. \u201cI\u2019m sure your lawyer will explain the particulars of the harassment policy to you. I know you\u2019ve filed a complaint against Miss Peterson, but we\u2019re hopeful that you and she can drop your complaints against each other, given the outcome of this hearing. You\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>He began shuffling his paperwork.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Aras.\u201d Soraya smiled widely and exchanged a nod and a meaningful look with Tara.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a victim,\u201d said Julia, stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d said the Dean, peering over the rims of his glasses.</p><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019m not a victim. Our relationship is consensual.\u201d She turned to look at Gabriel. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel kept his eyes fixed on the floor.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell, the committee has ensured that Professor Emerson was given due consideration.\u201d Professor Mwangi spoke to her gently. \u201cBut in light of his confession, we are holding him accountable for his actions. And that includes seeing to your welfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy welfare is tied to him. If he\u2019s going to be punished, then punish me too.\u201d She took a step closer to the table behind which the committee sat.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s head shot up, and he gave Julia a furious look.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mitchell, the university has a duty to protect students from being preyed upon by their supervisors. Please, let us do our job.\u201d Professor Chakravartty\u2019s tone was not unsympathetic.</p><p>\u201cWe did this together. If he\u2019s guilty, so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what he said! Give me a chance to respond.\u201d Julia looked desperately at the faces of the hearing officers, one after the other, hoping that someone, anyone would relent.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson has admitted to engaging in an inappropriate relationship with you while you were his student. Professor Picton has confirmed that she marked your work in his seminar and supervised your thesis. So we are inclined to be lenient with him. Unless you insist otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I insist otherwise! I want you to let him go.\u201d</p><p>The hearing officers shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you believe him instead of me? I\u2019m the student. You should weigh my testimony more heavily. He didn\u2019t hurt me. You have to believe me!\u201d Julia grew desperate, on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cMiss Harandi, control your client.\u201d The Dean\u2019s voice rose with irritation.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Julia, taking a step closer to the hearing officers. \u201cYou have to believe me. Let him go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will ask you and all other parties to sign a confidentiality agreement that is as much for your protection as for the integrity of these proceedings. Once again, if you have further difficulties, you are to inform Professor Martin.\u201d The Dean nodded at Soraya.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Julia.\u201d Soraya tugged on her arm, in vain. \u201cLet\u2019s go before they change their mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, what happened?\u201d</p><p>Julia took a step in his direction, but the pointed toe of her boot got caught in the carpet and she tumbled to her knees.</p><p>Finally her eyes connected with Gabriel\u2019s as he looked down on her. She inhaled slowly as she realized that his dark blue eyes were cold and empty. He lowered his head.</p><p>In an instant, the fire in her veins turned to ice.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.\u201d Soraya leaned back against the vanity in the ladies\u2019 washroom while her client sat crying softly in a chair. She pulled her BlackBerry out of her briefcase, scrolling through her emails before returning the cursed device to its former resting place.</p><p>\u201cI know John. His plan would have been to say nothing, then file a lawsuit. He would have tried to show that everything was your fault, setting the groundwork for Gabriel\u2019s defense. He never would have agreed to this kind of outcome.\u201d</p><p>Soraya fixed her client with a stern eye. \u201cDo you know something? Some secret that Gabriel might worry would come out? Something extremely damaging?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head vehemently. Gabriel\u2019s drug use was in the past as was his rampant promiscuity, including his encounter with Professor Singer. Of course, there was the small matter of the black market Botticelli prints, but she would never reveal their existence to anyone, least of all to Soraya.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d The attorney\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d Julia sniffled, wiping her nose with a tissue.</p><p>Soraya tossed her long, dark hair. \u201cThen he must be keeping secrets from you too. I can\u2019t imagine what would be more damaging to him than confessing to having an inappropriate relationship with you. I thought you told me you didn\u2019t sleep with him until December?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would he tell them you were together while you were still his student?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they fired him?\u201d Julia changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Soraya exhaled loudly. \u201cEmerson is tenured and from the body language in the room, he has the support of his Chair. But who knows? David is a self-righteous bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Gabriel was lying to protect me?\u201d</p><p>Soraya smothered a patronizing smile, for really, it would have been inappropriate to smile at that moment. \u201cHuman beings are selfish. He was protecting himself\u2014hiding some secret that he didn\u2019t want to come out or trading a confession for leniency. Gabriel went rogue and refused to let John fight the charges. Otherwise, we\u2019d still be sitting in the hall, waiting.\u201d</p><p>Julia stood at the sink and washed her face and hands, trying to make herself appear presentable.</p><p>Soraya shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be callous, but I really don\u2019t think you should be wasting your tears on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you were an intriguing diversion, in comparison to his other women. He probably said pretty things so you\u2019d screw him and keep your mouth shut. But men like him can\u2019t be trusted. And they never change.\u201d She continued hurriedly as she saw the horrified expression on Julia\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to mention this, but a friend of mine hooked up with him a couple of times. They met at a club about a year ago and ended up fucking in the washroom.</p><p>\u201cOne day last fall, he called her out of the blue. One more hook up and she never saw or heard from him again. It was as if he\u2019d vanished.\u201d Soraya measured Julia\u2019s reaction. \u201cWhy would you want to be with someone like that? He was probably screwing other women the entire time he was with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him. Don\u2019t judge him.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was quietly aggressive.</p><p>Soraya simply shrugged and dug around in her briefcase for her lipstick.</p><p>Julia closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to process these new revelations.</p><p>Gabriel and I started getting close last fall\u2014was he sleeping with someone else when he was sending me flowers and emails?Was he lying to me about Paulina?</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t know what to believe. Her heart told her to believe Gabriel, but she couldn\u2019t deny the fact that Soraya had planted a seed of doubt.</p><p>They walked into the hallway and headed for the stairs, hoping to make their escape.</p><p>John and Gabriel were doing the same thing. Neither of the men looked happy.</p><p>\u201cGabriel!\u201d Julia called.</p><p>John glared in her direction. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Gabriel. You can\u2019t be seen with her.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked over into conflicted blue eyes. He didn\u2019t look disgusted anymore; he looked sober and anxious.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you done enough damage for one day?\u201d spat his attorney as Julia took a hesitant step in their direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak to her like that.\u201d Gabriel moved to stand in between them, shielding Julia with his body.

I knew you were na\u00efve, but just how stupid are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, take your finger out of Miss Mitchell\u2019s face or I will separate it from your body.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice dropped, his tone quiet but chilling. \u201cYou do not speak to her like that. Ever. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p> <p>John closed his mouth.</p><p>Soraya used this as an opportunity to put him on the defensive. \u201cMy client is better off without the theatrics of either one of you. Don\u2019t pretend you weren\u2019t going to blame her for everything to save your client.

But his mask was firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cWhy did the Dean say that they were going to protect me from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go. Now.\u201d John tried to separate the couple as a noise inside the meeting room alerted them to the fact that the hearing officers were about to recess.</p> <p>\u201cDid they fire you?\u201d Julia asked tremulously.</p><p>Gabriel gave her a pained look, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell done, John. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re proud of yourself,\u201d Soraya hissed. \u201cDid you have to sell your soul to David? Or maybe your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow me, Soraya,\u201d said John.</p><p>\u201cSo you kept your job, but you can\u2019t talk to me? What about last night, Gabriel?\u201d Julia reached out a trembling finger toward his hand.</p><p>He pulled out of her reach and glanced sideways at John and Soraya, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you\u2019d never fuck me. But what about last night? No words, no I love you, not even a note or a text this morning. Is that all it was to you? A good-bye fuck?\u201d Julia\u2019s whisper caught on an involuntary sob, and she raised her voice. \u201cWho\u2019s the Angelfucker now?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel flinched.</p> <p>It was more than a flinch; actually, it was more like a reel backward from a punch. He closed his eyes and groaned softly, shifting his weight to his heels as his fists clenched at his sides.</p><p>Everyone watched as his skin took on a ghostlike pallor.</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, Julianne,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou keep your job, but you won\u2019t talk to me? How could you do this?\u201d she cried.</p><p>His eyes flew open, and they were a brilliant, livid sapphire.</p><p>\u201cYou think that I\u2019d just show up, fuck you, and that would be how I would say good-bye?\u201d</p><p>Julia watched his fists shake as he fought to maintain control.</p><p>\u201cThat was good-bye?\u201d Her voice caught on the last word.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes lasered into hers as if he were trying to communicate something wordlessly. He leaned forward so his nose was only inches from hers and dropped his voice so it was almost inaudible. \u201cI did not fuck you. I\u2019ve never fucked you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back slightly so there was some distance between them. He drew a long, unhurried breath. \u201cYou were throwing your life away for nothing\u2014all those years of hard work, everything you dreamed of and ever wanted was going to be taken from you and you would never be able to get it back.</p><p>\u201cThere was no way I could watch you commit academic suicide. I told you that I would go to Hell to rescue you and that\u2019s just what I did.\u201d He lifted his chin. \u201cAnd I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>Julia leapt forward, jabbing a finger into Gabriel\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make decisions for me! This is my life and my dreams. If I want to give them up, who the hell are you to take that decision away from me?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to love me, Gabriel. You\u2019re supposed to support me when I decide to stand up for myself. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted me to do? And instead, you cut a deal with them and dump me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you two shut the hell up?\u201d Soraya hissed. \u201cThe Dean will be walking through the door any minute. Come on, Julia. Right now.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on her client\u2019s elbow while John tried to step in between the two quarreling lovers.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it? They say it\u2019s over and it\u2019s over? When have you ever followed the rules, Gabriel? Now you decide to follow them?\u201d Julia asked, still furious.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression changed immediately. \u201cI had no choice, H\u00e9loise,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCircumstances were beyond\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my name was Beatrice. Of course, Abelard abandoned H\u00e9loise to keep his job. So I guess the name is more than apt,\u201d she spat, stepping away from him.</p><p>At that moment, Professor Martin entered the hallway. He scowled and began walking toward them.</p><p>Gabriel turned away from Jeremy, lowering his voice further. \u201cRead my sixth letter. Paragraph four.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your student, Professor. I won\u2019t be doing any reading assignments.\u201d</p><p>Soraya pulled Julia away, and the two women hurried down the stairs just as the hearing officers came through the door.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Gabriel ducked into the men\u2019s room as soon as Julia left. He couldn\u2019t risk calling her, since Jeremy might enter at any moment, but he was far from satisfied that she understood what was happening. Turning on a faucet in order to make noise, he quickly tapped out a short but explanatory email on his iPhone.</p><p>Having sent it, he turned off the faucet and exited, tucking his phone into his jacket pocket. He tried very hard to look grim and defeated.</p><p>As he walked over to the two men, Jeremy\u2019s cell phone chirped.</p><p>When Julia awoke the next morning the numbness had worn off. Sleep would have been a welcome respite from reality, except for the nightmares. She\u2019d been haunted by various dreams, all involving the morning she woke up alone in the orchard. She was frightened and lost and Gabriel was nowhere to be found.</p><p>It was almost noon when she crawled out of bed to check her messages. She\u2019d expected at least a text or a one line email, offering some kind of explanation. But there was nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d acted so strangely the day before. On the one hand he\u2019d told her he hadn\u2019t fucked her; on the other, he\u2019d called her H\u00e9loise. She didn\u2019t want to believe that he was so cruel as to flaunt the fact that he was ending things with a play on words, but he\u2019d used the word good-bye.</p><p>Her feelings of betrayal ran deep, for Gabriel had promised that he would never leave her. He was far too eager to go back on his promise, she thought, despite the fact that the university had no jurisdiction over his personal life, so long as she was no longer his student.</p><p>A dark thought occurred to her. Perhaps Gabriel had tired of her and decided to put an end to their union. The university had simply handed him an opportunity to do so.</p><p>If her falling out with Gabriel had occurred a few months earlier, she would have stayed in bed for three days. As it was, she dialed his cell phone with the intention of demanding an explanation. He didn\u2019t answer. She left a terse and impatient voice mail, asking him to call her.</p><p>Frustrated, she took a shower, hoping that the time to herself would afford her the opportunity to see her situation with clarity. Unfortunately, all she could think about was the evening in Italy when Gabriel showered her and washed her hair.</p><p>After she dressed, she decided to search for Gabriel\u2019s sixth letter, so she could read paragraph four. He\u2019d given her a clue, she thought, as to what was really happening. All she needed to do was find his words.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by letter. Did he mean emails or texts? Or both? If Gabriel was counting the emails, cards, and notes that he\u2019d written to her from the very beginning of their relationship, then by her calculation the sixth letter was a note he\u2019d left her the morning after their horrendous fight in the Dante seminar. Luckily, she kept it.</p><p>She pulled out the paper and read it eagerly.</p><p>Julianne,</p><p>I hope you\u2019ll find everything you need here.</p><p>If not, Rachel stocked the vanity in the guest washroom with a number of different items. Please help yourself.</p><p>My clothes are at your disposal.</p><p>Please choose a sweater as the weather has turned cold today.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>Julia wasn\u2019t exactly in the best frame of mind to embark on a detective mission or to engage in any elaborate decoding of messages. Nevertheless, she turned her attention to the fourth paragraph and tried to figure out what Gabriel had been trying to communicate to her.</p><p>He\u2019d lent her the British-racing-green sweater, but she\u2019d returned it. Was he trying to tell her to look at one of the clothing items he\u2019d bought her? Julia pulled out everything he\u2019d ever bought her or that she\u2019d borrowed and placed them all on her bed. She forced herself to take her time examining each item. But there didn\u2019t appear to be anything unusual about any of them.</p><p>Was he trying to tell her to weather the storm? Or was he simply saying that his affection for her had turned cold and this was good-bye?</p><p>Her anger burned blue. She stomped to the bathroom to wash her hands, catching sight of her image in the mirror. The wide-eyed nervous girl who had started at the University of Toronto in September was gone. Instead, Julia saw a pale and upset young woman, with pinched lips and flashing eyes. She was no longer the timid Rabbit or the seventeen-year-old Beatrice. She was Julianne Mitchell, almost-MA, and she would be damned if she\u2019d spend the rest of her life simply taking the scraps that others deigned to throw at her.</p><p>If he has a message for me, he can damn well say it in person, she thought. I\u2019m not going on a scavenger hunt just so he can assuage his conscience.</p><p>Yes, she loved him. Looking at the photograph album he made for her birthday, she knew that she would love him forever. But love was not an excuse for cruelty. She was not a plaything, an H\u00e9loise, to be dropped like a pair of dirty socks. If he was breaking things off with her, she\u2019d make him say so to her face. She was simply going to give him until after dinner to do so.</p><p>In early evening, she walked to the Manulife Building, the key to Gabriel\u2019s apartment in her pocket. With every step she imagined what she would say. She wouldn\u2019t cry, she promised herself. She would be strong. And she would demand answers.</p><p>As she turned the corner and approached the front door, she saw a tall, impeccably dressed blonde exit the building. The woman looked at her watch and tapped her foot impatiently as the doorman waved over a waiting taxi. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia hid behind a tree. She peeked around the trunk in order to take another look.</p><p>At first glance, she\u2019d thought the woman in question was Paulina; upon inspection she realized her mistake. Julia breathed a sigh of relief as she approached the building. Seeing Paulina with Gabriel on this day of all days would have been devastating. Surely, he wouldn\u2019t do that to her. Gabriel was supposed to be her Dante. He was supposed to love her enough to travel through Hell to protect her, not take Paulina back the moment their relationship was threatened.</p><p>With some trepidation, Julia entered the lobby and waved to the security guard, who recognized her. She decided against announcing her presence to Gabriel and took the elevator to his floor. She shivered as she contemplated what she might find in his apartment.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to knock but simply let herself in, fearing that she\u2019d find Gabriel compromised. But something strange caught her attention as soon as she\u2019d closed the door. All the lights in the apartment were off and the hall closet was open and half-empty, hangers and shoes haphazardly thrown on the floor. It was very unlike Gabriel to leave things in such a mess.</p> <p>She switched on several lights and placed her key on the table where he always kept his keys. His keys were not to be found.</p><p>\u201cGabriel? Hello?\u201d</p><p>She ventured into the kitchen and was shocked by what she found. An empty bottle of Scotch lay on the counter, next to a broken glass. Dirty plates and cutlery were dumped in the sink.</p><p>Steeling herself for what she might find, she walked to the fireplace, only to discover a mark on the wall and scattered glass shards on the floor. She could see Gabriel flinging his Scotch in anger, but she had a hard time imagining him leaving broken pieces for someone to step on.</p><p>Desperately worried, she crept down the darkened hall and into the master bedroom. Clothes were strewn across the bed, the drawers to Gabriel\u2019s dresser half-opened. His closet was similarly disarrayed, and Julia noticed that many of his clothes were gone as was his large suitcase.</p> <p>But what caused her to inhale sharply were the walls. All the framed photographs of her, and of Gabriel and her together, had been removed and piled face down on the bed, leaving the walls bare except for the hooks on which the photographs had been hung.</p><p>Julia gasped in horror as she saw that the reproduction of Holiday\u2019s painting of Dante and Beatrice had been taken down and was now leaning against the credenza, its back on display.</p><p>Shocked, she sank down on a chair. He\u2019s gone, she thought.</p><p>Julia burst into tears, wondering how he could have so easily broken his promises. She searched the apartment in vain for a note or some indication of where he\u2019d gone. When she came across the telephone she contemplated calling Rachel. But the thought of having to explain that she and Gabriel were over was too much to bear.</p><p>With one last look she turned out all the lights and was about to walk through the door when she stopped. Something niggled at the back of her mind. Closing the door, she returned to Gabriel\u2019s bedroom. Searching with her fingers, she fumbled about, looking for something. When she didn\u2019t find it, she turned on the light.</p><p>The photograph that Rachel had taken at Lobby several months earlier was missing. Gabriel always kept it on top of his dresser. In the picture, he and Julia were dancing, and he was looking at her with no little heat.</p> <p>Julia stood for a moment, looking at the empty space. It was possible, she thought, that he\u2019d destroyed the picture. But a quick inspection of the wastepaper baskets in the bedroom and bathroom suggested he hadn\u2019t thrown it away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d left or why he\u2019d left without offering her an explanation, but she began to suspect that all was not as it seemed.</p><p>As she took one last look at the empty hangers in the closet, she contemplated taking her clothes with her but only for an instant. Strangely enough, they no longer felt as if they were hers.</p><p>A few minutes later, she was waiting for the elevator, feeling battered and bruised. Her nose began to run as she wiped away a few tears. A hasty search of her pockets yielded no Kleenex, only lint. This made her tears fall faster.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d a voice at her elbow said, holding out a man\u2019s handkerchief.</p><p>Julia took it gratefully, noticing the embroidered initials S.I.R. on it. She wiped her eyes and attempted to return it, but a pair of hands made a motion of refusal.</p><p>\u201cMy mother is always giving me handkerchiefs. I have dozens.\u201d</p><p>She looked up into kind brown eyes that were partially hidden behind a pair of rimless spectacles and recognized one of Gabriel\u2019s neighbors. He was wearing a heavy wool coat and a navy beret.</p> <p>(Which, because of his age and heterosexuality could only be explained by the fact that he was French Canadian.)</p><p>When the elevator arrived, he politely held the door open for her before following her inside.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong? Can I help?\u201d His lightly accented voice cut through her haze.</p><p>\u201cGabriel is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I ran into him while he was on his way out.\u201d The neighbor frowned at the tears that were still welling up in Julia\u2019s eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t he tell you? I thought you were his \u2014\u201d He looked at her expectantly.</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent as the elevator continued its descent to the ground floor. Once again, when the door opened, he held it for her.</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cDo you know where he went?\u201d</p><p>The neighbor accompanied her to the lobby. \u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t ask. He was in quite a state, you see.\u201d The neighbor leaned closer and dropped his voice. \u201cHe reeked of Scotch and was extremely cross. Not in the mood to chat.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled a watery smile. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a bother. I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t tell you he was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wiped her face with his handkerchief once again.</p><p>The neighbor began muttering something about Gabriel in French. Something that sounded a good deal like cochon.</p><p>\u201cI could deliver a message for you, when he returns,\u201d the neighbor offered. \u201cHe tends to drop by my apartment when he runs out of milk.\u201d</p><p>Julia was quiet for a moment, then she swallowed hard. \u201cJust tell him that he broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>The neighbor gave her a reluctant, pained nod before taking his leave of her.</p><p>Julia walked outside into the bracing wind and began her long walk home, alone.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Several hours after the hearing, Gabriel sat in his apartment shrouded in darkness. The only light visible came from the blue and orange flames that flickered in his fireplace. He was surrounded by her. Completely surrounded by her memory and her ghost.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he swore he could smell her scent or hear her laughter echoing down the hall. His bedroom had become like a shrine, which was why he was sitting in front of the fire.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bear to look at the large black and white photographs of the two of them. Especially the one that hung over his bed\u2014Julianne in all of her magnificence, lying on her stomach with her naked back exposed, partially wrapped in a sheet, gazing up at him in adoration with sex-mussed hair and a sweet, sated smile...</p><p>In every room he had a memory of her\u2014some of them joyous and others bittersweet, like dark, dark chocolate. He stalked to the dining room and poured himself two fingers\u2019 worth of his very best Scotch and downed it quickly, relishing the burning sensation as it stung his throat. He tried desperately not to think about Julia standing in front of him, jabbing an angry finger into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to love me, Gabriel. You\u2019re supposed to support me when I decide to stand up for myself. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted me to do? And instead, you cut a deal with them and dump me?\u201d</p><p>At the memory of the look of betrayal in her eyes, Gabriel threw his empty glass at the wall, watching it shatter and fall to the floor. Shards of crystal like jagged icicles scattered over the hardwood, glimmering in the firelight.</p><p>He knew what he had to do; he simply needed the courage in order to do it. Grabbing the bottle, he walked reluctantly to the bedroom. Two more swallows and he was able to throw his suitcase on the bed. He didn\u2019t bother to fold his clothes. He barely cared about taking the essentials.</p><p>He thought about what it was like to be banished. About Odysseus\u2019s tears at being so far away from home, from his wife, from his people. Now Gabriel understood exile.</p><p>When he was finished, he placed the framed photograph from atop his dresser in his briefcase. Stroking a tender finger over the face of his beloved, he downed more Scotch before staggering to the study.</p><p>He ignored the red velvet wing chair, for if he turned to look at it, he would see her, curled up like a cat, reading a book. She\u2019d worry her lower lip between her teeth, her adorable eyebrows scrunched in thought. Had any man ever loved, adored, worshipped a woman more?</p><p>None but Dante, he thought. And he was seized by a sudden inspiration.</p><p>He unlocked one of the drawers of his desk. This was the memory drawer. Maia\u2019s picture was there, along with the scant remnants of his childhood\u2014his grandfather\u2019s pocket watch, some jewelry that belonged to his mother, her diary, and a few old photographs. He removed a photograph and an illustration before locking the drawer again, placing the items in his pocket. Pausing only to open a black velvet box and withdraw a ring, he headed for the door.</p><p>The chill in the Toronto air sobered Gabriel as he walked determinedly to his office. He only hoped he would be able to find what he needed.</p><p>The building in which the Department of Italian Studies was housed was dark. As he switched on the light in his office, he was assaulted by memories. Memories of the first time Julia visited his office and he\u2019d been unspeakably rude. Memories when Julia stood by the door after that disastrous seminar, telling him she wasn\u2019t happy. Telling him she didn\u2019t want Paul. He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands, as if he could block out the visions.</p><p>He packed his fancy leather briefcase with only the files he needed and a few books, before searching the shelves. Moments later, he found the simple textbook and breathed a sigh of relief. He penned a few words, added his bookmarks, then switched off the light and locked the door.</p><p>All faculty in the department held keys to the departmental office, where Mrs. Jenkins\u2019s desk and the mailboxes were located. Gabriel used the light from his iPhone to find the box he wanted. He deposited the book, stroking his fingers lovingly across the name labeling the mailbox. He noted with satisfaction that other textbooks were in other boxes, then with a heavy heart, he exited the office.</p><p>Paul Norris was angry. His anger was directed at the most evil man on the planet, Gabriel Emerson, who had verbally abused and seduced his friend before dumping her.</p><p>If Paul had been a fan of Jane Austen, he would have likened Professor Emerson to Mr. Wickham. Or perhaps, to Willoughby. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was all he could do not to pummel Emerson senseless and give him the ass whipping he\u2019d been in desperate need of all year. Additionally, Paul felt betrayed. For God knows how long, Julia had been involved with a man she called Owen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel Owen Emerson.</p><p>Perhaps she wanted Paul to figure it out. But it had never crossed his mind that Owen was, in fact, Professor Emerson. He\u2019d cursed the man and told her secrets about him, for God\u2019s sake. Secrets about Professor Singer. And while she was accepting his sympathy, she was sleeping with him. No wonder she\u2019d sworn up and down that Owen hadn\u2019t bitten her neck, that it was some other asshole.</p><p>Paul thought of Professor Emerson doing depraved things to Julia, and her small, small hands. Julia, who was sweet and kind, with blushing pink cheeks. Julia, who never passed a homeless man on the street without giving him something. Perhaps the true pain of betrayal was the realization that sweet Miss Mitchell had shared a bed with a monster who got off on pain, who had been a plaything of Professor Singer. Perhaps Julia wanted that lifestyle. Perhaps she and Gabriel invited Ann into their bed, as well. After all, Julia had picked Soraya Harandi to be her attorney. Didn\u2019t that mean she was familiar with Professor Pain?</p><p>Clearly, Julia was not who he thought she was. But his suspicions morphed into something else when, on the Monday after the hearing, he ran into Christa Peterson as she exited Professor Martin\u2019s Office.</p> <p>\u201cPaul.\u201d She nodded at him smugly, adjusting the expensive watch on her wrist.</p><p>He jerked his chin in the direction of Professor Martin\u2019s door. \u201cHaving some trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said quickly, smiling altogether too widely. \u201cIn fact, I think the only person who\u2019s having trouble is Emerson. You\u2019d better start looking for a new dissertation director.\u201d</p><p>Paul narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf Emerson drops me, he\u2019ll drop you too. If he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dropping him.\u201d She tossed her hair behind her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m transferring to Columbia in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that where Martin came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive my best to Julia, would you?\u201d Laughing, Christa brushed past him.</p><p>Paul jogged after her, catching her elbow with his hand. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What did you do to Julia?\u201d</p><p>She wrenched her arm free, her eyes narrowing. \u201cTell her she fucked with the wrong woman.\u201d</p> <p>Christa walked away as a stunned Paul stood, wondering what she had done.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t respond to Paul\u2019s worried messages or emails. So on the Wednesday after the hearing, he stood on the front porch of her building, buzzing her apartment.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Undeterred, Paul waited, and when a neighbor exited the building, he went inside and knocked on her door. He rapped several times until a hesitant voice called to him. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Paul.\u201d</p><p>He heard what sounded like the thud of Julia\u2019s forehead against the door.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to check on you since you aren\u2019t answering your phone.\u201d He paused. \u201cI have your mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul\u2014I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. Let me see that you\u2019re all right and I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>He heard the shuffling of feet. \u201cJulia,\u201d he called to her softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>A scraping sound echoed in the hallway, and the door slowly creaked open.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, looking down into the face of a woman he did not recognize.</p><p>She looked like a girl really, white skin against dark hair that was messily pulled up into a ponytail. Purple circles rimmed her eyes, which were bloodshot and glassy. She looked as if she hadn\u2019t slept since the hearing.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>She opened the door more widely, and Paul walked into her apartment. He\u2019d never seen it so disordered. Dishes were abandoned on every surface, her bed was unmade, and the card table was straining under the weight of papers and books. Her laptop was open as if she\u2019d been interrupted while working on it.</p><p>\u201cIf you came to tell me how stupid I am, I don\u2019t think I can handle that right now.\u201d She tried to sound defiant.</p><p>\u201cI was upset when I found out you\u2019d been lying to me.\u201d Paul shuffled her mail from one arm to the other and scratched at his sideburns. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to make you feel badly.\u201d His expression softened. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see you hurting.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her purple woolly socks and wiggled her toes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for lying.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cUm, I brought your mail. You had some stuff in the mailbox outside, and I also brought your mail from the department.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at him with a worried expression.</p><p>He held up a hand as if to reassure her. \u201cIt\u2019s only a couple of flyers and a textbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone send me a textbook? I\u2019m not teaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe textbook reps put exam copies in the professors\u2019 mailboxes. Sometimes they give books to the grad students too. I got one on Renaissance politics. Where should I put everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the table. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Paul did as he was bidden while Julia busied herself by retrieving the cups and bowls from around the apartment and stacking them neatly on top of the microwave.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of textbook?\u201d she asked, over her shoulder. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about Dante, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Marriage in the Middle Ages: Love, Sex, and the Sacred.\u201d Paul read the title aloud.</p><p>She shrugged, for the title didn\u2019t interest her.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d He gazed at her sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton asked me to make a lot of changes to my thesis. I\u2019ve been working around the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some fresh air. Why don\u2019t you let me take you to lunch? My treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so much work to do.\u201d</p><p>He brushed at his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cYou need to get out of here. This place is depressing. It\u2019s like Miss Havisham\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that make you Pip?\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head. \u201cNo, it makes me a nosy jerk who interferes in someone else\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like Pip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your thesis due tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Professor Picton gave me a week\u2019s extension. She knew I wouldn\u2019t be ready to turn it in April first because of\u2014everything.\u201d She winced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just lunch. We\u2019ll take the subway and head to Queen Street and be back before you know it.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up at Paul, into concerned dark eyes. \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m from Vermont. We\u2019re friendly.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd because you need a friend right now.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled in gratitude.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped caring for you,\u201d he admitted, his eyes unexpectedly gentle.</p><p>She pretended she didn\u2019t hear his declaration.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>They both looked at her flannel pajamas.</p><p>Paul smirked. \u201cNice rubber duckies.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, she disappeared into her closet to find some clean clothes. Not having done laundry in a week, her choices were limited, but at least she had something halfway presentable for a casual meal.</p><p>While she was in the bathroom, Paul took it upon himself to clean up her apartment, or at least, to tidy it. He knew better than to touch her thesis materials, choosing rather to straighten her bed and pick up things from the floor. When he was finished, he shelved the textbook and sat down in a folding chair to look over her mail. He quickly disposed of the flyers and junk and stacked what looked like bills into a neat pile. He noticed there weren\u2019t any letters of a personal nature.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>After she dressed, she covered the circles under her eyes with concealer, and pinked up her pale cheeks with blush. When she was satisfied that she no longer looked like a youngish version of Miss Havisham, Julia joined Paul at the card table.</p><p>He greeted her with a smile. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have things you want to say. You might as well get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned and gestured to the door. \u201cWe can talk over lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me,\u201d she blurted, looking pained.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Julia, the guy seduced you for kicks, then dumped you. How much abuse do you want?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it was!\u201d</p><p>Paul looked at her, at her sudden show of anger, and was impressed. He\u2019d rather have her angry than sad.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably wear a hat. It\u2019s cold out.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later they were outside, walking toward the Spadina subway station.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who. Don\u2019t make me say his name.\u201d</p><p>Paul huffed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather forget about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over to see a pinched look on Julia\u2019s pretty face. He stopped her gently. \u201cI ran into him a few hours after the hearing. He was coming out of Professor Martin\u2019s office. Since then, I\u2019ve been trying to finish my dissertation. If Emerson dumps me, I\u2019m screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Hell, I hope.\u201d Paul\u2019s voice was cheerful. \u201cMartin sent an email to the department saying that Emerson was on a leave of absence for the rest of the semester. You probably saw that email.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head.</p><p>Paul looked at her closely. \u201cI guess he didn\u2019t say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a few messages for him. He finally emailed me yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me to stop contacting him and that it was over. He didn\u2019t even call me by name\u2014just sent me a two line email from his university account, and signed it \u2018Regards, Prof. Gabriel O. Emerson.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Julia winced, but didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cAfter the hearing, he told me I wasn\u2019t sensible of my own distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretentious fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stomps on your heart and then he has the balls to quote Hamlet? Unbelievable. And he misquoted it, the jackass.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the line. I thought it was just\u2014him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare was a pretentious fucker too. That\u2019s probably why you couldn\u2019t tell the difference. The line is from Gertrude\u2019s speech about the death of Ophelia. Listen:</p><p>\u201cWhen down her weedy trophies and herself</p><p>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</p><p>And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</p><p>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</p><p>As one incapable of her own distress,</p><p>Or like a creature native and indued</p><p>Unto that element: but long it could not be</p><p>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</p><p>Pull\u2019d the poor wretch from her melodious lay</p><p>To muddy death.\u201d Julia\u2019s face grew pale. \u201cWhy would he say that to me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are nothing like her.\u201d Paul reiterated his list of favored profane adjectives with respect to the Professor. \u201cWas Emerson worried you\u2019d do something\u2014to hurt yourself?\u201d Paul was growing progressively more agitated as his undergraduate knowledge of Shakespeare came flooding back to him.</p><p>(The benefit of a liberal arts education.)</p><p>Julia feigned surprise at his question. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he thought. He just mumbled something about me trying to commit academic suicide.\u201d</p><p>Paul seemed relieved. Marginally.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else I need to mention. I talked to Christa.\u201d</p><p>Julia chewed at the inside of her mouth before indicating that he should continue.</p><p>\u201cChrista was happy that Emerson was leaving. And she referred to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always hated me,\u201d said Julia.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s up to, but I\u2019d watch your back.\u201d</p> <p>Julia looked off into the distance. \u201cShe can\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019ve already lost what mattered most.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Paul and Julia sat across from one another at a hip but retro caf\u00e9 on Queen Street. They engaged in small talk before they ordered their meals, falling into an uneasy silence as Julia pondered her situation.</p><p>\u201cSo how have you been?\u201d Paul\u2019s voice broke into her internal musings.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t say it aloud, because she wouldn\u2019t mention such a thing to Paul. But one of the reasons she had been so upset, apart from the loss of Gabriel, was the loss of what he represented\u2014the attainment of her high school crush, the loss of her virginity, the discovery of what she thought had been a deep and reciprocated love...</p><p>When she thought of the first time he made love to her, she wanted to cry. No one had ever treated her with such rapt attention and gentleness. He was so worried about hurting her and making sure that she was relaxed. He was insistent on telling her that he loved her, over and over again as he moved toward his orgasm. The first one that he would have with her, because of her...</p> <p>Gabriel staring into my very soul, moving inside me, telling me that he loved me while showing me with his body exactly that. He must have loved me. I\u2019m just not sure when he stopped. Or rather, when he chose to love his job more than me.</p><p>Paul cleared his throat good-naturedly, and Julia smiled her apology.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m upset and angry, but I try not to think about what happened. I\u2019ve been working on my thesis, but it\u2019s difficult to write about love and friendship when you\u2019ve just lost both.\u201d She blew a breath of air out. \u201cEveryone at the university must think I\u2019m a whore.\u201d</p><p>Paul leaned over the table. \u201cHey, you are not a whore. I\u2019d punch someone\u2019s lights out if they ever said anything like that about you.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, fidgeting in her lap with an embroidered handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cYou fell in love with the wrong person, that\u2019s all. He took advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>Julie protested, but he continued.</p><p>\u201cThe Dean\u2019s office asked me to sign a confidentiality agreement. They\u2019re keeping everything having to do with you and Emerson quiet. So don\u2019t worry about what people think. No one knows anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrista knows,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she had to sign the same confidentiality agreement. If she starts spreading rumors about you, you should go to the Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good would that do? The gossip would follow me to Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessors aren\u2019t supposed to take advantage of students. If you\u2019d said no to him, he would have fucked with your career. He\u2019s the villain.\u201d Paul fumed. \u201cYou have a lot of good things to look forward to, like graduation and going to Harvard. And someday, when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll find someone who will treat you properly. Someone worthy of you.\u201d He squeezed her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re kind and gentle. You\u2019re funny and bright. And when you\u2019re pissed off, you\u2019re sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cThat day you took Emerson on in the seminar room\u2014it was a total train wreck, but I would pay money to see it again. You are the only person I\u2019ve ever seen stand up to him, other than Christa, who is crazy, and Professor Pain, who is twisted. As much as I was afraid of what he\u2019d do in retaliation, your spunkiness was impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my temper. It wasn\u2019t my finest moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not. But it showed me something. It showed Emerson something. You\u2019re a bad ass. You need to let the bad ass come out every once in a while. Within reason, of course.\u201d</p><p>He was grinning now and slightly teasing.</p><p>\u201cI try not to give in to the anger, but trust me, it\u2019s there.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was quiet but steely.</p><p>As they finished their meals and savored their coffee, Julia told Paul an extremely edited account of her affair with Gabriel, beginning with his invitation to accompany him to Italy. She described how Gabriel saved her from Simon when she was home for Thanksgiving and that he paid to have the bite mark removed from her neck. Paul was surprised.</p><p>Julia had always felt comfortable talking to Paul. He wasn\u2019t as intense as Gabriel, of course, and far less mercurial. He was a good listener and a good friend. Even when he was scolding her for choosing Soraya Harandi as her attorney.</p><p>Of course, when she revealed that Soraya had been chosen by Gabriel, his ire shifted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you something personal. If you don\u2019t want to answer, just say so.\u201d Paul looked around to ensure that no one was eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Gabriel still involved with Professor Singer? Did you see her\u2014socially while you were with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! He tried to keep me away from her, even when we went to dinner at Segovia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I never realized you two were together.\u201d Paul shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t think very highly of him. But that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know him. He told me his involvement with Singer was temporary and that it ended a long time ago. And so we\u2019re clear, Paul, I believed him.\u201d Julia said those last few words with no little intensity.</p><p>Paul rubbed at his chin. \u201cI told you that I filed a complaint against Professor Pain last year. Soraya Harandi was her attorney. I sat in on Singer\u2019s Medieval Torture seminar because I hoped she would cover material relating to my dissertation. Then she hit on me. At first, I brushed it off. Then I received a strange email from her. She was careful to make her language ambiguous, but anyone from her seminar would have understood that she was propositioning me. So I filed a complaint.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Soraya Harandi did a hell of a job convincing the university that I\u2019d misunderstood the email and that I was embellishing my reports of what she said to me in person. It was my word against Singer\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThe only person on my side at the hearing was Dr. Chakravartty. She brought up emails that Singer had sent to other people and argued that there was a pattern. But Dr. Aras excused me as soon as she mentioned them. So I have no idea who they were to or what was in them. Professor Pain was given a warning and told to stay away from me. I never heard from her again. But I always wondered who else she went after. I was hoping that Emerson protected you from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. I haven\u2019t had any contact with her, and he hasn\u2019t either. I\u2019m really sorry that happened to you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt still pisses me off that she got away with it. That she\u2019s still getting away with it. That\u2019s why non-fraternization policies are in place\u2014to protect students and their academic careers.\u201d</p><p>They were both quiet for a moment, sipping their coffees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied to you.\u201d She gazed at him with watery eyes.</p><p>He held her gaze, then looked down and sighed. \u201cI\u2019d probably have done the same.\u201d</p><p>Then he moved to hold her hand again.</p><p>By the time Julia returned home, her mood had improved considerably. She didn\u2019t feel well, mind you, or whole. For how could she be whole when her other half had rejected her?</p><p>After a productive weekend, Julia was heartened enough by the progress she made on her schoolwork to return one of Nicole\u2019s telephone calls. Nicole wondered why Julia stopped coming to her weekly therapy sessions. Julia shyly explained that she and Gabriel were no longer together and that he\u2019d been paying for her therapy, to which her therapist responded that Gabriel was continuing to pay for her therapy\u2014indefinitely.</p><p>Luckily, both women agreed that it would be inappropriate to allow him to continue footing the bill, especially since he had effectively created the new, pressing reason for Julia to continue with therapy. So Gabriel\u2019s money was unceremoniously returned to him and new fees were assessed on a sliding scale, geared to Julia\u2019s income.</p><p>In other words, Nicole would charge Julia a ridiculously low fee in keeping with her fixed income as a student and be perfectly happy to do so. In their appointment on Wednesday, roughly two weeks after Gabriel\u2019s departure, they discussed Julia\u2019s heartbreak and the way in which she\u2019d chosen to deal with it. Nicole challenged her to focus on the positive aspects of her life and also, to finish her thesis. Both aspects of her advice resonated with Julia.</p><p>That evening, after having made progress on her writing, Julia fell asleep. She felt the bed shift and a warm body curled around her like a cocoon, drawing her close. An all too familiar nose nuzzled her neck, and the softest whisper of breath blew across her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He hummed into her skin but didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d she whispered, tears suddenly streaming down her face.</p><p>Gabriel was silent as he reached up to wipe away her tears, then he pressed his lips to her cheeks over and over again.</p><p>\u201cI know you loved me.\u201d Julia relaxed into their spooned position and closed her eyes. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t love me enough to stay.\u201d</p><p>The hands that held her tightly relaxed minutely until they finally disappeared altogether, leaving Julia alone and cold in her single bed.</p><p>Julia spent part of the next morning staring out the window, contemplating the very strange dream she\u2019d had the night before. Gabriel had returned to her, but he was still silent. He hadn\u2019t offered an explanation or begged for forgiveness. He\u2019d simply rejoined her in bed.</p><p>She\u2019d nestled into him, his body familiar and comforting. She\u2019d sighed in relief at his return, her subconscious unwilling or unable to reject him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really a dream\u2014just a different kind of nightmare.</p><p>After a modest breakfast, she checked her emails and text messages. As she scrolled through the incoming texts on her iPhone, she received the following from Rachel:</p><p>Hey Julia! What\u2019s up with Gabriel not answering his phone? I tried the landline too, but he wouldn\u2019t pick up. I guess things must still be hot and heavy, otherwise he\u2019d answer his phone once in a while.</p><p>I\u2019ve picked out the bridesmaid\u2019s dresses\u2014a dark red that will look great on you. I\u2019ll send the link thru email and you can tell me what you think. You\u2019ll have to email me your measurements so I can order the dress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the way, I finally met Scott\u2019s girlfriend! Her son, Quinn, is adorable.</p><p>Love you, Rachel.</p><p>Julia\u2019s first instinct was to close the text and ignore it. That\u2019s what she did to Rachel after Simon and Natalie humiliated her. But as her therapist had impressed upon her, this time she needed to do something different. Something braver.</p><p>She took a deep breath and typed out a response:</p> <p>Rachel, The bridesmaid dresses sound beautiful. I\u2019ll make sure to send you my measurements. I\u2019m glad you met Scott\u2019s girlfriend. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting her and her little boy.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to Gabriel in days. I don\u2019t know where he is. He left. It\u2019s over. J.</p><p>It took exactly one minute and forty-five seconds for Julia\u2019s iPhone to ring, indicating a call from Rachel. Unfortunately, Julia\u2019s courage gave out at that moment, and she didn\u2019t answer. The following text arrived shortly thereafter:</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill him. -R</p><p>Chapter 30</p> <p>Gabriel strode through the misty blackness into the woods behind what had been the Clarks\u2019 house. He brought a flashlight, but he almost didn\u2019t need it. He knew the woods so well that even if he\u2019d been drunk or coked out of his mind he could find his way to the orchard and back again. He was good at navigating the dark.</p><p>He stood at the orchard\u2019s periphery, eyes closed, as the chilled rain washed down. If he opened his eyes and squinted, he could almost see her\u2014the outline of a teenage girl resting on a man\u2019s chest, the couple nestled on an old, wool blanket. Her hair floated across her shoulders, her arm rested on his waist. He could barely see the man\u2019s face, but he could tell that the man was besotted with the brown-eyed angel in his arms.</p><p>Gabriel stood very still, listening to the echoes of memories that were half-dreams...</p><p>\u201cDo you have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be thrown out of Paradise tomorrow, Beatrice. Our only hope is that you find me afterward. Look for me in Hell.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t planned to return to the orchard without her. He hadn\u2019t planned to leave her. He\u2019d broken her heart. Although he was oppressed by guilt and regret, he knew he\u2019d make the same decision again.</p><p>Julianne had already given up so much to be with him. He\u2019d be damned if she gave up her future too.</p><p>Gabriel stood shirtless in his old bedroom, drying his hair with a towel and fumbling with the stereo. He was in the mood for painful music. Which meant, at that moment, that he was listening to \u201cBlood of Eden\u201d by Peter Gabriel. Midway through the chorus, the telephone began to ring. He\u2019d forgotten to ask Richard to cancel the telephone service when he moved to Philadelphia, after Gabriel bought the house.</p><p>Leaving the call unanswered, Gabriel paced like a restless ghost. He reclined on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. It was a passing fancy, he knew, but he swore he could smell Julia\u2019s scent on his pillow and that he could hear the gentle tide of her breathing. He toyed with the platinum band on his finger, twisting it over and over again. Lines from Dante\u2019s La Vita Nuova crowded his mind, describing Beatrice\u2019s rejection:</p><p>\u201cBy this false and evil rumour</p><p>which seemed to misfame me of vice...</p><p>she who was the destroyer of all evil</p> <p>and the queen of all good, coming where I was,</p><p>denied me her most sweet salutation,</p><p>in the which alone was my blessedness.\u201d Gabriel had no right to compare his situation to Dante\u2019s, since his misfortune was the result of his own choice. Nevertheless, as the darkness closed in around him, he was stricken by the possibility that he\u2019d lost his blessedness. Forever.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch!\u201d Tom Mitchell swore loudly into his daughter\u2019s ear. She had to hold her iPhone at arm\u2019s length in order to protect her eardrums. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, in March.\u201d Julia sniffled. \u201cHe confirmed it via email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. What was his reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me one.\u201d She didn\u2019t have the energy to describe the events leading up to her separation from Gabriel, and anything having to do with the academic fraud allegations would just make Tom angrier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please.\u201d The conversation was difficult enough without having to worry about shotguns being loaded and Gabriel\u2019s lily-white tail being hunted through the woods of Selinsgrove.</p><p>Tom breathed heavily into the phone. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say this, Jules, because I know you\u2014cared for him, but Gabriel is a cokehead. Once an addict, always an addict. Maybe he\u2019s using again. Maybe he ran into trouble with his dealer. Drugs are a messy business, and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gone. The farther away from you he is the better.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t cry at her father\u2019s words, but her heart clenched. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say things like that, Dad. For all we know, he\u2019s in Italy working on his book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a crack house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really am. I want my little girl to find someone good and be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that for you too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re quite a pair.\u201d He cleared his throat and decided to change the subject. \u201cTell me about graduation. I made some money from the sale of the house, and I\u2019d like to come to graduation. We should also talk about what you want to do this summer. Your room in the new house is waiting for you. You can paint it any color you want. Hell, paint it pink.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted a pink room in a long time, but thanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Although Selinsgrove was the last place Julia wanted to go at that moment, at least she had a parent and a home, a home that didn\u2019t have bad associations with either Simon or Sharon. Or him.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>On April ninth, Julia walked through the melting snow to Professor Picton\u2019s house, clutching her printed thesis in one hand and a bottle of Chianti in the other.</p><p>She was nervous. Although her relationship with Professor Picton had always been cordial, it was never warm. Katherine wasn\u2019t the kind of person to dote or fawn over her students. She was professional and demanding and decidedly unsentimental. So Julia was quite concerned when Katherine invited her to submit her thesis in person and to stay for dinner. Of course, there was no possibility of a refusal.</p><p>Julia stood on the front porch of Katherine\u2019s three-story brick home and rang the doorbell. She wiped her palms on the front of her pea coat, trying to eliminate the clamminess.</p><p>\u201cJulianne, welcome.\u201d Katherine opened the door and ushered her student inside.</p><p>If Julia\u2019s small studio was a hobbit hole, then Professor Picton\u2019s house was the abode of a wood elf. A wood elf with a taste for fine, old furnishings. Everything was elegant and antique; the walls were paneled in dark wood with expensive carpets blanketing the floors. The decorating was aristocratic but spare, and everything was extremely ordered and tidy.</p><p>After taking Julia\u2019s coat, Katherine graciously accepted the Chianti and the thesis, and directed her to a small parlor off the front hall. Julia promptly sat herself in a leather club chair in front of the hearth and accepted a small glass of sherry.</p><p>\u201cDinner is almost ready,\u201d Katherine said and vanished like a Greek goddess.</p><p>Julia examined the large books about English architecture and gardens gracing the low coffee table. The walls were lined with pastoral scenes interspersed with the occasional severe black and white portrait of the ancestral Pictons. She sipped her sherry slowly, savoring the warmth as it slid down her throat to her stomach. Before she could finish, Katherine was escorting her to the dining room.</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely.\u201d Julia smiled, in an effort to mask her nervousness. She was intimidated by the fine bone china, crystal, and silver candlesticks that Katherine had set atop a white damask tablecloth that looked as if it had been ironed.</p><p>(Not even the linens would dare to wrinkle without Professor Picton\u2019s permission.)</p><p>\u201cI like to entertain,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cBut truthfully, there are few dining companions that I can stand for an entire evening.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt a sinking feeling in her middle. With as little noise as possible, she took her place next to Katherine, who sat at the head of the long, oak table.</p><p>\u201cIt smells delicious,\u201d said Julia, trying not to ravenously inhale the scent of cooked meat and vegetables that wafted from her plate. She hadn\u2019t been eating much in the previous days but Professor Picton\u2019s offerings seemed to have stimulated her appetite.</p><p>\u201cI tend toward vegetarianism, but in my experience graduate students never eat enough meat. So I\u2019ve prepared an old recipe of my mother\u2019s. Normandy hotpot, she used to call it. I hope you don\u2019t mind pork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Julia smiled. But when she saw the lemon zest atop the plate of steamed broccoli, her smile narrowed.</p><p>Gabriel had a thing for garnishes.</p><p>\u201cA toast perhaps?\u201d Katherine poured Julia\u2019s wine gift into their glasses and held hers aloft.</p><p>Julia raised her glass obligingly.</p><p>\u201cTo your success at Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Julia hid her mixed emotions behind the act of drinking.</p><p>Once a polite space of time had elapsed, Katherine spoke. \u201cI brought you here to discuss a number of different things. First, your thesis. Are you satisfied with it?\u201d</p><p>Julia swallowed a piece of parsnip hastily. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Katherine frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, there\u2019s room for improvement. If I had another year, it would be so much better. Um...\u201d Julia wished a hole would open up under the floorboards and swallow her.</p><p>Inexplicably, Katherine smiled and sat back in her chair. \u201cThat\u2019s the correct answer. Good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudents these days think they\u2019re far more talented than they actually are. I\u2019m glad, with all your success, you\u2019ve maintained some academic humility.</p><p>\u201cOf course another year would improve your thesis. You\u2019ll be a better student and a better scholar next year, if you continue to work hard. I\u2019m pleased you realize you have room for improvement. Now, we can move on to something else.\u201d</p><p>Julia tore her eyes from Katherine and focused on her knife and fork. She had no idea what was coming next.</p><p>Katherine tapped an impatient finger on top of the table. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when people pry into my private life, so I leave others\u2019 private lives alone. In your case, I was dragged into something by David Aras.\u201d Katherine grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m not privy to everything that went on at that McCarthyite hearing, and I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d She glanced at Julia meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cGreg Matthews at Harvard is looking to hire an endowed chair in Dante studies. I\u2019d hoped that Gabriel would be offered that job.\u201d Katherine saw Julia move out of the corner of her eye, but quickly continued. \u201cUnfortunately, the chair has been offered to someone else. They foolishly tried to lure me out of retirement, but I declined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow that dreadful Pacciani man ended up on their short list, I\u2019ll never know. At any rate, Cecilia Marinelli will be the new endowed chair. They stole her from Oxford. It would be good if you could work with her. Provided all goes well with your thesis, I\u2019d be happy to telephone Cecilia and let her know of your arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Professor. That\u2019s very kind.\u201d</p><p>Katherine waved a casual hand. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>The two women spent the next few minutes finishing their dinner in relative silence. While Katherine cleared the table, after refusing her student\u2019s repeated offers to help, Julia finished her wine.</p> <p>Although she felt badly that Gabriel did not get his dream job, she was relieved that he would not be following her to Harvard. His presence in the department would have caused all kinds of problems. She could never work with him now. And it would have been extremely painful to have to try to maintain a professional and detached relationship with him. No, it was much better that Gabriel would stay in Toronto, while she moved to Boston. It was a mercy, albeit a severe one, that Harvard had hired Professor Marinelli.</p><p>After dessert and coffee, Katherine suggested they retire to the parlor. Once again, Julia sat in the comfortable club chair next to the fire and gratefully received the small glass of port that Katherine pressed into her hand. Although Katherine\u2019s decorating style was quite different from Gabriel\u2019s, it seemed as if Dante specialists enjoyed drinking by the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cYou will have a fresh start at Harvard, and no one will have an inkling of what transpired here. Until then, it would be wise not to draw any more attention to yourself.\u201d Katherine gave Julia a look that was piercing, if not severe.</p><p>\u201cGraduate students, especially female graduate students, are vulnerable with respect to their reputation. There are still those in the Academy who would choose to mislabel the fruits of talent and hard work as the results of preferment and prostitution. It\u2019s best if you never give anyone the slightest suspicion that you haven\u2019t earned your accomplishments through hard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton, I swear that I worked very hard in the Dante seminar. He didn\u2019t help me with my essay or give me any special treatment. That\u2019s why he asked you to grade it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true. But you deceived me, and quite frankly, I\u2019m a bit put out.\u201d</p><p>Julia gazed at her advisor with undisguised horror.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I understand why I wasn\u2019t taken into your confidence. I\u2019m sure Gabriel forbade it. I\u2019m annoyed with him as well, but for reasons I won\u2019t divulge, I owe him a debt.\u201d</p><p>Professor Picton sipped her port thoughtfully, staring off into space. \u201cWhen I was a student at Oxford, it was shamefully common for dons to develop romantic relationships with their students. Sometimes the relationships were what we would now consider harassment cases. Other times true love was involved. I saw both.\u201d</p><p>Katherine fixed Julia with an unblinking eye. \u201cI know the difference between a Willoughby and a Colonel Brandon. I hope that you do too.\u201d</p><p>The following evening, Julia walked to Paul\u2019s apartment. They\u2019d agreed to meet for coffee so they could debrief after Julia\u2019s dinner with Professor Picton.</p> <p>Paul turned to face Julia on the couch. \u201cNow that the semester is over for you, when are you moving?\u201d</p><p>Julia sipped her coffee. \u201cMy lease is up the end of July, but I was hoping to persuade my landlord to let me leave mid-June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My dad is going to help me move.\u201d</p><p>Paul placed his mug on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading back to Vermont in June. You could drive with me, and I could help you move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad is coming for graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can drive together. You two could stay with me at the farm for a day or so, then we could drive down to Boston to get you settled. Are you going to live in residence?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They sent me something saying I couldn\u2019t get into the residence halls until August. But I\u2019d need somewhere to live before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s younger brother goes to Boston College. Let me talk to him and see if he knows of a place you could sublet. Half the population of Boston is under twenty-five. There are a lot of students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that? Help me move and find an apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d expect to be paid, in beer. I like Krombacher, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled and they clinked their coffee mugs together.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d She pointed to a photograph of four people, two men and two women, that Paul had partially hidden behind a penguin on top of his television.</p><p>\u201cThe girl on the far left is Heather, my little sister, and her husband, Chris. That\u2019s me on the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other girl?\u201d Julia gazed at the face of the pretty young woman who was clutching Paul\u2019s waist and laughing.</p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s Allison.\u201d</p><p>Julia waited politely for Paul to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Julia.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still friends. But she\u2019s working in Vermont and couldn\u2019t handle the long-distance thing. We broke up a while ago,\u201d Paul explained quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good person.\u201d Julia shifted uncomfortably. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>Paul pulled her hand to his lips, kissing her knuckles chastely. \u201cI think you should say whatever is on your mind. For the record, I\u2019ve always thought you were a good person too.\u201d</p><p>She smiled but withdrew her hand delicately, so as not to give offense.</p><p>Shortly before midnight, she was asleep on his shoulder, their bodies close together on the futon. Paul\u2019s mind was drifting, imagining the feel of her lips against his, her skin beneath his hands. He turned his face into her hair, tightening his arms around her. She stirred, mumbling Emerson\u2019s name before burrowing her head in his chest.</p><p>He realized that he had a decision to make. If he was going to be Julia\u2019s friend, then he would have to suppress his romantic feelings for her. He couldn\u2019t kiss her or try to move things forward. It was far too soon. And it was quite possible she\u2019d never want him, even when her broken heart was mended. But Julia needed a friend; she needed him. He wasn\u2019t going to abandon her in her time of need, even if it was going to be painful to set aside his true feelings.</p><p>So instead of falling asleep with her in his arms, he carried her to his room and placed her on the bed. He covered her with the sheet and blankets, making sure that she was comfortable, then he picked up an extra pillow and a quilt and retreated to the living room.</p><p>He spent much of the evening frustrated and staring at the ceiling, while Julia slept soundly in his bed.</p><p>While Julia was spending the night at Paul\u2019s apartment, Gabriel sat in his hotel room, glaring at his laptop. He\u2019d received another terse email from his Chair, Jeremy Martin, reminding him of how much personal and political capital Jeremy had expended to \u201csave his ass.\u201d As if Gabriel needed a reminder.</p><p>His gaze drifted to the ring on his finger, resisting the urge to reexamine the words he\u2019d had engraved on the inside. He spun the platinum band around and around as he cursed his most recent failure.</p><p>Harvard had kindly informed him that his candidacy was unsuccessful and that they\u2019d hired Professor Marinelli, instead. Gabriel\u2019s lack of success was one more way in which he\u2019d failed Julianne. But it mattered little, now. What use would it be to be at Harvard, if she wouldn\u2019t forgive him?</p><p>He cursed bitterly. What use was it to be anywhere, if she wouldn\u2019t forgive him? Even in the hotel, she was with him. On his computer, on his cell phone, in his iPod, in his head.</p><p>Oh, yes, in his head. He was correct when he said that he would never forget what it felt like to gaze upon her naked body for the first time, the way her eyes were fixed on the floor shyly, the way her face flushed under his heated touch.</p><p>He remembered looking down into her deep, dark eyes as she trembled beneath him, ruby lips parted, breathing heavily, and the way her eyes widened as he entered her.</p><p>She\u2019d flinched. Somehow he could remember every time he\u2019d made her flinch. And there had been many\u2014when he shamed her for being poor, when he first carried her to bed, when he wove his fingers through her hair and she begged him not to hold her head down, when he admitted that he\u2019d agreed to separate himself from her...</p><p>How many times could he hurt her in one short life?</p><p>He\u2019d tortured himself by listening to the voicemail messages she\u2019d left for him\u2014messages he hadn\u2019t returned. They\u2019d grown progressively more despondent until they\u2019d ceased altogether. He couldn\u2019t blame her. It was clear that his messages had not gotten through, with the exception of a single email. He opened it again, imagining her reaction.</p><p>Stop contacting me.</p><p>It\u2019s over.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Prof. Gabriel O. Emerson,</p><p>Associate Professor</p><p>Department of Italian Studies/</p><p>Centre for Medieval Studies</p><p>University of Toronto</p><p>A bitter laugh that he recognized as coming from his own throat echoed in the room. Of course, that would be the message she believed\u2014not the others. He\u2019d lost her now. What hope was there without her?</p><p>Gabriel thought back to a conversation he\u2019d had with her about Grace\u2019s favorite book, A Severe Mercy. It was clear in the story that the main characters thought that they\u2019d made an idol of their love\u2014worshipping it and each other to their own detriment. He\u2019d done the same with Julianne, he knew. He\u2019d worshipped her very being, convinced that she was the light that would shine in his darkness.</p><p>He\u2019d loved her enough to leave her in order to protect her future. And having left her, he was in peril of never possessing her love again. It was the bitterest twist of fate, that his love for his Beatrice would be precisely what separated him from her.</p><p>And what of Paul? Surely he\u2019d use this as an opportunity to comfort Julia. And where would that comfort lead...Gabriel couldn\u2019t entertain the idea that she would be unfaithful. But he knew through her messages that she thought it was over. Paul would simply have to provide a shoulder for her to lean on and he\u2019d be back in her life, in her apartment, in her thoughts.</p><p>Angelfucker.</p><p>The only relief he could find, if relief it was, would be to torture himself with music and poetry. He clicked a button, and Sting\u2019s retelling of the story of David and Bathsheba filled the room. As the song swirled in the air, he gazed at Dante\u2019s poetic reflection on the death of Beatrice and found his heart echoing the words from La Vita Nuova.</p><p>\u201cAn abject wretch like this</p><p>May not imagine anything of her,\u2014</p><p>He needs no bitter tears for his relief.</p><p>But sighing comes, and grief,</p><p>And the desire to find no comforter,</p><p>(Save only Death, who makes all sorrow brief,)</p><p>To him who for a while turns in his thought</p><p>How she hath been among us, and is not.</p><p>With sighs my bosom always laboureth</p><p>On thinking, as I do continually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of her for whom my heart now breaks apace;</p><p>And very often when I think of death,</p><p>Such a great inward longing comes to me</p><p>That it will change the colour of my face;</p> <p>And, if the idea settles in its place.</p><p>All my limbs shake as with an ague-fit;</p><p>Till, starting up in wild bewilderment,</p><p>I do become so shent</p><p>That I go forth, lest folk misdoubt of it.</p> <p>Afterward, calling with a sore lament</p><p>On Beatrice, I ask, \u2018Canst thou be dead?\u2019</p><p>And calling on her, I am comforted.\u201d Gabriel closed the document on his computer and traced a light finger over the photograph of the lovely woman who graced his computer screen. He would discharge his duty over the next few days, but he would do so without his Beatrice to comfort him. In her absence, perhaps he would succumb to his old temptations to deaden the pain.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>On a Friday afternoon in mid-April, Julia arrived at Rachel and Aaron\u2019s apartment in Philadelphia. Rachel had planned on visiting her in Toronto and bringing the bridesmaid dress with her, but she had trouble getting the time off work. Since she was trying to save her vacation days for the honeymoon, Julia agreed to leave the comfortable confines of her hobbit hole, instead.</p><p>Rachel welcomed her friend with a hug, escorting her to the living room. Julia eyed the binders of samples and swatches that covered the coffee table.</p> <p>\u201cSo the wedding planning is finished?\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head. \u201cNot quite. But I don\u2019t want to talk about the wedding; I want to talk about you.\u201d She eyed her friend with a concerned look. \u201cThis thing with you and Gabriel was a complete shock.\u201d</p><p>Julia winced. \u201cTo me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t return our calls or answer our emails, and believe me, we\u2019ve tried. Scott copied me on the email he sent, and it was scathing.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Gabriel was in Selinsgrove a couple of weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelinsgrove?\u201d Julia was dumbfounded. \u201cI thought he was in Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo finish his book. To get away from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe jackass,\u201d Rachel cursed. \u201cHave you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He emailed to notify me that it was over.\u201d Julia retrieved her purse. She pulled out two keys and a security pass and handed them to her friend. \u201cThese are his.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gazed at the objects with confusion. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep them. Or give them to your father. I would have mailed them to Gabriel, but since he doesn\u2019t want contact...\u201d</p><p>Rachel placed the offending items on one of her wedding binders. Then, thinking better of it, she dumped his things into a drawer in one of the end tables, closing it with an oath.</p><p>\u201cI know he went to my parents\u2019 old house because one of the neighbors called my dad. Apparently, Gabriel was up at all hours playing loud music and prowling around outside.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s mind instantly went to the orchard. It seemed reasonable, she thought, for him to take solace in the one place he\u2019d always been at peace\u2014his Paradise. But since she was tangled up in his memories of that space, she wondered at him going there. Shaking her head, she put the thought from her mind.</p><p>Rachel faced her friend. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he would do this. Gabriel loves you. He isn\u2019t the kind of person to love easily, or to say those words without meaning them. That kind of love doesn\u2019t disappear overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he loved his job more. Or maybe he decided to go back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina? Is that what this is about? You didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d Rachel\u2019s eyes flashed.</p><p>\u201cUp until a year and a half ago, they were still\u2014involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Christmas, we were fighting about her and, uh, other things. He told me their history was more recent than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never so much as heard her name until the day she showed up at my parents\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew about her. But when he and I first started dating, he made it sound as if he ended things with her back at Harvard. In reality, he\u2019d been carrying on with her for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe that he\u2019d leave you for her, after Florence, after everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can believe anything now,\u201d Julia said coolly.</p><p>Rachel groaned, placing her hands over her eyes. \u201cWhat a mess. My dad is really upset and so is Scott. When he found out that Gabriel was in Selinsgrove, he decided to drive out there so he could knock some sense into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTammy needed him to babysit her little boy. So Scott decided that he could kick Gabriel\u2019s ass another time.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled wryly. \u201cI can imagine that conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott is head over heels for Tammy. It\u2019s pretty sickening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re coming for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked at her watch. \u201cI should probably start cooking. They\u2019ll arrive early so they can feed Quinn first. Scott\u2019s life has completely changed. Everything revolves around the baby\u2019s schedule.\u201d</p><p>Julia followed her host into the kitchen. \u201cWhat does your dad think of her?\u201d</p><p>Rachel began rummaging in the fridge. \u201cHe likes her. He adores the baby. You\u2019d think Quinn was his grandson.\u201d</p><p>She placed the ingredients for a salad on the counter. \u201cDo you really think Gabriel would go back to Paulina?\u201d</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the word aloud, but yes, she thought it was possible. He\u2019d changed a great deal of his life and his coping mechanisms for her. Now that their relationship was over, it was possible he\u2019d return to his old life.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s familiar territory,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound as if she\u2019s western Europe.\u201d Rachel leaned against the counter. \u201cDo you think the university demanded that he break things off with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but how is something like that enforceable? Can they make him leave the city? Can they tell him what to do in his personal life, when he\u2019s on a leave of absence? If Gabriel wanted to talk to me, he could have called. He didn\u2019t. The university handed him a convenient way to break up with me. He was probably planning it for a while.\u201d Julia crossed her arms around her chest. It was easier to give voice to her deepest fears with Rachel than to dwell on them when she was alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat a mess,\u201d Rachel repeated, turning to wash her hands.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>In the wee hours of the morning, Rachel and Julia were sprawled across the sofa in their bathrobes, drinking wine and giggling. Scott, Tammy, and Quinn had long since left, and Aaron had been asleep for hours. They could hear reverberations of his snoring echo down the hall.</p><p>Bolstered by a very good Pinot noir, Julia described what had happened at the hearing, and Rachel, to her credit, resisted interrupting her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Gabriel would give you up just to keep his job. He doesn\u2019t need the money, and he can always work somewhere else. What I don\u2019t understand is why he wasn\u2019t more explicit about what he was doing. Why didn\u2019t he grab you afterward and say I love you but we need to wait.\u201d Rachel giggled drunkenly. \u201cKnowing Gabriel, he would have recited something in iambic pentameter just because he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned something about Peter Abelard, but it wasn\u2019t comforting. Abelard kept his relationship with H\u00e9loise secret so he wouldn\u2019t lose his teaching position. Then he sent her to a convent.\u201d</p><p>Rachel reached over to pick up a pillow and threw it at her friend\u2019s head. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to send you to a convent. He loves you. And I refuse to believe otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Julia clutched the pillow to her chest as she reclined on her side. \u201cIf he loved me, he wouldn\u2019t leave me. He wouldn\u2019t have broken up with me via email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that Gabriel was stringing you along for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But that doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p><p>Rachel yawned loudly. \u201cWhatever he did, he screwed up. I\u2019m wondering if he isn\u2019t trying to protect you in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have texted me and said just that.\u201d</p><p>Rachel threw an arm over her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the part I don\u2019t understand. He could have asked us to give you a message. He could have written you a letter. Why didn\u2019t Gabriel tell the university to shove it?\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled onto her back, asking herself a similar question.</p><p>Rachel retrieved her cell phone from the coffee table. \u201cDo you want to call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Maybe he\u2019ll answer, thinking it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night and I\u2019m drunk. It\u2019s not exactly the best time to have a conversation. Plus, he told me not to contact him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook the phone in front of her. \u201cIf you\u2019re hurting, so is he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him a message saying that if he ever wants to talk to me, he needs to do it face to face. I\u2019m not calling him again.\u201d Julia downed the last of her wine in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll be at graduation.\u201d Julia sighed, a wistful look on her face. All her anger and frustration hadn\u2019t eliminated her longing for him. At least, not all of it.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune eleventh.\u201d</p><p>Rachel swore obliquely at the lateness of the date.</p><p>After a few minutes of shared silence, Julia decided to voice one of her other, greater fears.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he sleeps with her?\u201d</p><p>Rachel was quiet for a moment. So quiet, Julia began to repeat the question, but her friend interrupted. \u201cIf Gabriel were cruel, then maybe he\u2019d screw someone else. But I can\u2019t imagine him doing that and thinking that you\u2019d forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s with someone else and you find out about it, tell me.\u201d Julia gave her friend a pleading look. \u201cIt would be better to hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>His voice was warm and thick as he moved inside her, distributing his weight to his forearms. He leaned down to draw the delicate skin from the inside of her bicep into his mouth, kissing and sucking on it. It was just enough to tease her and perhaps to leave a gentle mark. He knew this drove her mad.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she gasped, in between moans. Every time he moved it sent the most wonderful sensations coursing through her body.</p><p>Until he stopped.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyelids fluttered open.</p><p>He rubbed his nose against hers and smiled. \u201cI need to see you.\u201d His gaze was gentle but intense, as if he were holding back the flame of desire momentarily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to keep my eyes open.\u201d She groaned a little as he moved inside her once again.</p><p>\u201cTry for me.\u201d He kissed her softly. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you leave me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked down on her with dismay, his blue eyes narrowing. \u201cI didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>That same evening Gabriel was lying in the center of the bed, eyes closed, while she trailed leisurely open-mouthed kisses across his pectorals, pausing reverently to kiss his tattoo, before extending her attentions to his abdominals. An oath left his mouth as she ran her fingers lightly up and down the well-defined muscles before swirling a tongue around his navel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It has been so long...</p><p>That was the thought that came to mind as she gently traced the skin and strands of hair before reaching a hand down to grasp him firmly. He shifted his hips. She was stroking him now, and he was panting, begging. She teased him unhurriedly as her long, silky hair caressed the tops of his thighs, before taking him into the warm wetness of her mouth.</p><p>Gabriel muttered a surprised expletive as he gave himself over to the sensations, before weaving his fingers into her hair.</p><p>He froze.</p> <p>A sick feeling bubbled up in his stomach as he remembered what happened the last time he\u2019d done this. He withdrew his hand immediately, worried that he\u2019d frightened her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He extended a single finger to trace her cheek. \u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>A cold hand caught him by the wrist before forcing him to grasp her head roughly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you forget?\u201d she taunted. \u201cHow to enjoy a blow job?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes flew open. In absolute horror he looked down into a pair of laughing blue eyes.</p> <p>Paulina was naked and crouched over him, smiling triumphantly as she held him close to her mouth. Gabriel recoiled, cursing and crowding backward against the headboard while she sat on her heels, watching him.</p><p>She laughed and pointed to his nose, indicating that he should wipe the traces of cocaine from his nostrils.</p><p>What have I done?</p><p>He scrubbed his face roughly with both hands. As the enormity of his depravity sunk in, he retched, dry heaving over the side of the bed. When he came to himself, he held out his left hand to show her his ring\u2014but there was none.</p><p>The wedding ring was gone.</p><p>Paulina laughed again and began crawling toward him, eyes feral, her naked body brushing against his own.</p> <p>Chapter 35</p><p>Gabriel struggled and flailed before jolting awake. He tore at the bedclothes, earnestly looking for any sign of her. But there was none.</p><p>He was alone in a dark hotel room. He\u2019d extinguished the lights before retiring, which was his first mistake. Neglecting to place the framed photograph on his nightstand was his second, for it served as a talisman against the darkness.</p><p>He swung his legs over the side of the bed and placed his face in his hands. Enduring rehab all those years ago had been excruciating but nothing compared with losing Julianne. He would have suffered the nightmares and haunting memories of old sins gladly if he could hold her in his arms every night.</p><p>As he gazed with contempt at the half-empty bottle of Scotch, he felt the darkness closing in. His desperate pursuit had placed a great deal of pressure on him. When that pressure was coupled with a striking sense of loss, it made it almost impossible for him to function at a high level without some kind of crutch.</p><p>Every day the drinks grew larger. Every day he realized that he needed to do something before he became trapped by his old coping mechanisms and ruined his future. He knew that if he didn\u2019t do something, quickly, he\u2019d relapse.</p><p>Impulsively, he made two telephone calls before gathering his belongings and shoving them into his suitcase. Then he directed the concierge to secure him a cab that would take him to the airport. He didn\u2019t bother to ensure that his appearance was neat and professional. In fact, he didn\u2019t bother looking into the mirror at all, for he knew that what he saw would disgust him.</p><p>Many hours later, he arrived in Florence and checked into the Gallery Hotel Art. It had been short notice, but he\u2019d persuaded the manager to give him the same suite in which he and Julia had consummated their relationship. It was either that or a rehabilitation program, and he was convinced his connection to her would prove far more redemptive.</p> <p>As he walked into the room, he half-expected to see her, or at least, signs of her. A pair of tangerine stilettos carelessly kicked off under a coffee table. A taffeta dress pooled on the floor next to a blank wall. A pair of seamed black stockings strewn across an unmade bed.</p><p>But of course, he saw none of those things.</p><p>After a relatively restful sleep and a shower, Gabriel contacted his old friend Dottore Vitali at the Uffizi Gallery and met him for dinner. They spoke of Harvard\u2019s new chair of Dante Studies. They spoke of Giuseppe Pacciani and Gabriel was marginally gratified to learn that although Giuseppe had been offered a campus interview while Gabriel had not, Giuseppe\u2019s lecture had been regarded as poor by the Harvard faculty. It was cold comfort, but a comfort nonetheless.</p><p>The next day Gabriel sought to distract himself from his troubles by engaging in pleasurable activities\u2014breakfast on a piazza, a walk along the Arno, a lengthy afternoon at his tailor\u2019s in which he ordered a hand-made black wool suit, and an hour or so spent looking for the perfect pair of shoes to match his finery. His tailor joked that the suit was so fine Gabriel could be married in it. The tailor had laughed, until Gabriel held up his left hand and showed him his ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m newly married,\u201d he explained, much to the tailor\u2019s surprise.</p><p>No matter where Gabriel walked in the city of Florence, he was assaulted with memories of her. He would stand on the Ponte Santa Trinita, hugging the sweet and sour feelings tightly to his chest, knowing that they were preferable to chemical alternatives.</p><p>Late one evening, slightly drunk, he wandered by the Duomo, retracing the path he\u2019d taken with Julianne months earlier. Tortured by his memory of her face when she accused him of fucking her, he stumbled across a familiar looking beggar, who sat in the shade of Brunelleschi\u2019s dome.</p><p>Gabriel approached him.</p><p>\u201cJust a few coins for an old man,\u201d the beggar cried in Italian.</p><p>Gabriel grew closer, eying the man suspiciously. The scent of unwashed flesh and alcohol assailed him, but he grew closer still. Recognizing the beggar as the same man who\u2019d inspired Julia\u2019s charity back in December, Gabriel stopped, swaying on his feet.</p><p>He felt for his wallet. Without bothering to look at the denominations, he withdrew several bills and held them in front of the man.</p><p>\u201cI saw you last December. Yet, you\u2019re still here.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s Italian was only slightly accusatory.</p><p>The man eyed the money hungrily. \u201cI\u2019m here every day. Even Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dangled the Euros closer to the man. \u201cMy fidanzata gave you money. You called her an angel. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>The man smiled toothlessly and shook his head, never allowing his eyes to leave the cash.</p><p>\u201cThere are many angels in Firenze, but more in Assisi. I think God favors the beggars there. But this is my home.\u201d The man hesitantly held out his hand, uncertain that Gabriel would actually give him the money.</p><p>In his imagination, Gabriel could see Julia\u2019s face as she compassionately argued the beggar\u2019s case. She wanted to give him money even if there was a strong possibility that he\u2019d waste the money on drink.</p><p>As Gabriel regarded the beggar, no better off than he\u2019d been before Julia\u2019s generosity, he was struck by the fact that she wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to donate again and again. She would have given the man coins every day, because she thought the act of charity was never wasted. She would have lived in hope that one day the man would realize that someone cares for him and try to get help. Julia knew her kindness made her vulnerable, but she was kind anyway.</p><p>Gabriel placed the bills in the man\u2019s hand and turned sharply on his heel, the echoes of the beggar\u2019s joy and blessings ringing in his ears.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t deserving of a blessing. He hadn\u2019t committed an act of charity the way Julianne would have done it, out of compassion and kindness. He was simply doing justice to her memory, or purchasing an indulgence.</p><p>As tripped over a cobblestone, he realized what he had to do.</p><p>The next day he tried to secure the house in Umbria that he\u2019d shared with her, but it was already occupied. So he traveled to Assisi where he checked into a small, private hotel that was simple in its furnishings and populated with pilgrims.</p><p>Gabriel had never styled himself as a pilgrim. He was far too proud for that. Nevertheless, there was something in the air in Assisi that allowed him to sleep peacefully. In fact, it had been the best sleep he\u2019d had since leaving Julia\u2019s arms.</p><p>He rose early the next morning and made his way to the Basilica of St. Francis. It was a place of pilgrimage for persons of all faiths, if only for its medieval frescoes and the peaceful atmosphere that pervaded it. It was no little coincidence that he found himself retracing the steps he\u2019d taken with Julianne prior to Christmas. He\u2019d taken her to Mass in the Basilica superiore or upper part of the church, and had even waited patiently while she went to confession before the Mass began.</p><p>As he wandered through the upper Basilica, admiring the images and drinking in the comforting quiet of the sanctuary, he caught a glimpse of a woman with long, brown hair disappear through a doorway. Intrigued, he decided to follow her. Despite the crowd of tourists and pilgrims, it was easy to pick her out, and so he found himself descending to the Basilica inferiore.</p><p>Then she vanished.</p><p>Distressed, he searched the lower church. Only when his search proved fruitless did it occur to him to descend deeper into the bowels of the Basilica toward the tomb of St. Francis. There she was, kneeling in front of the crypt. He slipped into the last row of pews and out of respect, knelt. But he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Julianne. The young woman in front of him was a little fuller in the hips and wider in the shoulders and her hair was darker. But she was beautiful, and her beauty reminded him of how much he\u2019d lost.</p><p>The room was small and primitive, a studied contrast to the wide-open and elaborately frescoed upper Basilica. Gabriel was not alone in finding that the simplicity that was St. Francis\u2019s life and mission was more accurately reflected in the unassuming tomb. It was with such thoughts in mind that Gabriel found himself leaning against the pew in front of him and bowing his head. Before he could form the intention to do so, he began praying.</p><p>At first they were just words\u2014desperate utterances and whispered confessions. As time wore on, his prayers took on a more repentant shape, while unbeknownst to him, the young woman lit a candle and departed.</p><p>If Gabriel\u2019s life had been a major motion picture, an old, weathered Franciscan brother would have stumbled across him as he knelt in prayer, and seeing his distress, would show him compassion, offering spiritual guidance. But Gabriel\u2019s life was not a motion picture. So he prayed alone.</p><p>If you had asked Gabriel afterward about what occurred in the tomb, he would have shrugged and evaded the question. Some things cannot be put into words. Some things defy language itself.</p><p>But there was a moment in his prayers in which Gabriel was confronted with the magnitude of all his failings, both moral and spiritual, while at the same time feeling the presence of One who knew the state of his soul and embraced him anyway. He was suddenly aware of what the writer Annie Dillard once referred to as the extravagance of grace. He thought of the love and forgiveness that had been lavished on the world and more specifically, on him, through the lives of Grace and Richard.</p><p>And Julianne, my sticky little leaf.</p><p>The magnet for sin found something very unexpected underneath the floors of the upper Basilica. When he left the church, he was more determined than ever not to return to his old ways. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 36</p><p>For Julia, the rest of April was a vortex of activity. There were final revisions to be made to her thesis, meetings with Katherine Picton and Nicole, and Friday nights to be spent with Paul.</p><p>Katherine ensured that Julia\u2019s final draft was error free and something that she could be proud of. Then she telephoned Cecilia Marinelli in Oxford to ask her to look for Julia at Harvard in the fall.</p><p>Paul secured a studio apartment in Cambridge for her to sublet. She began working through a list of texts Katherine had suggested she read in preparation for Professor Marinelli\u2019s seminar.</p> <p>At the end of April, Julia received a very official looking letter from the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies. Dr. Aras requested her attendance at his office in a week\u2019s time. He assured her that their appointment had nothing to do with a disciplinary matter, and he stated that Professor Martin would also be in attendance.</p><p>With great trepidation, she trudged across campus on a Monday afternoon, clutching her L.L. Bean knapsack. She took comfort in it, in the fact that it had been her companion for almost a year. Paul had offered to accompany her, but she\u2019d declined, arguing that she needed to face the Dean alone. Still, he\u2019d hugged her and promised to wait for her at their favorite Starbucks.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming, Miss Mitchell. How was your semester?\u201d</p><p>Julia gazed across the desk at Dean Aras in surprise. \u201cIt was\u2014interesting.\u201d</p><p>The Dean nodded, his eyes shifting to meet Professor Martin\u2019s. \u201cI know this academic year has been challenging for you. I asked to speak with you simply to find out if you have had any other problems since the hearing.\u201d</p> <p>Julia looked between the two academics, measuring them. \u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean Aras is wondering if Professor Emerson bothered you at all after the hearing. Did he call or email you? Did he try to meet with you?\u201d Professor Martin appeared friendly, but there was an undertone to his demeanor that made Julia suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care? You got what you wanted. He left the city.\u201d</p><p>The Dean\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cI\u2019m not about to retry the case with you, Miss Mitchell. This meeting is a courtesy, an attempt to ensure that you have been able to proceed with your education free of interference. We\u2019re trying to determine if Professor Emerson kept his word and left you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI received an email from him a few days after the hearing. He told me to stop contacting him and that we were over. That\u2019s what you want to hear, right?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the bitterness out of her voice.</p><p>Professor Martin exchanged a meaningful look with the Dean. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re glad to put this matter behind you.\u201d</p> <p>Julia sat silently, not bothering to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to go. Congratulations on a successful year and congratulations on being admitted to Harvard. We\u2019ll see you at graduation.\u201d The Dean nodded at her dismissively.</p><p>She picked up her knapsack and walked to the door. Just as her hand reached for the doorknob she stopped, turning to face the two professors.</p><p>How strange it is, she thought, that these two men, armed only with massive intellects and closets full of tweed, could wield so much power over her heart and her happiness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret my relationship with Professor Emerson, even though it ended badly. Both of you were incredibly dismissive and patronizing to me throughout this entire process. I understand the importance of protecting someone who needs protection, but the only people I needed protection from was you.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave them a withering look and exited the office.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>Gabriel stayed so long in Assisi, he became a fixture at the Basilica. Every day he spent a long hour sitting by St. Francis\u2019s crypt, thinking. Sometimes he prayed. Sometimes God seemed near and other times he seemed far away. At all times, Gabriel wished he was with Julia, although he began to realize how flawed their relationship had been\u2014how he\u2019d wanted to change his ways to be worthy of her when really, he should have changed because he was an insufferable ass.</p> <p>He was enjoying lunch one day at the hotel when a fellow American struck up a conversation with him. The man was a physician from California, who was visiting Assisi with his wife and teenaged son.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Florence tomorrow, and we\u2019ll be there for two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Gabriel asked, eying the gray-haired man curiously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be staying with the Franciscans. My wife, who is a nurse, and I will be working in a medical clinic. My son is going to be helping the homeless.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this as volunteers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We wanted to do this as a family.\u201d The man paused and looked at Gabriel intently.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider coming with us? The Franciscans can always use more help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Gabriel, stabbing a piece of beef determinedly. \u201cI\u2019m not Catholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are we. We\u2019re Lutherans.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at the doctor with interest. His knowledge of Lutherans was limited almost exclusively to the writings of Garrison Keillor. (Not that he was willing to admit it.)</p><p>The doctor smiled. \u201cWe wanted to lend a hand to a good work. I wanted to encourage my son to think beyond beach vacations and video games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the invitation, but I must decline.\u201d Gabriel was firm in his response, and so the doctor changed the subject.</p><p>Later that evening, Gabriel stared out the window of his simple hotel room, thinking as he always did about Julia.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have said no. She would have gone.</p><p>As ever, he was reminded of the divide between her generosity and his selfishness. A divide that, even after spending so many months with her, was yet to be breached.</p><p>Two weeks later, Gabriel stood in front of the monument to Dante in Santa Croce. He\u2019d joined the Lutherans in their trip to Florence and become one of the Franciscans\u2019 most troublesome volunteers. He served meals to the poor but was horrified by the quality of food on offer, so he wrote a check to hire a caterer to make the meals. He went with the other volunteers as they gave toiletries and clean clothing to homeless people, but he was so troubled by the lack of cleanliness of the men and women that he wrote a check to construct washrooms and shower facilities for the homeless at the Franciscan mission.</p><p>In short, by the time Gabriel had seen every aspect of the Franciscans\u2019 work with the poor, he\u2019d endeavored to change everything and agreed to finance the changes himself. Then he paid a few visits to some wealthy Florentine families, who he knew through his academic life, asking them to support the Franciscans as they helped the poor of Florence. Their donations would ensure a steady stream of revenue for years to come.</p><p>As he stood in front of the Dante memorial, he was struck by a sudden kinship with his favorite poet. Dante had been exiled from Florence. Even though the city eventually forgave him and allowed a memorial to be placed in his honor in the Basilica, he was buried in Ravenna. In a strange twist of fate, Gabriel now knew what it was like to be exiled from his job, his city, and his home, for Julianne\u2019s arms would always be his home. Even though he was forced into exile.</p><p>The memorials around him reminded him of his own mortality. If he was lucky, he\u2019d have a long life, but many people such as Grace had their lives cut short. He could be hit by a car, or contract cancer, or have a heart attack. Suddenly, his time on earth seemed very short and very precious.</p><p>Since he\u2019d left Assisi, he\u2019d tried to assuage his guilt and loneliness by doing good works. Volunteering with the Franciscans was certainly a step in that direction. But what about making amends with Paulina? It was far too late to make his peace with Grace, or Maia, or his biological mother and father.</p><p>What about Julianne?</p><p>Gabriel stared at the figure of a despairing woman who leaned on what looked like Dante\u2019s casket. He\u2019d accepted his exile, but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d refrained from writing letter after letter to her, letters that were never sent.</p><p>Cemeteries had a stillness all their own. Even cemeteries located in busy urban centers possessed this stillness\u2014an unearthly quiet that clings to the air.</p><p>Walking through the cemetery, Gabriel couldn\u2019t pretend that he was strolling in a park. The sparse trees that peppered the landscape were not teeming with singing birds. The grass, though green and very well kept, was not alive with squirrels or the occasional urban rabbit, playing with his brothers or looking for food.</p><p>He saw the stone angels in the distance, their twin forms standing like tall sentries among the other monuments. They were made of marble, not granite, their skin white and pale and perfect. The angels faced away from him, their wings spread wide. It was easier for him to stand behind the monument. He couldn\u2019t see the name etched in stone. He could stay there forever, a few feet away, and never approach. But that would be cowardly.</p><p>He inhaled deeply, his sapphire eyes shut tightly, as he said a silent prayer. Then he walked a half circuit around the monument, stopping in front of the marker.</p><p>He removed a pristine handkerchief from his trouser pocket. An onlooker might have guessed that he had need of it for sweat or tears, but he didn\u2019t. He leaned forward and with a gentle hand swept the white linen over the black stone. The dirt came away easily. He would need to tend the rose bushes that had begun to encroach upon the letters. He made a mental note to hire a gardener.</p><p>He placed flowers in front of the stone, his mouth moving as if he were whispering. But he wasn\u2019t. The grave, of course, was empty.</p><p>A tear or two clouded his vision, followed by their brothers, and soon his face was wet with their rain. He didn\u2019t bother to wipe them away as he lifted his face to gaze upon the angels, the souls of silent, marble compassion.</p><p>He asked for forgiveness. He expressed his guilt, a guilt he knew would ache for the rest of his life. He didn\u2019t ask for his burden to be removed, for it seemed to him to be part of the consequences of his actions. Or rather, the consequences of what he failed to do for a mother and their child.</p><p>He reached into his pocket to retrieve his cell phone and dialed a number from the iPhone\u2019s memory.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>Julia\u2019s father insisted on attending her graduation and refused to allow Paul to move her to Cambridge alone. Tom paid the security deposit and rent on her summer sublet. And it was Tom who flew to Toronto so he could watch his only daughter graduate with her MA on June eleventh.</p><p>Dressed in simple black with artful shoes, Julia left Paul and Tom on the steps of Convocation Hall while she went to line up with all the other graduating students.</p><p>Tom liked Paul. A lot.</p><p>Paul was forthright and had a firm handshake. He looked Tom directly in the eye when they spoke to one another. Paul offered his assistance in helping move Julia to Cambridge, including accommodations on his family\u2019s farm in Burlington, even after Tom had insisted that he could move Julia by himself. Tom dropped a hint to his daughter over dinner the evening before graduation, suggesting that Paul was an obvious choice for a new love interest, but Julia pretended she hadn\u2019t heard him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the graduates filed into the hall, Julia couldn\u2019t help but scan the audience, looking for Gabriel. With so many people it was unlikely that she would see him, even if he were present. However, when she gazed over at the faculty section she easily located Katherine Picton, dressed in her Oxonian robes. If the faculty were arranged alphabetically, and it certainly seemed as if they were, then Julia should have been able to guess where Gabriel would be seated, dressed in Harvard\u2019s crimson. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>When they called Julia\u2019s name, it was Katherine who ascended the stage in slow but certain steps to hood Julia with the vestment of a magister. It was Katherine who shook her hand professionally, wished her well at Harvard, and handed her the diploma.</p><p>Later that evening, after a celebratory dinner with Paul and Tom at a local steakhouse, Julia checked her voice mail and found a new message. It was from Rachel.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Julia! We all send our love and we have presents for you. Thanks for sending me your new address in Cambridge. I\u2019ll mail everything and make sure it arrives after you do. I\u2019m also sending your bridesmaid\u2019s dress.</p> <p>\u201cDad booked your flight from Boston to Philadelphia for August twenty-first. I hope that\u2019s okay. He wanted to pay for it, and I know that you were planning on coming a week early.</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t heard from Gabriel. I\u2019m hoping he was at your graduation. But if he wasn\u2019t, maybe you two will be able to sort everything out at the wedding. I can\u2019t imagine that he\u2019d miss it. He\u2019s supposed to be a groomsman, and I don\u2019t even have his measurements for his tux!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>A certain blue-eyed Dante specialist read T.S. Eliot\u2019s poem Ash Wednesday before offering his nighttime prayers. He was alone, and yet not alone.</p><p>Looking at the photograph on his bedside table he thought about her graduation. How beautiful and proud she would have looked in her robes. With a sigh, he closed his book of poetry and turned out the light.</p> <p>In the darkness of his old bedroom in the Clarks\u2019 former house, he reflected on the past weeks. He\u2019d left Italy and traveled to Boston and Minnesota. He\u2019d promised the Franciscans he\u2019d return, for they\u2019d said (wisely) that they prized his presence more than his donations. With that thought in mind, he closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, it\u2019s time to get up.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he kept his eyes shut, hoping the voice would go away. Sleep was peaceful and he needed it.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d The voice laughed softly, and he felt the mattress dip next to his legs.</p><p>He opened his eyes and saw his adoptive mother sitting on the edge of his bed. \u201cIs it time for school?\u201d he asked, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>Grace laughed again, the sound light and airy like music. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit old to be going to school, at least as a student.\u201d</p> <p>He looked around, confused. Then he sat up.</p><p>She smiled warmly and held out her hand. He relished the feel of her soft hand in his before squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She gave him a puzzled look that was not unkind, as he held her hand in both of his.</p><p>\u201cI never said good-bye. I wasn\u2019t able to tell you\u2014\u201d He paused and inhaled quickly. \u201cThat I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mother knows these things, Gabriel. I\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p><p>He was momentarily overcome with a wave of emotion as he reached over and pulled her into a hug. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were sick. Rachel told me you were getting better. I should have been there.\u201d</p><p>Grace patted him on the back. \u201cI want you to stop blaming yourself for everything. You made the best decision you could given the information you had at the time. No one expects you to be omniscient\u2014or perfect.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away so she could see his face. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t expect it of yourself, either. I love all my children, but you were my gift from God. You\u2019ve always been special.\u201d</p> <p>Mother and son spent a moment or two in quiet communion before she stood up, smoothing her dress.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wiped his eyes, pulling back the blankets and swinging his flannel covered legs to the floor. He stood up, trying to comb his hair, momentarily forgetting that he was shirtless. Grace went into the hallway then came back, with her arm around a young woman.</p><p>Gabriel stared.</p><p>The woman was young, although she seemed ageless. Her hair was long and blond, her face a flawless white, and she was slender and tall. Her eyes were familiar. Striking sapphire blue eyes greeted his, accompanied by a wide, pink smile.</p><p>Gabriel gave Grace a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you two talk,\u201d she said, and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gabriel.\u201d He smiled politely and extended his hand.</p><p>She shook it, grinning happily in return. \u201cI know.\u201d Her voice was soft and very sweet. It reminded Gabriel of a little bell.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to meet you. Grace told me what you were like as a child, about your work as a professor. I like Dante too. He\u2019s very funny.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded, not quite understanding.</p><p>The young woman looked up at him wistfully. \u201cWill you tell me about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stiffened, and his eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew her.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his hands. \u201cShe went to see her family in Minnesota, to try to reconcile with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know what she\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>He took a moment to carefully construct what to say. \u201cShe\u2019s attractive and smart. She\u2019s stubborn. She speaks several languages and she cooks well.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cBut she\u2019s not especially musical. She can\u2019t carry a tune in a basket.\u201d</p><p>The young woman giggled. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d She eyed Gabriel curiously. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cI think I love her now, in a way. We were friends in the beginning, when I met her at Oxford.\u201d</p><p>The young woman nodded and turned her head as if someone was calling her from the hallway. She quickly shifted her gaze back to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I met you. It wasn\u2019t possible before. But I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d She smiled and turned toward the door.</p><p>Gabriel followed her. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him expectantly. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. Although there\u2019s something familiar about your eyes...\u201d</p><p>She laughed and Gabriel smiled in spite of himself, for her laughter was infectious. \u201cOf course my eyes are familiar; they\u2019re yours.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile slid off his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know me?\u201d She seemed puzzled.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Maia.\u201d</p><p>His expression froze. Then, as the moments passed, it ranged through several different emotions, like clouds floating across the sky on a summer\u2019s day.</p><p>She pointed to the tattoo he wore on his left pectoral. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d She leaned forward, whispering conspiratorially. \u201cI know that you loved me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy here. It\u2019s filled with light and hope and love. And it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and kissed him on the cheek, her touch lingering for only a second, before she left him to walk to the hallway.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>Tom stood at Julia\u2019s front door the day after her graduation, wearing a gray T-shirt with the word Harvard emblazoned across the chest.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Julia\u2019s tone was a question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d he said gruffly, pulling her into a hug.</p><p>Father and daughter shared a quiet moment on the porch of Julia\u2019s building before they heard someone coming up the steps behind them.</p><p>\u201cUh, good morning. I brought breakfast.\u201d Paul held a tray containing three coffees and some doughnuts from Tim Horton\u2019s. He seemed somewhat embarrassed at having intruded on the Mitchells, but he was greeted with a handshake from Tom and a hug from Julia.</p><p>The trio shared breakfast at Julia\u2019s card table, then the two men began planning how best to pack up all of her things and move them. Luckily, Paul had persuaded Sarah, who was subletting to Julia, to allow her to move into the Cambridge apartment on June fifteenth.</p><p>\u201cUm, Katherine Picton invited me to lunch today. But I don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Julia spoke quickly. She didn\u2019t want to leave Tom and Paul working while she went on a social call.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of stuff, Jules.\u201d Tom quickly appraised her studio\u2019s contents. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you pack your clothes while we start on the books. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be close to finished by the time you have to see your professor.\u201d He smiled and tousled her hair with his hand before disappearing into the washroom, leaving Paul and Julia alone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. Dad and I will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned. \u201cWhen are you going to accept the fact that I\u2019m here because I want to be? I don\u2019t leave, Julia, not when I have a reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>Julia stiffened uncomfortably, and her eyes quickly fixated on the half-finished coffee in front of her.</p><p>\u201cIf Professor Picton summoned you, it\u2019s because she wants to talk to you. You\u2019d better go.\u201d Paul squeezed Julia\u2019s hand lightly. \u201cYour old man and I can handle things around here.\u201d</p><p>Julia exhaled slowly and smiled.</p><p>There were a few intimate things that Julia did not want her father or Paul to see so she hid them in her L. L. Bean knapsack. The items were not what one might expect a young woman to hide from her father\u2014a journal, diamond earrings, and a few items related to her counseling sessions.</p><p>Nicole had been pleased by Julia\u2019s progress, and when they concluded their final session, gave her the name and contact information of a counselor near Harvard. Nicole had not only helped Julia cope, she was passing her into another set of capable hands that would help her take the next steps in her journey.</p><p>Julia wore a dress and modest sandals to Professor Picton\u2019s house, thinking that an invitation to lunch warranted attractive garb. She carried her knapsack on one of her shoulders and clutched a tin of what she was told was a very fine loose Darjeeling tea, which she\u2019d purchased as a hostess gift. She and her Darjeeling were received with typical Pictonian restraint and immediately ushered into the dining room where they enjoyed a very pleasant lunch of prawn salad, cold cucumber soup, and a fine Sauvignon blanc.</p><p>\u201cHow is your reading list coming along?\u201d Katherine asked, eying Julia over her soup.</p><p>\u201cSlowly but surely. I\u2019m reading the texts you\u2019ve suggested, but I\u2019ve only started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Marinelli is looking forward to meeting you. It would be good for you to introduce yourself to her when she arrives in Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. And thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be beneficial for you to meet the other Dante specialists in the area, especially at Boston University.\u201d Katherine smiled sagely. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m sure circumstances will arrange themselves so you end up being introduced to them eventually. But if they don\u2019t, promise me that you will you drop by the Department of Romance Studies at BU before September.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will. Thank you. I don\u2019t know what I would have done...\u201d Julia\u2019s voice trailed off as she warred with her emotions.</p><p>Surprisingly, Katherine reached across the table and patted Julia\u2019s hand. She touched her awkwardly, as a distinguished bachelor professor might pat the head of a crying child, but not without feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve graduated with honors. Your thesis is solid and could form the basis of what will hopefully be a fine dissertation. I look forward to watching your career with interest. And I think you will be very happy in Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>When it was time for her to leave, Julia intended to shake Katherine\u2019s hand but was surprised when she was pulled into a restrained but warm hug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a good student. Now go to Harvard and make me proud. And drop me an email now and then to let me know how you are.\u201d Katherine pulled back and looked at Julia fixedly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible I\u2019ll be giving a lecture in Boston in the fall. I hope we\u2019ll run into one another.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded her agreement.</p><p>As she walked to her small studio on Madison Avenue, she stared in wonder at the gift Professor Picton had placed in her hands. It was a worn and rare early edition of Dante\u2019s La Vita Nuova that had belonged to Dorothy L. Sayers, who had been a friend of Katherine\u2019s dissertation director at Oxford. In it was Sayers\u2019s marginalia, written in her own hand. Julia would treasure it always.</p><p>No matter what Gabriel had done, persuading Katherine Picton to be her thesis advisor was a gift so great she would be forever in his debt.</p> <p>Love is doing a kindness for someone else, not expecting to receive anything in return, she thought.</p><p>Early the next morning, Julia, Tom, and Paul loaded everything into the back of a U-Haul and drove eight hours to the Norris farm, which was located just outside of Burlington, Vermont. The Mitchells were warmly welcomed and were persuaded to stay a few extra days so Ted Norris, Paul\u2019s father, could take Tom fishing.</p><p>Julia silently doubted that any other inducement would have delayed his rigorous schedule, but that was before either of them had tried Louise Norris\u2019s cooking. Paul\u2019s mother was an excellent cook who made everything, including doughnuts, from scratch. Tom\u2019s stomach was in love.</p><p>On June fifteenth, the night before the Mitchells and Paul were supposed to leave for Cambridge, Paul couldn\u2019t sleep. His father had called him out of bed well after midnight because of a bovine emergency. By the time the crisis was averted, he was far too agitated to go back to bed.</p><p>He had two women on his mind. Allison, his former girlfriend, had been visiting when he arrived with Julia two days earlier. They were still friends, so the gesture was well meant, but Paul knew that part of her reason for being there was to size Julia up. He\u2019d told Allison about Julia at Christmas, so she was more than aware of Julia\u2019s presence in his life and his attachment to her. An attachment that he had to admit was unrequited, at least, at that time.</p><p>Still, Allison was friendly to Julia, and of course, Julia was her own shy but charming self. It was awkward for Paul as he watched his past and his potential future make small talk while he fumbled for something to say.</p> <p>When Allison called his cell phone before bed that evening and said that Julia was lovely, he didn\u2019t know how to respond. Of course he had feelings for Allison. They had a long and good history as friends before they began dating. He loved her still. But she\u2019d broken things off with him. He\u2019d moved on and met Julia. Why should he feel guilty?</p><p>While Paul was contemplating his very complex (yet simultaneously non-existent) love life, Julia was wrestling with insomnia. When she finally grew weary of tossing and turning she decided to creep from the third floor garret she was occupying to the kitchen to get a glass of milk.</p><p>She found Paul sitting alone at the large, harvest table, eating a rather expansive dish of ice cream.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He took in her appearance with a swift but appreciative look.</p><p>Julia walked over to him wearing an old Selinsgrove High School T-shirt and a pair of running shorts that had St. Joe\u2019s cheekily sewn onto the seat.</p><p>(To Paul\u2019s eyes, she was Helen of Troy in leisurewear.)</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep, either?\u201d She pulled out a chair to sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cDad had a problem with one of the cows. Heath Bar Crunch?\u201d He dished up a large spoonful of Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream and held it out to her.</p> <p>It was her favorite flavor. She gently took the spoon out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d she groaned, eyes closed. She opened her eyes and handed back the spoon, resisting the urge to lick it clean.</p><p>Paul put the spoon in the bowl and stood up. She blinked at him and instinctively moved back in her chair.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d he whispered, pulling her to her feet. He pushed her hair behind her shoulders, noting that she didn\u2019t flinch when he did so. Their upper bodies grazed one another. He looked into her eyes with an expression of heated intensity. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Her face crinkled up into a smile. \u201cWe won\u2019t be saying good-bye. We\u2019ll email and talk on the phone. If you come to Boston, we\u2019ll see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand.\u201d</p><p>Julia freed her wrist from Paul\u2019s hand, stepping back. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Allison, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t want to create trouble for you. Dad and I can make the trip by ourselves.\u201d</p><p>She waited patiently for his response, but instead of looking relieved, he looked conflicted.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Allison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to ask me that?\u201d He took another step toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>Leery of rejection, he raised his hands slowly and cupped her face. Her fine features were engulfed by his large hands. He held her tenderly, worried about such fragility underneath his grasp, and slowly began to stroke her face with his thumbs.</p><p>Julia tore her eyes away from his. \u201cPaul, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me say this,\u201d he interrupted forcefully. \u201cJust once, let me tell you how I feel.\u201d He inhaled and waited until she met his gaze again before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you. I don\u2019t want to be apart from you because I love you. The thought of having to leave you in Cambridge is tearing me up.\u201d</p><p>Julia inhaled slowly and began to shake her head.</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out. I know that you aren\u2019t in love with me. I know it\u2019s too soon. But do you think that you could be\u2014in time?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. Her mind raced ahead to envision a future she hadn\u2019t previously considered\u2014a crossroads of possibilities. She thought of what it would be like to love Paul, to be held and kissed by him, to have him take her to his bed upstairs and make love to her, gently and sweetly. For she knew above all things that Paul would be sweet.</p><p>He would want marriage, of course, and children. But he would be proud of her academic career and support her in it.</p><p>She found herself unrepulsed by these images, for they were good. She could have a contented life with a decent man who had never done her ill and who, she knew, would probably never so much as hurt her feelings as long as he lived. She could have a good life with him.</p><p>He lifted her chin and she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be drama and fights and exes like Professor Pain. I will treat you respectfully, and I will never, ever leave you.</p><p>\u201cChoose me,\u201d he whispered, his eyes deep and intense. \u201cChoose me and I will give you a happy life. You\u2019ll never have to cry yourself to sleep again.\u201d</p><p>Tears began to stream down her face. She knew that what he was saying was true. But knowing the truth and wanting the truth are two very different things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like him. I\u2019m not an inferno that blazes and dies out. I\u2019m constant. I\u2019ve held back because I knew that you only wanted to be friends. But just once, I\u2019d like to be able to show you what I feel without holding back.\u201d</p><p>He took her silence as acquiescence and wrapped his arms around her. He bent down so their lips could meet and poured all his passion and love for her into a single kiss. Paul\u2019s mouth was warm and inviting. What began as a gentle contact quickly became urgent with desire.</p><p>With a split-second decision, she opened to him, tentatively, and his tongue quickly entered and met hers, his hands ending up in her hair. There was no domination, no pressing of boundaries, nothing overwhelming or crass.</p><p>Paul kissed her for as long as he could without becoming obscene, then slowly lessened the pressure of his lips on hers, pecking her briefly before moving his lips to her ear. \u201cI love you, Julia. Say that you\u2019ll be mine. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Julia tightened her arms around him as the tears fell.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>Over breakfast the next morning, Louise Norris looked with concern between her son and the young woman he loved. Her husband, Ted, tried to keep the conversation moving by talking about the ill cow he\u2019d tended to the night before. Tom tried to cram a homemade doughnut into his mouth without appearing like a barbarian, and failed.</p><p>After breakfast, the kitchen emptied like a galleon full of rats docking in a new port, leaving Paul and Julia sitting across from one another, each fidgeting with their coffee mugs and avoiding one another\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Julia broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lip as her eyes darted to meet his, wondering if he was angry or bitter. Or both.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. His dark eyes were still kind, but he appeared defeated. \u201cI had to try, you know? I didn\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019d found someone else. But I won\u2019t bring it up again.\u201d He pursed his lips, and a resigned expression passed over his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me embarrassing you.\u201d</p><p>Julia leaned over the table and took his hand in hers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t embarrassed. I know that we would have had a good life together. I care for you too. But you deserve more. You deserve to have a life with someone who will love you the same way that you love her.\u201d</p><p>Paul released her hand and walked away.</p><p>\u201cCare to explain why he\u2019s so quiet?\u201d Tom turned to Julia as they waited for Paul to come out of the men\u2019s room at a gas station in New Hampshire.</p><p>\u201cHe wants more than I can give him.\u201d</p><p>Tom squinted at something in the distance. \u201cHe seems like a good man. He comes from a good family. What\u2019s the problem? Got a thing against cows?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to make her laugh, but it had the opposite effect. He quickly held his hands up in surrender. \u201cWhat do I know? I thought the senator\u2019s son was a good match for you. So I guess I\u2019m a horse\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>Before Julia could disagree, Paul returned to the U-Haul, ending the heart to heart conversation between father and daughter.</p><p>Two days later Julia stood on the front steps of her new building, saying good-bye to Paul, feeling worse than she had when she rejected him in his parents\u2019 kitchen. He hadn\u2019t been cold, or rude, or resentful. He hadn\u2019t shirked any responsibilities in terms of driving from Vermont to Cambridge, or unloading Julia\u2019s things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d even gone out of his way to set up a job interview for her at the trendy coffee shop across the street. The former occupant of the apartment had just quit her job there. Paul hoped that Julia could replace her, knowing that she needed the money.</p><p>He\u2019d slept on the floor in Julia\u2019s small apartment and never complained. He\u2019d been perfect, actually. And that made Julia almost feel as if she should change her mind.</p><p>It would be safer, easier, to choose Paul. Her heart would heal with him. But in choosing Paul, she would be settling for the good and not the exceptional. And even if the exceptional eluded her for the rest of her life, it would be better, she thought, to live the life of a Katherine Picton, than to be like her mother. In marrying a good man without loving him passionately and completely, she would only serve to short-change him and herself. And she was not that selfish.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye.\u201d He hugged her tightly and released her, watching her expression carefully. Perhaps he was looking to see if she\u2019d changed her mind.</p> <p>\u201cGood-bye. Thanks for everything. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without you, all these months\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThis is what friends do.\u201d</p><p>Paul saw her eyes fill with tears and gave her a very worried expression. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are.\u201d Julia sniffled. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a great friend to me, and I hope that we can still be friends, even though...\u201d She didn\u2019t finish her sentence, and Paul nodded as if he was grateful she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>With much hesitation he reached out to stroke her cheek one last time. Then he walked toward the car where his friend Patrick was waiting. Patrick was going to drive him back to Vermont.</p> <p>Suddenly, Paul stopped. He turned around and walked back to Julia, nervously.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to mention this in front of your father, so I was waiting until after he left. Then I thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d Paul looked away, up Mount Auburn Street, seemingly struggling with something.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, turning to look at her. \u201cI got an email yesterday from Professor Martin.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cEmerson quit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She placed a hand on either side of her temple as she tried to focus on the enormity of what Paul was saying. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He agreed to continue supervising my dissertation, even though he\u2019s leaving. At least, that\u2019s what Martin said. I haven\u2019t heard from Emerson at all.\u201d</p><p>Paul caught sight of Julia\u2019s agitated pose and quickly put an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset you, but I thought you should know. The department is starting a search for his replacement, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be recruiting at Harvard. I knew you\u2019d hear about it. I thought it would be better coming from me.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded woodenly. \u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. Martin was tight-lipped about the entire thing. I think he\u2019s pissed. After all the shit Emerson put the department through, he up and quit.\u201d</p><p>Julia numbly hugged Paul good-bye and returned to her new apartment so she could think. That evening, she called Rachel. When she received a voice mail message she contemplated telephoning Richard, but she didn\u2019t want to bother him. She knew that Scott wouldn\u2019t have any inside information as to Gabriel\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>So she left a couple of messages on Rachel\u2019s cell phone over the course of the next few days, then she waited. Rachel never responded.</p> <p>As the days of June passed, Julia started a part-time job as a sales clerk at Peet\u2019s coffee shop, which was located in a remodeled three-story house across the street. Since Tom covered her rent and her moving expenses, and since he had demanded that she take some of the proceeds from the sale of his house back in Selinsgrove, she was able to live simply but comfortably on her part-time job and her savings until her fellowship began in late August.</p><p>She quickly arranged an appointment with the therapist that Nicole had recommended and began meeting with Dr. Margaret Walters on a weekly basis. When she wasn\u2019t learning the ropes of the retail coffee market and charming the citizens of Harvard Square, she followed Katherine Picton\u2019s instructions and introduced herself to Greg Matthews, the Chair of her new department.</p><p>Professor Matthews received her warmly, and they spent the better part of an hour discussing their common interest in Dante. He mentioned that Cecilia Marinelli was arriving from Oxford the following week and suggested that Julia drop by in order to attend a reception that was being held in Professor Marinelli\u2019s honor. Julia accepted the invitation gladly. Then he walked her to the graduate student lounge and introduced her to a group of students before politely taking his leave.</p><p>Two of the students were cordial but not particularly friendly. The third student, Zsuzsa, who was from Hungary, welcomed Julia immediately. She told Julia that a group of them met for drinks every Wednesday at Grendel\u2019s Den, a local pub overlooking Winthrop Park. Apparently, Grendel\u2019s had a lovely patio and an exceptional beer list. Julia promised to meet Zsuzsa there the following Wednesday night, and the two women exchanged email addresses.</p><p>Despite Julia\u2019s overall shyness, a character trait that she would never lose completely, she fit into the Harvard landscape like a hand into a glove. She found an undergraduate tour guide called Ari who gave her an orientation to the campus, the library, and the graduate school. She secured a library card in advance of registration, which would be held in August.</p><p>Julia dropped into the graduate student lounge on occasion to see Zsuzsa and to learn more about the atmosphere of the department. And she spent long hours in the library, hunting down books that she would need to read that summer. Exploring the neighborhood, she found a grocery store and a bank and claimed a particular Thai restaurant, which was just down the street from her apartment, as her new favorite place to eat.</p><p>So by the time Rachel called her on June twenty-sixth, Julia was completely at home in her new life and happy. Almost.</p><p>Julia was in between customers when Rachel called her cell phone, so she asked one of her co-workers to cover for her and walked out to the front lawn so as not to disturb anyone.</p><p>\u201cRachel, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine! I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get back to you. Some bastard stole my phone and I had to get a new one. Then I had to go back through all the messages, starting with the ones about the wedding and \u2014\u201d</p><p>Julia gritted her teeth only slightly as she waited for Rachel to draw breath so she could steer the conversation in a completely different direction. In two or three paragraphs, her patience was rewarded.</p><p>\u201cGabriel quit his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rachel almost shouted. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine was his research assistant in Toronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel sold his condo. He sent Dad an email saying that he was moving and that he has been staying in hotels while he looks for a house.\u201d</p><p>Julia leaned her back up against the old, gnarled oak tree that stood in front of Peet\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDid he mention where he was looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just that he\u2019d hired a company to pack up his things and put them in storage. But if he quit his job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the process of quitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should call him! Julia, it\u2019s the perfect time. You have to call him.\u201d</p><p>Julia gritted her teeth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe broke up with me, remember? I\u2019m not going to be the one to fix this\u2014assuming it can be fixed.\u201d</p><p>Rachel grew very quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you sweep whatever happened under the carpet. But I hope that you two could talk about what happened. He needs to hear how you feel about all of this and what happened to you after he left. And frankly, he needs to offer some kind of explanation. He owes you that. Then you can tell him to get lost, if that\u2019s what you really want.\u201d</p><p>Julia squeezed her eyes shut as a wave of pain washed over her. The thought of seeing Gabriel\u2014and listening to his explanation\u2014physically hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure my heart can survive his explanation.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>Julia buried herself in busyness for the next few days, studying in preparation for her introduction to Professor Marinelli. Since the Professor was the guest of honor at the lavish reception where they met, their conversation was short, but a success. Professor Marinelli was still settling into her new home, but recognized Julia\u2019s name thanks to Professor Picton\u2019s recommendation and suggested that they meet for coffee in July.</p><p>Julia wafted home on a breeze of optimism. She was so happy, she decided it was finally time to begin the project she\u2019d been avoiding\u2014unpacking her books and arranging them on shelves in her small apartment. Until that evening, she\u2019d availed herself of Harvard\u2019s libraries. But every day the collection of boxes nagged at her, and so she finally decided it was time to organize them. The process took longer than she anticipated. She finished about a third of the boxes that evening before walking to the Thai restaurant and ordering take out.</p><p>Two days later, Julia was down to the final box. After a very enjoyable evening with Zsuzsa and a few other graduate students at Grendel\u2019s Den on June thirtieth, Julia came home determined to finish unpacking.</p><p>As had been her practice, she shelved the volumes in alphabetical order almost mindlessly. Until she came to the last book in the bottom of the last cardboard box, Marriage in the Middle Ages: Love, Sex, and the Sacred, published by Oxford University Press. Frowning, she turned the volume over in her hands. It took a few minutes for a distant memory to creep back to her\u2014Paul, standing in her studio apartment, saying that he\u2019d retrieved her mail from the department.</p><p>\u201cA medieval history textbook,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>Out of curiosity, Julia leafed through the volume and found a business card wedged in the Table of Contents. The card was for Alan Mackenzie, the Oxford University Press textbook representative in Toronto. On the back of his card was a handwritten note that stated he\u2019d be happy to help her with her textbook needs.</p><p>Julia was about to close the book and shelve it when her eyes alighted on one of the readings.</p><p>The Letters of Abelard and H\u00e9loise, Letter Six.</p><p>It only took an instant for Julia to recall her last conversation with Gabriel.</p><p>Gabriel turned away from Jeremy, lowering his voice to a whisper. \u201cRead my sixth letter. Paragraph four.\u201d</p><p>Her heart racing, she turned the pages, shocked to find an illustration and a photograph marking the place where Abelard\u2019s sixth letter was found:</p><p>But whither does my vain imagination carry me! Ah, H\u00e9loise, how far are we from such a happy temper? Your heart still burns with that fatal fire you cannot extinguish, and mine is full of trouble and unrest. Think not, H\u00e9loise, that I here enjoy a perfect peace; I will for the last time open my heart to you;\u2014I am not yet disengaged from you, and though I fight against my excessive tenderness for you, in spite of all my endeavours I remain but too sensible of your sorrows and long to share in them. Your letters have indeed moved me; I could not read with indifference characters written by that dear hand! I sigh and weep, and all my reason is scarce sufficient to conceal my weakness from my pupils. This, unhappy H\u00e9loise, is the miserable condition of Abelard. The world, which is generally wrong in its notions, thinks I am at peace, and imagining that I loved you only for the gratification of the senses, have now forgot you. What a mistake is this! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She must have read the passage five times before its message began to sink into her agitated mind.</p><p>Julia looked at the illustration closely. The title read The Contention for Guido de Montefeltro. The name was familiar, but she couldn\u2019t quite remember its significance. She grabbed her latptop, intent on looking the image up on the internet but quickly remembered that she didn\u2019t have internet access in her apartment.</p><p>She located her phone, but the battery was dead and she had no idea where the cord was to recharge it. Undeterred, she returned to the book and picked up the photograph that had been placed next to the illustration. It was a picture of the apple orchard behind the Clarks\u2019 house. Gabriel\u2019s handwriting was on the back:</p><p>To my Beloved,</p> <p>My heart is yours and my body.</p><p>My soul, likewise.</p><p>I will be true to you, Beatrice.</p><p>I want to be your last.</p><p>Wait for me...</p> <p>When she\u2019d overcome her shock, she was desperate to speak to him. She didn\u2019t care that it was close to midnight and Mount Auburn Street was dark. She didn\u2019t care that Peet\u2019s had closed hours ago. She grabbed her laptop and fled her apartment, knowing that if she could stand just outside the door to Peet\u2019s, she\u2019d be able to pick up a wireless signal and email Gabriel. Julia had no idea what she would say. All she could do was run.</p><p>The neighborhood was almost silent. Despite the gentle drizzle and mist of warm vespertine rain, a small group of what looked like frat boys were about a half a block away, talking and laughing. Julia stepped from the curb and began to cross the street, her flip-flops squishing against the wet asphalt. She ignored the droplets that fell from the sky, soaking through her T-shirt. She ignored the thunder that began to roll and the flash of lightning that illuminated the eastern sky.</p><p>In the very center of the road, she stopped because straight ahead of her, she glimpsed a shadowy figure lurking in the darkness behind the oak tree in front of Peet\u2019s. Another flash of lightning revealed that the figure was a man.</p><p>He was half-hidden by the tree and in the absence of light, she couldn\u2019t make out his features. She knew better than to approach a stranger in the shadows, so she stayed where she was, craning her neck to see him.</p><p>As if in response to her movements, he came around the edge of the tree and slowly walked into the pool of light that cascaded onto the sidewalk from the street lamp. Another bolt of lightning shimmered overhead, and for one brief instant Julia thought he looked like an angel.</p><p>Gabriel.</p> <p>Chapter 43</p><p>Gabriel saw the pain in her eyes. That was the first thing he noticed. Somehow, she looked older. But her beauty, her goodness made visible, was even more breathtaking than it had been before.</p><p>Standing in front of her, he was overwhelmed by how much he loved her. All his trials fell away. He\u2019d been working up the nerve to go to her, to ring the doorbell and beg entrance. When he thought he couldn\u2019t wait a minute more, the door to her apartment building opened and she scampered like a deer into the road.</p><p>He\u2019d fantasized about their reunion. On some days, it was the only thought that sustained him. But the longer she stood, statue still, making no move to come to him, the more a feeling of despair grew. Several different scenarios coursed through his consciousness, few of them ending happily.</p><p>Don\u2019t send me away, he begged her silently. Running an uneasy hand through his hair, he tried to smooth the rain dampened strands.</p><p>\u201cJulianne.\u201d He couldn\u2019t disguise the tremor in his voice. She was staring through him as if he were a ghost.</p><p>Before Gabriel could give voice to that idea, he heard something approach. He turned in the direction of an approaching vehicle. Julia was still standing in the road.</p><p>He shouted to her wildly, \u201cJulia, move!\u201d</p> <p>Frozen, she ignored his warning, and the car whipped past, narrowly missing her. Gabriel began walking toward her, arms and hands waving.</p><p>\u201cJulia, get out of the road. Now!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes were shut tightly. She could hear noises and the distant hum of his voice, but she couldn\u2019t make out any words. Droplets of rain fell on her bare arms and legs, and a solid chest pressed against her face as a warm, masculine body wrapped around her like a blanket.</p><p>She opened her eyes.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s handsome face was lined with worry, his eyes shimmering with hope. He placed a hesitant hand against the curve of her cheek, brushing under her eye with the pad of his thumb.</p><p>For a few moments, at least, they said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She stared up at him, speechless.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to shock you. I came as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>His words broke through the haze that froze her. Julia wriggled out of his grasp. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI would have thought it was obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel huffed in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s July first. I came as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head, taking a cautious step back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His voice took on a conciliatory tone. \u201cI wish I could have returned earlier.\u201d</p><p>Her expression said it all\u2014the narrowed, suspicious eyes, the ruby lips pressed tightly together, the clenched jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou knew I resigned. Surely you must have known I\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>Julia clutched her laptop to her chest. \u201cWhy would I think that?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. For a moment, he was too stunned to speak.</p><p>\u201cDid you think that I wouldn\u2019t come back, even after I\u2019d resigned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what a person tends to think when her lover flees the city without so much as a phone call. And sends her an impersonal email saying that it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cSarcasm does not become you, Julianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying does not become you, Professor.\u201d Her eyes flashed.</p><p>He took a step toward her, then stopped. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to that, are we? Julianne and the Professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to what you told the hearing officers, we never got past it. You\u2019re the professor, I\u2019m the student. You seduced and dumped me. The hearing officers didn\u2019t tell me if you said that you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>He swore under his breath. \u201cI sent you messages. You simply chose not to believe them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat messages? The telephone calls you never made? The letters you never wrote? Apart from that email, I\u2019ve heard nothing from you since you called me H\u00e9loise. Absolutely nothing.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the messages I left you? Maybe you deleted them without bothering to listen\u2014just like you left without bothering to tell me. Do you know how humiliating that was? That the man who was supposed to love me fled the city in order to break up with me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pressed a hand to his forehead, as if to help his mind focus. \u201cWhat about the letter from Abelard to H\u00e9loise and the photograph of our orchard? I put the book in your mailbox myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the textbook was from you. I only looked at it a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I told you to read Abelard\u2019s letter! I told you myself,\u201d he sputtered, a horrified expression on his face.</p><p>Julia clutched her laptop more tightly. \u201cNo, you said read my sixth letter. I did. You told me to choose a sweater because the weather had turned cold.\u201d She eyed him furiously. \u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you H\u00e9loise. Wasn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was crushingly obvious,\u201d she snapped. \u201cH\u00e9loise was seduced and abandoned by her professor. Your message was crystal clear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the textbook...\u201d he began. He searched her eyes. \u201cThe photograph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it tonight when I was unpacking my books.\u201d Her expression softened. \u201cBefore this, I thought you were telling me that you\u2019d tired of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he managed. His words were woefully inadequate, but they came from the heart. \u201cI...Julianne, I need to expl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go inside,\u201d she interrupted, peering up at the windows of her apartment.</p><p>He reached out to take her hand but thought better of it, letting his arm drop to his side.</p><p>The thunder and lightning continued as they climbed the stairs. By the time they entered the studio apartment, the lights had flickered and gone out.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s just this building,\u201d Julia mused. \u201cOr if it\u2019s the whole street.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel murmured his response, watching impotently as she felt her way across the room. She pulled back the blinds to let in as much light as possible. Mount Auburn Street was dark.</p><p>\u201cWe could go somewhere with electricity.\u201d His voice sounded at her elbow, and she jumped.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He placed a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay here.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel resisted the urge to insist, realizing that he was in no position to demand that Julia do anything. He looked around the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a flashlight or some candles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I think.\u201d She found a flashlight and handed Gabriel a towel while she retreated to the bathroom to change into dry clothes. By the time she\u2019d returned, he was seated on the futon, surrounded by a half-dozen tea lights, which were spread artfully on the furniture and across the floor.</p><p>Julia watched the shadows flicker on the wall behind him. Unearthly shapes seemed to hover around him, as if he were trapped in Dante\u2019s Inferno. The lines on his forehead had deepened, it seemed, and his eyes appeared larger. He hadn\u2019t shaved recently, the scruff of his beard covering the planes of his face. He\u2019d smoothed his damp hair back with his fingers, but a single curl had rebelled, clinging stubbornly to his forehead.</p><p>Julia had forgotten how attractive he was. How, with just a glance or a word he could make her blood heat. He was as dangerous as he was beautiful.</p><p>Gabriel reached out to pull her to sit next to him, but she curled into the opposite corner.</p><p>\u201cI found a corkscrew and a bottle of wine. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d He handed her a glass that was half-full of an inexpensive Shiraz. She was surprised he\u2019d bothered, for it was the kind of wine he would have disdained in the past.</p><p>She took several long sips, savoring the wine on her tongue. She waited for him to cough, sputter, and complain about the appalling bathwater. But he didn\u2019t. In fact, he didn\u2019t drink at all. Instead, he stared at her, his eyes coming to rest unapologetically on the swell of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAre you changing schools?\u201d His voice sounded husky.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He gestured to her sweatshirt.</p><p>She looked down. Boston College.</p><p>\u201cNo, Paul gave this to me. He went there for his master\u2019s, remember?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stiffened. \u201cI gave you a sweatshirt once,\u201d he observed, more to himself than to her.</p><p>Julia took another long sip of wine, wishing there was more of it.</p><p>He watched her drink, his eyes resting on her mouth and throat. \u201cDo you still have my Harvard sweatshirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably but couldn\u2019t drag his gaze away from her. He longed to run his hands up and down her body and press their mouths together. \u201cWhat do you think about Boston University?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked over at him warily. In response to her suspicion, the bravado seemed to leak out of his gaze and he chewed at the edge of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cKatherine Picton told me to introduce myself to the Dante specialist in the Department of Romance Studies. But I haven\u2019t gotten around to it. I\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need to thank her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the new Dante specialist at Boston University.\u201d</p><p>He searched her eyes for a reaction. But there wasn\u2019t one. She sat very still, the candlelight flickering over her fine features.</p><p>He chuckled mirthlessly, pouring more wine into her glass. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the response I was hoping for.\u201d</p><p>She muttered her annoyance, tasting the wine again. \u201cSo you\u2019re\u2014here to stay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d He looked at her sweatshirt significantly.</p><p>The heat of his gaze seemed to scorch her. She resisted the urge to hide her breasts from him, keeping her arms at her sides.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a full professor now. Romance Studies doesn\u2019t have a graduate program in Italian. The university wanted to be able to attract graduate students in Dante studies, so they cross-appointed me with Religion. They have a graduate program.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at the shadows that surrounded them, shaking his head. \u201cSurprising, isn\u2019t it? That a man who spent his life running from God should become a professor of Religion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen stranger things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabriel whispered, \u201cI think you have. I would have resigned from Toronto sooner, but it would have caused a scandal. Once you\u2019d graduated, I was free to accept the job here.\u201d</p> <p>Julia turned away, and Gabriel noticed the nakedness of her ear lobes. She wasn\u2019t wearing Grace\u2019s earrings anymore. The thought gutted him.</p><p>Her brow wrinkled as she contemplated what he\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so significant about July first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday is the day my contract in Toronto ends. It\u2019s the day my resignation takes effect.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI read your emails and listened to your voice mails\u2014all of them. But I hoped you\u2019d seen the book. I placed it in your mailbox myself.\u201d</p><p>Julia was still processing his words. She wasn\u2019t accepting his excuses; she simply wasn\u2019t arguing with him. At least, not yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed your graduation.\u201d He sipped a glass of water. \u201cKatherine sent me a few photographs.\u201d He cleared his throat, hesitating. \u201cYou looked beautiful. You are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He dug into his trouser pocket and produced his iPhone. Curious, she took it, setting her wine aside. As his wallpaper, Gabriel had a photograph of Julia in her graduation gown, shaking Katherine Picton\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cFrom Katherine,\u201d he explained, noting her confusion.</p> <p>She scrolled through his photo album determinedly, her stomach queasy. There were pictures from their trip to Italy and photos from Christmas, but Paulina was not to be found. There were no compromising pictures of Gabriel, no images of other women. In fact, almost all the pictures were of her, including a series of very provocative shots that he\u2019d taken in Belize.</p><p>She was surprised. After being so convinced he wanted nothing to do with her, the sight of his apparent regard was disorienting.</p><p>She returned his phone. \u201cThe picture that you used to keep on your dresser, the one of us at Lobby, did you take it with you?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted in surprise. \u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>Julia paused for a moment as the revelation sunk in. \u201cI noticed it was missing when I went looking for you.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to take her hand but once again, she withdrew.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went back to my condo, I saw your clothes. Why you didn\u2019t take them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t really mine.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows knitted together. \u201cOf course they were yours. They still are, if you want them.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Julianne, I wanted you with me. The photograph was a poor substitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t help himself. He gently stroked the curve of her cheek with his thumb, inwardly relieved that she didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cI never stopped wanting you.\u201d</p><p>She moved away, leaving his hand to touch only air. Her tone grew harsh. \u201cDo you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be left by the person you love, not once, but twice?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pressed his lips together. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>He waited to see if she would answer him, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSo Paul gave you that sweatshirt.\u201d He toyed with his glass. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Why do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my student.\u201d Professor Emerson sounded prim.</p><p>\u201cSo was I, once,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cYou should email him. He said he hasn\u2019t heard from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve spoken with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gabriel. I\u2019ve spoken with him.\u201d</p><p>Julia pulled her wet hair out of its ponytail, running her fingers delicately through the tangles.</p><p>Gabriel watched, entranced, as a cascade of dark, shiny strands fell across her thin shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMy hair hurts,\u201d she explained.</p><p>The corners of his mouth turned up in amusement. \u201cI didn\u2019t know hair could hurt.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through her hair, and his expression changed instantly to one of concern. \u201cYou could have been seriously injured, standing in the middle of the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t drop my laptop. It has all my research on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault for surprising you. I\u2019m sure I looked like a ghost, skulking about behind that tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever skulked a day in your life. And you didn\u2019t look like a ghost. You looked like something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Julia felt her skin flame.</p><p>He watched her cheeks take on the shade of pink he was most familiar with. He ached to feel her blush beneath his fingers. But he was wary of pushing her.</p><p>She gestured vaguely. \u201cPaul suggested I back up my files on a flash drive, so if something happened to my computer I\u2019d still have everything. But I haven\u2019t updated it recently.\u201d</p><p>At the second mention of his former research assistant, Gabriel suppressed a growl and the urge to mutter a favored expletive that involved copulating carnally with celestial creatures.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d expect me to get in touch with you once you graduated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I did, Gabriel? Graduation came and went with no word from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I had to wait until my resignation took effect. My contract didn\u2019t end until July first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t say the things I need to say while you\u2019re sitting on my futon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>She shifted her feet, actively resisting the overwhelming urge to throw herself into his arms and tell him that everything was fine. Things between them weren\u2019t fine. And she owed it to herself, if not to him, to be honest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken up enough of your evening.\u201d He sounded defeated.</p><p>He stood, glancing at the door, then back at Julia. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t want to talk to me. But I hope you\u2019ll give me one more conversation before you say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Julia straightened her shoulders. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say good-bye with a conversation. You said it by fucking me against a door.\u201d</p><p>He strode toward her quickly.</p><p>\u201cStop it. You know my opinion of that word. Never use it in reference to us again.\u201d</p><p>Here was the old Professor Emerson, simmering beneath Gabriel\u2019s chastened exterior. He\u2019d been soft with her, so she found his change in tone jarring. But she\u2019d been exposed to his ill temper before and discovered, at that moment, that it didn\u2019t really trouble her. So she ignored him and stood up, prepared to escort him out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget this.\u201d She picked up his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Julianne, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Paulina?\u201d</p><p>Her question hung in the air like an arrow, poised in flight.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering how often you saw her while you were gone.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel placed his phone in his pocket. \u201cI saw her once. I asked for her forgiveness and wished her well.\u201d His tone had the air of finality.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come out and ask the question, Julianne?\u201d His lips pressed into a thin, angry line. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me if I slept with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s answer was so swift, so vehement, Julia retreated slightly. He was righteously indignant, his fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should have been more specific. There are a lot of things a man and woman can do short of sleeping together.\u201d She raised her chin defiantly.</p><p>Gabriel glared, forcing himself to count to ten. It would not do for him to lose his temper now. Not when he had so far to go.</p><p>\u201cI realize that you and I have very different views of my departure, but I assure you, I didn\u2019t seek out other women.\u201d His expression grew gentle. \u201cI was alone with your pictures and my memories, Julianne. They were poor companions, but the only other companion I wanted was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there wasn\u2019t anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was faithful the entire time. I swear it, on Grace\u2019s memory.\u201d</p><p>His oath stunned them both, and as their eyes met she saw his sincerity. She closed her eyes. Relief began to well up inside her.</p><p>He took her hand, cradling it gently in his. \u201cThere are a lot of things I should have told you. I\u2019ll tell you now. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay here,\u201d she whispered, her voice taking on an eerie sound in the flickering darkness.</p><p>\u201cThe Julianne I remembered hated the dark.\u201d He released her hand. \u201cPaulina is in Minnesota. She reconciled with her family and met someone. We agreed that I would no longer be supporting her, and she wished us well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wished you well,\u201d Julia muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, she wished us well. Don\u2019t you see? She assumed we were still together and I didn\u2019t tell her otherwise. In my mind, you and I were still together.\u201d</p><p>This was Gabriel\u2019s own arrow, pointed back at her. He hadn\u2019t told Paulina that he was single, because in his mind, he wasn\u2019t. The realization washed over her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201d His voice was the soul of sincerity.</p><p>She averted her eyes. \u201cWhat were you doing in front of a closed coffee shop in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was working up the courage to ring your doorbell.\u201d Gabriel began twisting the platinum band on his left hand. \u201cI had to convince Rachel to give me your address. She was understandably hesitant.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes dropped to his left hand. \u201cWhy are you wearing a wedding ring?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d He pulled off the ring and held it out to her.</p><p>She recoiled.</p><p>\u201cRead the inscription,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Hesitantly, she took the ring and held it up to one of the candles. Julianne\u2014my Beloved is mine and I am hers.</p> <p>A sick feeling entered her stomach, and she quickly returned it to him. He replaced it on his left hand without a word.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing a ring with my name on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that you didn\u2019t want to talk.\u201d His voice was gently reproving. \u201cIf you\u2019re allowed to ask me questions, can I ask about Paul?\u201d</p><p>She blushed and looked away. \u201cHe was there to pick up the pieces.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes. He was perilously close to giving in to his temper and saying something cutting, but that would only succeed in pushing her further away.</p> <p>He opened his eyes. \u201cForgive me. This ring has a mate, smaller in size. I purchased them at Tiffany in Toronto on the day I bought the silver frame for Maia\u2019s picture.</p><p>\u201cI still think of you as my other half. My bashert. Despite what happened, there was never any question of me pursuing someone else. I have been faithful to you since you told me who you were, back in October.\u201d</p><p>Julia suddenly found it very difficult to speak. \u201cGabriel\u2014these past few months, without a word, then tonight...\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with compassion, his arms aching to hold her. But she was too far away. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to have this conversation now. Just\u2014if you can stand it, please let me see you tomorrow.\u201d He gave her a look filled with longing.</p><p>She met his gaze briefly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled loudly. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll speak to you tomorrow, then. Rest well.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, opening the door.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d</p><p>He stood in front of her, far too close. She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cWill you\u2014let me kiss your hand?\u201d His voice was wistful and small, like a young boy.</p><p>She waited for him to kiss the back of her hand, then without thinking she reached up and pressed her lips to his forehead. Suddenly, his arms were around her back, pulling her flush against him.</p><p>Although he had trouble thinking of anything other than Julianne when he was kissing her, Gabriel focused his attention on trying to communicate with lips and mouth that he hadn\u2019t betrayed her. That he loved her.</p><p>When she kissed him back with equal passion, he moaned.</p><p>He made sure to be gentle, if not intense, and as her own movements slowed, he began to nibble slightly at the fullness of her lower lip, before pressing closed mouthed kisses to both cheeks and finally, the end of her nose.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes he saw a flood of emotions pass over Julia\u2019s pretty face.</p><p>He ran his fingers through her damp hair, once, twice, and gazed down at her longingly. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She was silent as he walked through the door.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s kiss did nothing to strengthen Julia\u2019s resolve, but she would not consider it a mistake. She\u2019d been curious about what it would be like to kiss him again and was surprised at how familiar it was. In mere seconds he succeeded in causing her pulse to race and her throat to constrict.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny that he loved her. She\u2019d felt it. Even Gabriel, with his polished manners and charm, couldn\u2019t lie with his kiss.</p><p>There was something different about him. He seemed softer, somehow, more vulnerable. Yes, there was the occasional show of temper and the old Professor Emerson, but she knew that Gabriel had changed. She just didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>By the following morning the power had been restored and Julia was able to recharge her phone. She called the manager at Peet\u2019s and explained that she was under the weather and would be taking the weekend off. He wasn\u2019t happy about it since it was the fourth of July weekend, but there was little he could do.</p><p>After a long hot shower, (a shower spent dreaming about Gabriel\u2019s lips and old, suppressed memories of the two of them together), Julia felt much, much better. And only a little worse. She sent a quick email to Rachel, explaining that Gabriel had returned and declared his love for her. An hour later, her phone rang. She expected that it would be Rachel. Surprisingly, it was Dante Alighieri.</p><p>\u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d Gabriel sounded cheerful.</p><p>\u201cWell. And you?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cNot as well as I used to\u2014tolerably, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. This was the Professor Emerson she remembered.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you my house,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, if you\u2019re willing.\u201d He sounded worried she might refuse.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on Foster Place, near Longfellow\u2019s house. Ideal for a commute to Harvard. Not so convenient for BU.\u201d</p><p>Julia was puzzled. \u201cIf it\u2019s inconvenient for BU, then why did you buy it?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat. \u201cI was thinking that\u2014I was hoping that...\u201d He struggled to find the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s small but it has a beautiful garden. I\u2019d like to know what you think of it.\u201d He cleared his throat again, and she swore she could hear him tugging at his shirt collar. \u201cOf course, I could always move.\u201d</p><p>She hummed in response, not sure what to say.</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve had a good night\u2019s sleep, will you talk to me a little?\u201d</p><p>Julia had never heard Gabriel sound so nervous. \u201cOf course. But it isn\u2019t something we can do over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to pay a visit to campus to see my new office. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d Now Gabriel\u2019s voice was heated.</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cI could come over later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for dinner. I\u2019ll pick you up at six thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a cab.\u201d</p><p>Julia broke the awkward pause that followed with an explanation that she needed to go.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said Gabriel stiffly. \u201cIf you wish to take a cab, that\u2019s your prerogative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep an open mind until we talk, and I\u2019d like to ask you to do that too.\u201d Her tone was conciliatory.</p><p>Gabriel felt as if he were hanging on to his hopes by a very thin thread. He was far from certain that she would take him back. And even if she did, the old specter of jealously taunted him. He didn\u2019t know how he would react if she revealed that she\u2019d turned to Paul in her grief and shared his bed.</p><p>God damned Angelfucker.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gabriel said, his voice strained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you called me. Why didn\u2019t you call me while you were away?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone, wondering what his story would include.</p><p>When Julia arrived at Gabriel\u2019s new home, she surveyed it with no little puzzlement. It was a two-story frame house with a simple, unadorned front, and it was painted a charcoal gray with darker trim. There was almost no front yard to speak of and a small, paved car pad to the house\u2019s right.</p><p>In an email that included directions, Gabriel had sent Julia a link to the original real estate listing for the property. The asking price had been over a million dollars. The house had been built prior to World War II. In fact, the entire street had been a neighborhood of Italian immigrants who built the small, two bedroom houses in the nineteen twenties. Now the street was populated with old-moneyed yuppies, Harvard professors, and Gabriel.</p><p>As she took in the tidy simplicity of the building, Julia shook her head. So this is what a million dollars can buy you in Harvard Square.</p><p>As she prepared to knock on the front door, she was surprised to find a note on it in Gabriel\u2019s hand.</p><p>Julianne,</p><p>Please meet me in the garden.</p><p>G.</p><p>She sighed, and just like that she knew that tonight was going to be very, very difficult. She walked around the side of the house and down the little paved driveway, gasping when she rounded the corner.</p><p>There were flowers and greenery, wisps of sea grass and elegantly trimmed boxwood, and in the very center of the garden stood what looked like a Sultan\u2019s tent. A fountain sat on the right side of the green space, featuring a marble statue of Venus. Underneath the fountain was a small pond filled with white and red Koi.</p><p>Julia walked toward the tent so she could peer inside. And what she saw pained her.</p><p>In the tent was a low, square bed, exactly like the futon that graced the terrace of the suite she\u2019d shared with Gabriel in Florence. In the suite where they\u2019d made love for the first time. On the terrace where he fed her chocolates and strawberries and danced with her to Diana Krall under the Tuscan sky. The futon where he made love to her the following morning. Gabriel had tried to reproduce the ambience of that terrace down to the very color scheme of the bedclothes.</p><p>The voice of Frank Sinatra seemed to float from somewhere closer to the house, while almost every flat, fireproof surface held a tall, pillar candle. Ornate Moroccan lanterns were suspended from crisscrossed wires overhead.</p><p>It was a fairy tale. It was Florence, and their apple orchard, and the wonders of an Arabian night. Unfortunately for Gabriel, the extravagant gesture begged the question: if he was resourceful enough to construct a Moroccan caravan in his garden, why couldn\u2019t he have told her he planned to return?</p><p>Gabriel saw her standing in his garden, and his heart leapt. He wanted to pull her into his arms and press their lips together. But he could see from the set of her shoulders and the stiffness of her spine that such an act would be unwelcome. So he approached her carefully.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Julianne.\u201d A silky voice caressed her ear as Gabriel leaned in from behind her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard him approach, so she shivered slightly. He rubbed one arm and then the other, up and down, in an act that was supposed to be comforting but in reality caused a deep erotic flush to dance across the surface of her skin.</p><p>\u201cI like the music,\u201d she said, pulling away from him.</p><p>He extended his palm as an invitation. Cautiously, she placed her hand in his. He pressed an unhurried kiss to her knuckles before releasing her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stunning, as always.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes slowly drank in the sight of Julia in her plain black dress, her pale, shapely legs in a pair of black ballet flats, and the way the gentle whisper of wind blew a few strands of hair across her glossy, reddish lips as she turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She waited for him to comment on her shoes, for his eyes rested on them a little longer than was polite. She\u2019d worn the flats because they were comfortable and because she wished to assert her independence. She knew he wouldn\u2019t like them. Surprisingly, however, he smiled.</p><p>Gabriel was a little more casually dressed in a white linen shirt and khaki pants, with a navy linen jacket. His smile was perhaps his most decorative asset.</p><p>\u201cThe tent is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it please you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou always ask me that.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile faded slightly, but he resisted the urge to frown. \u201cYou used to like the fact that I am a considerate lover.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their eyes met and Julia looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely gesture, but I would rather have had a letter from you or a telephone call three months ago.\u201d</p><p>It appeared as if he wanted to argue with her, but in an instant his expression changed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my manners,\u201d he muttered. He offered his elbow, escorting her to a small bistro table that was set up in a corner of the stone patio.</p><p>Small white lights shone down on the patio from the branches of an obliging maple. Julia wondered if Gabriel had hired an exterior decorator just for the occasion. He pulled out her chair, and when she was seated, gently eased it closer to the table. She noticed that the centerpiece on the table was filled with orange and red gerbera daisies.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you manage all of this?\u201d Julia unfolded her napkin and placed it in her lap.</p><p>\u201cRebecca is a wonder of New England industriousness.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave him a questioning look, but her question was soon answered when Gabriel\u2019s housekeeper served dinner. Rebecca was tall and plain and wore her salt and pepper hair in a short bob. Her eyes, which were large and dark, sparkled with amusement. Julia divined quickly that Gabriel had taken Rebecca into part of his confidence, at least as far as this evening was concerned.</p><p>Despite the elaborate d\u00e9cor and the perfect music, dinner was a simple affair by Gabriel\u2019s standards: lobster bisque; a pear, walnut, and Gorgonzola salad; steamed mussels with frites; and then finally and most gloriously, a blueberry tart with sour lemon ice cream. Gabriel served her champagne, the same Veuve Clicquot he\u2019d served the first time she dined at his apartment. That evening seemed so long ago, even though it was less than a year.</p><p>They made small talk during their meal, discussing Rachel\u2019s wedding and Scott\u2019s girlfriend and her son. Gabriel described the things he liked about his house and those he didn\u2019t, promising Julia a tour. Neither of them were in a hurry to begin discussing the events leading up to their separation.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t drinking?\u201d She noticed that he\u2019d imbibed only Perrier with his meal.</p><p>\u201cI quit.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was drinking too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you were with me. You pledged not to get drunk anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She looked at him carefully, at the way his eyes indicated there was a very unpleasant experience behind his words. \u201cBut you enjoyed drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an addictive personality, Julianne. You know this.\u201d He smoothly changed the subject to something more pleasant.</p><p>When Rebecca served dessert, he and Julia exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cNo chocolate cake tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, mon ange,\u201d Gabriel breathed. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d love nothing more than to feed you again.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her cheeks grow red, and she knew it would be a poor decision to go down that road with him before they had their conversation, but as he gazed at her with undisguised passion, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said, quietly.</p><p>Gabriel smiled as if the sun had just returned to the sky after a protracted absence and quickly shifted his chair so he was seated next to her. Close. Very close. So close that she could feel his warm breath on her neck, which goose pimpled in anticipation.</p> <p>Gabriel picked up Julia\u2019s dessert fork and placed some pie and ice cream on it and turned to face her.</p><p>As she gazed at him with longing, his breath caught in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She looked at him in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten how lovely you are.\u201d He traced the curve of her cheekbone with his unencumbered hand and brought the fork to her lips.</p><p>She closed her eyes and opened her mouth, and at that moment, Gabriel\u2019s heart soared. Yes, it was a little thing\u2014almost inconsequential if one were to consider what tales to tell a confidante. But Julia didn\u2019t trust quickly or easily. The ease with which she made herself vulnerable to him made his heart beat quick and his blood pump fast.</p><p>She hummed at the mixture of flavors, opening her eyes.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself. He leaned closer so their mouths were parted by mere inches and whispered, \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and he pressed his lips to hers. She was sweetness and light, gentleness and goodness, and the burning and searing goal of all of his earthly hunts and fascinations. But she didn\u2019t belong to him. So he kissed her gently, like he first kissed her in the orchard, with both hands tangling in her long, curled hair. Then he pulled back to watch her face.</p><p>A contented sigh escaped her ruby lips as she sat with eyes closed, floating.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Now her eyes were open. Her expression reflected an unnamed emotion, but she didn\u2019t say it back.</p><p>When dessert was well and truly over, Gabriel suggested they take their espressos to the tent, dismissing Rebecca for the evening. Night had fallen on this little patch of Eden, and like Adam himself, Gabriel led a blushing Eve to his bower.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes and curled up on the futon against the cushions, nervously chewing her fingernails while Gabriel lit the candles in the Moroccan lanterns. He took his time, adjusting them so their light flickered over the futon seductively. Then he lit the other candles that were scattered throughout the tent. Finally, he lay on his back next to her, hands behind his head, angled so he could see her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk about what happened,\u201d she initiated.</p><p>Gabriel gave her his full attention.</p><p>\u201cWhen you showed up outside my apartment I didn\u2019t know whether to hit you or kiss you.\u201d Her voice was low.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never your nature to be vindictive. Or cruel.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and began. She told him how it broke her heart to have left message after message with him, only to have them unacknowledged. She told him about her surprise at finding his apartment abandoned. She told him about the kindness of his neighbor, and Paul, and Katherine Picton. She spoke of her continued sessions with Nicole.</p><p>Julia was too busy fussing with her espresso to notice how unsettled he\u2019d become. When she mentioned how the textbook he\u2019d passed to her had ended up on her shelf unopened, Gabriel cursed Paul.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to curse him.\u201d Her tone was sharp. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault that you put your message in a textbook. Why didn\u2019t you choose a volume out of your personal library? I might have recognized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been ordered to stay away from you. If I\u2019d put a volume from my library in your mailbox, Jeremy would have noticed it. As it was, I chose a textbook and I placed it in your mailbox after hours.\u201d He huffed in frustration. \u201cDidn\u2019t the title mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe title of the textbook: Marriage in the Middle Ages: Love, Sex, and the Sacred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should it have meant, Gabriel? For all I knew, you\u2019d labeled me as your H\u00e9loise and left me. I didn\u2019t have any reason to think otherwise and you didn\u2019t leave me with one.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, eyes flashing. \u201cThe textbook was the reason. The title, the photo from the orchard, the image of St. Francis trying to save Guido da Montefeltro...\u201d His voice cracked, and he paused, in agony. \u201cDidn\u2019t you remember our conversation in Belize? I told you I\u2019d go to Hell to save you. And believe me, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d sent me messages. I overlooked the textbook because I didn\u2019t know it was from you. Why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI was told that the Dean would interview you prior to your graduation and that he would ask if you\u2019d heard from me. You\u2019re a lovely woman, Julianne, but a terrible liar. I had to send messages in code.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s surprise registered immediately on her face. \u201cYou knew about the interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew about a great many things,\u201d he said stoically. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t tell. That\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel told me not to despair.\u201d She captured his gaze for a moment. \u201cBut I needed to hear those words from you. Our last night together, you had sex with me, but you wouldn\u2019t talk to me. What was I supposed to think?\u201d</p><p>Tears overflowed her eyes. But before she could wipe them away with her hand, Gabriel\u2019s tugged her from her safe corner into his outstretched arms. He pressed her to his chest and kissed her head, before wrapping his arms around her back.</p><p>Somehow, the feel of his arms around her made her cry harder. He squeezed her gently.</p><p>\u201cMy pride was my downfall. I thought I could court you while you were my student and get away with it. I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you chose your job instead of me.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was filled with hurt. \u201cWhen I discovered you\u2019d moved out of your apartment...Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Julianne. My goal was not to hurt you, I promise. I regret everything that you described.\u201d He kissed her forehead once again. \u201cI need to tell you what happened. It\u2019s a long story. And only you can tell me how it ends...\u201d</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>Julia pulled away so she could see his face better, bracing herself for what was to come. Her sudden movement seemed to cause the scent of her hair to waft over to him.</p><p>\u201cYour hair is different,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cA little longer, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell of vanilla anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my shampoo.\u201d She sounded curt.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gabriel shifted his body to eliminate the gap between them.</p><p>\u201cBecause it reminded me of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you aren\u2019t wearing your earrings?\u201d he asked, fingering her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He paused and gazed at her, his hurt evident.</p><p>She looked away.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Julianne. No matter what you think of me or what I did, I promise that I was only trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>She moved to lie on her side, careful not to touch him.</p><p>\u201cI am your faithful one, Beatrice,\u201d Gabriel quoted, his eyes brimming with emotion. \u201cPlease remember that when I tell you what happened.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and said a silent prayer before beginning his story.</p><p>\u201cWhen you and I appeared before the hearing officers, my hope was that we would say very little and force them to show what evidence they had. But it became clear that they weren\u2019t going to rest until they\u2019d laid charges and punished us.</p><p>\u201cI screwed up when I submitted Katherine\u2019s grade for your work to the Registrar. Since the administration was worried you\u2019d been awarded the grade because you were sleeping with me, they were going to suspend your grade while they investigated further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a provision listed in the policies governing academic behavior. As long as the grade was incomplete, you wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia blinked at Gabriel as understanding washed over her. \u201cNo Harvard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo Harvard this year and probably no Harvard ever, since they would have been suspicious as to why the University of Toronto was suspending your grade. Even if Harvard never learned the reason, they have so many applications. Why should they give you a second thought when they could admit someone with a spotless record?\u201d</p><p>Julia sat very still, the weight of his words pressing down on her.</p><p>Gabriel scratched at his chin in agitation. \u201cI was afraid the hearing officers were going to ruin your future. But it was my fault. I\u2019m the one who persuaded you that it was safe to get involved with me; I\u2019m the one who invited you to Italy. I should have waited. My selfishness is what led to all this.\u201d</p> <p>He gazed into her eyes and lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined our last night together. I should have talked to you. But all I could think about was how worried I was. I never should have treated you the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt so alone the next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the worst way for me to deal with my anxiety. But I hope that you believe me when I tell you that it wasn\u2019t just a...\u201d He paused, stumbling. \u201cA fuck to me. Every time we were together it was always, always done with love. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Julia dropped her gaze to the futon. \u201cFor me too. There\u2019s never been anyone else, before or since.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for an instant, relief coursing through him. Even though she\u2019d felt angry and betrayed, she hadn\u2019t followed her anger to another man\u2019s arms. She hadn\u2019t given up on him completely.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cWhen you confessed to our relationship and I saw the Dean\u2019s reaction, I knew we were caught. My lawyer was prepared to stonewall, hoping that the committee would excuse me or hand down a ruling that I could challenge in court. But when you confessed, you provided the corroboration the committee needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had an agreement to show a united front. An agreement, Gabriel.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice grew heated.</p><p>\u201cI acquiesced to you in good faith, Julianne. But I also promised that I wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to hurt you or to end your career. That promise takes precedence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn agreement is a promise.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned forward. \u201cThey were threatening your future. Did you really expect me to sit there and watch it happen?\u201d</p> <p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he challenged her. \u201cDid you sit there and say nothing when they told you they were pursuing charges against me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew to his. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t. I pleaded with them. They wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d His blue eyes bored into hers. \u201cFrom whom do you think I learned about self-sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not bothering to contradict him. \u201cIf we broke the rules, then why didn\u2019t the Dean try to punish both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the professor; I should have known better. And Professor Chakravartty was on your side from the very beginning. She doesn\u2019t think professor-student relationships can be consensual. And sadly for us, they found that old email of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was my fault.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gently leaned over and brushed the back of his hand against her cheek. \u201cNo. I persuaded you that we could break the rules and get away with it. And then, instead of taking responsibility for my actions, I sat there behind my lawyer. You were the only one brave enough to tell the truth. And once you did, I had to confess.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to accept their sanctions if they brought the investigation to a speedy conclusion. The hearing officers were only too glad to dispose of the matter without a lawsuit and they agreed, promising leniency.\u201d</p> <p>Julia wore a pained expression.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, their definition of lenience and mine were two different things. I expected to be censured, not forced to take a leave of absence.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed at his face with his hands. \u201cJeremy was furious at the prospect of losing me, even for a semester. I\u2019d caused a scandal that would embarrass not only him but my colleagues and the other students in the department. Christa was filing a lawsuit against the university too. It was a huge mess, and I was at the root of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were at the root of it, Gabriel. I knew the rules, and I broke them too.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half-smile. \u201cThe rules are written in such a way as to excuse the student because the professor is the one with the power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only power you had over me was love.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her softly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s heart was full, almost to the brim. She hadn\u2019t looked back at their time together and viewed him the way the hearing officers did. She hadn\u2019t recoiled when he kissed her. In fact, her lips had welcomed him. She gave him hope that by the end of his story, she\u2019d still be at his side.</p><p>\u201cWhen they brought Jeremy in, I begged him to help us. I promised I\u2019d do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Julia asked.</p><p>He shifted again. \u201cI had no idea he was going to side with the hearing officers and demand that I cease all contact with you. It was a rash promise made in a fit of desperation.\u201d</p><p>Julia moved away from him. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe persuaded the committee to place me on administrative leave. It was effectively a suspension, but they didn\u2019t call it that in order to avoid tainting the department. I was also prohibited from supervising female graduate students for a term of three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together. \u201cI was told to end things with you immediately and cease all contact. They said if I violated this condition, the agreement would be void and they would re-open the investigation, into both of us.\u201d He paused, seemingly struggling for words.</p><p>\u201cIf they thought I was a victim, why would they threaten to investigate me again?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s blue eyes cooled. \u201cThe Dean suspected you were telling the truth\u2014that our relationship was consensual and that I was trying to save your reputation. He wasn\u2019t about to let us go off into the sunset together. That\u2019s why I sent you the email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat email was cruel.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows knitted together. \u201cI know. But since I was sending it from my university account to your university account, I assumed you\u2019d realize it was all for show. Have I ever spoken to you like that before?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a challenging look.</p><p>He winced. \u201cI mean, have I spoken to you like that since I realized who you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the university really demand that you stop talking to me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cThey did. The threat of Christa\u2019s lawsuit was hanging over all of us. Jeremy seemed to think that if I took a leave of absence that he could convince Christa to drop the lawsuit. And he did. But once again, he said that if he found out I was still seeing you, he wouldn\u2019t lift a finger to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s blackmail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s academia. Christa\u2019s lawsuit would have damaged the department, possibly irreparably. Jeremy would have lost the ability to recruit top faculty and students because people would hear that it wasn\u2019t a safe place to be. I didn\u2019t want to be embroiled in a scandal any more than he did, and I certainly didn\u2019t want you hauled into a courtroom as a witness.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat, clearly struggling. \u201cI agreed. Jeremy and the Dean made it clear that they would interview you at the end of the semester to see if I\u2019d kept my promise. I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>Julia toyed with the folds of her dress. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? Why didn\u2019t you demand a recess so you could explain what was happening? We were a couple, Gabriel. We were supposed to work together.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed thickly. \u201cWhat would have happened if I\u2019d taken you aside and explained what I was about to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have let you go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I wasn\u2019t going to allow you to lose everything because of my failures. I couldn\u2019t live with that. I only hoped that you would forgive me\u2014someday.\u201d</p><p>Julia was stunned.</p><p>\u201cYou were willing to risk everything to save me, thinking that I might not forgive you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her eyes grow teary, and she swiped at them blindly. \u201cI wish you could have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I, but I promised Jeremy that I\u2019d stay away. Before he entered the hallway, I tried to speak to you, but John and Soraya kept interrupting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201cIf I\u2019d told you it was only temporary, they would have realized from your expression. They would have known I had no intention of following through on my promise. I\u2019d given my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you planned to break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did.\u201d He was quiet again for a moment, looking off into the distance.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense, Gabriel. You made all kinds of promises to them, but you broke them. You put the textbook in my box, you wrote me a message...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI planned to do more. I was going to email you, saying that it was only until the end of the semester. Once you\u2019d graduated and I\u2019d resigned, we would renew our relationship. That is, if you still wanted me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cI knew you would be watched. And that the Dean would interview you to find out if I\u2019d kept my promise. I worried about your ability to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d said Julia fiercely. \u201cYou could have sent me an email and explained that I needed to pretend to be heartbroken. I\u2019m not a great actress, but I can act a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were other\u2014factors.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cWhen I fell, you looked at me as if you hated me. You looked disgusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, please.\u201d He grabbed her hand and pulled her to his chest. \u201cThat look was not meant for you. Any disgust I felt was directed at the hearing and myself. That look was not meant for you, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Julia shed more than a few tears at that moment, the consequence of shock and anxiety and a measure of relief at having her questions answered. But some of the most important questions remained.</p><p>\u201cI hate that I\u2019ve made you cry again,\u201d Gabriel said ruefully, running a hand up and down her back to comfort her.</p><p>Julia wiped her eyes. \u201cI need to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay with me tonight.\u201d He glanced down at her cautiously.</p><p>She was conflicted. Staying with him could possibly undercut all the things she had yet to say, but running back to her cold, dark apartment seemed cowardly. As always, she knew that once she allowed herself to curl into his side, her body and heart would drag her mind along with them.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d She sighed in defeat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t bring myself to leave right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay\u2014in my arms.\u201d He kissed her forehead, murmuring his love against her skin.</p><p>Slowly, he extricated himself from her embrace and retrieved a couple of blankets, pausing to blow out the candles as he did so. He left the tea lights lit in the Moroccan lamps overhead, admiring the play of light and color against the walls of the tent. The very air shimmered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They made a nest together in the center of the futon. Gabriel lay on his back with his beloved at his side. He did nothing to stifle the deep sigh of contentment that escaped his lips as he wrapped his arm about her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He stroked her hair slowly, reveling in the feel of the silkiness of the strands as they slipped through his fingers. He tried to savor her new, unfamiliar scent but found himself mourning the loss of the old one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014missed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He squeezed her tightly as a feeling of cautious relief coursed through him.</p><p>\u201cI used to lie awake at night, wishing you were with me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes watered at the sound of her vulnerability and her courage. If he ever had a moment\u2019s doubt that he would love and admire her forever, no matter whether she chose him or not, that doubt faded away like a wisp of smoke.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She hummed to herself and within minutes, the two weary, former lovers were sound asleep.</p> <p>Chapter 46</p><p>Julia opened her eyes and saw bright July sunlight streaming in through the open door of the tent. She was curled up under two cashmere blankets that had been lovingly tucked around her. She was alone. Were it not for the fact that she knew that the tent belonged to Gabriel, she would have thought that she\u2019d dreamed the previous evening. Or that she\u2019d woken up to a new dream.</p><p>As she got out of bed, she found a note next to her pillow.</p><p>Darling,</p><p>You were sleeping so peacefully that I didn\u2019t want to disturb you. I\u2019ll ask Rebecca to make waffles for breakfast because I know you like them. Falling asleep in your arms again reminded me that I was only half a person in your absence.</p><p>You make me whole.</p> <p>With love,</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t deny the fact that a variety of emotions came upon her as she read the note, like a symphony of different instruments. Perhaps the most dominant feeling was that of relief.</p><p>Gabriel loved her. Gabriel had returned.</p><p>But forgiveness and reconciliation were two different things, and she knew that although other forces had been at work to effect their separation, she and Gabriel each bore responsibility for the situation in which they currently found themselves. Julia didn\u2019t want to run back into his arms only to escape the pain of their separation; that would be like taking a pill to kill a pain without investigating its root causes.</p><p>She found her shoes and slowly walked across the garden, retrieving her purse before entering the back door. Rebecca was already at work in the small kitchen, preparing breakfast.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She greeted Julia with a smile.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Julia motioned toward the staircase that led to the second floor. \u201cI was just going to use the bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca wiped her hands on her apron.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Gabriel is in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you knock on the door? He might be finished.\u201d</p><p>The thought of running into Gabriel, damp from the shower, wrapped in a towel, made Julia\u2019s skin grow pink.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ll wait. May I?\u201d She gestured to the kitchen sink and, with Rebecca\u2019s permission, proceeded to wash her hands. When they were dried, she removed a hair elastic from her purse and pulled her hair into a ponytail.</p><p>Rebecca invited her to sit down at the small, round kitchen table. \u201cThis house isn\u2019t very convenient with only one bathroom. I end up having to climb those stairs several times a day. Even my little house has two bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>Julia was surprised. \u201cI thought that you lived here.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca laughed as she retrieved a pitcher of freshly squeezed orange juice from the refrigerator. \u201cI live in Norwood. I used to live with my mother, but she passed away a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Julia gave Rebecca a sympathetic look as she poured orange juice into two wine glasses.</p><p>\u201cShe had Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Rebecca simply before returning to her cooking.</p><p>Julia watched as she plugged in an electric waffle maker and proceeded to wash and hull a basket of fresh strawberries and whip some cream. Gabriel had planned the breakfast well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an adjustment to keep house for a professor after looking after my mother. He\u2019s a bit particular, but I like that. Did you know that he\u2019s lending me books? I\u2019ve just started reading Jane Eyre. I\u2019ve never read it before. He says that as long as I keep cooking I can keep borrowing books. Finally, I have a chance to further my education and use everything I learned from years of watching the Food Network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lending you books from his personal library?\u201d Julia sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t that nice? I don\u2019t know the professor very well, but I\u2019m already fond of him. He reminds me of my son.\u201d</p><p>Julia sipped her orange juice and began to eat her breakfast, urged as she was not to wait for Gabriel\u2019s arrival.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he bought this house when the kitchen is so small and there\u2019s only one bathroom.\u201d She spoke between bites of a cinnamon flavored waffle.</p><p>Rebecca wore a knowing smile. \u201cHe wanted to live in Harvard Square, and he liked the garden. He said that it reminded him of his parents\u2019 place back home. He plans to renovate the house to make it more comfortable, but he refused to book a single contractor until you gave your approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy approval?\u201d Julia\u2019s fork clattered to the floor.</p><p>Rebecca efficiently handed her another one. \u201cHe might have said something about selling it if you didn\u2019t like it. Although given the language I heard coming from upstairs this morning, I think he has decided to begin his renovations immediately.\u201d</p><p>She passed a plate of crispy bacon to Julia. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed this, but the professor can be a little intense.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed loudly. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She was able to enjoy not one but two waffles before the sound of Gabriel and his Italian shoes came thumping down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he greeted her, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Acutely aware of Rebecca\u2019s presence, Gabriel and Julia made polite small talk for a moment or two before Julia excused herself to visit the bathroom.</p><p>With one look at her face and hair in the mirror, she realized that she needed to have a shower. And that\u2019s when she noticed a shopping bag placed neatly on the corner of the vanity.</p><p>Inside the bag she found bottles of her old brand of vanilla shampoo and shower gel, along with a new lavender-colored poof. Even more surprisingly, she found a pale yellow summer dress with a matching cardigan. It took a moment or two for her to overcome the sudden, almost overwhelming feeling that passed over her. But she swallowed it back and showered and dressed, making herself presentable.</p><p>She was grateful to have clean clothes to wear but slightly irritated at Gabriel\u2019s presumption. She wondered if she\u2019d find lingerie in her size hanging in his closet. She wondered if, when he moved the contents of his condo, he kept all the clothes and items she\u2019d left behind.</p><p>She swept her hair behind her ears. Grace\u2019s earrings were hidden in the back of her underwear drawer with a few other precious things, in her apartment. She knew that putting them away, although it seemed necessary when he left, had injured Gabriel deeply.</p><p>They\u2019d wounded each other, and both were in need of forgiveness and healing. But Julia couldn\u2019t decide what path would be the best one to take in order for her to mend. The obvious choices in life aren\u2019t always the correct ones.</p><p>When she finally came downstairs, Rebecca was cleaning up the kitchen and Gabriel was in the garden. She found him sitting in a chair under the shade of a large umbrella.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked, for his eyes were closed.</p><p>He opened his eyes and smiled. \u201cI am now. Join me?\u201d He extended his hand, and she took it, settling herself in the chair adjacent to him.</p><p>\u201cThat color suits you,\u201d he said, appraising her yellow dress with unconcealed delight.</p><p>\u201cThank you for going shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do today?\u201d</p><p>Julia tugged the hem of her dress to cover her knees. \u201cI think we should finish our conversation.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, silently renewing his prayer. He didn\u2019t want to lose her. And he knew that her reaction to the next part of his story might bring about just that.</p><p>\u201cI know you remember our conversation in the hallway, after the hearing. When John was rude to you, I wanted to break off his finger and feed it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you comprehend the depth of my feeling for you. It goes beyond wanting to be near you, or to protect you. I want you to be happy, and I want you to be treated you with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t break off people\u2019s fingers when they\u2019re rude to me.\u201d</p><p>He made a show of stroking his chin thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose not. What can I do? Strike them with the collected works of Shakespeare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one sturdy volume? Of course.\u201d</p><p>They shared a laugh before falling silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to communicate what had happened behind closed doors, but I was ordered not to talk to you. That\u2019s why I spoke in code. Except I stupidly quoted Abelard, forgetting that you and I had different interpretations of his relationship with H\u00e9loise. I should have quoted Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, anyone.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou were so angry. You accused me of fucking you. Julianne...\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice broke as he pronounced her name. \u201cDid you really think so lowly of me? To think that was how I would choose to say good-bye?\u201d</p><p>Julia looked away, avoiding the intensity of his gaze. \u201cWhat was I supposed to think? You wouldn\u2019t talk to me. You left the next morning without leaving a note. And then at the hearing, suddenly it was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t trust myself to speak with words. When I made love to you, I thought you understood what I was trying to say\u2014that we\u2019re one. That we\u2019ve always been one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were talking about our conversation in the hallway after the hearing,\u201d she prompted, eager to change the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they could have forced you to leave the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t, really. Jeremy simply wanted my word that I\u2019d stop seeing you.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms in front of her. \u201cThen why did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy discovered I broke my promise before we exited the building. He demanded I break things off with you and swear on my honor that I would stay away from you. I\u2019d already told him I\u2019d do anything if he helped us. I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>Julia thought back to her exit interview with the Dean and Professor Martin, just before graduation. \u201cWhy did Jeremy think you broke your promise? You wouldn\u2019t talk to me or answer my messages. You sent me an email telling me it was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d read between the lines and realize it was just for the administration. I\u2019d sent you another email before that from my Gmail account, saying it was only temporary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He retrieved his phone. Scrolling through a few screens, he settled on something. Then he fixed distressed and haunted eyes on hers.</p><p>\u201cAfter the hearing, I ducked into the men\u2019s room and quickly sent you an email.\u201d He gently took her hand. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, giving her the phone.</p><p>Julia quickly glanced at the screen.</p> <p>Beatrice, I love you. Never doubt that. Trust me, please. G.</p><p>She blinked several times, trying to assimilate what she saw typed in black and white with what she\u2019d experienced. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t receive this.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave her a tortured expression. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the screen again and saw that the date and time of the email corresponded with Gabriel\u2019s story. But the addressee of the email was not her. In fact, the actual recipient was someone entirely different.</p><p>J.H. Martin.</p> <p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened as the magnitude of Gabriel\u2019s error suddenly became very, very clear. Instead of sending the email to Julianne H. Mitchell, he\u2019d sent it to Jeremy H. Martin, the Chair of the Department of Italian Studies.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He plucked the phone from her hand, muttering curses. \u201cEvery time I tried to do something for you, it backfired. I tried to save you, and the hearing officers were suspicious. I tried to give you a clue in conversation, and I made you feel like I\u2019d abandoned you. I tried to email you, and I sent the email to the very person who\u2019d forbidden me to contact you. Honestly, Julia, were it not for the fact that I hoped that someday we would be having this conversation, I would have stepped out into rush hour traffic on Bloor Street and ended it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that. Don\u2019t even think it.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s sudden show of fierceness pleased him, but he found himself back-pedaling quickly. \u201cLosing you was a low point for me. But suicide isn\u2019t an option I\u2019d entertain again.\u201d He gave her a look that seemed to signify much more than he could say at that moment.</p><p>\u201cJeremy was furious. He\u2019d put his career and his department on the line to help me and I\u2019d gone behind his back two minutes later. Now he had proof, in writing, that I was breaking my agreement with the committee. I had no choice but to do whatever he said. If he sent my email to the Dean, the repercussions would have been devastating for both of us.\u201d</p> <p>At that moment, Gabriel and Julia were interrupted by Rebecca, who joined them on the patio, carrying a pitcher of homemade lemonade garnished with a few frozen raspberries that floated delicately in the cloud of yellow. She served their drinks with an encouraging smile and vanished back into the house.</p><p>Gabriel drank greedily, enjoying his reprieve.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d prompted Julia, sipping her lemonade.</p><p>\u201cJeremy told me to stay away from you. I had no choice. He held Damocles\u2019s sword in his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe let you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a handshake and a promise.\u201d Gabriel grimaced as the memory of that dreadful conversation haunted him. \u201cHe showed me mercy. Then more than ever I felt obligated to keep my word. I resolved not to contact you directly until you were already assured your place at Harvard.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head stubbornly. \u201cBut what about me, Gabriel? You made a lot of promises to me. Didn\u2019t you think about keeping them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Before I left Toronto, I put the textbook in your mailbox. I thought you\u2019d find the passage in Abelard\u2019s letter and read what I wrote on the back of the photograph.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it was from you. I didn\u2019t even look at it until the night you came to see me. That\u2019s why I was running outside. I didn\u2019t have an internet connection in my apartment and I wanted to email you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You have to understand that I thought you\u2019d had enough of me. That you\u2019d decided I wasn\u2019t worth the trouble.\u201d Tears sprang to Julia\u2019s dark eyes, and she brushed them aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one in this relationship who was never worth the trouble. I knew I\u2019d put myself in a situation in which I was careless with your heart. But it wasn\u2019t done to hurt you. It was pride and bad judgment and mistake after mistake.\u201d He looked down at his hands and began to turn the wedding ring around his finger.</p><p>\u201cKatherine Picton tried to help me. She said she\u2019d see that the university left you alone during my absence and that she would do everything she could to help you graduate on time. She mentioned that an old friend of hers had left the Department of Romance Studies at Boston University in order to take a position at UCLA. She wanted my permission to nominate me as his replacement. I asked her to go ahead.</p><p>\u201cI interviewed for the position, and while I waited for their decision, I went to Italy. I had to do something to shake myself out of my depression before I did something I would regret.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s stomach suddenly tightened. \u201cSomething you would regret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot women. The mere idea of being with someone else made me sick. I was more worried about other\u2014vices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you go any further, I need to tell you something.\u201d Her voice was stronger and more determined than the will behind it.</p><p>Gabriel began to watch her carefully, wondering what in the world she was about to reveal.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you that my relationship with Paul didn\u2019t go beyond friendship, what I said was true. Technically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows flew up and his voice lowered to a growl.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted more. He told me he loved me. And we\u2014kissed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was silent for a moment or two, and Julia watched as his knuckles whitened.</p><p>\u201cIs Paul who you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a friend to me when I needed one. But I never had romantic feelings for him. I think you know this already, but you ruined me for other men when I was seventeen.\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cBut you kissed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Julia leaned over and with a gentle hand, brushed a lock of hair away from Gabriel\u2019s forehead. \u201cBut that\u2019s all. I had no idea you were coming back to me, but I still turned him down.\u201d She withdrew her hand. \u201cNot because I wouldn\u2019t have had a good life with him. But because he wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that distressed him.\u201d Gabriel sounded sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cI broke his heart,\u201d said Julia, her shoulders hunching. \u201cAnd I took no pleasure in doing so.\u201d</p><p>The sight of Julia\u2019s obvious discomfort tugged at him, but he couldn\u2019t disguise the relief at her admission that he had no rivals in her affection. He squeezed her shoulder before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI was worried that if we had any contact and Paul found out about it, he\u2019d run and tell Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have done that. He was good to me, even after I broke his heart.\u201d Julia smoothed imaginary wrinkles out of her yellow dress. \u201cI know you said you were faithful, and I\u2019m not questioning you on that. But did anyone\u2014kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cI\u2019d make a good Dominican or Jesuit, don\u2019t you think? With my new virtue of celibacy? Although I discovered during our separation that I don\u2019t have the disposition to be a Franciscan.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave him a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a story for another day.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand in affection and withdrew it, silently willing him to finish his story.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t offered the position at BU, I was going to resign my job in Toronto. All I had to do was keep myself together until after graduation.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to feel close to you, to remember a happier time, so I went to Italy. Truthfully, Julianne, those days with you in Florence and Umbria were the happiest days of my life.\u201d He averted his eyes. \u201cI even went to Assisi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo become a Franciscan?\u201d She smirked.</p><p>\u201cHardly. I visited the Basilica and I thought I saw you.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her hesitantly, wondering if she would think that he was disturbed. \u201cYour doppelg\u00e4nger led me to the lower church and down to the crypt, to the tomb of St. Francis.</p><p>\u201cAt first, I stared at the young woman, wishing she was you. Wishing I hadn\u2019t made so many mistakes. I was confronted by my own failures. My sin. I\u2019d made an idol of you. I\u2019d worshipped you, like a pagan. Then when I lost you, I was in danger of losing everything. I told myself I needed you to save me, that I was nothing without you.</p><p>\u201cI began to see how I\u2019d been given chance after chance. Through no goodness of my own, I\u2019d been given grace and love. And I\u2019d thrown it away or treated it cheaply. I didn\u2019t deserve the family who adopted me. I didn\u2019t deserve Maia, who was the best part of my relationship with Paulina. I didn\u2019t deserve to survive the drugs and graduate from Harvard. I didn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>He paused and brushed at his eyes again, but this time the moisture didn\u2019t abate.</p><p>\u201cGrace isn\u2019t something we deserve, Gabriel,\u201d Julia said softly. \u201cIt comes from love. And God wraps the world in second chances and sticky little leaves and mercy, even though some people don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of her hand. \u201cPrecisely.</p><p>\u201cIn the crypt of the Basilica, something happened. I realized you couldn\u2019t save me. And I found\u2014peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes we search for grace until it catches us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you not an angel?\u201d he breathed. \u201cWhatever happened to me, it made me want to be good. My experience caused me to focus on God, but also to love you more. I\u2019ve always been attracted to your goodness, Julianne. But I believe I love you more deeply now than before.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as her eyes suddenly blurred with salt water.</p><p>\u201cI should have told you that I loved you sooner. I should have asked you to marry me. I thought I knew what was best for you. I thought that we had all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>Julia tried to speak, but her voice caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me that it isn\u2019t too late, Julianne. Please tell me I haven\u2019t lost you forever.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, and put her arms around him. \u201cI love you, Gabriel. I never stopped. We both made mistakes\u2014with our relationship, with the university, with each other. But I hoped that you would come back to me. That you still loved me.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him on the lips, and Gabriel felt an overflowing of joy mixed with guilt.</p><p>He was embarrassed, she could tell. But Julia also knew that his damp eyes were the result of a myriad of things\u2014exhaustion and frustration, and the pain that lingers from a prolonged depression.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll stay?\u201d His voice was soft.</p><p>She hesitated just long enough for him to feel worried.</p><p>\u201cI want more than what we had before,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMore than I can give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily, but I\u2019ve changed over these past few month, and I see that you have too. The question is, where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you want. Tell me and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI want us to figure things out together. And that will take time.\u201d</p><p>Soon it was too warm to sit outside, so Gabriel and Julia returned to the house and settled themselves in the living room. He reclined on the leather sofa, while Julia made herself comfortable in one of the red velvet chairs.</p><p>\u201cShould we address the elephant in the room?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded, suddenly tense.</p> <p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ll start. I want to get to know you again. I want to be your partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be a good deal more than that,\u201d whispered Gabriel.</p><p>Julia shook her head vehemently. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon. You took away my choices, Gabriel. You have to stop doing that or we aren\u2019t going to get very far.\u201d</p><p>His face fell.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, dreading his answer.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret trying to save your career. I wish we could have come to a consensus about it. But when I saw you in danger, I reacted. And what\u2019s more, so would you if I were in danger.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her anger rise. \u201cSo this whole conversation, your apologies, mean nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I should have talked to you before I did anything. But if you expect me to be the sort of man who watches the woman he loves lose her dreams, then I can\u2019t meet your expectations. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Julia flushed a brilliant red. \u201cSo we\u2019re right back where we started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hold it against you when you went out of your way to protect me from Christa, or from the committee. I didn\u2019t hold your harassment email against you, even though we both agree it was a mistake. Can\u2019t you give me the same consideration? Can\u2019t you give me grace, Julianne? Your grace?\u201d</p><p>Despite his pleading tone, Julia wasn\u2019t listening. At that moment, all she heard was Gabriel discounting her objections. Again.</p> <p>She shook her head and walked to the door.</p><p>Here was the fork in the road, where the paths diverged. She could walk through the door, and everything with Gabriel would be over. There would be no third chance. Or she could stay, knowing that he refused to see his damned heroics in front of the committee as anything problematic.</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cLet me love you, Julianne. The way that you should be loved.\u201d</p><p>He stood behind her, his lips vibrating against her ear. She could feel the warmth of his body radiating through her clothes and against her back.</p><p>\u201cI am your faithful one, Beatrice. Of course I want to protect you. Nothing will change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather have had you than Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can have both.\u201d</p> <p>She turned around. \u201cAt what cost? Don\u2019t tell me that our situation didn\u2019t damage us, possibly irreparably.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her hair over one shoulder and pressed his lips to the bare side of her neck. \u201cForgive me. I promise I won\u2019t rob you of your dignity or our partnership. But I won\u2019t stand by and watch you get hurt when I can prevent it. Don\u2019t make me to revert to being a selfish bastard.\u201d</p><p>In stubborn annoyance, Julia took a step toward the door, but Gabriel caught her arm.</p><p>\u201cIn a perfect world, there would always be communication and consultation between partners. But we don\u2019t live in that world. There are emergencies and dangerous, vindictive people. Is my desire to keep you from harm so great a sin that you would leave me over it?\u201d</p><p>When she remained silent, he continued. \u201cI will do my utmost to make decisions with you and not for you. But I make no apologies for wanting you to be safe and happy. I won\u2019t be beholden to the rule that I have to consult you before I act in cases of emergency.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to treat you like an equal. I want the same treatment. That means that you need to trust me to make the best decision I can, given the information I have, without being omniscient. Or perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have you alive and carrying your shield than have you dead and covered by it.\u201d She sounded obstinate.</p><p>Gabriel laughed. \u201cI think the battle of Thermopylae is behind us, darling. But I share your sentiment and would ask the same of you. My little warrior.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her neck again. \u201cTake my ring.\u201d He quickly slipped the wedding ring from his left hand and held it over her right shoulder. \u201cI wore this to signify the fact that my heart, my life was yours.\u201d</p><p>She hesitantly took the ring from his hand and slipped it on one of her thumbs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sell this damn house. I only bought it to be close to you. But I can find an apartment until we choose a home together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just moved in. And I know you love the garden.\u201d Julia sighed.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you want. We can take our time without making promises about the future. But please forgive me. Teach me, and I promise I will be your most willing student.\u201d</p><p>When she was silent and unmoving for several minutes, Gabriel took her hand, leading her from the living room upstairs to his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked as they approached the door.</p><p>\u201cI need to hold you in my arms, and I think that you need to be held. That damn sofa is too narrow for both of us. Please.\u201d He led her to the bed and positioned himself on his back with open arms, inviting her to wrap herself around him.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWhat about Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t disturb us.\u201d</p><p>Julia was unwilling to return to his bed simply because he invited her, and so she looked around for something, anything, to distract him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d She pointed at what looked like two groupings of large picture frames that were leaning against one of the walls and covered by a sheet.</p><p>\u201cLook at them.\u201d</p><p>Julia crouched down on the hardwood floor and removed the sheet. There were about ten large photographs, stacked in two groups of five, all black and white. All featured Julia. Some included Gabriel.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen most of them before as they had been framed after their separation. There were photographs from Belize, from Italy, and posed photographs that had served as part of her Christmas present to Gabriel. All were startlingly beautiful and amative.</p><p>\u201cIt was difficult for me to look at them when I thought I\u2019d lost you. But as you can see, I kept them.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel watched as Julia looked through the photographs once more before studying his favorite, a picture of her lying on her stomach on a bed in Belize.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the old ones? The ones you had before you met me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong gone. I didn\u2019t need or want them anymore.\u201d</p><p>She placed the sheet over the pictures before walking to the bed. She looked conflicted.</p><p>Gabriel reached out his hand. \u201cRelax. I just want to hold you.\u201d</p><p>She allowed herself to be pulled into his arms so she could nestle against his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he murmured, kissing her forehead. \u201cI want to earn your trust and your respect. I want to be your husband.\u201d</p><p>Julia was quiet for a moment, holding her breath, as his words sunk into her consciousness. \u201cI want us to take things slowly. No more talk of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately, I can wait.\u201d He kissed her once again.</p><p>This time, the kiss escalated. Hands roamed to find purchase on muscles and curves, mouths connected determinedly, punctuated by sighs and almost breathless moans, hearts began to beat faster. It was a kiss to mark a reunion, to pledge the continuation of fidelity and love. Gabriel kissed her to show her that he loved her, that he was sorry.</p><p>Julia kissed him back to tell him that she could never give her heart to anyone else. That she was hopeful their shared imperfections, once acknowledged and explored, could be ameliorated in order to provide both of them with a healthy, happy life.</p><p>She pulled away first. She could hear his quickened breathing, and it cheered her that they still had this spark between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect our relationship to be perfect. But there are some things we need to work out and whether that takes a therapist or not, I know it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cI agree. I want to be able to court you as I was unable to back in Toronto. I want to hold your hand as we walk down the street. I\u2019d like to take you to the symphony and kiss you on your front steps.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cWe were lovers, Gabriel. You have photographs of the two of us in bed together, just over there. Would you really be satisfied with simply courting me?\u201d</p><p>He wove their fingers together. \u201cI want the chance to make things up to you\u2014to treat you the way I should have treated you all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always very generous in bed,\u201d she deflected.</p><p>\u201cBut selfish in other ways. Which is why I won\u2019t make love to you until I regain your trust.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what Julia wanted to say, but given the context she held her tongue. Somehow, her remark didn\u2019t quite seem consonant with his declaration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that if we have sex, it will short circuit the kind of changes we need to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want to wait?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a scorching look. \u201cNo, Julianne, I don\u2019t want to wait. I want to make love to you now and for the rest of the week. I know we should wait.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she realized that he was serious.</p><p>He kissed her tenderly. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be partners, there has to be trust. If you don\u2019t trust me with your mind, how can you trust me with your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you said that once before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come full circle.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAnd so there isn\u2019t a misunderstanding, when I say trust, I mean completely. I\u2019m hopeful that in time your anger will disappear and you\u2019ll forgive me. I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to work out our need to protect one another, without causing another crisis.\u201d He looked over at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI should have waited until you were no longer my student before we became involved. I told myself that because we weren\u2019t sleeping together, we weren\u2019t breaking any rules. But I was wrong. And you\u2019re the one who had to pay the price.\u201d He searched her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I believe you. But the Professor Emerson I knew and loved wasn\u2019t exactly a proponent of abstinence.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re forgetting how our relationship began. We abstained the night we met and a good many nights afterward.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his mouth repentantly. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his side, looking into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely aching to feel you in my arms, to be joined with you, body and soul. But when I\u2019m inside you, I want you to know that I will never leave you. That you are mine and I am yours, forever.\u201d His voice grew rough. \u201cThat we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you. When I make love to you again, I want to be your husband.\u201d</p><p>When she gaped at him, he continued quickly. \u201cRichard showed me the kind of man I want to become\u2014a man who spends the rest of his life loving one woman. I want to make vows to you before God and stand in front of our families and make promises to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabriel, I can\u2019t even contemplate marrying you. I need to learn how to be with you again. And frankly, I\u2019m still angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, and my intention is not to rush you. Do you remember the first time we made love?\u201d</p><p>She felt her cheeks flame. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p> <p>She paused, a faraway look in her eyes. \u201cYou were very intense, but kind. You planned everything, even down to that ridiculous cranberry juice.</p><p>\u201cI remember that you were arched over me, looking into my eyes while you moved, and you said that you loved me. I\u2019ll never forget those moments for as long as I live.\u201d She hid her face against his soap-scented neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you shy now?\u201d he asked, tracing the symmetry of her jaw with a single finger.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve seen me naked. I\u2019ve worshipped every beautiful inch of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss the connection we had. I haven\u2019t felt whole without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t either. But do you think you could make love to me when you don\u2019t trust me? You forget, my love, that I know you. You are not the type of woman to place your body where your heart will not go.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember our last time together? You told me that you felt like I\u2019d fucked you. The next time I have you naked in my bed, I want you to know without doubt that our union is born of love and not lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goal can be realized without getting married,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But if you don\u2019t think you can ever trust me enough to marry me, maybe you should let me go.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIs that an ultimatum?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But I want to prove myself to you, and you need time to heal.\u201d He examined her expression carefully. \u201cI need something permanent.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cYou want something permanent or you need something permanent?\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight on the bed. \u201cBoth. I want you to be my wife, but I also want to be the kind of man I should have been before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, you are always trying to win me. When are you going to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands in frustration. \u201cWithholding sex so I\u2019ll marry you is manipulative.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression brightened considerably. \u201cI\u2019m not withholding sex. If you were declaring that you weren\u2019t ready to sleep with me and I tried to pressure you, I\u2019d be a manipulative jackass. Shouldn\u2019t I be allowed to wait to have sex until our relationship is repaired, and to have that choice respected? Or does \u2018no means no\u2019 only apply to women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t pressure you if you had an objection to having sex,\u201d Julia sputtered. \u201cYou were more than patient with me when I wasn\u2019t ready to sleep with you. But what about make-up sex? Isn\u2019t that customary?\u201d</p> <p>He brought his face very close to hers. \u201cMake-up sex?\u201d The heat of his gaze almost scorched her skin. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d his voice rasped.</p><p>Welcome back, Professor Emerson.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014yes?\u201d</p><p>He took a single finger and traced her trembling lower lip. \u201cTell me,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>She blinked a few times, if only to break the magnetic pull his dark blue eyes had on her. He\u2019d rendered her speechless.</p><p>\u201cI want nothing more than to spend days and nights devoted to your pleasure, exploring your body, worshipping you. And I will. On our honeymoon you will find me the most attentive, inventive lover. All my arts will be at your service, and I will endeavor to undo all wrongs when I take you to my bed, as my wife.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her head just over the place where his tattoo lay hidden underneath his crisp white shirt. \u201cHow can you be so\u2014cold?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rolled her so she was wholly in his arms and on top of his chest, their upper bodies pressed together.</p><p>He kissed her gently at first, soft skin gliding over softer skin before he pulled her lower lip between his, drawing on it slightly. Then as his embrace became more heated, his hand clasped around her neck, stroking up and down until he felt her relax.</p><p>The barest tip of his tongue moved forward to tease her upper lip, the act of a gentleman who was unsure how he would be received. He needn\u2019t have worried. Julia welcomed him, and he began to explore her mouth with purpose, catching her almost unawares before pulling back without warning.</p><p>\u201cDoes that seem cold to you?\u201d His warm breath blew across her cheek, a hungry look in his eyes. \u201cDoes that feel as if I don\u2019t want you?\u201d</p><p>She would have shaken her head if she could have found it.</p><p>Gabriel moved his lips against her jaw, her chin, and painstakingly slowly down the left side of her neck until he was kissing the hollow at the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd this? Does this seem cold to you?\u201d His mouth moved against the surface of her skin.</p><p>\u201cN-No.\u201d She shivered.</p><p>He traced his nose up to her ear where he began to nibble, in between whispered adorations.</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d His right hand slowly descended her side, tracing each rib as if it were precious or perhaps as if he were searching for the primordial one Adam had lost. He shifted her slightly so her thigh slid over his hip, coming into contact with the undeniable evidence of his ardor.</p><p>\u201cCan you deny this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at her heatedly. \u201cNow that we\u2019re clear on that point, I\u2019m interested to hear your response.\u201d</p><p>Julia found it difficult to reason clasped to his body the way she was. She began to squirm, and he squeezed her more tightly.</p><p>\u201cThere was no one else. My arms were full even when I was alone. But if you were to tell me you\u2019d fallen in love with someone else and that you were happy, I\u2019d let you go. Even though it would break me.\u201d He grimaced and dropped his voice to a whisper. \u201cI\u2019ll love you forever, Julianne, whether you love me or not. That\u2019s my Heaven. And my Hell.\u201d</p><p>The room echoed with silence for several minutes, and Julia placed a shaking hand over her mouth. Slow, steady tears poured down her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He tugged at her a couple of times before he was able to coax her to cry against his chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d His voice was desperate, as he quickly rubbed his hand up and down her arm.</p><p>It took a few minutes for Julia to be able to compose herself enough to speak. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face immediately contorted in confusion. \u201cIs that a question?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond him, he began to panic. \u201cYou didn\u2019t believe that I loved you? But I told you that I loved you over and over again. I tried to show you with my actions, with my words, with my body. Did you not believe me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head from side to side, as if indicating that he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever believe me? When we were in Italy? When we were in Belize?\u201d He tugged painfully at his hair. \u201cMy God, Julia, did you make me your first thinking that I merely liked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you only believe that I love you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d let me go so I could be happy, even if it was with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Two tears streamed down her cheek, and he caught them with his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you love someone. You want them to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, and Gabriel watched a teardrop slide over the wedding ring she was wearing on her thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhen I found the illustration of St. Francis and Guido de Montefeltro, I didn\u2019t understand why you put it there. But it\u2019s clear to me now. You were worried the university was going to ruin my life. Rather than let it happen, you took my place. You loved me enough to let me go, even though it would break your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, I...\u201d Gabriel\u2019s protestation was cut short by the warmth of her lips melting against his. It was chaste and sorrowful, erotic and joyous.</p><p>She had never felt herself worthy of agape before. It wasn\u2019t a goal she aspired to or a grail that she sought. When Gabriel first told her that he loved her, she believed him. But the magnitude and depth of his love was not readily apparent. It had only become clear to her at this moment, and with that revelation came a tremendous sense of awe.</p><p>Perhaps Gabriel\u2019s love had always been sacrificial. Perhaps it had grown over time, just like the old apple tree that fed them on that night so long ago, and she just hadn\u2019t noticed how much it had grown.</p><p>At that moment, the genesis of his sacrificial love didn\u2019t matter. Having been confronted with what she could only describe as something very deep, she knew that she could never doubt his love now. Gabriel loved her as he knew her, fully, completely, and without question.</p><p>He pulled away, pressing his palm to her face. \u201cI\u2019m not a noble man. But the love I have for you can\u2019t be turned off. When I came to you at your apartment, my intention was to tell you that I loved you and to see that you were all right. And if you sent me away...\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to send you away,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do my best to help you any way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She moved so he was cradling her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I left.\u201d He pressed their lips together.</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>In the days and weeks that followed, Julia and Gabriel saw each other as much as they could, but between his preparation for the fall semester and her extended shifts at Peet\u2019s, most of their contact was mediated via telephone and email.</p><p>Julia continued her counseling sessions with Dr. Walters, which took on a new dimension upon Gabriel\u2019s return. Gabriel and Julia began couple\u2019s counseling, as well, on a weekly basis, which rapidly morphed into (unofficial) pre-marital preparations.</p><p>By the time Julia moved into one of the graduate student residences in August, she and Gabriel had managed to address several of their previous communication problems. But their collective obstinance remained. Gabriel wouldn\u2019t sleep with her until they were married, and Julia wished to move their physical relationship forward, incrementally. Gabriel was loath to share a bed with her except on occasion and then only reluctantly, with the grim visage of a martyr.</p><p>On one such evening, Julia lay awake in his arms long after he\u2019d fallen asleep. His body was warm and his words had been sweet, but she felt rejected. The passionate Professor hadn\u2019t needed much persuasion to reconnect with Paulina when she sought him out. But he wouldn\u2019t love Julia with his body, even though he pledged his eternal devotion.</p><p>As Gabriel\u2019s chest rose and fell beneath her cheek, she contemplated the path her life had taken. She wondered if Beatrice had spent some of her evenings earnestly desiring Dante\u2019s presence, yet having to settle for the fact that he would only worship her from afar.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d</p><p>She started at the sound of her name. He muttered something and tightened his grip on her, pulling her closer.</p><p>A lone tear escaped her eye.</p><p>She knew he loved her. But the knowledge was sharp and sweet. He was trying to let go of the past with Paulina and the other women, and she was paying the price. But perhaps it was no more than the price he\u2019d paid for the shame she\u2019d carried because of Simon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He mumbled again and this time she whispered in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips to his tattoo and closed her eyes.</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>Despite the pain of their continued physical separation, Julia recognized that Gabriel was constantly discovering new and ingenious ways to demonstrate his love. Though she found their new situation difficult, she continued to have faith in him.</p> <p>He refused to even entertain the notion of spending the night inside her small dorm room, but he\u2019d drop in on occasion with flowers or food, and they would picnic on the floor. He took her to the movies, (even deigning to see a non-subtitled, domestically produced romantic comedy), and kissed her goodnight on the front steps of her building.</p><p>On more than one occasion, he spent a Friday or Saturday evening in the library with her, writing his new book while she prepared for Professor Marinelli\u2019s seminar. Julia was being wooed in word and deed, and she liked it. But she was also unsatisfied, craving the closeness that could only be had when making love.</p><p>Soon it was August twenty-first and they were flying to Philadelphia to help with the preparations for Rachel and Aaron\u2019s wedding. As they walked into the lobby of the Four Seasons hotel, Julia was stunned to find her father sitting in a wing chair, reading the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p><p>\u201cMy dad is here,\u201d she hissed, hoping to give Gabriel enough of a head start so he could make it to the elevators before Tom took out one of his hunting rifles and shot him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I called him.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to Gabriel in wide-eyed disbelief. \u201cWhy would you do that? He wants to kill you.\u201d</p><p>The Professor pulled himself up to his full height. \u201cI want to marry you. That means that I need to make amends with your father. I want to be able to be in the same room without him attempting to shoot me. Or castrate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a good time to ask him about marrying me,\u201d Julia whispered. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, he\u2019ll forego castration in order to remove your legs\u2014with his Swiss Army knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask for his permission to marry you; that decision rests with you. Would you really want to marry a man your father despises?\u201d</p><p>Julia began to wring her hands in agitation.</p><p>He leaned over to speak in her ear. \u201cLet me do some damage control so it isn\u2019t beyond the realm of possibility for him to accept our relationship. You might want him to walk you down the aisle someday.\u201d</p> <p>No sooner had the words left Gabriel\u2019s lips then Tom saw the couple standing together. He smiled at his little girl widely, then glanced at Gabriel and scowled. As he stood to his feet, he brushed his jacket back so his hands could rest on his hips. He looked menacing.</p><p>O gods of women whose fathers wish to castrate their boyfriend in the lobby of the Four Seasons, please don\u2019t let him be carrying anything sharp.</p><p>Gabriel boldly leaned over to press his lips to her forehead while staring Tom straight in the eye. Tom fixed him with a murderous expression.</p><p>\u201cDad, hi.\u201d Julia walked over and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jules.\u201d He hugged her back before pulling her behind him protectively. \u201cEmerson.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred by Tom\u2019s unfriendly tone, Gabriel stuck his hand out. Tom simply stared at it as if it, like its owner, was felonious.</p><p>\u201cI think we should find a quiet corner in the bar. I don\u2019t want an audience for what I have to say to you. Jules, do you need help carrying your luggage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the porter has it. I\u2019m, um, going to my room. Gabriel, I\u2019ll let you check into your room yourself, okay?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, noting that Tom\u2019s scowl relaxed slightly at the news that his daughter was not currently cohabitating with the Devil.</p><p>\u201cJust for the record, I love both of you. So I\u2019d really like it if you didn\u2019t injure one another.\u201d Julia looked warily between the two men, and when both failed to answer, she shook her head and walked to the front desk. Her first order of business was to find out how well stocked the mini-bar was.</p><p>Later that evening, after a somewhat tense but not unpleasant dinner with her father, Julia availed herself of the gift basket of lavender bath products Gabriel had sent to her room, complete with virginal lavender poof. She laughed when she thought of the first time he\u2019d poofed her.</p><p>She sobered when she realized that he\u2019d purchased lavender items rather than vanilla, despite the fact that he preferred vanilla on her to any other scent. Perhaps this was his way of keeping her at arm\u2019s length. Whatever his reason, she\u2019d respect his wishes and hope that he\u2019d change his mind. Soon.</p><p>She was soaking in the large, pedestal bathtub when her cell phone rang. Luckily, the accursed device was well within reach.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s smooth voice filled her ears.</p><p>\u201cJust relaxing. Thank you for the gift basket, by the way. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say my conversation with your father was enjoyable, but it was necessary. I gave him the chance to curse me and say that I\u2019m a no good cokehead who doesn\u2019t deserve you. Then I did my best to explain what happened. By the end of our conversation, he begrudgingly bought me a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Tom paying ten dollars for a Chimay Premi\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cIt was Budweiser, actually. And not the original Budweiser Budvar from the Czech Republic. He ordered for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you must love me, if you\u2019re willing to give up your pretentious European imports for appalling bath water.\u201d Julia gave the large bathtub a baleful look. She would rather have been bathing with Gabriel than without him.</p><p>\u201cDrinking a domestic beer is the least I could do. I don\u2019t think your father will forgive me for hurting you, but hopefully things will improve. I told him that I want to marry you. Did he mention that over dinner?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cHe told me that I was his little girl and that he wanted to protect me. Then he said some things about you that weren\u2019t very complimentary.</p><p>\u201cBut he admitted I\u2019m an adult and that I need to live my own life. He said it was clear to him that you\u2019d changed\u2014even since he\u2019d seen you last. I think you surprised him. And he isn\u2019t used to being surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice sounded pained.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not being the kind of man you could bring home to your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, my dad thought the sun shone out of Simon\u2019s ass. He isn\u2019t exactly the best judge of character. And he doesn\u2019t know you as I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle him.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was quiet for a moment as he contemplated her response. \u201cMy conversation with Tom was a good warm up for dinner with my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. How did that go?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cTalking to Scott on the telephone is one thing, but having dinner with him is something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s protective of me. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad asked me to offer a toast to Mom at the wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling. That\u2019s going to be difficult. Are you sure you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the line for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI have some things I need to say. Things almost thirty years in the making. Now\u2019s my chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve kissed and made up with everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically. Dad and I made our peace on the telephone weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you meet Tammy\u2019s little boy?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted into the phone. \u201cHe soiled me as soon as I picked him up. Perhaps Scott coached him to make his feelings about me known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn peed on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he spilled milk all over my new Armani suit.\u201d</p><p>Julia dissolved into peals of laughter at the thought of the very elegant, very particular professor being soiled by his brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong that I didn\u2019t care that much? I mean about the suit.\u201d</p><p>Julia stopped laughing abruptly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care? What did you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe concierge sent it to be dry-cleaned. I\u2019ve been assured that milk will come out of wool crepe, but I\u2019m not holding my breath. Suits can be replaced, people can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to be sweet with you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I\u2019ve never seen you around children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYou\u2019d make beautiful babies, Julianne. Little girls and boys with big brown eyes and pink cheeks.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s sharp intake of breath whistled in Gabriel\u2019s ear.</p><p>His voice almost caught in his throat. \u201cIs it premature to have this conversation?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hesitation about marriage isn\u2019t over having children. It comes from what happened between us and being a child of divorced parents. They loved each other once, I think, and ended up hating each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were married happily for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. If I could have a marriage like theirs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can have a marriage like theirs,\u201d Gabriel corrected her. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want. And I want it with you.\u201d</p><p>He tried to communicate with his tone how much he desired a marriage like the one Richard and Grace enjoyed. How he was trying desperately to become the kind of man who could give Julia that kind of marriage.</p><p>She exhaled slowly. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me to marry you before, I would have said yes. But I can\u2019t right now. There\u2019s so much we need to work through, and I\u2019m already stressed out about grad school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to stress you out.\u201d His voice was soft but slightly strained.</p><p>\u201cI thought you made your decision about having children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always adoption.\u201d He sounded defensive.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of having a little blue eyed baby with you makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Seeing what Grace and Richard did with you, I\u2019d be interested in adopting someday. Just not while I\u2019m a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe adoption would have to be private. I doubt a respectable agency would place a child with a drug addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you? Absolutely. If we were married, I\u2019d consider having my vasectomy reversed. It was done many years ago so I don\u2019t know how successful a reversal might be. But once we\u2019re married I\u2019d like to try\u2014with your blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s premature to have that conversation.\u201d The arm she was leaning on accidentally slipped off the side of the bathtub, splashing into the water.</p><p>Scheisse, she thought, too worn out to call on a god to come to her rescue.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking a bath?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She took comfort in the fact that he groaned into her ear. It was painful that he could resist her, day after day, no matter what.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m across the hall feeling lonely and sad, in case you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lonely too, Gabriel. Can\u2019t we do something about that?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, and Julia felt hopeful.</p><p>Gabriel groaned again in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I need to go. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head somewhat resignedly as she ended the call.</p><p>Despite the absence of her mother, Rachel almost had a fairy-tale wedding. She and Aaron were married in a beautiful garden in Philadelphia, and although Aaron had initially rejected the idea of having fifty doves released at the moment the priest pronounced them husband and wife, Rachel wore him down.</p> <p>(At least none of his relatives decided to practice their target shooting.)</p><p>As maid of honor and groomsman, Julia and Gabriel found themselves standing near the bride and groom, flanked by Scott. Julia spent much of the ceremony peeking over at Gabriel, and he stared at her unashamedly.</p><p>After the photographs were taken and the wedding dinner and toasts were complete, Rachel and Aaron enjoyed the first dance. They melted into one another\u2019s arms before their parents were invited to join them on the dance floor.</p><p>There was a moment of nervousness amongst the guests when Richard stood, alone, before walking over to Julia and asking if she would honor him by being his partner. She was stunned by his request, as she had assumed that he would choose an aging aunt or friend, but she accepted quickly. Ever the consummate gentleman, Richard held Julia firmly but respectfully as he moved her across the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cYour father seems to be enjoying himself.\u201d He nodded at Tom, who was standing with a drink in his hand and engaged in an animated conversation with one of the female professors from Susquehanna University.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting him,\u201d she said shyly as they danced to the strains of Etta James\u2019s \u201cAt Last.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old friend and a good friend. Grace and I owe him a great deal from when we were having trouble with Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded and tried to concentrate on her feet, lest she stumble. \u201cGabriel\u2019s toast to Grace was very moving.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s never called us Mom and Dad before. I\u2019m sure that Grace is watching and that she\u2019s very, very happy. I know that part of her happiness is seeing the transformation in our son. You brought that about, Julia. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for that. Some things are beyond all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree. But sometimes relationships can be conduits of grace, and I know you\u2019ve been one for my son. Thank you.</p><p>\u201cIt took a long time for Gabriel to forgive himself for what happened to Maia and for not being with Grace when she died. He\u2019s a very different man than he was a year ago. I hope that I\u2019ll be able to dance with you at another wedding in the near future. One in which you and my son take center stage.\u201d</p><p>An earnest expression came over her face. \u201cWe\u2019re taking things one day at a time, but I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait too long. Life takes unexpected turns, and we don\u2019t always have the time we think we have.\u201d As the song ended, he kissed her hand and escorted her back to Gabriel.</p> <p>Julia wiped away a tear as she sat down. Instantly, Gabriel\u2019s lips were at her ear. \u201cIs my father making you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s just reminding me of what\u2019s important.\u201d She wound their hands together and brought their connection to her mouth so she could kiss his knuckles. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, my sweet, sweet girl.\u201d He leaned over to kiss her, and for a moment they forgot where they were as she reached up to wind her arm around his neck and pull him closer.</p><p>As their lips met and their breath commingled, the noise of the room slipped away. Gabriel pulled Julia so she was leaning across his lap, clasping her to his heart as he kissed her passionately. When they came apart, they were both breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea weddings brought out such reactions.\u201d He smirked. \u201cOr I would have taken you to one sooner.\u201d</p><p>After dancing several slow dances with Gabriel, Julia took a turn with Scott and with Aaron, and finally, with her father. It was clear that Tom and Julia had a lot to say to one another, and their expressions weren\u2019t always happy ones. But by the end of the dance they seemed to have come to some sort of understanding, and Gabriel felt marginally relieved when she returned to him, wearing a smile.</p><p>Near the end of the evening, Aaron requested Marc Cohn\u2019s \u201cTrue Companion\u201d and dedicated it to Rachel. Immediately, a throng of married couples scurried toward the dance floor. Tammy surprised everyone by bringing little Quinn over to Julia and asking her to hold him while she danced with Scott.</p><p>Julia was afraid that Quinn wouldn\u2019t like her.</p><p>\u201cHe looks good on you,\u201d Gabriel whispered as Quinn fell asleep snuggled into her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried he\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Gabriel reached over to lightly stroke the fine hair that decorated the boy\u2019s head, smiling widely as he seemed to offer a contented sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to get married and have children all of a sudden?\u201d Julia blurted.</p><p>He shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cThings happened while we were separated. I realized what was important\u2014what I wanted for a happy life. And I went to an orphanage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn orphanage? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered with the Franciscans in Florence and they used to bring candy and toys to the children at the orphanage. I went along.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret. I planned to stay in Assisi indefinitely, but I met an American family who were going to run a medical clinic for the poor in Florence. I decided to join them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t especially good at it. But I found my niche, eventually, telling stories about Dante in Italian.\u201d</p><p>Julia grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s a good job for a Dante specialist. What about the orphanage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children were well looked after, but it was a sad place. They had babies there, some of whom had AIDS or fetal alcohol syndrome. Then there were older children who would never be adopted. Most adoptive parents want younger kids.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned and gently touched the little boy\u2019s head. \u201cWhen Grace found me, I was at an age that would have been considered unadoptable. She wanted me anyway. I\u2019ve been blessed.\u201d</p><p>Julia heard his sudden vulnerability and was struck by how much he\u2019d changed. She couldn\u2019t have imagined the old Professor Emerson talking about his blessings, or stroking a little boy\u2019s head. Especially if the boy had ruined his new Armani suit.</p><p>Just before the last dance, Gabriel walked over to the DJ and spoke to him in hushed tones. Then, with a wide smile, he returned to Julia and extended his hand.</p><p>They walked slowly onto the dance floor just as \u201cReturn to Me\u201d filled the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t choose \u2018Besame Mucho,\u2019\u201d she said.</p><p>Gabriel gazed into her eyes intensely. \u201cI thought that we needed a new song. A new song for a new chapter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked the old one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to forget the past,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut we can make the future better.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a half-smile and changed the subject. \u201cI remember the first time we danced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an ass that evening. When I think of how I behaved...\u201d His tone was remorseful. \u201cI had a strong reaction to you but didn\u2019t know how to act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to act around me now.\u201d She touched his face and pressed their lips together before tentatively fingering his black silk bow tie. \u201cI remember admiring your ties when I was just your student. You always dressed impeccably.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel caught her hand in his and pressed his open mouth to her palm. \u201cJulianne, you were never just my student. You\u2019re my soul mate. My bashert.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to his chest, and she hummed against his tuxedo. And when Dean Martin switched to Italian, it was Gabriel\u2019s voice that sang in her ear.</p><p>As Gabriel stood outside of Julia\u2019s hotel room in the wee hours of the morning, he looked at her appraisingly. Her long, curled hair, her beautiful skin and flushed cheeks, her eyes sparkling with champagne and happiness. The way her dark red strapless dress complemented her figure. His brown-eyed angel still had the power to enchant him.</p><p>As he gently caressed her cheek, she gazed up into the hazy blue eyes he was now hiding behind his glasses. He was so handsome in his tuxedo. So very, very sexy.</p><p>Boldly, she reached out to pull the edge of his bow tie and felt the silk come apart in her fingers. She wrapped the tie around her hand once to tug his lips to hers.</p><p>As they kissed, Julia suddenly realized how difficult it must have been at the beginning of their relationship for Gabriel to keep his hands off her. The boiling of blood and heating of flesh when one knew what lay beyond kissing in the voluptuary dance that was foreplay. She could barely contain her need for him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, straining on tiptoe to place tiny kisses across his neck as she tugged on his tie once again.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed gruffly. \u201cThis is a stunning reversal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve waited a respectable amount of time. I love you. And I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cThen marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off with his kiss, pulling her against his chest. Somehow his hands were in her hair, clutching her tightly. And then as he gently slid his hands to caress her naked shoulders, he tentatively pressed into her mouth.</p><p>Julia released his bow tie to wrap her arms around his neck, tugging him until their bodies were flush against one another. She nibbled his full lower lip and moaned as his tongue slowly traced the curve of her mouth.</p><p>Suddenly, his fingers were touching her collarbones and moving to her back, gliding across the surface of her skin as it began to flush and heat.</p><p>\u201cLet me do things the right way,\u201d he pleaded, his hands cupping her face.</p><p>\u201cHow could this be wrong?\u201d she whispered back, eyes dark and desperate.</p><p>He kissed her again, and this time she shamelessly wound her right leg around his hip, trying to recreate their tango against a wall from the Royal Ontario Museum.</p><p>He pressed forward until her back was flush against the door to her room, his hands roaming up and down her thighs, before pulling back suddenly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia removed his glasses in order to smooth the creases around his eyes, and saw passion, conflict, and love staring back at her. She unwound her leg from his hip and pressed their lower bodies together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabriel.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at the sound of her voice, as if she was awakening him from a dream.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t move, she placed a few inches between them and handed him his glasses. \u201cGoodnight, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He looked stricken. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He remained perfectly still, staring down into eyes that were filled with sadness and longing. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be strong for both of us,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut when you look at me like that...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips softly and nodded his acquiescence as she fumbled for her slide card, and the two of them disappeared behind her hotel room door.</p><p>Early the next morning, Julia left the comfort of Gabriel\u2019s warm embrace to tip toe to the washroom. When she returned, she found him wide-awake and gazing at her with concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>Blushing, she smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come here.\u201d He opened his arms, and she snuggled close, placing a leg over both of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I embarrassed you in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d The urgency of his tone took Julia aback. \u201cHow could I be embarrassed by the woman I love showing me that she wants me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we gave some of the other guests a bit of a show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some inspiration,\u201d he spoke against her lips, kissing her.</p> <p>When they broke apart, she rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI guess you\u2019re serious about waiting until the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t complaining last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me.\u201d She winked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t like to complain.</p><p>\u201cThank you for compromising, Gabriel.\u201d She tightened her arms around his waist. \u201cLast night was important for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me too.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI could see that you trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, because I\u2019ve never trusted you more.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, before pushing a lock of hair away from her face. \u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d he said, his fingers gently running up and down her neck. \u201cSomething strange.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows knit together curiously.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was back in Selinsgrove, I saw something. Or rather, something happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Julia covered his hand with hers, stilling his fingers. \u201cWere you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused uncomfortably. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll keep an open mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a dream. When I woke up, I wondered if it was a vision.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cLike when you thought you saw me in Assisi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Like what you said about the Gentileschi painting while we were in Florence\u2014about Maia and Grace.</p><p>\u201cI saw her. Grace. We were in my old room at my parents\u2019 house. And Grace told me...\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice broke. He struggled to compose himself. \u201cShe told me that she knew that I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did,\u201d Julia murmured, hugging him more tightly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more. She had someone with her. A young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel swallowed roughly. \u201cMaia.\u201d</p><p>Julia gasped, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she was happy.\u201d</p><p>Julia wiped a stray tear from Gabriel\u2019s face. \u201cWas it a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Richard? Or Paulina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019ve both made their peace.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her hand against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you needed this in order to forgive yourself\u2014to see that Grace and Maia forgave you and that they\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded wordlessly, burying his face in her hair.</p><p>Chapter 50</p><p>On their flight back to Boston, Julia surprised Gabriel by telling him that she would welcome his proposal. His happiness could barely be contained in the first class section of the airplane. She expected that he would drop to one knee immediately.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>When they arrived in Boston, she expected him to take her shopping for wedding rings.</p><p>He made no such plans.</p><p>In fact, as September flew by, she wondered if Gabriel was going to propose to her at all. Perhaps it was the case that he merely assumed that they were engaged and planned to pick out wedding rings at some later date.</p><p>Gabriel warned her that the doctoral program at Harvard was challenging and that the professors were highly demanding. In fact, he remarked more than once that the average faculty member who taught in her program was far more pretentious and ass-like than he had ever been.</p><p>(Julia wondered if such astronomical ass-like levels were humanly possible.)</p><p>Nevertheless, his warnings hadn\u2019t quite prepared her for the amount of work she was required to do on a daily basis. She spent long hours in seminars and also in the library, keeping up with her homework and supplementing the reading from her classes. She met with Professor Marinelli regularly and found that they enjoyed a professional but comfortable rapport. And she worked tirelessly on her Italian and other languages, in preparation for her competency exams.</p><p>Gabriel encouraged her, of course, and he did his very best not to pressure her about spending time with him. He was busy with his new position and had immediately taken over the supervision of three doctoral students, having relinquished Paul to Katherine\u2019s capable direction. But full professors have more leisure time than graduate students, and so Gabriel spent many an evening and weekend alone.</p><p>He began volunteering as a tutor at the Italian Home for Children in Jamaica Plain. Despite his somewhat limited success, under his supervision a small group of teenagers developed a lively interest in Italian art and culture. The Professor promised to send them to Italy if they graduated high school with a respectable grade point average.</p><p>Though he kept himself busy, each day ended as it began, with him alone in his now renovated house, missing Julianne.</p><p>He seriously contemplated buying a dog. Or a ferret.</p><p>Despite her overall busyness with graduate school, which was a welcome distraction, Julia continued to be frustrated. Their separation was unnatural, uncomfortable, cold, and she ached to breach that separation and be one with him again. The fact that she couldn\u2019t made her terribly sad. All the romantic activities short of intercourse couldn\u2019t erase that kind of loneliness. And there were only so many times she could listen to comforting music while lying alone in her single bed.</p><p>Sexual desires can be satisfied in many ways, but she longed for the attention that he paid to her when they were making love, the way he lavished single-minded devotion on her as if there were no one and nothing else on earth. She coveted the way she felt when he touched her naked form. For in those moments, she felt beautiful and desirable, despite her innate shyness and unease about her body. She desired the moments after sex, when they were both relaxed and sated, and Gabriel would whisper beautiful words in her ear, and they would simply be in one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>As the days passed, Julia wasn\u2019t sure how long she could tolerate their disconnection without lapsing into a depression.</p><p>One day at the end of September, Julia opened the door of the Range Rover and silently slid into the passenger seat. She buckled her seatbelt and gazed out the window.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d Gabriel reached his hand out to push her hair away from her face.</p><p>She stiffened.</p><p>He withdrew his hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Gabriel reached over to gently turn her chin in his direction. Her face was puffy, and her skin was blotchy and uneven. She\u2019d been crying for a while.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He unfastened her seatbelt and tugged her over the center console and onto his lap, which was no easy feat. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Walters brought up all this stuff about my mother. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but she said that she wasn\u2019t doing her job if she let me suppress everything that happened in St. Louis. I took as much as I could take and then I left.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grimaced. Dr. Townsend had been making similar comments about his own mother, but he seemed to be closer to making peace with his past since his trip to Italy. Certainly, his continued presence at Narcotics Anonymous meetings seemed to be helping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he offered, kissing the top of her head. \u201cBut didn\u2019t Nicole address your relationship with your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly. Mostly we discussed you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel winced. He would always feel guilty for the pain he had caused her, but the fact that he had bumped Sharon off Nicole\u2019s priority list for helping Julia made him cringe.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed mirthlessly as she wiped her tears away. \u201cFind me another therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be helping you if I did. Any therapist worth her salt would insist that you address what happened with your mother. And her boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>Julia began to protest, but Gabriel interrupted her. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re going through. Even though our mothers were abusive in different ways, I understand.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her nose with a tissue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to listen, whenever you want to talk about it. But in order to be healthy, you have to deal with your past. I\u2019ll do everything I can to help, but this is something only you can do\u2014for yourself and for us.\u201d He gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cYou realize that, don\u2019t you? That the healing process not only helps you, it helps us?\u201d</p><p>She nodded begrudgingly. \u201cI thought all the angst was behind us. I thought that after everything we\u2019d been through, we\u2019d have our happy ever after.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tried to repress a snicker. And failed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t believe in happy ever after?\u201d</p><p>He smirked at her and tapped her nose with his finger. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe in angst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not an Existentialist; I\u2019m a Dantean.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cVery funny, Professor. With a name like Emerson, I would have thought you to be a Transcendentalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d He kissed her wrinkles affectionately. \u201cI exist in order to please you.</p><p>\u201cWe will be happy, Julianne, but don\u2019t you see that in order to get to the happiness, you have to address the pain of the past?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about visiting Maia\u2019s grave.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019d like to take you with me.\u201d His voice was hesitant and barely above a whisper. \u201cI\u2019d like you to see it. That is, if you wouldn\u2019t find it morbid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored. Of course I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you everything that happened with Sharon. Or with Simon.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rubbed at his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you everything about my past, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes it bother you? That we haven\u2019t told one another everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m willing to listen to anything you have to say. But truthfully, there are some things I don\u2019t want to discuss about my life. So I understand your reticence to lay bare your history.\u201d He locked eyes with her. \u201cThe important thing is that you address those events with someone. I\u2019m sure that talking things over with Dr. Walters is good enough.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her once again and held her close, meditating on how far they\u2019d come in their individual journeys and how far they still needed to go.</p><p>Chapter 51</p> <p>In October, Gabriel persuaded Julia to travel to his house in Selinsgrove for the weekend in order to congregate with their relatives. Rachel and Aaron insisted on doing all the cooking during the weekend, while Tammy\u2019s little boy, Quinn, entertained everyone, including Tom, with his smiles.</p><p>\u201cHow is married life treating you?\u201d Gabriel asked Aaron as he assembled the ingredients for a salad.</p><p>\u201cReally well. You should try it sometime.\u201d Aaron winked at Julia as he took a long pull from his Corona.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an idea.\u201d Gabriel smiled smugly and went back to his salad.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Gabriel. When are you going to put a ring on that woman\u2019s finger?\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice floated across the kitchen from the oven.</p> <p>\u201cShe has one.\u201d</p><p>Rachel left her chicken Kiev unattended and raced across the kitchen to examine Julia\u2019s left hand.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count.\u201d She pointed to Julia\u2019s thumb, which was encased by Gabriel\u2019s platinum band.</p><p>Julia and Rachel exchanged a look and shook their heads.</p><p>Gabriel regarded the way that Julia\u2019s countenance fell and quickly abandoned his salad (which was laden pretentiously with both fruit and nuts), and hastily embraced her.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he whispered, so quietly that no one else could hear.</p> <p>She murmured her acquiescence, and he squeezed her tightly before kissing her.</p><p>\u201cGet a room.\u201d Aaron snickered.</p><p>\u201cOh, we have one.\u201d Gabriel glanced at him sideways.</p><p>\u201cWe have two, actually.\u201d Julia sighed in resignation.</p><p>When they sat down for dinner, Richard asked everyone to hold hands while he said the blessing. He thanked God for his family, for Tammy, Quinn, and Julia, for his new son-in-law, and for the friendship of the Mitchells. He thanked God for his wife and her memory and he pointed out that the seeds she had planted with her children, her husband, and her friends had come to fruition. And when he said \u201cAmen,\u201d everyone wiped at their eyes and smiled, more thankful than they could say that the family was together and strong once again.</p><p>Chapter 52</p><p>After dinner, Tammy and Scott cleaned up while Rachel and Aaron practiced their parenting skills with Quinn. On the back porch, Richard and Tom smoked cigars and drank Scotch, while watching old Mr. Bancroft carry things from the garage into the woods. Richard gave Tom a knowing look, and the two men clinked glasses.</p><p>Inside the house, Gabriel took Julia\u2019s hand and led her upstairs. \u201cWear something warm,\u201d he said as they walked into her room. \u201cI want to take you for a walk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that cold out,\u201d she remarked, as she pulled on one of Gabriel\u2019s old cashmere cardigans.</p><p>He\u2019d divested his wardrobe of cardigans after Julia informed him that they made him look like a grandfather.</p><p>(Or a PBS host.)</p><p>Upon hearing that, Gabriel was only too glad to donate his cardigans to the Salvation Army, with the exception of one or two that Julia rescued.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to catch cold,\u201d he protested, tugging playfully on her sweater.</p><p>\u201cI have you to warm me,\u201d she countered, winking at him.</p><p>After winding her Magdalen College scarf around her neck, Gabriel escorted her downstairs, through the kitchen and outside.</p><p>\u201cGoing for a walk, Emerson?\u201d Tom\u2019s voice surprised them.</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, Mr. Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>Tom patted the Swiss Army knife in his coat pocket. \u201cIf you make her cry, I\u2019ll gut you like a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of her, I promise. And if I make her cry, I\u2019ll dry her tears.\u201d</p><p>Tom snorted and muttered something under his breath.</p><p>Julia gazed between Gabriel and Tom quizzically. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel is taking you for a walk, with my blessing.\u201d Her father spoke with only the slightest of scowls.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d interjected Richard, his gray eyes alive with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou two need to lay off the Scotch.\u201d Julia shook her head at the men as Gabriel pulled her into the dense, thick trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d she asked as they trudged hand in hand toward the remains of the old orchard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Gabriel kissed the top of her head before quickening their pace. He grinned as he inhaled her scent. \u201cYou smell like vanilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got sick of lavender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes they were at the edge of the orchard. Despite the fact that the trees were very thick, Julia saw light streaming through the branches.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and find out.\u201d He led her through the trees.</p><p>There were small white lights decorating some of the branches of the trees overhead and lanterns scattered on the ground containing flameless flickering candles. Amidst the gentle light, which cast a warm glow over the stark, bare trees and the old grass, there stood a white tent. Inside, a bench was spread with a familiar looking blanket and decorated with cushions.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gabriel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He walked with her to the tent, encouraging her to sit down.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to go to so much trouble. I would have been happy with this old blanket and the ground. That\u2019s what we used before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like spoiling you.\u201d His eyes caught hers, and she lost her breath as a simmering intensity shone from their blue depths. \u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</p><p>He withdrew, walking over to a low table on which rested a champagne bucket and two champagne flutes. She nodded and watched as he expertly opened the champagne bottle and poured two glasses. He returned to her side. \u201cShall we toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She glanced at the alcohol in his hand. \u201cWe could drink something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sip for me. To Julianne, my beloved.\u201d He raised his glass.</p><p>\u201cI think we should drink to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too. To us.\u201d He smiled, and they toasted one another before sipping their champagne.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do all of this? It must have taken hours.\u201d Julia gazed at the spectacle around them.</p><p>\u201cOld Mr. Bancroft has been taking care of the house and grounds while I\u2019m away. I asked him to arrange everything while we were eating dinner. May I?\u201d He reached into a bowl of strawberries and chose the largest, ripest one and held it out to her.</p><p>Gabriel brought the red fruit to Julia\u2019s lips, smiling widely as she took half of it into her mouth before biting down. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that it complements the taste of the champagne.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed as some of the juice from the berry escaped her mouth. She moved to wipe it with her hand, but Gabriel\u2019s fingers were faster. He traced her lips slowly, capturing the juice, and transferred his fingers to his own mouth before sucking on them.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>As he repeated this ritual, Julia began to feel strangely light-headed. Gabriel\u2019s sensuality, even bridled, was dizzying in the extreme.</p><p>She reached over to return the favor and was stunned when, after swallowing, he drew one of her fingers into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it before sucking it.</p><p>\u201cSweet like candy,\u201d he mused, his voice throaty and thick.</p><p>He sat next to her on the bench and placed his arm around her, drawing a single finger across her trembling lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you do to me? The flush of your cheeks, the warmth of your skin, the speed of your heart...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond words.\u201d</p><p>Julia unbuttoned her sweater and placed his palm flush against her chest. \u201cFeel my heart beat. You do this to me, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at where his palm was placed. \u201cI intend to elicit that reaction for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>He captured her lips with his in a fiery kiss before withdrawing his hand to hover at her cheek. \u201cI brought you here because this is where it all began. You changed my life that night. I\u2019ll never be able to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour love is thanks enough.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her sweetly.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the music coming from?\u201d Julia looked around for a stereo system but couldn\u2019t find one.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bancroft provided the means to have music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot half as lovely as you. You brought beauty to my life the instant I met you.\u201d Gabriel tightened his grip around her. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe I have you in my arms after all these years, and that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always loved you, Gabriel. Even when you didn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d Julia pressed her head to his heart as he hummed along to the music.</p><p>When the song was replaced by a new one, Gabriel murmured against her skin. \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rain kisses on you once you let me present my gift.\u201d He pulled something out of his jacket and handed it to her. It was an announcement written in Italian on very expensive card stock.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cRead it,\u201d he urged, his eyes alight.</p><p>The announcement was from the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and it declared the opening of an exclusive exhibit of an extraordinary collection of Botticelli illustrations of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, some of which had never before been seen in public. The announcement went on to declare that the exhibit was on loan to the Uffizi from Professor Gabriel Emerson, as a gift to his fidanzata, Miss Julianne Mitchell.</p><p>She gaped at him in surprise. \u201cGabriel, your illustrations. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy happiness has made me generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the legal issues? And how you bought them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lawyer hired a team of experts to trace the provenance, which ends in the late nineteenth century. After that, no one knows to whom they belonged. And since they were always part of a private collection, I own them legally and rightfully. Now I want to share them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Julia flushed and looked down at the ground. \u201cBut my name shouldn\u2019t be attached to the exhibition. The illustrations are yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only sharing them because of you.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached up a hand to touch his jaw. \u201cThank you. What you\u2019re doing is very generous. I always thought that those pictures should be available for people to see and to enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taught me not to be selfish.\u201d</p><p>She moved to kiss him, eagerly tasting his mouth. \u201cYou taught me to accept gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re a matched set.\u201d He cleared his throat as he pushed a lock of hair away from her face. \u201cWill you accompany me to the exhibition? We\u2019ll schedule it for the summer. Dottore Vitali would like to host a reception for us, similar to the one he held last year for my lecture.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Perhaps we\u2019ll be able to find a private corner of the museum so we can...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more, Professor.\u201d She winked.</p><p>Gabriel tugged at his collar involuntarily.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to get married in Florence next summer? We could have the wedding while we\u2019re visiting the exhibition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sought the ground as disappointment spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cNext summer would be far too late. What about next month?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes flew to hers. \u201cI\u2019d marry you tomorrow, if I could. But are you sure? It doesn\u2019t leave us much time to plan a wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want our wedding to be small. I\u2019m tired of living alone. I want to be with you.\u201d She brushed his ear with her lips. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t only because I want to have you warm my bed.\u201d</p><p>A growl escaped Gabriel\u2019s chest, and he kissed her firmly. She sighed into his mouth, and the two embraced warmly before he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your studies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of graduate students are married. Even if I only see you in bed at night it will be more than I see you now. Please don\u2019t make me wait.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cAs if the waiting wasn\u2019t killing me as well. Where should we get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssisi. It\u2019s always been an important place for me, and I know it\u2019s important to you too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen Assisi it is, as soon as possible. Honeymoon to be determined?\u201d He lifted his eyebrows suggestively. \u201cOr is there somewhere particular you\u2019d like to go? Paris? Venice? Belize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere would be wonderful as long as I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tightly. \u201cBless you for that. I\u2019ll make it a surprise, then.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again and within moments, felt the world spinning around her. Everything fell away as she melted in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have something else I want to show you,\u201d he said at length, dragging his lips from hers.</p><p>He clasped her hand in his and walked over to the old apple tree that stood on the edge of the clearing.</p><p>He turned to face her, eyes full of feeling. \u201cThe first time we met, I picked an apple from this tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe apple represented what my life was like at that time\u2014carnal, selfish, violent, a magnet for sin.\u201d</p><p>Julia watched as he sank to one knee, pulling a golden apple out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cThis apple represents what I\u2019ve become\u2014full of hope. And love.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the apple before her eyes sought his.</p><p>\u201cHas a man ever asked you to marry him before?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad I\u2019m your first.\u201d</p><p>He opened the apple like a magic box and Julia saw a sparkling diamond ring nestled against a fold of red velvet.</p><p>\u201cI want to be your first and your last. I love you, Julianne. I offer you my heart and my life.</p><p>\u201cMarry me. Be my wife, my friend, my lover, and my guide. Be my blessed Beatrice and my adored Julianne.\u201d His voice wavered slightly. \u201cSay you\u2019ll be mine. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Julia managed, before the tears overtook her.</p><p>Gabriel removed the ring from the apple and placed it gently on her finger before caressing her hand with his lips.</p><p>\u201cI chose this ring a long time ago, when I picked out the wedding bands. But it can be returned.\u201d His voice was wistful. \u201cI know you might want to choose your own rings.\u201d</p><p>Julia examined the two-and-a-half-carat, cushion-cut diamond in its platinum setting. The ring was old-fashioned with smaller, bead set diamonds that surrounded the central stone and graduated side stones that decorated the band. Although it was far larger and more ornate than she had ever dreamed of, it was perfect because he chose it for her.</p><p>\u201cI choose this one,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stood up and she flew into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you forever. Since I first saw your picture,\u201d she said as her happy tears spilled onto his chest. \u201cI wanted you even before I knew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you when I didn\u2019t even know your name\u2014just your goodness. And now I get to keep my Beatrice forever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 53</p><p>A few days later, Paul received an email from Julia announcing her engagement. It made him ill. Reading and re-reading her words didn\u2019t ameliorate his situation. Not one bit. But he did so anyway, if not to torture himself then to have her new status indelibly impressed on his mind.</p><p>Dear Paul,</p><p>I hope this email finds you well. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to answer your last message. Grad school is kicking my butt, and I feel so behind in everything. But I\u2019m loving it. (By the way, thank you for the recommendation of Ross King\u2019s books. I don\u2019t have much time to read these days, but I\u2019m going to pick up Brunelleschi\u2019s Dome.)</p><p>One of the reasons I don\u2019t have much time to read is because I\u2019m engaged. Gabriel has asked me to marry him and I said yes. We\u2019d hoped to get married quickly, but were unable to book the basilica in Assisi until January 21st. Gabriel has personal ties with the Franciscans, which is the only reason we were able to book the basilica in so short a time.</p><p>I\u2019m very happy. Please be happy for me.</p><p>I\u2019m sending your invitation to your apartment in Toronto. We\u2019re also inviting Katherine Picton.</p><p>I\u2019ll understand if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to attend, but it was important to me to invite the people I care about. Gabriel has rented a house in Umbria for the wedding guests to stay in before and after the wedding. You\u2019d be most welcome. I know my father would be happy to see you again too.</p><p>You\u2019ve been nothing but a good friend to me, and I hope that someday I\u2019ll be able to repay the favor.</p><p>With affection,</p><p>Julia.</p><p>P.S. Gabriel didn\u2019t want me to mention this, but he\u2019s the one who persuaded Professor Picton to supervise your dissertation. I asked her but she refused. Surely he isn\u2019t as bad as you thought?</p><p>Paul\u2019s gratitude for Gabriel\u2019s generosity didn\u2019t erase the sudden sharp pain he felt at the realization that he\u2019d just lost Julia. Again.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d already lost her, but before Gabriel\u2019s return there was the possibility that Julia would change her mind, even if that possibility was remote. Somehow the knowledge that she was going to marry him smarted so much more than if she had been marrying, say, some other schmuck called Gabriel. Like Gabriel-the-plumber or Gabriel-the-cable-guy.</p><p>Shortly after she emailed Paul, Julia received a package in her mailbox at Harvard. Seeing that it was postmarked in Essex Junction, Vermont, she opened it eagerly.</p><p>Paul had sent her a limited edition copy of The Velveteen Rabbit. He\u2019d written a short inscription to her on the flyleaf, which tugged at her heart, and enclosed a letter.</p><p>Dear Julia,</p><p>I was surprised by your news. Congratulations.</p><p>Thanks for inviting me to your wedding but I won\u2019t be able to attend. My father had a heart attack a few days ago and is in the hospital. I\u2019m helping out on the farm. (My mother says hello, by the way. She is making something for you as a wedding present. Where should she send it? I\u2019m assuming you won\u2019t be living on campus once you\u2019re married)</p><p>From the first time I met you, I wanted you to be happy. To be more confident. To have a good life. You deserve these things, and I\u2019d hate to see you throw them away.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be your friend if I didn\u2019t ask you if Emerson is what you really want. You shouldn\u2019t settle for less than the best. And if you have any doubt about it, you shouldn\u2019t marry him.</p><p>I promise I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Paul.</p><p>With sadness, Julia folded up Paul\u2019s letter and placed it back inside the book.</p><p>Chapter 54</p><p>Despite the fact that Tom gave his blessing to Julia and Gabriel (albeit begrudgingly), conflict ensued when the happy couple announced the destination of their wedding.</p><p>While the Clarks were only too glad to spend a week in Italy during the winter, Tom, who had never traveled outside of North America, was less than enthused. As the father of the bride, he\u2019d intended on paying for his only daughter\u2019s wedding even if he had to mortgage his new house in order to do so. Julia wouldn\u2019t hear of him doing such a thing.</p><p>Though the wedding would be small, the estimated costs were high enough that they would effectively damage Tom financially if he paid for everything. Gabriel was more than comfortable covering the costs, much to Tom\u2019s chagrin. It was more important to Gabriel that Julia have the day of her dreams than for her father to be placated.</p><p>Julia tried to smooth over the conflict between the two men by pointing out that there were things that her father could pay for, such as her wedding dress and the flowers.</p><p>In late November, she was on Newbury Street in Boston when she saw the dress in the window of an elegant boutique. The dress was ivory silk organza with a v-neck and little wisps of sleeves that sat high on the shoulders. While the top was covered in lace, the skirt was full and layered like a cloud.</p><p>Without further thought, she walked into the shop and asked to try it on. The shopkeeper complimented her, saying that Monique Lhuillier\u2019s gowns were very popular.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t recognize the designer\u2019s name, and she didn\u2019t look at the price tag because there wasn\u2019t one. When she stood in front of the mirrors in the dressing room, she knew. This was her dress. It was classically beautiful and would complement the color of her skin and the shape of her body. And Gabriel would adore the fact that much of her upper back would be exposed. Tastefully, of course.</p><p>She sent a picture of herself in the gown to Tom via her iPhone, asking him what he thought. He called her immediately, telling her that he\u2019d never seen a bride as absolutely beautiful as she.</p><p>Tom asked to speak to the boutique manager, and without Julia discovering the substantial price, he made arrangements to purchase the dress. Knowing that he was able to buy his only daughter the dress of her dreams enabled him to accept the fact that Gabriel would be paying for most of the wedding.</p><p>After saying good-bye to Tom, Julia spent several hours shopping for the rest of her trousseau. Among other things, she chose a veil that was almost ankle length, a pair of satin heels that she could walk in successfully, and a long, white velvet cape that would protect her and her dress from the January weather in Assisi. Then she went home.</p><p>Two weeks before the wedding, Tom called Julia to ask her an important question. \u201cI know the invitations have been sent out but would there be room for one more?\u201d</p><p>Julia was surprised.</p><p>\u201cSure. Is there a long lost cousin I wasn\u2019t aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d hedged Tom.</p><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>He took a very deep breath and held it.</p><p>\u201cDad, spit it out. Who do you want to bring?\u201d Julia closed her eyes and silently begged the gods of daughters whose fathers were single to intervene on her behalf and keep Deb Lundy from attending her wedding or worse\u2014getting back together with her father.</p><p>\u201cUm, Diane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cDiane who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane Stewart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane from Kinfolks restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Tom\u2019s gruff reply immediately telegraphed to Julia far more than he realized.</p> <p>Her jaw dropped in shock.</p><p>\u201cJules? You still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. Um, sure, I\u2019ll add her to the guest list. Uh, is Diane a\u2014special friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Tom fell silent for a moment. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d said Julia.</p> <p>Tom ended the conversation quickly and Julia put down her cell phone, wondering which blue plate special had precipitated her father\u2019s new romance.</p><p>Definitely not the meatloaf, she thought.</p><p>Chapter 55</p><p>On January twenty-first, Tom paced nervously at the entrance to the Basilica in Assisi. He was nervous. And the fact that Julia and her bridesmaids were late didn\u2019t help matters. He tugged at his bow tie as he waited. Then, a vision in white velvet over organza floated through the front doors like a luminescent cloud.</p><p>He was speechless.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Julia breathed, smiling with excitement as she walked toward him.</p> <p>Tammy and Rachel helped divest her of her cape and adjust the layers of her skirt, unfolding the train that extended behind her. Then Christina, the wedding planner who was hovering nearby, handed Rachel and Tammy their bouquets, which were a mixture of irises and white roses, designed to match their iris-colored dresses.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty,\u201d Tom mumbled, pressing a shy peck to Julia\u2019s cheek through her long veil.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She flushed, looking down at her bouquet, which consisted of two dozen white roses and a few springs of holly.</p><p>\u201cCould you give us a minute?\u201d he asked the others.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Christina pulled Tammy and Rachel to stand at the entrance to the sanctuary, signaling to the organist that the processional was about to begin.</p><p>Tom smiled at Julia nervously. \u201cI like your necklace,\u201d he said.</p><p>Julia\u2019s hands flew to the pearls that hung around her neck. \u201cThey were Grace\u2019s.\u201d She fingered the diamonds in her ears too but elected not to reveal their source.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what she\u2019d think about you marrying her son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think that she\u2019d be happy. That she\u2019s looking down on us and smiling.\u201d</p><p>Tom nodded again and shoved his hands into the pockets of his tuxedo. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked me to walk you down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked puzzled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get married without you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, shifting awkwardly in his rented shoes. \u201cI should have kept you when I took you away from Sharon the first time. I never should have sent you back.\u201d His voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d she whispered, tears overflowing.</p><p>He reached over and hugged her, trying to show her with his embrace what he couldn\u2019t say in words.</p><p>\u201cI forgave you a long time ago. We don\u2019t ever need to speak of it again.\u201d She paused, looking up at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re my Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules.\u201d Tom gave a strangled cough, then released her with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl.\u201d</p><p>He turned so he could peer down the long aisle that led to the altar, to where Gabriel was standing with his brother and brother-in-law. All three men were dressed in black Armani tuxedoes, with crisp white shirts. However, Scott and Aaron had eschewed Gabriel\u2019s choice of bow ties in favor of regular ones because bow ties were, as Scott put it, \u201cfor old men, Young Republicans, or professors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cIf you have any doubts, I\u2019ll call a cab and take you home right now.\u201d</p><p>Julia squeezed his hand. \u201cNo doubts. Gabriel might not be perfect, but he\u2019s perfect for me. We belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him that I expected him to take care of my little girl. That if he wasn\u2019t prepared to do that, we\u2019d have a problem. He said that if he treated you as anything less than the treasure you are, that I should come after him with my shotgun.\u201d Tom grinned. \u201cI said that suited me fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Julia took a deep breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do this.\u201d He offered Julia his arm, and they nodded to the bridesmaids to begin the processional to J. S. Bach\u2019s \u201cSheep May Safely Graze.\u201d</p><p>When Julia and Tom entered the Basilica, to the melody of \u201cJesu, Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring,\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes caught hers and a wide smile spread across his features. The January sun peeked through the doors, illuminating the bride from behind and making her look as if a halo shone around her veiled head.</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t stop smiling. He smiled through the entire Mass, including his vows to worship his wife and the performance of selections from Bach\u2019s Sleepers Awake and Mozart\u2019s Exsultate, jubilate by a solo soprano.</p><p>After the ceremony, he placed trembling fingers on Julia\u2019s veil and lifted it carefully. He swiped his thumbs underneath her eyes, wiping away the happy tears that had trickled down, and kissed her. The kiss was soft and chaste, but full of promise. Then they walked to the lower church and down to the crypt.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t planned to do so. Somehow, hands entwined, they found themselves approaching the tomb of St. Francis. In the quiet darkness where Gabriel had his ineffable experience months earlier, they knelt in prayer. Each silently thanked God for the other, for the many blessings He had given them, for Grace and Maia, for their fathers and siblings.</p><p>When Gabriel finally stood and lit a single candle, each of them asked God for one more blessing. One small miracle out of the lavishness of his grace. As they ended their prayers, a strange but comforting feeling wrapped around them like a blanket.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweet girl.\u201d Gabriel took her hand to help her to her feet. He wiped her tears away, kissing her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d she said, smiling up at him. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me. I keep wondering how this happened. How did I ever find you again and convince you to become my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven smiled on us.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to kiss her husband next to St. Francis\u2019s tomb without shame, knowing that her words were truly spoken.</p><p>Chapter 56</p><p>Later that evening, they changed into their honeymoon clothes, a dark suit for Gabriel and a purple dress for Julia, and sat side by side in a chauffeured car that he\u2019d hired.</p><p>Soon the car was pulling up the drive that led to a villa near Todi. The very same villa that Gabriel had rented when they visited Italy the year before.</p><p>\u201cOur house,\u201d she whispered, as soon as she caught sight of it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He kissed the back of her hand as he helped her out of the car. Then he was taking her in his arms and carrying her across the threshold.</p><p>\u201cAre you disappointed? I thought you\u2019d prefer some quiet time to ourselves, but if not, we can go to Venice or Rome. I\u2019ll take you anywhere you want to go.\u201d He placed her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect. I\u2019m so glad you decided to bring us here.\u201d She threw her arms around his neck.</p><p>At length, he pulled away. \u201cI think I should carry our luggage upstairs. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Julia grinned. \u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you see if there\u2019s anything tempting in the kitchen, and I\u2019ll join you soon.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward with a devilish look on her face. \u201cThe only thing in the kitchen that would tempt me would be you on top of the kitchen table.\u201d</p><p>Her sultry suggestion hearkened back to their previous visit, when they\u2019d christened that table several times. With a deep groan, he quickly carried their suitcases upstairs as if someone was chasing him.</p><p>In the kitchen, Julia found the pantry to be fully stocked, as was the refrigerator. She laughed when she saw several bottles of cranberry juice lined up on the counter, as if they were waiting for her. She\u2019d just opened a bottle of Perrier and finished preparing a cheese plate when Gabriel returned. He seemed years younger as he raced into the kitchen, boyish even, his eyes bright and his expression cheerful.</p><p>\u201cThis looks delicious. Thank you.\u201d He sat at her side, glancing at the kitchen table significantly. \u201cBut I have to say that I\u2019d rather our first few times occur in bed.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her skin flush. \u201cThis table has happy memories for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me too. But we have plenty of time to make new ones. Better ones.\u201d He gave her a heated look.</p><p>She felt the flutterings of desire increase.</p><p>\u201cWas the wedding everything you hoped for?\u201d He gazed at her eagerly, pouring two glasses of sparkling water.</p><p>\u201cIt was better. The Mass, the music\u2014having the wedding in the Basilica was incredible. I felt so at peace there.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded, for he\u2019d felt that way too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we only invited family and close friends. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have much of a chance to talk to Katherine Picton, although I saw you dancing with her twice.\u201d Julia pretended to be offended.</p><p>He eyed her in mock surprise. \u201cReally? I danced with her twice? That\u2019s pretty impressive for a septuagenarian. I\u2019m surprised she could keep up with me.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes at his pretentious choice of adjectives.</p><p>\u201cYou danced with Richard twice, Mrs. Emerson. I suppose we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my father now too. And he\u2019s an excellent dancer. Very elegant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than me?\u201d Gabriel feigned jealousy.</p><p>\u201cNo one is better than you, darling.\u201d She leaned over to kiss away his pout. \u201cDo you think that he will ever marry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his and caressed her knuckles gently, one by one.</p><p>\u201cBecause Grace was his Beatrice. When you\u2019ve experienced a love such as that, anything less would seem like only a shadow.\u201d He smiled sadly. \u201cStrangely enough, it was the same in Grace\u2019s favorite book, A Severe Mercy. Sheldon Vanauken never remarried after his wife died.</p><p>\u201cDante lost Beatrice when she was just twenty-four. He spent the rest of his life mourning her. If I were to lose you, it would be the same for me. There will never be anyone else. Never,\u201d he emphasized, a fierce but loving look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if my father will marry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it trouble you if he did?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo. It would take some getting used to, but I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dating someone kind. I\u2019d like him to be happy. I\u2019d like him to have someone kind to grow old with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to growing old with you,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cAnd you are certainly kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to growing old with you too.\u201d</p><p>Husband and wife exchanged a look then finished their food in relaxed quietness. Afterward, Gabriel stood and stretched out his hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t given you your wedding gifts, yet.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand and her fingers touched his wedding band. \u201cI thought our gifts were our rings and the inscriptions inside them: I am my Beloved\u2019s and my Beloved is mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d He led her to the fireplace and paused.</p><p>When they entered the house, Julia hadn\u2019t noticed that the artwork that hung over the fireplace previously had been removed. In its place was a large and impressive oil painting of a man and a woman in a passionate embrace.</p><p>She took a step closer to the painting, transfixed by the stirring image.</p><p>The male and female figures were wrapped around each other, the male naked to the waist and slightly underneath the female as if he were kneeling at her feet, his head resting on her lap. The female figure was bent forward, naked and wrapped carelessly in what appeared to be a bed sheet, clutching the male\u2019s back and sides and resting her head between his shoulder blades. In truth, it was difficult to tell where his body began and her body ended, so entwined they were, almost like a circle. Need and desperation leapt off the canvas, as if the couple had just made up after a fight or found each other after an extended absence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s us,\u201d breathed Julia as she blinked in shock.</p><p>The male\u2019s face was partially hidden by the woman\u2019s lap, his mouth pressed against her naked thigh. But it was Gabriel\u2019s face, of that there could be no doubt. The female\u2019s face was Julia\u2019s, eyes closed in bliss, a small smile playing at the edge of her full lips as she faced the viewer. She looked happy.</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood behind her and placed his arms around her shoulders. \u201cI posed for the artist and provided photographs of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhotographs?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned forward to kiss the side of her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize your posture? It\u2019s a study of some of the pictures I took of you in Belize. Do you remember the morning after you wore your corset for the first time? You were lying in bed...\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened in remembrance.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s usually sure tone sounded surprisingly uncertain. \u201cI wanted something\u2014ah\u2014personal to commemorate our wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it. I\u2019m just surprised.\u201d</p><p>His body relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She took his hand and gently pressed her lips to his palm. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely gift.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. But there\u2019s one more small thing.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the mantelpiece of the fireplace in order to retrieve a familiar looking golden apple.</p><p>\u201cHow did that get here?\u201d Julia smiled.</p><p>\u201cOpen it, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the lid and found a large, old-fashioned key inside. She met Gabriel\u2019s eyes quizzically. \u201cA magic key? To a secret garden? Or to a wardrobe that leads to Narnia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. Come with me.\u201d He caught her wrist and brought it to his lips, hesitating against her skin.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>He led her out the front door, closing it behind them. They stood on the porch, surrounded by darkness that was illuminated only by the lights that hung on the stone walls.</p><p>\u201cTry the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust try it.\u201d Gabriel rocked back on his heels, trying to hide his sudden anxiety.</p><p>Julia put the key in the lock and twisted. She heard the lock click and with a flick of her wrist, it unlocked and the door swung open.</p><p>\u201cThank you for becoming my wife,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWelcome home.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWe were happy here,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI wanted us to have a place that we could escape to, somewhere with fond memories.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to lightly touch her arm. \u201cWe can spend our holidays here when we aren\u2019t in Selinsgrove. You could write your dissertation here, if you want. Although I couldn\u2019t bear to be separated from you for more than a day.\u201d</p><p>Julia kissed him, thanking him over and over again for his lavish gift. They stood there for several minutes, reveling in one another\u2019s touch, their heartbeats quickening.</p><p>Chapter 57</p><p>Without breaking the kiss, he picked her up and carried her back inside the house and up the stairs to the master bedroom. He twirled her around, admiring the way the full skirt of her purple dress flared out as she spun.</p><p>\u201cI believe I owe you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Julia laughed as Gabriel pressed himself up against her back.</p><p>He reached over her shoulder to whisper to her. \u201cMake-up sex.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice goose pimpled her skin.</p><p>He rubbed his hands up and down her bare arms. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He brushed her hair aside so his lips could find her neck, and he began plying her with kisses. \u201cAnd just so you know, I have a lot to make up for. In fact, I think it will take me all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night?\u201d asked Julia, coughing slightly.</p><p>\u201cAll night and into the morning.\u201d</p><p>She had already begun to melt into his embrace by the time he retreated, pressing his mouth and tongue eagerly to the curve of her shoulder before letting go.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re getting ready for bed I want you to think about all the ways I\u2019m going to please you.\u201d</p><p>He traced a single finger across her neckline in promise before releasing her with a provocative wink.</p><p>Julia gathered her lingerie from her luggage and disappeared into the bathroom. When she went shopping for something to wear on their wedding night, she had been intimidated. She was unsure what to choose that he hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>In a tiny shop on Newbury Street, she had found exactly what she was looking for\u2014a long Merlot colored silk gown with a low neckline. But its crowning glory was the crisscrossing laces in the back, which plunged to an almost indecent level. She chose the gown knowing that he would delight in undoing her. In more ways than one.</p><p>She left her hair up and she swiped at her lips with a hint of sheer gloss before stepping into the black stilettos she\u2019d purchased for their honeymoon. Then she opened the bathroom door.</p><p>Gabriel was waiting.</p><p>The master bedroom was bathed in candlelight, scented with sandalwood, and Julia could hear soft music playing. It was a different playlist than they\u2019d enjoyed before, but she liked it nonetheless.</p><p>He approached her in his white shirt and dress pants, his shirt untucked and unbuttoned almost to his waist, his feet bare. He held his hand out, and she joined him, winding her arms around his back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exquisite,\u201d he whispered, his hands almost trembling as they traced the bareness of skin that peeked through her laces. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten how lovely you are by candlelight. Almost, but not quite.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d He fingered her pinned up hair, and she nodded.</p><p>A lesser man would have taken out the hairpins all at once, if he could have found them, freeing the strands quickly so he could move on to something else. But Gabriel was not a lesser man.</p><p>Painstakingly, he combed his long fingers through her hair until he alighted on a hairpin and then he gently undid it, letting down a single curl. He repeated this procedure until Julia\u2019s hair fell like waves against her pale shoulders and her body was alive with want.</p><p>He cupped her cheeks and looked deeply into her eyes. \u201cTell me what you desire. The night is yours. I\u2019m yours to command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo commandments.\u201d Julia tasted his lips twice. \u201cJust show me that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, I love you with all four loves. But tonight is a celebration of eros.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel plied her bare shoulders with urgent, heated kisses before standing behind her and stroking the exposed skin of her back. \u201cThank you for your gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour body, alluringly wrapped up just for me.\u201d He paused as his eyes swept down to her feet. \u201cAnd your shoes. Surely after such a long day, they must be uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>He began to toy with the diamonds in her ears. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause all I could think about was making love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of almost nothing else for days. For months.\u201d Gabriel inhaled sharply and began running his hands up and down her bare arms. \u201cI\u2019m the only man to see you naked in all your glory and to know the sounds you make when you\u2019re pleasured. Your body recognizes me, Julianne. It knows my touch.\u201d</p><p>Beginning at her lower back, he undid the bow, sliding the satin laces painstakingly through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Gabriel reached over to lift her chin to the side so he could see her profile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take my time. The\u2014ah\u2014more vigorous activities will come later, after we\u2019re sufficiently reacquainted.\u201d He pointed his nose in the direction of a blank wall, and Julia felt her skin heat in anticipation.</p><p>He slowly pulled the laces open until her back was completely exposed. Then he placed the palms of his hands flat against her skin and began to skim them up and down.</p><p>\u201cI burn for you. All these months I\u2019ve waited, waited to take you to bed.\u201d</p><p>He turned her so she was facing him and without ceremony pushed the straps of her nightgown down her arms. His eyes followed the sighing silk as it slid down her form before dropping to the floor.</p><p>She stood before him naked, her hands at her sides.</p><p>\u201cMagnificent,\u201d he breathed, his hungry eyes appraising every inch of her with painstaking slowness.</p><p>Not content to be the center of attention, she began to unbutton his shirt. She pushed it off his shoulders and pressed her mouth to his tattoo, nipping and kissing across his pectorals before making short work of his trousers.</p><p>Soon he was naked also, and she saw evidence of his arousal. He moved to kiss her, but she stopped him.</p><p>With eager fingers she began with his hair and explored his body, paying homage with fingertips and lips. His face, his mouth, his jaw, his shoulders, his sculpted chest and abdominal muscles. His arms and thighs and...</p><p>He caught her hand in his before she could wrap it around him, whispering sweet things against her mouth. Words of devotion in Italian that she recognized as coming from Dante\u2019s pen. He picked her up and carried her to the large, canopied bed, where he seated her on the edge. Then he knelt on the floor in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall I begin?\u201d he asked, his eyes slightly darkened as his hands traveled across her flat stomach and down her thighs. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Julia inhaled quickly and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cShall I start here?\u201d He leaned forward to trace her lips with the barest touch of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOr here?\u201d He caressed her breasts before letting his mouth take over, licking and teasing them. She closed her eyes and gasped at the sensation.</p><p>\u201cWhat about here?\u201d His finger slowly encircled her navel before he fluttered his mouth across her abdomen.</p><p>She moaned and tugged at his hair. \u201cAll I want is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen have me.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, and he responded by enjoying her mouth slowly, setting a gentle, languorous pace. When he felt her heartbeat quicken, he took her left foot in his hand and began to remove her shoe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to wear them?\u201d she asked, looking down at him. \u201cI bought them for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s save them for later, when we christen the wall.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was a throaty whisper.</p><p>He slowly removed her shoes and spent a few moments massaging her feet, paying special attention to her arches. Then he pushed her to the center of the bed and reclined beside her.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a soft kiss on the lips. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time to hear you say that and to know that you mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I mean it. The past is behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>Tenderly, he began using his hands to touch and to tease, his movements deliberate but passionate. He added his mouth, nipping and sucking to the tune of her sighs. His heart swelled in gladness at her sounds and the way her body writhed from side to side under his touch.</p> <p>When her hands moved up and down his back urgently, finally coming to rest on his backside, he spread himself atop her, bringing their bodies into perfect alignment.</p><p>Staring down at her, he whispered, \u201cBehold, thou art fair, my love; thine eyes are as doves...Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached up to press their lips together before she responded. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you inviting me inside?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded as a flash of heat raced across the surface of her skin. \u201cMy husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brown-eyed angel.\u201d</p> <p>His tongue played with her mouth as their bodies melted into one another, and soon they were one, their collective sighs muffled by teeth and tongues.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s rhythm was slow at first, like the patient lapping of waves upon a beach. He wanted this experience to last forever, for in that moment, as he gazed into the wide and loving eyes of his wife, he realized that their previous experiences, exciting as they were, paled in comparison with the sublimity of their current connection.</p><p>She was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. She was his soul mate and his wife, and all he wanted was to bring her joy. He was consumed by his adoration of her.</p><p>Julia traced his brows, wrinkled as they were in concentration, his eyes now shut tightly.</p><p>\u201cI love that look,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes closed, your eyebrows furrowed, your lips pressed together\u2014you only look like that when you\u2014come.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, and she saws sparks in their sapphire depths. \u201cOh, really, Mrs. Emerson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed that look. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d Gabriel sounded embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI want to have a painting or a photograph of that face.\u201d</p><p>He frowned playfully. \u201cA picture like that might be too much.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cThis is coming from a man who decorated his bedroom with naked photographs of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only naked photographs in my bedroom will be of you, my exquisite wife.\u201d</p><p>His rhythm increased, catching Julia by surprise.</p><p>As she panted out her pleasure, Gabriel buried his face in her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re so enticing. Your hair, your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour love makes me beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me love you forever.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back. \u201cYes, forever. Please.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel moved apace, his lips playing across her neck, sucking and drawing the skin lightly into his mouth.</p><p>In response, her hands grasped his hips, pushing and pulling until she was close, very close.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he gasped, moving more quickly.</p><p>Julia gazed up into the dark but tender eyes of her husband, so alive with passion and true affection.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, eyes widening and closing as the sensations overtook her.</p><p>This time, Gabriel didn\u2019t close his eyes as his brows furrowed in concentration.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed with every movement, every glide of skin against naked skin, until they were both sated and still.</p><p>Chapter 58</p><p>Just before sunrise, Julia awoke with a start.</p><p>Her handsome husband was by her side, his face boyish in sleep. It was the face of the young man she met on Grace\u2019s back porch. She traced his eyebrows and the stubble on his chin, a tremendous feeling of love flowing through her. A tremendous feeling of contentment and joy.</p><p>Not wanting to disturb him, she crept from their bed. She picked up his discarded shirt from the floor and put it on before tiptoeing out to the balcony.</p><p>The faintest hint of light shimmered from the horizon, over the gently rolling hills of the Umbrian landscape. The air was chilly, far too cold to be outside in anything other than a hot tub, but the view was unspeakably lovely, and she felt the need to drink in its beauty. Alone.</p><p>Growing up, she felt so unworthy of having her deepest desires satisfied, of being loved absolutely. She didn\u2019t feel that way anymore. This morning, expressions of gratitude bubbled up from her soul, wafting Heavenward.</p><p>Gabriel stretched out his hand to Julia\u2019s side of the bed, but found only her pillow. It took a moment for him to awake, exhausted as he was with the previous evening and early morning\u2019s activities. They\u2019d made love several times and taken turns worshipping one another\u2019s bodies with mouths and hands.</p><p>He smiled. All her fears and anxieties appeared to have vanished. Was it solely because they were married now? Or was it because enough time had passed that she knew beyond doubt that he wouldn\u2019t take advantage of her?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. But he was pleased because she had been pleased. And when she gave herself to him in a way that she\u2019d never been able to before, he treasured that gift, knowing that it was given out of love and absolute trust.</p><p>Awaking to an empty bed made him nervous, however. So rather than indulge himself in these silent musings, he quickly went in search of his beloved. It didn\u2019t take long for him to find her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he called, as he walked out onto the balcony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wonderful. I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch pneumonia,\u201d he chided, slipping off his robe and wrapping it around her.</p><p>She turned to thank him and noticed that he was naked. \u201cSo will you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, positioning himself in front of her and opening the robe so it wrapped around both of them. She sighed at the pleasurable feeling of their naked bodies pressed tightly together.</p><p>\u201cWas everything to your liking?\u201d Gabriel rubbed her back through the robe.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of conversation, if you recall. Perhaps I kept you up too late. I know we were making up but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little out of practice, but deliciously worn out.\u201d She flushed. \u201cLast night was even better than our first time together. And certainly, as you put it, more vigorous.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI concur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much. I feel as if our connection is deeper.\u201d She nuzzled his shoulder with her nose. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to worry about you disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I feel the connection too. It\u2019s what I needed. It\u2019s what you deserve. When I touch you, when I look into your eyes, I see our history and our future.\u201d He paused and lifted her face so he could see her better. \u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>Julia kissed him delicately and snuggled closer in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI spent too long in the shadows.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice brimmed with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to being in the light. With you.\u201d</p><p>She placed a hand on either side of his face, forcing him to see her. \u201cWe\u2019re in the light now. And I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I love you, Julianne. I\u2019m yours for this life and the next.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips once more and led her back into the bedroom.</p><p>Fin. </p> </body></html>"]
