Aware of the dangers inherent in the dark winter's night, he kept the speed of his powerful car well under control, watching out for reckless pedestrians.</p><p>However, in sharp contrast to the usual Friday night crowds, there was an almost deserted air about the brightly lit centre ofAuckland. He knew it was illusionary. The revelers were there but hidden in soundproofed, weatherproofed basements and upstairs rooms, full of pumping music that drowned out the driving rain. He'd passed one such room on his way out of his studio office. It had been the site of a wrap party for a murder drama.</p><p>A reed-thin blonde had caught him leaving the building and invited him to join in. Her eyes had been frank with invitation for a much more private party. Unfortunately for her ambition, he didn't play those kinds of games, and ever since Bonnie, blondes held about as much appeal as arsenic.</p> <p>After the day he'd had, all he wanted was some cognac and a hot bath.Taylorlooked like she could do with both. The poor baby was standing outside in the icy rain, waiting for a bus, her face pinched with cold. She could probably do with a hot man in bed as well but...</p><p>Taylor?</p><p>Standing in the pouring rain under a barely glowing streetlight, shivering and blue?</p><p>\"Dio!\"He screeched to a stop and then backed up, thanking God for the lack of traffic. As soon as he reached her, he leaned across and threw open the passenger door. \"Get the hell in!\" The weather obliged, butTaylordidn't.</p><p>The sodden woman outside made a face, as if debating whether to take his less than warm offer.</p> <p>Needle-sharp rain continued to pelt her, hard and certainly painful, even through the thick wool of her pantsuit. \"The bus is supposed to come any m-m-m-minute.\"</p><p>Her chattering teeth enragedJackson. For a second, he thought he saw fear in those big eyes of hers but it had to have been a trick of the light. He'd never met a woman less afraid of him than this bedraggled creature. \"Get in here right now,Taylor.\"</p><p>She looked like she was going to be obstinate, but then the universe took pity on him. It started to hail.</p><p>With a tiny shriek that was undeniably feminine, she scrambled into the car and pulled the door shut. Her trembling hands immediately went to the warm air circulating from the ventilation shafts.</p><p>He turned up the heat before pulling away from the curb to make a right turn instead of going left.Taylor lived on the opposite side of the city from him. Outside, the night had become immeasurably darker, but the hailstorm petered away after a short but brutal reign.</p><p>\"I'm wet ... your car...\"Taylorbegan, through lips that were blue with cold.</p> <p>He was furious with her. \"It'll dry.\" A plume of water from a passing motorist momentarily blanketed the windscreen in sleet. He slowed to a crawl until the vehicle had passed, taking the chance to send a glare Taylor's way. \"What the hell were you doing catching a bus at this time of night?\" His voice was a lacerating whip. How dare she put herself in such a vulnerable position?</p><p>\"None of your b-b-business.\" The sound of chattering teeth destroyed her attempt at a haughty dismissal.</p><p>\"Taylor,\"he warned, in a tone that he only used when his temper was on the thinnest edge, as she very well knew.</p><p>\"You're not my boss anymore, so don'tTaylorme.\" His passenger's unrepentant stubbornness was a living being in the air around them.</p><p>Jacksonwas used to being obeyed, especially by pretty young women. Everyone loved the man who could get them onto the silver screen, though he remembered vividly thatTaylorharbored no such ambition. He also recalled the steely spine beneath that beautiful exterior. Aware that the more he demanded, the more obstinate she'd become, he tried a calmer approach. \"I'm being a Good Samaritan.</p><p>Humor me.\"</p><p>She didn't say anything for a while but he figured that was because she was thawing out. When she finally spoke, what she revealed made his blood boil. All thoughts of calming down were consigned to the deepest hell.</p><p>\"My ride wanted more than I did. I left.\" Out of the corner of his eye, he could see her huddling into the seat. The small sign of vulnerability tore at him. All of his protective instincts awoke fully armed.</p> <p>\"Did he hurt you?\" His hands had turned into claws on the steering wheel.</p><p>A pause. \"No.\"</p><p>\"Taylor.\"</p><p>\"Don'tTaylorme!\" she cried again, but her voice broke at the end - another uncharacteristic sign of weakness. \"He was a bozo.\" She sniffed. \"I thought he was someone I could trust. We were at a party on the Shore thrown byDracena Medical - the place where I've been temping for the past three months.</p><p>My contract ended yesterday, but they invited me to the party anyway. When it began to break up, one of the project directors offered a few of us a ride home. I didn't realize that I was going to be the last one left in the car until it was too late.\" She was babbling, betraying her fear even as she tried to convince him of the lightness of the matter.</p><p>\"I'd never have gone with him otherwise. I thought I'd get dropped off first because the others live farther out, but apparently, they'd all decided to get off in the city and go dancing. He didn't tell me that. I still thought it would be okay until ... well, as soon as the others left, he started talking about ... s-spending the night with me.\"</p><p>Jacksonbecame quietly murderous at the evidence of this man's predetermination to get her alone. \"Did he hurt you?\" he repeated, knowing that she'd told him the truth about why she'd accepted the ride. He'd long ago learned of her wariness around most men.</p><p>She mumbled something under her breath.</p><p>\"Did. He. Hurt. You?\" He was ruthless, aware that her emotional state made her susceptible to questioning. Freed from the constraints which had forced him to keep his distance in the past, he would protect her with every breath in his body. \"Answer me.\"</p><p>\"He ripped my shirtsleeve when I was leaving the car. And he's got my purse. No big deal,\" she muttered.</p><p>A wave of red rose in front of his eyes. \"Name?\"Taylorhad always touched the deepest, most primitive part of him. Tonight, that part was beyond furious.</p><p>\"Jackson, I...\" She sounded hesitant.</p><p>\"Name?\" The night outside wasn't as dark as his thoughts about the man who'd dared to assault her.</p><p>\"Why?\" The question was far more confident, his stubborn, temperamentalTaylorrising back from the upsetting experience.</p><p>He gave her an imminently reasonable answer. \"How else are you going to get your purse back?\"</p><p>\"You're, um ... not going to mess him up are you?\"</p><p>\"What do you think I am - some sort of mobster?\" He was well aware that he looked like one. Big, dark and thickly muscled. Half of that was genetics. Being part Italian and part Viking tended to do that to a man. The other half was nightmares. Exercise took his mind off them. Add his black hair and eyes and he could easily pass for one of themafioso .</p><p>\"Maybe.\" She didn't sound timid, as one should while conversing with a mobster.</p><p>\"I'll just pick up your purse. No problem,\" he lied. This creep was going to have major problems.</p><p>\"Promise you won't hurt him first.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" The thought that this might've been just a lovers' quarrel rocked him. Pain squeezed his gut at the idea of her wrapped in another man's arms. Blinded and numbed by the horrifying revelation after Bonnie's death more than a year ago, had he left his pursuit ofTaylortoo late?</p><p>\"Because I don't want you in trouble.\"</p><p>The relief he felt at her response should have shocked him. \"Tell me his name.\"</p><p>\"Promise first or I won't say.\" She folded her arms. The smell of wet wool rose into the air.</p><p>He swore under his breath, well aware that she was mule-headed enough to do exactly that. \"I promise not to touch him,\" he gritted out.</p><p>Deprived of his preferred form of revenge, he accepted that the man could be taught a lesson in another way. He knew a few men whom he could count on to do what was right, and one of them was a detective in sex crimes.</p><p>There was silence from the recalcitrant woman in the passenger seat, as if she was debating whether or not to trust his promise. At last, she sighed. \"Donald Carson.\"</p><p>He nodded, absurdly pleased that his word was good enough for her. \"Are you warm yet?\" He was beginning to overheat, but she'd been soaking. She needed to get out of those wet clothes but he wasn't going to make that insane suggestion. Being alone with a nakedTaylorwas not the best of ideas.</p><p>Especially when the primitive side of his nature was blazing with the need to brand her with his mark.</p><p>\"Getting there.\" Her voice was soft, unintentionally stoking the hunger inside of him.</p><p>Desire burned through the anger, turning his voice rough. \"There is a picnic blanket in the back seat.\" He was aware that the cadence of his speech was changing, as his long-dormant instincts awoke. It was a habit that betrayed too much, and he made a concerted effort to rein it in.</p><p>He heard her move. \"It's still in the plastic wrap.\"</p><p>\"It was part of a gift. I threw it back there months ago.\" Rain pounded the windscreen as he drove out into a particularly unsheltered part of the road. \"You still live in New Lynn?\" He named a suburb about thirty minutes out ofNew Zealand's biggest city, under normal circumstances.</p><p>\"Uh-huh.\" Her voice was muffled.</p><p>When he chanced a quick glance, he saw that only her bright little face remained uncovered by the woolen blanket. With long black hair beginning to curl in the heat, and thickly lashed blue eyes smudged with tiredness, she looked like a bedraggled and bad-tempered kitten.</p><p>And he wanted to scoop her up into his lap and kiss and cuddle her until she melted for him.</p><p>His reaction toTaylorwent against all of the vows he'd made after he'd found out the terrible revenge Bonnie had taken on him for leaving her. Standing over his estranged wife's grave, he'd sworn to never again let a woman close enough to wound him so terribly. At that moment, while his heart felt like it had been ripped from his chest to lie torn and bleeding on the crying earth, such a vow had been easy to make. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>However, aroundTaylor, that pain-fueled promise held about as much weight as air. She'd affected him in an inescapable way since the minute he'd first seen her standing in his office doorway. Married at the time, he'd convinced himself that he likedTaylorbecause she was a good kid and a hard worker. Now, there was no Bonnie, and he'd seenTaylorwith her blouse stuck to breasts that were definitely those of a woman.</p><p>\"Where's your brother?\" He tried to lead his mind down less inflammatory paths, but all the while he was thinking that maybe it was time he gave his instincts what they'd always craved. A long, slow taste of sweet littleTaylor.</p><p>\"Nick's on a wilderness camp with his class, in Riverhead forest, just out of the city.\"</p> <p>That explained why she was out so late, as she organized her life around Nick's needs. He'd only met her brother twice, once during a barbeque for employees' families and again when he'd unexpectedly neededTaylorto come into work on a Saturday and she hadn't been able to find a sitter. However,Taylor</p><p>'s daily reports - glowing updates more like a mother would give of her firstborn, than a sister of her brother - had made him feel like he knew the boy intimately.</p><p>\"You're still temping with the same agency?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"I've asked for you when I needed a temp.\" Each time, the hapless replacement had had to bear the brunt of his unreasonable temper at her absence.</p> <p>\"Oh.\" She turned a little toward him. \"I didn't know.\" A pause. \"I don't work in the film industry anymore.\"</p><p>\"Why not film?\" Had she been avoiding him, he thought with a flare of anger that was rooted in possessiveness that he'd never consciously acknowledged. Until now.</p><p>\"It's not the kind of environment I want to be in.\"</p><p>Stopping at a red light, he faced her. \"Environment?\"</p><p>She shrugged, her cheeks a little pink. \"Excess, glamour, money, money, money.\"</p><p>He'd always known that she'd fight against coming into his world. \"What about art?\"</p> <p>\"What about it?\" she scoffed.</p><p>He smiled and accelerated with care when the light turned green. \"PoorTaylor. Disillusioned so young.\"</p><p>\"Don't patronize me.\" The order was sharp.</p><p>She'd been the only one of his secretaries who'd given him backchat. He'd offered her a permanent position after her contract ended, but she'd been adamant in her desire to leave. He'd wanted her more than he'd craved anything in his life, but honor had forced him to let her go, before he stole both her youth and her innocence. Yet, he'd kept waiting for her to walk back through the door. The memory made his voice curt. \"Sorry.\"</p><p>\"No, you're not.\"</p><p>He shrugged. \"What can I say? For a kid, you're very cynical.\" At thirty-two, he was only eight years her senior, but in his heart, he was decades too old.</p><p>Taylor's temper started to simmer. Why didJacksonalways treat her like a child? \"I'm not a kid!\" Her feelings around him were definitely those of an adult.</p><p>His big body tended to do things to her insides that scared her, because she had no idea what to do to feed those wild, hot feelings. With her history, she could never, ever allow herself to love a man, but the minute she'd met JacksonSantorini , she'd learned that she couldn't stop herself from lusting after this particular male.</p> <p>A deep chuckle heated both her cheeks and her temper. \"Next to me, you're a baby.\"</p><p>\"Crap.\" She was so furious that she could barely get the single word out.</p><p>\"Crap?\" He was laughing at her again, in that superior masculine way of his that made herwant to scream.</p><p>\"Age makes no difference to the person you become once you're an adult.\" She needed him to accept her as a woman, though she shied away from the implications of that need.</p><p>\"Of course it does.\" His response was infuriatingly calm. \"More experience, more life lived.\"</p><p>\"More years doesn't necessarily mean more experience!\"</p><p>His sardonic look dared her to prove it.</p><p>She did, goaded beyond endurance. \"I'm bringing up a child. Can you say the same?\"</p><p>\"No.\" His response was so cold that the inside of the car suddenly felt like a freezer.</p><p>It was clear that she'd offended him deeply with her careless words. Not for the first time, she wondered if his childless marriage had been his choice. \"I'm sorry,\" she said quietly, \"I shouldn't have said that.\"</p><p>\"It's true.\" An emotionless response.</p><p>She bit her lip, debating whether to continue. \"Yes. But so soon afterBonnie's death ... I shouldn't have said it. I wasn't thinking.\"</p><p>It was her own emotional anguish over the possibility of losing custody of Nick to her stepfather,Lance, that had made her so reckless. Even tonight's desperate attempt to forget her fears for a few hours had ended in a nightmare. Except for being picked up byJackson, her day had been sheer hell. And now, she'd made him angry. Somehow, that was the worst feeling of all.</p><p>\"It's been twelve months since Bonnie overdosed.\"Jacksonknew his voice was hard, but so had been surviving the losses a year ago. \"You know our marriage was finished long before then. Hell, the whole world knew.\"</p><p>They'd been married, but not to each other. He'd had his work and for a brief glittering moment of pure happiness,Taylor's smile. Bonnie had had drugs. They hadn't even slept together for over two years, except for that one fateful time four months before her death.</p><p>She'd been so lovely that day, a shimmering memory of the girl he'd wed, before news of her father's death had stolen her joy. He'd long since learned that that girl had been a mirage, but when she'd turned to him for comfort, he hadn't been able to deny her. Not when grief had ripped apart the mask of sophistication that had become her face.</p><p>And they'd created a child.</p><p>Whom Bonnie had murdered when she'd taken her life with a cocktail of drugs. If she hadn't, he might have been a parent, too, able to refuteTaylor's claim. He could still feel the knives that had sliced through his soul when the autopsy had revealed her to be pregnant. Further tests had proven that the child had been his flesh and blood.</p><p>But, even that incredible grief hadn't compared to his rage at discovering that Bonnie had known of the tiny life growing inside of her. She'd known that his child was in her womb when she'd taken her final lover, and she'd known that his child was in her womb when she'd ingested the fatal drug cocktail.</p><p>At that moment of understanding, hate had spread through his body like a virus, decimating his ability to feel tender emotions.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\" She could be nice sometimes,\"Taylorsaid, betraying the soft heart behind that tough exterior.</p><p>\"When she wasn't drugged to the gills.\" He knew too much about the kind of pain \"nice\" Bonnie could inflict.</p><p>\"I wonder why she did all those things.\"</p><p>He knew she was talking about the drugs and that final affair, unearthed by the press and gleefully announced to the world. What would she say if he told her thatBonnie's famous lover had been the last in a string of men?</p><p>He'd stopped touching Bonnie as soon as he'd discovered the infidelities. His love for her had died long before. After a lonely, barren childhood, her joyful charm had drawn him, only to teach him an even deeper sense of isolation. They hadn't shared a bed again, except for that day four months before her death. After hours spent at work inTaylor's company, aching for things he had no right to demand, his defenses had been at an all-time low. Seeing Bonnie smile after weeks of depression, he'd desperately wanted to believe that they could salvage their marriage.</p><p>As the forgotten child of an impulsive celebrity union, he'd promised himself that he would not repeat the cycle of divorce and remarriage that characterized his parents, and which had already spread to his three younger half siblings. Even the youngest, Valetta, had a broken marriage under her belt.</p><p>Driven by that promise, he'd kept trying to glue together his andBonnie's shattered relationship. He'd even letTaylorgo without a single touch, stifling the hungry need her presence always aroused.</p><p>But even his most precious vows had a breaking point - he hated Bonnie for teaching him that lesson.</p><p>The final straw had come the day she'd flaunted her faithlessness, meeting her newest lover in a place haunted by the paparazzi. That humiliating betrayal had forever severed any remaining loyalty he'd had toward the girl he'd married, and he'd immediately filed for divorce.</p><p>He still remembered her reaction.</p><p>\"Oh please,\" she'd mocked, cocktail in hand. It had been barely10:00 a.m.\"As if you've been faithful.\"</p><p>The tragedy was,he had. The only infidelity he could be accused of was of the mind. In his bleakest moments, he hadn't been able to stop thinking aboutTaylor, but he would've never touched her while a wedding band encircled his finger. Never . She deserved better than that.</p><p>After he'd walked out on Bonnie, a cautious hope had taken root in his heart. Once the divorce was final, he'd intended to seek outTaylorand see if someone so young and untouched could find something to love in him.</p><p>Then all of his dreams had crumbled to dust.Bonnie's death hadn't shocked him; she'd been trying to kill herself for years. It was discovering the murder of his child that had destroyed his hope. He'd been bleeding too badly to do anything but merely function.</p><p>Taylor's voice broke into the nightmarish memories. \"I mean, Bonnie had beauty, talent, wealth and you.</p><p>What was missing in her life?\"</p><p>Jackson's heart slammed hard into his rib cage at her befuddled tone. \"Maybe I'm not such a prize.\"</p><p>\"I know you're incredibly loyal and generous. Your protectiveness might annoy your wife but she'd know it sprang from deep caring. That would make it bearable.\"</p><p>Her naive belief in his goodness rocked him to the deepest recesses of his misbegotten soul. \"I wish you were a reporter.\" They'd savaged him afterBonnie's last affair, taken his humiliation and broadcast it to the world. JacksonSantorini's private pain sold a lot of papers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Bonnie had overdosed, they'd turned on him again, like a pack of wild dogs, vicious and unfeeling. But, they'd done such a good job the first time around, he couldn't give them any more rage or any more anguish.</p><p>\"Plus, you're gorgeous.\"Taylorwondered what she was doing. Her words were true. What was also true was that she could never deliver on the promise implied in the flirtatious tone. And even if she could have, she was nowhere nearJackson's league. The man was linked with superstar actresses whose beauty shone from the silver screen and glittered on red carpets.</p><p>Just last week, she'd read an article where a titian-haired actress had stated that the reclusive head of Santorini Studios was her dream man. Though the megastar couldn't understand why such an important man chose to live in so small a country, it made him all the more interesting to her. All the more desirable.</p><p>\"I don't think anyone would describe me as gorgeous.\"Jackson's response was dry. \"But thank you.\"</p><p>She scowled. \"You're not pretty, not like the actors. There's nothing soft about you. Your face is strong, interesting ... gorgeous.\" She wasn't going to back down. Just like the world-famous actress, dark-eyed, dark-haired JacksonSantorini was her dream man.</p><p>Some people might say that he was a little too muscular, but onJackson, the bulk looked good. Very, very good. She wanted to reach over and squeeze one of those taut arm muscles to see if there was any give at all. Then she wanted to bite down on that firm, golden flesh.</p><p>And therein lay her problem.</p><p>Jacksonhad been the best employer she'd ever had. The most demanding but also the most appreciative.</p><p>A permanent job with him would've been perfect ... if she hadn't stupidly gone and fallen in lust with her married boss.</p><p>Until she'd met him, she'd thought of lust as something frightening and dirty. Given her childhood, she knew that was understandable. But, the moment she'd seen JacksonSantorini in the flesh, it had hit her like a thunderbolt. She'd been flabbergasted, having no idea what to do about the heat that pooled in her stomach like high-octane fuel whenever he so much as glanced at her.</p><p>Even more disturbing were the other emotions that had crept in while she wasn't guarding her back.</p><p>Dangerous emotions like trust. And hope.</p><p>Not that she'd ever followed up on the attraction. Touching another woman's husband was an unbreakable taboo. Even if her morals hadn't stopped her, practicality would have - she'd seen firsthand what happened to discarded mistresses. But she hadn't been able to stop fantasizing about her sexy Italian boss, even as she adamantly refused to open the door to any other feeling.</p><p>When the media storm had broken overBonnie's lover, she'd wanted to slap the other woman for throwing away a man ofJackson's worth. Though she'd had no right, she'd ached to go to him, and try and soothe his unbearable pain. How dare that woman hurtJacksonwhere he was most vulnerable - in that proud heart of his?</p><p>It had been over a year since their last meeting but her feelings hadn't changed. Even her upsetting experience at Donald's hands couldn't alter that, because she trustedJacksonon a gut level. She'd never felt safe with a man until he'd started bullying her with his protectiveness, walking her to her car and more than once following her home late at night to ensure that she arrived safely. And he'd never made any demands in return.</p><p>The truth was, her sexy ex-boss still made her burn.</p><p>Jacksonwas stunned byTaylor's little speech. Nobody had ever called him gorgeous, not even starlets who thought he might be influenced by flattery. That was a lie too big even for them. And yet he knew that the woman in the passenger seat did not tell lies. Who else butTaylorwould've dared to inform him that he looked like he was strung out on cocaine when he'd dragged himself into the office one Monday after fighting with Bonnie all weekend?</p><p>The question was,what was he going to do with the knowledge that she considered him gorgeous? At that moment, his attention was caught by flashing red lights up ahead. \"Looks like there might have been an accident.\"</p><p>\"I hope no one was hurt.\"Taylorleaned forward, blanket clutched tight. When he glanced at her, he saw that heat had given her face a soft pink glow that was at once enchanting and innocently seductive.</p><p>\"Let's see.\" Reaching the poncho-clad cop standing in the middle of the street, he wound down the window. Sharp drops of rain immediately assaulted his face. \"What's the problem, officer?\"</p><p>The young man leaned down. His eyes flicked toTaylorand then back toJackson. \"There's been a three-car crash up ahead. Pretty messy. We're detouring people up through there.\" He pointed to an upward-sloping street on his right, the route marked with orange safety cones.</p><p>Jacksonnodded. \"Was anyone badly injured?\"</p> <p>\"No fatalities.\" His relief was clear. \"Drive safely.\" Moving back, he let them pass.</p><p>After turning up the small incline,Jacksonsaid, \"Look, you need to dry out and with this detour and the weather, we won't reach your place for at least another hour.\" Water sloshed around the tires as he came to a level section of the road. \"You can spend the night at my place - the drive will only take twenty minutes.\"</p><p>\"I can't do that!\" she cried.</p><p>\"Why?\" It angered him that she didn't trust him, when he'd never given her reason not to. Okay, so maybe he'd yelled at her once or twice while she'd been his secretary, but she'd yelled right back and they'd got along fine.</p><p>Once again, she surprised him. \"Because paparazzi stalk you. They're probably hiding in the bushes by the door. I don't want to be famous.\" She sounded determined.</p><p>He shook his head at her amazing mind. \"If there is a paparazzo there tonight, piccola , I swear I'll beat him up for you.\" The endearment slipped out without thought. \"Of course, he's probably already drowned.\"</p><p>A laugh escaped her. \"Well, if you promise.\"</p><p>Traffic being much lighter on this side of the city, they reached his eight-month-oldMissionBayhome in less time than he'd anticipated. Pressing an electronic key, he drove the car through the security gates.</p><p>About fifty meters up the drive he pushed another button to raise the garage door before driving in. It shut behind them, enclosing them in a dry haven lit with a strong white bulb. The sound of rain on hard surfaces was muted to a soft lullaby, lending an unexpected intimacy to the air.</p><p>\"Don't you think garages should have bleary yellow lights?\"Taylorstretched out to pop her door open.</p><p>He let her lighten the mood, giving her space. For now. \"You think something's wrong with my ambience?\" Stepping out, he found her standing beside her door like some sort of disheveled fairy wrapped in tartan.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him. \"When I'm no longer in danger of turning into an icicle, I'll tell you.\"</p><p>Biting back his first real smile for a year, he led her out of the garage, through the converted basement which he used as a gym, and up to the first floor of his home. \"Bathroom's upstairs on the right.\" He pointed to the stairs leading up from the living room. \"There should be fresh towels on the rails. I think the cleaning service came today. I'll find you a robe and throw it through.\"</p><p>\"Don't peek.\" She started to struggle up the stairs, trying not to trip on the blanket she refused to release, an empress giving an order to a lowly servant.</p><p>Shaking his head at her impudence, he dropped his keys on a table in the living area and walked into his study.</p><p>Ignoring the blinking message light on his phone, he placed a call to the Auckland Police Station. As usual, Detective Cole McKenna was pulling the graveyard shift. AfterJacksonexplained the matter to one of the few men he trusted implicitly, Cole swore creatively under his breath.</p><p>\"Your lady doesn't want to press charges?\"</p><p>Jacksonthought aboutTaylor's attempts to brush off the entire incident. \"I'd like to take care of it without pulling her into something messy.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that's what I figured. I need a diversion from paperwork anyway. Let's see - Donald Carson, Project Director atDracena Medical.\" He tapped some keys. \"Got him. I think3:00 a.m.sounds like a good time for a visit.\"</p><p>Jacksonitched to face Carson himself but he'd made a promise and if he saw the man, he'd surely break it. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"I'll swing by your place and drop off yourTaylor's purse when I'm heading off shift, just after six.\"</p><p>Yes,Jacksonthought, she was his . \"I don't want Taylor to start thinking I'm about to get arrested so leave the black and white at the station,\" he joked, trying not to let his frustration at being unable to act himself seep into his tone.</p><p>Cole chuckled, seeing through him. \"Lady must be something special if you're trying to behave.\"</p><p>They hung up on that note. His tension easing now that he'd done something about the man who'd dared to hurtTaylor, he quickly played back his messages. All four were from very smart people, including his mother, wanting something.</p><p>The demanding note in his mother's voice wasn't unusual. A rising star when she'd inconveniently fallen pregnant with Jackson to AnthonySantorini , her husband at the time, Liz Carlyle had had neither the time nor the inclination to raise her son. She'd saved that for his half brotherCarlton, born almost ten years later.</p><p>As for Anthony, the celebrated director's paternal instincts had finally kicked in nine years afterJackson's birth, when he'd sired Mario closely followed by Valetta, with wife number three.</p><p>However, now thatJacksonwas a success, both Liz and Anthony preferred to forget that the closest they'd ever come to parenting him was writing checks for boarding schools and nannies. Neither had any compunction against using family ties to solicit his help. Frowning, he noted the details of the messages before erasing them. He'd take care of their requests later.</p><p>After he took care ofTaylor.</p><p>Heading upstairs, he passed the closed door of his admittedly huge bathroom and entered his bedroom, knowing he had an unused robe someplace. Except when he reached the closet, he picked out his favorite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The instant she shut the bathroom door,Taylordropped the blanket and started removing her damp clothes, pausing only to place her cell phone in a safe spot. Clipped to the waistband of her pants, it hadn't disappeared with Donald. The small change in her pockets clinked as she dropped her pants to the floor - forgotten from an earlier purchase, the money would have been just enough for the bus.</p><p>She noted the sunken spa to the left but headed straight toward the shower. Encased in glass, it had an enormous amount of space, the fixtures steel and glass. Obviously, it had been custom-built for someone much bigger than her.</p><p>Immediately, her brain bombarded her with images of Jackson's muscled bulk in the shower, his arms bulging with strength as he did things to her in the watery enclosure that were surely not anatomically possible.</p><p>\"Even if they were, you're such a coward that you'd run a mile if he tried.\"</p><p>With a self-mocking laugh that was tinged with a trace of disappointment, she stripped and stood in the centre of the cubicle, under the three showerheads. The spray hit her so high that she was in danger of drowning. She reached up and tried to tilt them down but they wouldn't budge. Giving up, she stood shivering on the tiles outside.Jackson's firm knock came a minute later. Cracking open the door, she peeked around it.</p><p>\"You should be getting warmed up. I told you I'd throw it in.\" Hescowled, all male annoyance and faintly menacing good looks.</p><p>And yet she trusted him. He had a rock-solid integrity that defied her to put him in the same unflattering category as the rest of his sex. A thought nudged at the back of her mind but she pushed it aside. Her stepfather's attempt at wresting custody of Nick from her was her problem and despite his kindness, Jacksonwouldn't want to know about it. After all, she'd just been his temporary secretary.</p><p>She grabbed the robe, hiding behind the door. \"Wait.\" Snuggling into the garment, which smelt reassuringly ofJacksonand devoured her entire body, she tugged the door fully open. \"I need you to set the showerheads lower. I feel like I'm standing underNiagara Falls.\"</p><p>Shaking his head, he walked into the humid room. \"They're electronic.\" He showed her a control panel on the outside wall of the shower. \"See?\"</p><p>Taylorflicked her gaze up from her appreciative view of his backside. The man was muscled everywhere. She couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to run her hands all over that beautiful golden skin. \"How was I supposed to know your house wasgadgety ?\" Grateful that she sounded normal, she made a face at him. \"Okay, fix them anyway now that you're here.\"</p><p>Giving her one of his rare but extremely lethal grins, he did as ordered. \"Enough,shortie ?\"</p><p>Nurtured by the warmth of that smile, something woke in her heart, something that wasn't lust. Used to protecting herself from emotions that promised joy but could just as well lead to incredible suffering, she tried to ignore it. \"Thanks, Mr. Mobster.\" She could barely wait to luxuriate in the heat. \"I need to thaw now. Shoo.\"</p><p>He left with another grin that seared her nerves. Disgusted at both her physical and unexpected emotional susceptibility to a man so far out of her reach, she shucked off the robe and stepped into the shower.</p><p>Jacksonstood outside the bathroom, trying to relearn to breathe. It wasn't easy when erotic visions of Taylorin black lace dominated his thoughts. His lovely guest had apparently started stripping at the door and not stopped 'till she'd reached the shower. Ignoring the trail of feminine clothes, ending in a pair of black lace panties, had been a forced lesson in self-control. Especially when he noticed that the bra matched.</p><p>He hadn't thought thatTaylorwould be the black lace type. Showed how much he knew. Groaning, he leaned on the wall with both hands and dropped his head against the white paint. His shoulders were rigid with tension, his jaw set as he wrestled with instinct.</p><p>\"I will not seduceTaylor,\" he repeated over and over, and knew he was lying. Having her encased in his robe wasn't enough. He wanted her encased in him, while her body sheathed his in hot, wet welcome.</p><p>Poor, sweetTaylorwould probably run a mile if she discovered what he was thinking. Bundled up in his white robe, she'd looked even smaller than usual. Though she wasn't a petite woman, next to his bulk she appeared fragile. His biceps bulged as he tensed his body, trying to tame the desire rippling through him, hot and voracious. Its talons tore at his control, hungering for heat and abandon and sheer, unadulterated pleasure.</p><p>Taylorhad definitely awakened the sleeping tiger within him. The question was,did she have any interest in satiating it? Well ... she had called him gorgeous. Despite his frustrated desire, he smiled, remembering the first time he'd seen her.</p><p>He'd looked up from drafting changes to a contract, expecting to find a mature woman in his office doorway. The agency knew his requirements. He didn't want some young would-be starlet trying to impress him with her \"charms\" - he wanted superb typing skills not mediocre acting skills.</p><p>The woman in the doorway had had dark hair pulled back into a severe bun, lush lips softened only by gloss and lovely blue eyes. He'd detected a trace of challenge in those too-blue eyes, as if his reputation didn't scare her. She'd been dressed in a knee-length skirt and fitted jacket, both in solid navy, looking every inch the executive assistant.</p><p>He'd wanted to groan in despair. It would've taken a blind man not to notice that she was stunning. He'd known from experience that if he gave her the slightest encouragement, she'd pull out some undoubtedly beautiful hair from that bun, undo the buttons on her jacket and sashay over.</p><p>\"I need this dictation typed yesterday,\" he'd growled, throwing her a tape.</p> <p>She'd caught it and left, without commenting on his brusqueness. Dismissing her from his mind, he'd started to race through another piece of work, aware that without a competent secretary, his day was likely to end sometime in the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>Less than half an hour later, she'd walked back in. Handing him several typed sheets, she'd picked up his handwritten edits to the contract and returned to her workstation. Wondering at her confidence, he'd turned his eyes to what she'd given him and just about died of shock.</p><p>Stalking out, he'd stood over her desk. \"Name?\"</p><p>\"Taylor Reid.\" Her response had been cool.</p><p>\"Do you want to be a movie star?\"</p><p>Blue, blue eyes had widened. \"Good God, no.\"</p><p>He'd grinned at that disgusted statement. It had been the first time that she'd made him smile. \"Fine.</p><p>Good work. Do I have you for the next three months?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>His delight in having found an extremely efficient secretary hidden beneath the form of a beautiful woman had been borne out. By the end of her first week, she'd organized his office, caught up on the backlog of filing and yelled at him when he'd raised his voice to her.</p><p>And somewhere along the way, he'd found himself corning to work just to hear her tart responses to his questions, and bask in her sunny smile. They'd never crossed any line, never even touched, but in his heart he'd known that he wanted to claim her as his woman. Only his promise to himself that he'd be faithful, unlike his philandering father and womanizing half brothers, had kept him from taking her. Or perhaps it had been the fact thatTaylorhad seen him as honorable and he'd wanted to live up to her expectations.</p><p>Now, there were no barriers to what he wanted to do with sweet, sexy Taylor, and his body was demanding he make up for almost three years of abstinence, broken only by that one, bittersweet afternoon with Bonnie. After her death, he'd had plenty of offers and no trouble refusing them all. He'd thought his emotional centre had died with his child, taking with it his need for a woman's soft touch. But his reaction toTaylortold him that his body hadn't shut down, it had merely gone into hibernation, waiting for the one woman who could bring him back to life.</p><p>Taylor.</p><p>The shower shut off. Shaking his head, he pushed off the wall and headed down the stairs to the kitchen.</p><p>After her assault tonight,Taylorwould hardly be reassured if she found him waiting for her outside the bathroom, blatantly aroused and more than ready to peel off her single layer of clothing. He didn't know if he could control himself around skin pink from heat, body naked and touchable under the robe. His robe.</p><p>Then, minutes later, she walked into the kitchen, wrapped in that damn robe. \"Is that coffee I smell?\"</p><p>He'd kicked off his shoes in the living room and saw that she was barefoot, too. \"You'll get cold on the tiles. I'll find you some socks.\" He didn't even to try to fight his protective instincts toward her.</p><p>She came to stand next to him, holding out a hand for the cup of coffee he held. \"Coffee first.\"</p><p>\"This is ... mine,\" he finished, as she stole the cup and took a big gulp. He watched her swallow, heard her sigh in appreciation and felt all sorts of things harden in his body. Her fresh, womanly scent made him want to strip her down to her glowing skin and crush her body under his, while his hands stroked and kneaded. Frowning, he backed off a couple of steps. \"How are you feeling?\"</p><p>\"Better.\" She turned, cradling the cup in her palms. \"Donald didn't really scare me - I guess I just felt betrayed.\" Disappointment edged her tone.</p><p>He understood. \"You're safe here.\"</p><p>Her smile was glorious. \"I know. I trust you.\"</p><p>Dio!hethought. No way in hell could he seduce hernow. \"I'll get you those socks.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about it. Let's go in the living room instead.\" She put down the now empty cup. \"Are you coming?\"</p><p>Bemused, he followed her into the spacious room. A small music system was arranged in wall brackets on the left, while a large sofa upholstered in blue sat against the opposite wall. However, the main feature was the floor-to-ceiling window immediately in front. Stretching from one end of the room to the other, it looked out over the sea to the dormant island volcano ofRangitoto . Tonight, the weather obscured most of the view, allowing only a glimpse of crashing breakers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"It's so open.\" She walked across the plush dove-grey carpet to spread her palm against the glass.</p><p>He came to stand beside her. \"It's reflective. No one can see inside, even if they get into the grounds.\"</p><p>Next to him,Taylor's profile was clean and pure. The curling hair around her face looked like it would be incredibly soft to the touch. The urge to reach out and test his theory was so strong that he shoved his hands into his pants pockets and clenched them tight.</p> <p>\"Your home's very tidy.\"</p><p>To him, it looked barren. \"I don't live with a kid.\"</p><p>She smiled fondly. \"He is a tad messy but I suppose muddy sneakers come with little boys.\"</p><p>\"I'm surprised you let him go on the camp.\"</p><p>Her eyes moved from contemplating the turbulent sea to fix on his face. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"</p> <p>He raised a brow. \"You're very protective of Nick.\"</p><p>\"I'm his only family.\" Her defensiveness was clear. \"I can be protective if I want.\"</p><p>He left the topic for now, aware how touchy she was about her brother. He'd tried to broach the subject with her while she'd worked for him, but she'd frozen him out. At the time, he'd been frustrated at having to accept that he didn't have any rights over her brother ... or over her.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>He wouldn't touch her tonight, because he'd promised her safety and he would never renege on that assurance. But, after tonight, all bets were off, because he wanted rights overTaylor. All sorts of rights.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>\" One of the spare rooms is made up. It's to the right of the upstairs bathroom. My bedroom's across the hall if you need anything.\"Jackson's tone was businesslike.</p><p>Taylorknew a dismissal when she heard one. \"Yes, boss.\" She looked from the tumultuous weather outside to the powerful man standing next to her. He could be just as dangerous as the storm winds.</p><p>\"I certainly never heard that when you were working for me.\" His words were light but the look in his eyes was intensity itself, hot and possessive.</p><p>She knew what that look meant and had from a very early age. She just didn't want to deal with it. Heart thudding, she said an abrupt \"Good night,\" and left.</p><p>There was no lock on the bedroom door but she didn't worry.Jacksonwould never assault her. That didn't mean he didn't want her. In the past, when life had threatened to become too bleak or lonely, she'd hugged the awareness of his desire to her, safe in the knowledge that nothing would ever come of it. She wasn't that kind of woman.</p><p>AndJacksonwasn't that kind of man. His personal code was stronger than lust or passion. He wouldn't have broken his wedding vows no matter what Bonnie had done. But now his wife was gone and he'd acknowledged the smoldering fire between them, if only with his dark eyes.</p><p>Confused by her warring emotions,Taylorstarted to get ready for bed and then realized she had nothing to sleep in. About to search the closet in the room, she heard a heavy tread outside her door. A curt knock followed.</p><p>Opening the door, she foundJacksonholding out a white shirt. \"Thought you might need this.\" His voice was low and that banked fire in his gaze wasn't apparent.</p> <p>Her heart turned over. \"Thanks.\" Just as she took the shirt, her cell phone, which she'd dropped into the pocket of her robe, rang. Immediately, worry shot through her. \"That might be Nick. Hold on.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, it was her stepfather. LanceHegerty , on the line. \"Where are you,Taylor? No one's answering at your place. \"Where's my son?\"</p><p>She knew he'd said the last deliberately - a cruel reminder that Nick was only her half brother. No matter that she'd raised him, in the eyes of the law she had less of a right to Nick than Lance, his biological father.</p><p>\"Why are you calling? It's late.\" Her voice threatened to tremble. She crushed the shirt in her hand.</p><p>\"You haven't responded yet.\"</p><p>She knew her face was losing its color. Turning her back toJackson, she said, \"I have two more weeks.\"</p><p>A bare fourteen days before time expired to file legal papers in opposition to his claim for sole custody.</p><p>His laugh was cruel. \"We can do it easy or we can do it hard but I'll win. Remember that and don't forget your place, brat - you're nothing but a rich man's castoff. My son deserves better than a life with you.\"</p><p>She hung up, hand shaking. Lance could reduce her to tears with a few well-chosen barbs, but she prided herself on never breaking down where he could see or hear her.</p><p>\"Who was that?\"Jacksondemanded.</p><p>She could almost feel the heat of his big body against her back. The urge to tell him was overwhelming, but remnants of the fear generated by the call held her back.Jacksonwas a rich and powerful man, too.</p><p>He might take Lance's side. Bewildered and a little lost, she could barely think. All she knew was that she couldn't let that monster take Nick. Suddenly, panic hit her. What if Lance took him by force? She had to call the camp and warn them!</p><p>When she turned to faceJackson, the clean, male scent of him taunted her with promises of safety.</p><p>\"Someone I don't want to talk to,\" she admitted, trying not to let him see the panic riding her.</p><p>\"Do you want me to deal with it?\"</p><p>She shook her head. \"No. I think I'd like to go to sleep.\" Her words were blunt, her inner resources depleted by the force of her apprehension.</p><p>Though his dark eyes narrowed, he left, his shoulders almost filling the doorway. Despite the horrible feeling in the pit of her stomach, the urge to touch those shoulders made her throat dry. Big, strong Jacksonseemed like the safest port in the storm of her life.</p><p>Trembling, she closed her door and immediately called Nick's camp counselor. After waking her from a deep sleep, she made the poor woman do a bed check on her brother and then swear that she'd ensure that no one butTaylorwas allowed to pick him up, during or after camp. She wanted to go get him right now, but Nick had been so excited about the camp, she couldn't bear to cut it short.</p><p>Calmer now that she knew he was safe, she got out of the robe and into the shirt. It came almost to her knees and she had to fold back the cuffs several times before her hands poked through the sleeves. But, for some reason she didn't want to face, it comforted her to be wearingJackson's shirt. She crawled into bed, craving sleep.</p><p>Instead, fear hammered at her temples, creating an excruciating headache. Whimpering in pain, she sat up, aware that her suffering was stress induced. She needed to release some of the pressure by asking for help - by askingJackson? Out of the grip of the illogical terror that had bewildered her after the call, she knew that her fears that he'd take Lance's side were groundless. JacksonSantorini might be dictatorial and dominating, but unlike her tormentor, he had honor.</p><p>Life had forced her to be strong, but this time there were so many burdens on her that she felt as if she would collapse. Despite that, her heart rebelled against askingJackson. She remembered how his family ignored him, except when they needed his help. Becoming another burden chafed, but she'd do anything to protect Nick. Including asking the help of a man who made her wish for impossible things.</p><p>Afraid that her courage would desert her if she delayed, she jumped out of bed. It was only when she was standing beforeJackson's bedroom door that she remembered her only clothing was his shirt. Her knuckles had hit the wood by then and it was too late. The door swung open before she could retreat.</p><p>Jacksonstood in front of her, wearing a pair of white boxer shorts.</p><p>Captivated by the view, she lost her train of thought. His thickly muscled wall of a chest, covered with a sprinkling of black hair, was only the start. Ropes of muscle ran across his shoulders and arms, and his abdomen was ridged in a way that told her he carried no excess flesh. His thighs looked like tree trunks.</p><p>She'd been right - the man was muscled everywhere.</p><p>He shifted and she jerked her head up, aware that she'd been staring. But, how could any red-blooded woman resist indulging herself with such a prime example of masculinity? Especially a woman who'd been shown time and time again that this masculine power would never be turned against her. She expected to see amusement in those dark eyes, but something else awaited her.</p><p>Desire.</p><p>Hot, rippling desire.</p><p>Scorching desire.</p><p>She was familiar with desire - Jacksoninspired dreams of such erotic power they left her drenched in sweat. But she was even more familiar with desire in men's eyes. After she'd turned fourteen, her mother's boyfriends had looked at her with eyes hot with wanting. Then there had been that ... she didn't like to think about that much. It still made her feel dirty and used.</p><p>\"Cara.\"Jackson's husky whisper sent shivers racing through her, but she couldn't move away.</p><p>He tipped up her face with a finger under her chin and then bent down to press his lips gently against hers. Instinctive defense mechanisms kicked into place and she stood still, not fighting but not responding either. Frustration gnawed at her stomach as she realized that despite her age and knowledge ofJackson, childhood terrors still had a stranglehold over her.</p><p>He broke the kiss. \"My apologies. I did not realize that you did not accept my kiss.\"</p><p>So formal, she thought, so icy, when his lips had been warm and soft. She felt suddenly bereft but knew it was her own fault - the fruit of cowardice. \"I accepted.\"</p><p>He braced his right hand on the doorjamb, his face expressionless in a way she hated. \"Like a statue. I won't touch you again if that is what you prefer.\"</p><p>That option didn't sound good to her. Nibbling on her lower lip, she looked down at the lush grey carpet and then backup. \"I don't deal well with men wanting me.\" While she didn't trustJackson's desire, she trusted his intellect. He would never judge her for her fear, not when he'd been hurt so much by others. \"I</p><p>... had some bad experiences when I was younger.\" She hadn't meant to admit that much but couldn't bringherself to regret the confidence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jackson's protective instincts were jolted awake. \"Who?\" he demanded, his tone barely above a growl.</p><p>Closing the distance between them, he put one hand on her hip. He'd expected her to recoil but to his pleased shock, one fine-boned hand fluttered to rest on his bare chest. Heat engulfed his body but he ruthlessly caged the fire, aware of the fragility of her faith in his goodness.</p><p>\"I don't want to talk about that right now.\" Her answer didn't satisfy him, but then she said, \"I wanted to talk to you about the phone call.\"</p> <p>He was placated by that evidence of her trust. For this night, it was enough. \"Who was on the other end?\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you press for more information before?\"</p><p>\"I figured I had no right to know.\" Her face was so solemn, so lovely in the frame of midnight-dark hair.</p><p>He lovedTaylor's thick, curling mane. Dreams of the silky strands spread over his arm as she slept beside him had tormented him since their first meeting. \"Do I?\"</p><p>Taylorknew what he was really asking. \"I don't know if I'm ready to let you into my world.\"</p> <p>He was silent for a moment. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"You're...\" How could she admit that she was scared of what he made her feel, what he made her ache for?</p><p>\"You trust me, don't you?\"</p><p>The answer came easily because he'd always been far more than just her boss, no matter what she'd tried to convince herself. \"I'm here.\" And she wouldn't be if she didn't trust him on a deep, unshakable level.</p><p>That trust was rooted in the knowledge that he'd never coerce her to do anything against her will.</p><p>Jacksonwas a protector. And she needed his protection from Lance. More importantly, Nick needed his protection. \"Nick is the most precious part of my world,\" she whispered, making a decision.</p> <p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"He's returning from camp in a couple of days,\" she told him. \"Do you want to come pick him up with me?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Taylorfelt something change in their relationship at that moment. With her invitation, she'd accepted Jackson's claim over her and made a claim of her own. But did she have any right to him when her whole being was wracked with fear over Lance's threats to take her brother away?</p><p>\"You only ever speak of Nick.\" One big hand stroked her hair. Instead of fear at the intimacy, she felt a shy sense of pleasure because this was annoyingly protectiveJackson. \"Do you have no other family?\"</p><p>\"Not in truth.\"</p><p>\"Tell me what that means, piccola .\" It was a masculine demand disguised as a request.</p><p>Taylorfound that she wanted to tell him. He'd never been given any privacy with his life and it seemed only fair that be should know something of her as well. And the truth was, she needed to tell someone and aside fromJackson, who was there?</p> <p>The first words took time, but he didn't hurry her. Standing in the hallway with her toes digging into the carpet andJackson's heat surrounding her, she'd never felt safer. He might want her, but he would never force her - she'd stake her life on that. \"My mother brought us up, well, she brought me up anyway. She died when Nick was six.\" Keeping her voice steady was an effort. \"I was twenty and her death wasn't a surprise. She was an alcoholic.\"</p><p>To her shock, right then,Jacksonpicked her up and walked into his bedroom. The only light came from the full moon outside. She remained absolutely silent as he pulled a blanket off the bed and then sat down in a window seat similar to others about the house. He slung the blanket around her shoulders and held her in his lap like she belonged to him, while he leaned against the wall. She sat up but his body surrounded her. Protected her.</p><p>\"Why am I telling you?\" she asked, wondering how it was that she felt so safe with him. And whether she should be frightened at the reason behind the feeling.</p><p>\"Because you obviously need to talk. Did that phone call have anything do with your brother?\"</p><p>\"How...\" She gasped at his perception.</p><p>\"It terrified you. You only react like that when Nick's hurt.\"</p><p>Her nod was jerky. \"It was Nick's father, Lance.\"</p><p>\"Your father?\"</p><p>Her blood seemed to turn ice-cold. Taking a deep breath, she toldJacksonthe reason why Lance cared nothing if he destroyed her. \"He's not my father.\"</p><p>Jacksonlooked down at the flat sound of Taylor's voice. \"What?\" The urge to wrap her up in his arms and press her against his chest was almost irresistible. He fought the urge because he needed to see her face.</p><p>\"My mother, Helena, was pregnant by another man when she married Lance.\" She stared fixedly at the dark square of the bedroom doorway. \"My biological father was already married. He didn't want his mistress after she became pregnant and refused to get rid of me. She was destitute.\"</p><p>\"That wasn't your fault.\" He was shocked at the self-recrimination in her tone.</p><p>\"Lance never let her forget,\" she continued. \"Almost every week, he'd say something to remind her that I wasn't his, that he'd taken her in when she was 'knocked up.' He didn't even give me his name.\"</p><p>Jacksonfelt his hands curl into fists but forced himself to remain silent, aware that she needed to talk. It humbled him that she trusted him enough to share something so painful. He'd had no choice when his secrets had been ripped from him and used to sell newspapers, but he knew just how much courage it took to deliberately entrust another person with such private pain.</p><p>\"And she never stopped reminding me that it was because of me that she was stuck with a man who beat her when he was bored, and ... and used her.\" Her slim shoulder shifted as she took a deep breath that hitched. \"While I was growing up, Lance used to disappear without explanation for weeks, and then return like nothing had happened.</p><p>\"My mother used to wait for him, as if he'd come back and rescue us from poverty. Then one time, he didn't come back. They divorced when Nick was barely two.\" She stopped speaking, staring down at her hands.</p><p>Jacksonwanted to strangle her parents. Instead, he gave in to the urge to touch her and closed one of his hands over hers, not certain that she'd tolerate any further contact while mired in the past.</p><p>Her eyes were confused when she finally turned to look at him. \"Why did she love him for such a long time? Why did she? We both knew he had other women. Was she that grateful that he took her in when she was pregnant?\"</p><p>Jacksoncould imagine her mother's befuddlement at this child of hers who was so without deceit, a child who wouldn't allow her to forget grim reality in useless illusions. \"She sounds like a woman who lost her way.\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Poignant sadness colored that acknowledgement.</p><p>\"Where does Nick's father fit in?\"</p><p>Fear clouded her gaze. \"Lance didn't return for him after our mother died. Even before her death, I was the one who took care of Nick. But now he's back.\"</p><p>Encouraged by her lack of resistance to their linked fingers, he reached out with his free hand and stroked her hair off her face, shifting his body closer to hers at the same time. \"What exactly does he want?\"</p><p>\"Nick.\" Pain devastated the pure blue of her eyes to a dull shade. \"I'll fight him 'till I have nothing left, but I'm afraid. He's Nick's father. I'm only his half sister.\" She leaned just a little into his stroking hand.</p><p>He was pleased that she saw him as a source of strength. \"You've raised him.\"</p><p>\"You don't understand. Lance isn't some riffraff - he's rich. He always was, though he never gave us a cent. I suppose he married my mother because she was so very beautiful and he wanted her. But, then, he threw her away. He didn't care about Nick then.\" Desperation was apparent in her too-fast speech.</p><p>\"He told me that he'd remarried and had a stable home for his son. I think he only wants Nick because he can't have children with his new wife.\" She was shaking, as if with rage. \"I can't let that happen! Lance will hurt him. I saw him hit Nick when he was a baby!\" Releasing his hand, she clutched at his forearm. \"I saw him!\"</p><p>Gently disengaging her fingers, he took a chance and wrapped his arms around her. After a momentary hesitation, she softened. \"You must not worry so, piccola . I am here.\" Her pain tore at him. \"How rich?\"</p><p>\"He's a partner atHegerty Williams. He's theHegerty .\" She named a prominent law firm. \"He knows judges and psychiatrists. He said he'd have me declared unfit if I didn't give him Nick, and that he's convinced judges who are friends of his that I have a bad lifestyle.</p><p>\"I've tried to fight it but all my motions to the court keep getting denied and his accepted. I've fought every way I can but I don't know how much longer I can stall him. I'm so scared. I can't lose Nick. I can't.\"</p><p>Jacksonfelt his instincts growl in warning. How dare anyone threaten this woman? This strong, beautiful woman, who, unbeknownst to anyone, belonged to JacksonSantorini . He pulled back and tilted her face up with a finger under her chin, his anger intensifying when he saw that her eyes were shiny with tears she refused to shed.</p><p>\"Do you trust me, Taylor?\" If she didn't, he was damn well going to teach her to, even if he had to cuddle her in his lap all night long.</p><p>She nodded. \"Yes.\" Then she scowled. \"I don't think I should've admitted that.\"</p><p>He was pleased with her despite her dark expression. \"Then believe me when I say I'll help you.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry to ask this of you. I know how people always want things from you. I don't want to be like them!\" Her frustration was clear.</p><p>\"I know you don't think like that.\" He'd always had to fight her pride to give her the smallest consideration. Stroking the cool smoothness of her cheek, he said, \"Come now, piccola . Where is my little tigress?\"</p><p>Her full lips curved upward in a rueful smile. \"I think she's in hibernation.\"</p><p>\"That's more like theTaylorI know.\" Without stopping to think, he pressed a hard kiss to her lips, withdrawing the instant he remembered what he'd done. \"My apologies again...\" His gut twisted at the thought that he might've broken her fledgling trust in him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her fingers on his mouth stopped him. \"I ... I don't mind when you touch me.\" Her eyes widened, as if she was surprised by her own words.</p><p>He was touched by the admission. \"A woman should enjoy her man's kiss, baby, not merely allow it.\"</p><p>With her face bathed in the soft light of the moon streaking in through the window, she looked indefinably vulnerable.</p><p>\"I'm not sure I know how to enjoy.\" Her words were brutally honest. \"C-could ... you...\"</p><p>He leaned closer, enclosing her with his body. \"What would you like, piccola?\"</p><p>\"A kiss. Like it's supposed to be,\" she whispered.</p><p>Her words betrayed that for her, kissing had never been a pleasure. One day soon, he'd find out who had abused her, but for tonight, he would kiss her as an innocent was meant to be kissed - with tenderness and just a stroke of passion. Just enough to tantalize.</p><p>WhileTaylor's heart pounded so hard that she could feel every beat in her throat,Jacksonmoved one big hand to cradle her head and lowered his mouth to hers. Braced for pressure, all she felt was a teasing graze of lips on lips that left her with no idea how to react.</p><p>\"Just feel.\" He grazed her lips again but this time, lingered over the caress. \"It feels good doesn't it?\"</p><p>She nodded, throat dry. There was no pain, no force, nothing but the male scent ofJacksonand the burning heat of his almost naked body. Her hands were on his beautiful skin and she could feel the raw power barely contained beneath the surface. Despite the blatant evidence of male muscle, she let her lashes flutter shut. If he'd wanted to hurt her, he could've done so long before this moment. All those nights working alone with him, she'd never once felt less than safe. His old-fashioned sense of chivalry had even stopped him from inviting himself in for coffee when he'd followed her home.</p><p>\"Then just feel. Sweet, sweet,Taylor.\" His hand tipped her head back and he dropped a single kiss on her neck. She whimpered in surprise.</p><p>\"Relax for me, bellissima ,\" he cajoled, as his lips touched hers again, hot but undemanding. \"Feel.\"</p><p>Seduced by that deep voice, she did as he asked. She just felt. Felt the soft-hard duality of his lips, felt the tenderness with which he was coaxing her to open her mouth for him, felt the shudder that ripped through him when she did. Yet, he didn't invade her mouth. Instead, he teased her with feather-light strokes of his tongue across her lips. As each slow lick built her desire, he whispered hot promises to her in Italian, his voice darkly smoky, teasing,tempting but not delivering.</p><p>At last, she gave a frustrated little moan and pressed closer, her hands clenching in his hair to hold him to her. Only then did he touch tongue to tongue, a quick foray that didn't remind her of the forceful kisses that had hurt and shamed her as a girl, because he invited rather than took. Curious, heart thudding, she followed. His arms tightened around her, chest muscles tensing as her breasts were crushed between them, barely covered by the shirt. Beneath her bottom, she could feel the hard ridge of his erection. Panic tried to rise but failed, because despite his obvious arousal, his touch remained heartbreakingly gentle.</p><p>Their lips parted with a silky wet sound, deeply intimate in the semidarkness of the room. The man holding her nipped at her full lower lip with his teeth. \"You taste like you belong to me.\"</p><p>Instead of inciting fear, his possessiveness heated her blood. \"I like touching you. Kissing you.\" She was talking with her lips on his, her hands deep in his hair. The pure, sensual pleasure she derived from touching him enthralled her.</p><p>\"Good.\" There was a very satisfied glint in his eye, and the thumb he ran across the lip he'd bitten was nothing less than proprietary. When he pressed her down against his chest, she sighed and gave in.</p><p>Remnants of the passion that he'd aroused in herunawakened body glowed like embers, keeping her warm and relaxed. A new kind of trust took root in her heart, a woman's trust, a sexual trust, which dared her to take what her sexy ex-boss was offering and not look back to a young girl's easily bruised sensuality.</p><p>\"Are you awake, cara?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>A pause. \"Do you wish to tell me why you have such fear of men's desires?\"</p><p>\"I promise I will, but not tonight.\" She couldn't bear to taint the sweetness of that kiss, the almost unbearable tenderness of it, with such horrible memories.</p> <p>\"You must sleep then.\" He stood, with her in his arms.</p><p>At her door, he set her on her feet. She put a hand on his arm as he turned away. \"Thank you for your help.\"</p><p>Something dark shaded through his eyes. \"I do not want your gratitude,Taylor.\"</p><p>Somehow, she knew it wasn't rejection but a question. \"It wasn't gratitude. It was trust.\" It took courage to confess that. Before she'd met JacksonSantorini , she'd never trusted a male in the prime of his life.</p><p>He touched her hair again, a softer curve to his unsmiling mouth. \"Go to sleep, piccola . I will find a way to help you and your brother.\"</p><p>It was a measure of her trust that she slept the night through, without nightmares. Truth to tell, it scared her a little, this faith she had inJackson. A woman could be fooled into love with something as powerful as trust to lead her astray. And her love was the one thing thatTaylorwould never entrust to any man.</p><p>Not evenJackson.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The next morning,JacksondroveTaylorhome.</p><p>Prior to starting the trip, he'd astounded her by producing her purse. Cole had dropped it off early that morning, whileJacksonhad been working out. His friend had also indicated that Donald Carson was now so terrified of being labeled a sexual offender by the police, it was a sure thing that he'd never assault a woman ever again.</p><p>Because the sleep-deprived detective hadn't stuck around,Jacksonhad had to explain toTaylorthat he hadn't left her in the night and done away withCarson. He knew his tone had been edgy, his instincts still raw from being unable to go after the bastard himself. He had a feelingTaylorhad seen that all too clearly, because she hadn't pressed him for anything other than Cole's name on the drive to her apartment.</p><p>Now, while she changed, he made several calls to his legal people. An idea was brewing in his gut, but he wanted to be certain he was right. As he'd told her the night before, he didn't want her gratitude.</p><p>Neither his heart, nor his pride, would ever settle for such a paltry emotion from this strong woman.</p><p>He was the child of a broken marriage, reared by nannies and the survivor of a loveless union. It was enough loneliness for a lifetime. This time, he needed a woman capable of endless loyalty and utter devotion.Taylorwas the only woman he wanted and he hungered for everything she had. He would fight for it, but he wouldn't steal it. Not when she'd gifted him with her trust.</p><p>AtJackson's request,Taylorpacked an overnight bag and accompanied him home after changing into clean clothes. Exhausted from weeks of trying to fight Lance, she couldn't resist leaning on him.</p><p>\"I have to go to a meeting. Wait for me. We'll talk when I come back,\"Jacksonsaid after brunch.</p><p>She fought her natural instinct to probe, aware that she'd already asked too much. \"When will you be back?\"</p><p>\"As soon as I can.\" He touched his lips to hers in a light caress. \"Stop bristling. I need to talk to some people who won't appreciate an audience.\"</p><p>She scowled at his perception. \"Don't be too long.\"</p><p>\"Try and relax. You might want to think about whether you want to work as my secretary again.\"</p><p>After he left, she did just that, quickly deciding to accept. After all, there was no longer any need for her to hide her desire for her sexy Italian boss.</p><p>Jacksondidn't return until it was almost dinnertime.</p><p>\"Did you find out anything?\" she asked.</p><p>\"I am following something through.\"</p><p>She could see fatigue in his eyes and decided not to push for more information before he ate. Her heart, always fascinated by this man, became a little more his at the quiet way he was helping her. Several calls interrupted their meal but finally when there was silence she made some coffee and took it into the living room.</p><p>She handed him a cup. \"Here you go.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\" Curiously remote, he walked over to stand facing the window, his gaze on the darkness outside.</p><p>Shunning the couch, she perched on the third step of the stairs leading up to the bedrooms, her eyes on Jackson. He was such a big man, she thought, with wide shoulders and powerful arms. He'd shoved up the sleeves of his black sweater to bare thick forearms dusted with dark hair.</p><p>In the muted light of the room, his skin looked dusky but she knew it was warm golden brown, evidence of his Italian heritage.Jacksonwas a vibrant presence, powerful even when standing still. Silhouetted against the dark, he looked isolated and she couldn't bear to see him so alone. She knew what it was like to be separate, to not belong.</p><p>\"What're you thinking?\" she whispered.</p><p>He turned to face her, leaning one shoulder against the glass. \"What would you say tomarrying me?\"</p><p>\"Marry you?\" Her hands clamped around her coffee cup.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Cool and calm,Jackson's eyes gave her no indication of the tenor of his offer.</p><p>\"Why?\" He was her dream man, but in her life dreams had a nasty way of turning into nightmares.</p><p>\"I've talked to several lawyers and a judge I know. As Nick's biological father, Lance has strong rights.\"</p><p>She felt the bottom drop out of her stomach. \"No!\"</p><p>\"But,\" he continued, \"to retain custody, you can argue abandonment and show the court your ability to provide a good home. Unfortunately, having a husband will count, especially since Nick will need a male role model.\"</p><p>Confusion and hope warred within her. \"But what's in it for you?\" He was a powerful, handsome man.</p><p>Why would he want to tie himself toa nobody like her?</p><p>\"I want a wife - I've always known the value of family and loyalty, and I know you, too, understand those things. I need a hostess who I know will be exemplary. If Nick is still basically the same boy I met, we'll get along fine.\" He paused and then added, \"Because of your love for Nick, I also don't have to worry about word of our arrangement ever being splashed across the tabloids, should we part ways.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what about me?Taylorwanted to ask, despite the selfishness of such a question.Jackson's proposal seemed so cold and calculated, disregarding the emotional links already tying them together.</p><p>Before she could answer, he said, \"You'd have the security and stability you want for Nick. I promise you that whatever it takes, Lance won't touch him. I can tie this up legally for years, if that's what it takes.\" The hardness in his tone underlined each word.</p><p>\"But dragging Nick through that type of case...\"</p> <p>He put down his coffee cup before answering. \"That's a worst-case scenario. My gut says it won't happen. Lance's reputation is built on professionalism and discretion. He won't want his dirty laundry aired in public.\"</p><p>\"But he's already filed a lawsuit against me.\" She squeezed her cup, trying to warm suddenly cold hands.</p><p>\"He saw you as powerless. Family court operates a lot behind closed doors and he was probably counting on that. But once I get involved, he'll know that the media will sniff out every single detail, including the way he left Nick.\" His conviction made her want to believe.</p><p>\"What happens if we marry?\" Being married to JacksonSantorini was almost impossible for her mind to comprehend. She'd barely been able to handle a kiss and now this?</p><p>\"No judge is going to pickHegerty's side over mine, no matter how deep they are in each other's pockets.\" There was a harsh edge to his voice that reminded her of some old-world mobster, at once terrifying and magnificent. \"At worst, we'd get a fair hearing. I'm not going to lie to you, if that's what happens, it's likely Lance will be granted partial custody at least.\"</p> <p>She respected him for not sugarcoating the truth. The worst-case scenario was still better than the certain failure that she'd been facing until now. \"And at best?\"</p><p>\"At best,Hegerty will withdraw. In fact, I'm betting on it. He doesn't sound like a man who picks on those strong enough to fight back.\" His lip curled in disgust.</p><p>\"I'd do anything for Nick.\" She found her way with those words. \"Are you sure it'll work?\" For Nick, she'd even chance marrying the one man who threatened to batter down the painstakingly wrought walls around her heart.</p><p>\"Yes. I protect those who belong to me.\" The statement was without compromise. \"Nick would have every advantage.\"</p><p>\"So long as we're together,\" she blurted out. \"Your family's track record isn't so good.\" She wouldnot put Nick through the pain of gaining a father, only to have that father walk away. Her own experience at Lance's hands had taught her that sometimes it was better to never have a father at all. \"And what if we divorce before he's eighteen? Lance might try again.\"</p><p>He nodded, those dark eyes going even more opaque. \"I'm willing to make a commitment to a certain number of years together. I was with Bonnie for six.\"</p> <p>\"But not happy.\"</p><p>\"No.\" A bald truth.</p><p>\"Why chance that again?\" Despite her concern for Nick, she remembered the deep sorrow she'd sometimes glimpsed inJackson's eyes. That hidden pain had only deepened since their last meeting.</p><p>Something terrible had happened. Something worse thanBonnie's affair, her suicide and the ensuing media frenzy. Whatever it was, it had wounded him terribly. She couldn't bear to cause him more pain.</p><p>Worry for Nick andJacksoncollided. How could she buy one's joy with the other's unhappiness? She couldn't. Both her men deserved better.</p><p>And so didshe .</p><p>\"I hardly think you'll take up drugs and spiral into depression. You care too much for Nick.\" He spoke of their marriage as if it were only a business arrangement. As if the tender kiss last night had never happened. Perhaps that powerful moment of trust had meant nothing to him, used as he must be to far wilder displays of passion.</p><p>\"As for Nick having every advantage, I'll set up a trust fund for him, to be his whether we're together or not.\" He walked over to stand at the foot of the stairs, looking down at her from his considerable height.</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes, worry about his reasons for the proposal, and confusion over her own feelings, momentarily overridden by irritation. He'd better not offer her money as well or she'd scratch out his eyes. She had no pride where Nick was concerned but for herself, she had plenty.</p><p>\"I'd make sure you were taken care of,\" he began, his hand on the banister.</p><p>\"Stop right there.\" Putting down her cup, she stood up on the second step, level with his face. \"The only reason I'm considering this crazy idea is because it will help me keep my brother. I don't want your money!\" In her anger, she didn't stop to consider why he'd offer to sweeten the deal, when she was the one without options.</p><p>\"I'd be asking you not to work while you were my wife, even though I'd lose the best secretary I ever had.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" She put her hands on her hips. This reasonable man was not the passionate, wild creature she knew. Where was herJackson?</p><p>\"More than half my business is done via social events. Bonnie alienated a large number of people we need to woo back. You'd be working, but in a way that the outside world would never appreciate.\" He continued in that calm and practical way, stoking her simmering temper.</p><p>\"If we separated, it would be difficult for you to get back into the workforce. It's only fair that I give you something to tide you over. You'd never use Nick's trust fund and it would hurt him if you were without resources.\"</p><p>\"You really know how to hit the jugular don't you?\" Her tone was sharp.</p><p>\"It's a skill.\" His voice was uninflected but she knew that she'd hurt him.</p><p>Why had she done that? Was it because she was afraid of what he made her feel? She'd vowed to never love a man as much as her mother had, because she knew that in some ways, she was the same asHelena</p><p>. They both loved with a passion that could be destructive if it wasn't returned.</p><p>Her mother had loved the man she'd had an affair with, and she'd ended up loving Lance, too. Her suffering when they'd both thrown her aside like used tissues had been fatal.Taylornever intended to be in that position - never would she allow herself to be that vulnerable. Except sometimes,Jacksonmade that ultimate weakness seem tempting.</p><p>Unable to bear his hurt, she reached out to touch his cheek, rough with five o'clock shadow. \"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing to be sorry for.\" He didn't move away from her touch, but neither did he show any reaction.</p><p>She pushed her hand into his thick hair while he stood there, letting her do whatever she wanted. \"Don't you ever get angry,Jackson? Flat-out mad?\"</p><p>\"No.\" He looked into her eyes, completely cold.</p><p>\"No, you just go icy,\" she whispered. He'd yelled at her in the office but that had been over little things.</p><p>When it really mattered, he simply shut down. She wondered if he felt too much and had to feel nothing at all to survive. Her heart hurt for him. \"Well, guess what?\"</p><p>He raised a brow at her snappish tone.</p><p>\"If you marry me, you have to live with a temper.\"</p><p>\"I face tantrums all the time in my line of work.\"</p><p>\"Tantrums?\" Leaning across, she put her other hand in his hair. She trusted him to not let her fall from her precarious position. He didn't let her down. Big, warm male hands clasped her waist tight. \"Don't you ever say I have tantrums, JacksonSantorini , or I'll show youangry. \"</p><p>\"You wanted to know if I could handle temper.\" Despite her deliberate provocation, his tone remained even.</p><p>\"Okay.\" Until this moment, she hadn't realized the depth of his pain. Just who was JacksonSantorini behind his guise of powerful producer? \"How do you deal with the tempers in the business?\"</p><p>He gave her a humorless smile. \"You know we talk money and if the demands are unreasonable, we get hard-nosed. Or, we send in people to soothe their famous nerves.\"</p><p>She stifled a laugh. \"So, how's that going to work for me, Mr. Big Shot Producer-Guy?\"</p><p>For a second, he looked dumbstruck. Then he said, \"Guess I'll have to learn to soothe your nerves.\"</p><p>\"Nerves!\" she cried, before glimpsing the tiny spark of humor in his eyes. Relief at finally getting through to him made her giddy. \"Ooooh. You make me so mad.\"</p><p>The hands on her waist tightened. He lifted her up without visible effort and set her on her feet in front of him. \"How mad?\"</p><p>\"Sooooomad.\" She had to tilt her head back to look up at him. The position made her vividly aware of his size and power. He was so hot and alive. So male that it made the woman in her whimper for things she knew nothing about.</p><p>The moment stretched and she saw desire begin to warm those Italian-dark eyes. Involuntarily, fear shivered through her. His tenderness last night hadn't been enough to destroy scars she'd carried since childhood. He removed his hands, his face tensing, all angles and harsh shadows.</p><p>\"If we marry, I won't force anything on you.\" He paused, as if making a decision. \"But, I do wish for something from this marriage.\"</p><p>\"What?\" At last, she thought, a reason behind this improbable proposal.</p><p>\"A baby.\" His eyes were fathomless. \"If we can beat your fear and have sex, I don't want you using protection.\"</p><p>Taylorwas momentarily silenced, stunned by the request. Despite the newly awakened desire between them, why would he ask this of her, a woman who could barely allow him a kiss? Maybe he didn't understand the extent of her fear. She would marry him to keep Nick but she wouldn't trick him. He had to know that her problems ran deep.</p><p>\"I may never be able to give you what you want. Are you willing to never father a child?\" She had to make him understand that this wasn't something that would pass easily. It might never pass. Even if they managed to overcome her fear of intimacy, having children terrified her for a much more painful reason.</p><p>After witnessing her mother's despair, she wasn't sure if she could ever make herself that vulnerable to a man. Even a man likeJackson. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At that moment,Jacksonfelt dark, nameless emotions rock his soul.Taylorwas asking him to make a choice - her or a child. It was a choice that he'd made easily standing overBonnie's grave, but applied to this honest blue-eyed woman, it seemed terribly wrong. \"You are right, I am not.\" The words were torn out of him. \"How about we give ourselves a year? If there is no child, then we will part.\"</p><p>It hurt him to say that, going against all of his vows that he would not have marriage after short marriage like the rest of his family. But he'd buried one child who'd never had a chance to be born. He needed to replace that memory with one of a healthy bambino . The problem was, in his imagination, all his children hadTaylor's blue eyes. How could he possibly walk away from her if she didn't allow him to touch her?</p><p>And yet, how could he not?</p> <p>Taylor's next question was subdued, as if she hadn't expected the time limit. \"And Nick?\"</p><p>\"I think we can fix things so that Lance has no chance, even if we're not together.\" He looked at her and said bluntly, \"Tell me the reason behind your fear of sex.\"</p><p>Taylorput her hands on his hard chest, dismayed at her disappointment. She should've been celebrating a husband who only wanted a child from her, not love. Or had she cherished some hidden dream of a far more romantic proposal? If she had, it had been a girlish fancy. A bargain like this was far safer.</p><p>Romance and love died but JacksonSantorini would never renege on an agreement.</p><p>\"It's not you. Please know that,\" she said, at last.</p> <p>His scowl made him look more like a mobster than ever. \"Was it someone your mother brought home?\"</p><p>His voice had dropped an octave into the deep and menacing range. He put his hands around her waist again, and this time the warmth and weight of them calmed her.</p><p>She swallowed. \"It was a maintenance man.\" Her voice shook as she revealed something she'd never told any one. There was more, much more, but she didn't have the courage to tell him the whole truth at once.</p><p>\"What did he do?\"Jackson's voice rasped and the hands on her hips pulled her closer, as if he couldn't stop the protective movement. Shewent, glad to be near his warmth.</p><p>\"I ... developed around fourteen. That was when he started staring at me. I didn't know what that look meant then, hadn't learned.\" It mattered thatJacksonunderstand, that he didn't look at her with those icy eyes when she couldn't respond beyond the most innocent caresses, because she cared what he thought of her. \"He followed me to the laundry room. I thought he was going to fix a broken machine.\" Even now, she could feel her fear when she'd finally realized that he was just standing there in the corner, watching her, eyes slimy.</p><p>\"When I tried to go up the stairs after I loaded the machine ... he stalked me until I starting backing up. I dropped the basket and tried to get away but he - he grabbed me and pushed me hard against a linen closet down there.\" Tears streaked down her face and she was that terrified young girl again. \"I was so scared. He said he could understand my fear. He'd teach me not to be afraid. He'd make me like it. And you know what made it worse?\"</p> <p>\"Tell me, piccola .\"One big hand was stroking her hair, while the other was pressed flat on her lower back.</p><p>\"I kind of had a crush on him before that. He was a university student working part-time. Good-looking.</p><p>Smart.\" She pressed her cheek againstJackson's chest, wrapping her arms around his waist. \"I didn't think he'd be vicious like Lance was to my mother. God, I was a fool.\" She took a gasping breath and admitted the most horrible part of it. \"It was my first kiss. He split the inside of my lip. The bruises on my arms and back didn't fade for weeks.\"</p><p>\"Taylor.\"Jackson's voice was gruff, giving her permission to end this if it hurt too much.</p><p>She couldn't stop now. \"He was pressed up against me and I could feel him ... being aroused. I fought but he was too strong. I thought he'd keep hurting me but then someone came down the stairs. He'd forgotten to lock the door.\"</p><p>\"You had a chance to escape?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" She'd thanked God over and over while she'd thrown up in the bathroom.</p><p>\"Did he touch you again?\" The quiet rage inJackson's voice somehow soothed her.</p> <p>She shook her head against him, unwilling to lose the steady sound of his heartbeat. \"He watched me but I stopped going anywhere in the building by myself. I encouraged the children in the other apartments to tag along everywhere. Grant - the maintenance guy couldn't risk offending their families by scaring them off. Some of their parents wouldn't have thought twice about taking care of him.\"</p><p>\"Grant? Grant who?\"Jacksondemanded.</p><p>\"I won't let you get in trouble.\" She set her jaw.</p><p>\"I promise you I won't. But I need to do something - you didn't let me have Donald.\" There was such ferocious anger in his request that she worried about him.</p><p>\"No!\"</p><p>\" Cara mia, please.\"</p><p>She bit her lip, undone by the softly spoken endearment. Sometimes she forgot thatJackson's father was Italian, but right now, she could very well believe that this man came from a land that believed in vengeance and an eye for an eye. \"I can't prove it.\"</p><p>\"You don't need to prove it to me other than by your words and I am the only one who matters.\" He was holding her so close, so very close, but she wasn't afraid. There was just some part of her that refused to place him in the same category as other men. Did that make her a fool, or was she being given a precious chance to fight the lessons of the past and seize something glorious?</p><p>\"Grant Layton.\" It was too hard to resist the temptation to tell the one man who'd ever cared about her.</p><p>\"Thank you, piccola . Thank you.\" His embrace tightened, his potent masculinity surrounding her.</p><p>Close contact didn't scare her. It was only when anything sexual happened that she was that fourteen-year-old again, backed up against the door of the cupboard, with the handle digging into her back. Her mind had been black with fear and betrayal as the object of her teenage crush had destroyed her innocence before it had a chance to blossom. But perhaps her childhood heart might've recovered from that, if something worse hadn't happened.</p><p>Jackson's hand moved up and down her spine, soothing strokes that relaxed her. \"Thank you for telling me.\"</p><p>\"You had to know,\" she whispered. \"I won't steal your happiness to find my own. I'd run with Nick before I'd do that.\" He deserved better than a woman so damaged she'd resigned herself to a lifetime of loneliness.</p><p>\"You're traumatized.\" He kept stroking her. \"We can get you counseling if you want.\"</p><p>She started shaking her head before he could finish. \"The thought of exposing my thoughts for a stranger to pick through ... no. I'd rather trust you with my secrets.\"</p><p>He was silent for a long time and she thought that she'd asked too much of this man who guarded his emotions so carefully. He'd offered her a pragmatic bargain. There had been no mention of gentler, softer feelings.</p><p>\"I am honored.\" His heart thudded under her cheek. \"But, I might not be the best choice. I want you.\"</p><p>\"Will you force me?\"</p><p>\"Never.\"</p><p>\"In my heart, I've always known that.\"</p><p>Jacksonwas stunned by that calm acceptance of his promise when he was starting to see thatTaylorhad experienced only fear and violence from the men in her life. She hadn't said anything to indicate further abuse, but if the young maintenance man had noticed her developing beauty, what had other, older men noticed? And what had they done to his sweetTaylor? He stifled his questions for the moment, aware that she was emotionally wrung out. \"How?\" he asked instead.</p><p>A pause, then, \"You might hurt me with indifference and coldness but you'd never physically abuse me.\"</p><p>He winced at her honest response. \"I'm not indifferent to you.\" But he was a cold man. He'd had to become one to survive his solitary childhood and then Bonnie. The last blow had been the loss of his child.</p><p>He neededTaylor's fire as his anchor against the coldness swallowing him alive, needed her to be the candle in the darkness that brought him back home. And though he'd never let her know, he needed her love. Because he did, he fought for her. \"I will always be there for you, but I know of a therapist who specializes in sexual trauma.\" He'd made it his business to find out that information earlier today.</p><p>Taylortensed. \"I don't know...\"</p><p>\"Can you try, cara? She might help you in ways I have no knowledge of.\" His need to encourage her spirit overcame his desire to be her strength. Faced with her pain, his first instinct would be to reassure and shield, possibly thwarting her recovery. The therapist would be far tougher, forcingTaylorto use the courage that had let her successfully raise a child, to heal herself.</p><p>This time, it was her hand that stroked his spine. \"I'll try ... we can learn together.\"</p><p>What was she offering to teach him? He didn't care. He'd take whatever she could give him. It was a disturbing thought.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Taylorawoke inJackson's guest bedroom on Sunday morning, wearing his big white shirt. Rain beat overhead, a rough lullaby that signaled the return of the storm. Warm and comfortable, she had no desire to rise.</p><p>A sharp knock on her door made her scowl. \"Come in.\"</p><p>Jacksonpushed the door open and stood in the doorway, clad all in black. \"We have to talk.\"</p><p>She yawned and pulled out one hand from her cocoon to pat at the bedspread. \"Sit.\"</p><p>There was an inferno in his caressing gaze. \" Cara mia, I am only a man.\"</p><p>Her heart thundered. \"Please?\" Why was she making him do this? Was she testing his promise that he wouldn't force her to do things that terrified her?</p><p>Sighing, he came and sat beside her. \"Happy?\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" she teased. \"Where's my engagement ring, JacksonSantorini ?\" She was trying to be lighthearted, for what right did she have to demand anything? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her surprise, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a finely made gold ring with tiny shards of diamond embedded in the beautiful scrollwork. Despite its simplicity, she knew it was no ordinary ring.</p><p>Her hand trembled as he slid it onto her ring finger, under the rain-drenched sunlight falling through the skylight.</p><p>\"Jackson, this is so lovely.\" Her voice was barely a whisper as, sittingup, she stared at the ancient gold.</p><p>His smile was slow. \"The ring was my paternal grandmother's. Her name wasGia and she was married to my grandfather Josef for over fifty years.\"</p><p>Her eyes smarted with tears. No one had ever given her something so precious, so from the heart.</p><p>\"Why are you crying?\"</p><p>\"I'm not.\" She rubbed at her eyes with her free hand.</p><p>\" Piccola.\" He reached out and pulled her from the blankets and onto his lap, pressing her cheek against his chest. Instead of fear at the intimacy, she felt a fierce sense of belonging. \"Why do you cry like this?\"</p><p>The sudden change in the cadence of his voice startled her. \"You sound so Italian.\"</p><p>\"I am Italian.\" He stroked her hair in that way of his. She'd never imagined that such a big man could be so incredibly tender. \"Have you stopped crying?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" She kept her head against his chest. \"Thank you for the ring.\" She wanted to ask if Bonnie had ever worn it but couldn't find the courage. After all, despite the hurt that his first wife had caused him, he'd loved her when they'd married. It hadn't been just a bargain.</p><p>\"The ring has been sitting in a vault for ten years. You will bring it to the light once more.\"</p><p>The words made her heart swell. Maybe it was selfish, but she wanted a part of him that Bonnie hadn't seen and hurt. She didn't know the details of what they'd done to each other, but she knew that the results had devastated the man holding her so very carefully. The feel of his hard body made her want to luxuriate in him, but the slight tension in his muscles reminded her that this wasn't fair.</p><p>She moved off his lap. \"I'll meet you downstairs for breakfast - I'll cook.\"</p><p>\"I'll look forward to it.\" He rose at once, and with a pang in her heart, she knew that he'd been waiting for the moment when she'd set him free.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she watchedJacksonpick up a fork and use the edge to cut the corner off a pancake. She watched his lips as he forked in the bite, and somewhere along the way her desire to know if he enjoyed her cooking was overcome by the urge to taste his lips. To try and see if she could come out of sexual deep freeze.</p><p>\"Good.\"</p><p>The short accolade snapped her out of her sudden, sensual need to explore the man she was going to marry. Quickly, she choked down some of her own breakfast.</p><p>\"We'll marry within the week,\"Jacksonsaid after she'd taken a few bites, his tone matter-of-fact.</p><p>Her mouth felt fuzzy with nervous tension, but she managed to ask, \"Won't a sudden marriage look odd?\"</p><p>He raised a brow. \"We've been secretly seeing each other for months, not wishing to be dogged by paparazzi.\"</p><p>\"Clever.\"</p> <p>He acknowledged the compliment with a wry smile. \"Valetta did something like that when she decided she was ready for marriage. That lasted about six months - a record even in my family.\"</p><p>\"How is your sister anyway?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. Haven't seen her for months.\"</p><p>\"Don't you care?\" She couldn't hide her disapproval.</p><p>\"My family is not close like you and Nick.\" His clipped response didn't encourage further conversation on that topic. Strung taut as she was, she didn't have the inclination to pursue it today. \"I believe we can be married by Tuesday.\"</p><p>\"Tuesday.\" She put down her fork. \"Registry?\" A twinge of pain arrowed through her heart. Despite the nature of their bargain, she didn't want this marriage to start out so very practically, devoid of any hint of hope.</p><p>\"Only if that is what you wish.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" She looked up, wondering at the change inJackson's speech rhythms. As usual, it had happened without warning. At first, she'd thought it was caused by strong emotion, but that couldn't be true, because he was very calm. Whatever it was, the more Italian he sounded, the worse her self-control became.</p><p>\"There is an isolated farmstead about an hour out by helicopter. It is often used as a wedding venue. I've checked and we can have it for Tuesday if we want.\"</p><p>\"But it's Sunday today! We couldn't organize everything by then ... could we?\" Hope blossomed.</p><p>His beautifully shaped lips gentled into a smile. \"If we could, do you want the farmhouse?\"</p><p>\"Of course. I'd like to invite some friends.\"</p><p>In the next few hours,Taylorlearned about the power of money and charisma. Shops opened just for them, caterers called in relief staff, florists ordered shipments of flowers in special air packages and a couturier flew in from a weekend retreat to show her his wedding collection.</p><p>\"Come in, come in.\"The little artiste waved them through to his upstairs showroom.</p><p>Flustered, she looked up at the darkly beautiful man who was her companion. \"Jackson?\"</p><p>\"Hmm.\" He bent his head a little, hand on her lower back. She'd always guessed that he was a possessive man and he'd let her see that side of him today. No one who met her was in any doubt that she was nowSantorini's woman.</p><p>Taylorfelt ambivalent about the claiming. Part of her was delighted. But, another part of her, the lost, lonely, abandoned girl, was terrified. Yes, he was claiming her now but there was a time limit on their relationship. If she didn't give him what he wanted, he'd abandon her, just like everyone else. The brutal truth was that this was nothing more than a business deal.</p><p>Faced with the couturier, she was lost. \"What am I supposed to do?\" she askedJackson, her voice a whisper. She had never been a rich girl, in spite of Lance's wealth. He'd never treated them to any luxury, and had begrudged them every penny he did spare.</p><p>Jackson's hand curved over her hip, blatantly proprietary. \"You're a very valued customer. Take only what appeals.\" The caress in his voice touched her deep within, even though she tried to remain unmoved. How could she hope to resist the one man who'd never let her down?</p><p>\"But he came all this way for us.\"</p><p>\"He knows I'll remember that when we need a wedding dress for one of the new movies in the works.</p><p>Don't worry, cara , he will get his payment.\"</p><p>Bolstered by his confidence, she started to look through the many beautiful creations brought out for her inspection.Jacksonspent a lot of time on his mobile phone, checking on security details for their wedding.</p><p>It was while he was standing by the window, phone to his ear, that she found the dress she wanted.</p><p>\"How very lovely.\" She picked up the smooth satin-silk fabric, which looked like it had been embedded with pearls crushed to the consistency of the finest white sand. The dress had a cowl neck which would drape softly over her breasts, before the sleek material swept gracefully down her body. The bias cut ensured it would hug her curves and swish gently around her ankles.</p><p>\"I'd like to try this on.\" She glanced over her shoulder to ensureJacksonwasn't looking her way. \"I don't want him to see it before the wedding.\"</p><p>The little man was delighted to help in her conspiracy. \"Use the back fitting room and if you like it, I'll box it up out of his sight.\"</p><p>It was a perfect fit, as if it had been made with her in mind. The couturier gave her a shimmering gossamer veil to go with the dress, and even found a pair of shoes.Jacksonsimply raised a brow at her secretiveness but paid for the purchase with a gold card.</p><p>\"It's costing you a lot,\" she said, in the car.</p><p>\"It's my choice,Taylor. It's my wedding, too.\"</p><p>That didn't make her feel much better. \"I don't understand,\" she burst out, raw from the evidence of his wealth and her lack of it. \"What do you get out of this? There are so many women out there who wouldn't hesitate to bear you a child.\" Women who weren't flawed, she thought. Women he wouldn't have to rid himself of after a year.</p><p>\"I get you and I get Nick, two people whose loyalty will be mine without question. In this business, loyalty like that is priceless.\" His tone was forceful. \"And, I may get to father a baby, who I know will have a good mother - there aren't many women whom I'd trust with that responsibility.\"</p><p>Jacksoncould see thatTaylorwasn't convinced, but he knew that she wouldn't protest. Not when Nick's future was at stake. He barely understood his own need, need which had been hidden for so long that it was starving for a taste of her. He just knew that he had a chance to makeTaylorhis and he was taking it.</p><p>She saw herself as without passion, damaged. He saw in her the promise of a magnificent woman. He wasn't a saint and he wanted her. But neither was he a brutal man who would force compliance. That didn't mean he wouldn't try to find the sensual woman in Taylor, the one who made him feel things he hadn't felt for so long he'd thought them dead.</p><p>It had pained him to admit that the ache to father a child was so great he would give her up if she couldn't bring herself to bear his touch. Yet, it was the truth. He'd never wanted much in his life, but he wanted to hold his child in his arms. How could someone as innocent asTaylorunderstand his need to find redemption by creating a life where Bonnie had destroyed it?</p><p>Taylorspent that night at home. She rose at seven the next day and was ready an hour later to go and pick up Nick, who would be dropped off at the school with the other children.Jacksonwas on her doorstep just after eight.</p><p>The sight of him rattled her. She'd just spent hours dreaming of him and none of the dreams had been comfortable. It was as if her own mind was taunting her with what could be. \"I don't know if you should come,\" she finally said. \"I know I invited you but it might be too sudden.\" Her worry was genuine but she also needed time alone to sort out her tumultuous feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"He has to know. And we have to see how he reacts to me.\" Taking the bag she'd packed in anticipation of spending the night before the wedding at his house,Jacksontouched her on her lower back, a subtle pressure that reminded her she now belonged to him.</p><p>Her feelings of confusion intensified but she didn't move away, because whileJacksonmight be the most disturbing thing in her life, he was also the safest. \"I don't want him to know why we're marrying.\" She couldn't bear it if Nick thought she was sacrificing something for him, because she wasn't.</p><p>\"I agree.\"</p> <p>As they drove to the school.Jacksonsaid, \"Don't worry. He's met me before so it won't be a total surprise.\" The fleeting touch on her cheek was unexpected but welcome.</p><p>Dutifully chaperoned by his camp counselor, her brother was waiting for them by the gate. When the sleek black Mercedes stopped in front of him, she saw his eyes widen. She stepped out and feltJackson follow. While she went to hug Nick, after thanking the counselor, he picked up her brother's bags and dumped them in the trunk.</p><p>After a quick hug that apparently embarrassed him from the speed with which he pulled away, Nick looked up at the man beside her. \"Hi,Jackson.\"</p><p>\"Nick.\"</p><p>Nick was a smart boy. He looked from her toJackson. \"What?\" Speculation turned his blue eyes sky-bright.</p> <p>Taylordidn't want to tell him right now but realized that she didn't really have a choice. \"What would you say if I told you that ... me and Jackson...\"</p><p>Nick started to grin. \"Are you gonna marry my sister?\"</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \"How did you know that?\"</p><p>The boy shrugged. \"I dunno. 'CauseJacksonlikes you?\"</p><p>Flustered, she looked at Jackson, who just said, \"Smart kid. Jump in the car - we'll talk on the way.\"</p><p>Nick scrambled in, already asking his first question. \"Are we going to live with you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"Jacksonanswered.</p><p>A short silence. \"Will I always stay with you?\"</p><p>Taylorfrowned, not understanding. ButJacksonevidently did. Stopping the car at the side of the street, he looked over his shoulder. \"Yes. I went to boarding school and I would never send a child of mine there.\"</p><p>\"But I'm not yours.\"</p><p>Taylor's heart clenched at that quiet statement. Her instinct was to reassure him but she remained silent, aware that something important was happening between the solemn, ten-year-old and the charismatic man in the driver's seat.</p><p>\"You are now.\" There was no arguing withJackson's decisive statement. He turned and restarted the car.</p><p>Nick was quiet for a longtime. Then he said, \"Will I have my own room like I do now?\"</p><p>\"Sure. You can't sleep with us, after all.\"Jacksongrinned in the rearview mirror. \"You can have one of the two big first floor bedrooms. We'll be on the second floor.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile,Taylor's stomach went into freefall. He'd said \"us.\" Did he expect her to have sex with him from the start in spite of everything? The idea of being with him wasn't abhorrent, had never been so. It was the fact that she knew she'd freeze up and he'd hate her for it.</p><p>Once at the apartment, she sent Nick off to pack enough fresh clothes to see him through to the wedding.</p><p>Jacksoncame to stand in front of her. \"Something's bothering you.\" His body language conveyed that he wasn't moving until she confided in him.</p><p>She swallowed and decided to be blunt. \"Are we going to be sharing a bedroom?\"</p><p>His mouth thinned. \"I won't go back on my word,Taylor. You may not have noticed, but my bedroom is part of a suite. It's internally connected to a smaller bedroom. You can use that. Nick will never know.\"</p><p>\"I hadn't considered what he'd think if we were in separate bedrooms.\" She was flustered, used to providing everything for her brother's happiness.</p><p>Jacksontook her hand in his, his dark gaze trapping hers. \"You can't think of everything. Learn to depend on me a little. We males like to be needed.\"</p><p>\"I'm depending on you a great deal.\"</p><p>The strong lines of his face were suddenly sharper. \"Do not just depend on me as someone powerful, but also as a man. As your husband. You are now in my care.\" His rough declaration made her eyes widen in surprise.</p><p>\"Taylor! I don't have a suit for your wedding.\" Nick barreled out of his room. Worry stamped his face.</p><p>Jacksonreached out and tousled his jet-black hair. \"I've ordered you a tux. If you're ready, let's head home.\"</p><p>Nick's smile strengthenedTaylor's resolve. She'd do anything for her brother. And, she thought, a little shocked, she'd do anything to keep a smile onJackson's face, too. She would not hurt him by withholding herself - he understood her fear but it was a rejection all the same, telling him that she didn't trust him. If she couldn't trust her body withJackson, who could she trust?</p><p>It was a startling insight.</p><p>That day was a whirlwind of activity. With Nick tagging along quietly,Taylorwent to work withJackson, helping him organize matters so that the studios could temporarily function without him at the helm. After lunch, she left to meet Maggie, the therapist she'd agreed to see. To her surprise, she found herself comfortable with the older woman who welcomed her into her office.</p><p>When she returned to the studios,Jacksonsimply asked, \"So?\"</p><p>\"I like her. It might work.\"</p><p>Giving her a smile,Jacksonwent back to work and after checking on Nick, she continued to assist him.</p><p>They'd agreed to leave town for a few days on the pretext of a honeymoon, so that Lance would have no room to ask awkward questions about their marriage. As Nick was now on vacation, it was decided that he'd spend the time out on a farm, with a friend of his who'd moved out of the city.</p><p>\"I want to take him with us, but I know we have to give the impression of being on a honeymoon,\"Taylor said, late that night. She was pacing in front of the sofa, whileJacksonstood by the window, back to the night, cognac in hand. The amber liquid sparkled through the crystal snifter, momentarily catching her gaze. \"I've missed him so much. I don't know if they'll take care of him out on the farm.\"</p><p>\"You're overprotective.\"Jackson's quiet declaration stopped hermidpace .</p><p>Shocked, she clenched her fists. Her temper ignited. \"What would you know about bringing up a child?\"</p><p>She thought pain flickered over the rugged beauty of his face but his tone was calm. \"I was a boy at one stage.\"</p><p>\"And you think that gives you the right to tell me how to raise Nick?\" Just because he was helping her keep her brother didn't mean he could dictate to her.</p><p>\"No. What gives me the right is that I can see he's unhappy and that he'll never say anything to you, because he loves you too much.\"</p><p>An arrow to her heart would have done less damage. \"Unhappy?\" she whispered.</p><p>\"He's been getting bullied for being a sissy.\"</p><p>\"How do you know? He just got back from camp.\"</p><p>\"He told me while you were having a bath - he couldn't hide it after I saw the bruise on his leg.\"</p><p>\"What!\" she cried, fighting the urge to wake Nick and check up onhim. \"Who? I'll kill them.\"</p><p>\"That's just the problem.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't he tell me? What's the problem?\" She couldn't bear to think of her sweet baby brother being bullied. Why hadn't he trusted her with this? Why had he toldJackson, whom he hardly knew?</p><p>\"You're always sticking up for him. Even at school.\"</p><p>\"You wouldn't know, but that's what elder siblings do.\" Her hurt made her cruel. \"You don't even know where your sister is at the moment.\"</p><p>Jacksondidn't blink but she knew him well enough to know that her barb had found its target. The skin over his cheekbones tightened and he looked away from her and over the water vista out the window.</p><p>The night was peaceful and the water moved in gentle symphony, but inside, she felt like she was crashing and burning. His hurt pained her.</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, meaning it.</p><p>\"It doesn't matter.\" Heshrugged, shoulders taut under the blue shirt. JacksonSantorini , she remembered, was used to being hurt. His wife had torn into his pride and the world had lapped up his suffering. She even knew that his family never contacted him except to complain or ask for something. No wonder he didn't keep in touch. It had only been her own feelings of inadequacy at having let her brother down that had made her strike out.</p><p>She wanted to kick herself. \"Yes, it does.\" Walking over, she touched her hand to his back and rested her head against his thickly muscled arm. \"I hurt you. And I despise myself for it, for taking out my frustration on you.\"</p><p>He put his drink on the windowsill and slipped his arm around her. \"You know something?\"</p><p>Relieved that he wasn't holding a grudge, she said, \"What?\"</p><p>\"I think you're the first person I've ever met who really means they're sorry when they say so.\"</p><p>And she knew she was forgiven. \"I do. So don't be angry. I know what yourfamily's like, and I don't blame you for keeping them at a distance. It just makes me crazy to know that Nick's being hurt.\"</p><p>\"I showed him some moves.\"</p><p>Her brows furrowed. \"Moves?\"</p><p>\"Self-defense.\"</p><p>She bit her lip. Nick had kept something else from her. Once, he'd shared every new experience.</p><p>\"And?\"</p><p>\"He's a natural.\"</p><p>\"But he's not very physical.\"</p><p>\"He's never had a chance to be.\" He hugged her tight, as if aware that this was hurting her. \"Trust him, Taylor. He's an extraordinary boy.\"</p><p>She heard the affection in his tone and knew that he meant it. \"I hate it when he's hurting. I hate it!\"</p><p>\"Iknow, cara mia .\"Theendearment made her want to reach up and kiss him. \"Let me help.\"</p><p>Her instincts rebelled. She was used to looking out for Nick on her own. But, though it was a painful concession, she acknowledged that over the past year, his needs had changed in a way she couldn't fulfill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was starving for a male role model.

He wasn't exactly a prize. What the hell did he know about children?</p><p>A sharp pain stabbed him. Damn Bonnie for stealing his chance to learn.Taylor's drawn out silence seemed to signal rejection. His pride told him to withdraw the offer, but the memory of the joy on Nick's face when he'd paid attention to him pricked his paternal instincts into fighting mode.</p><p>\"Look,\" he began.</p><p>\"Hush.\"Taylorheld up a slim hand. \"This is important. I have to think.\"</p><p>He didn't know whether to be flattered or insulted. People usually didn't gainsay him, much less reject his help. Then again, in most cases, it wasn't a little boy's happiness on the line.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>His heart clenched at that decisive sound. \"Yes?\"</p><p>\"You'll be good for him.

For the first time, he had the startling realization that even if they never had a child, he might not be able to walk away from this woman.</p><p>His woman.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\" Then I have no arguments,\"Taylorstated.</p><p>He sucked in a breath. \"That's a lot of trust.\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>They stood there for a long time beforeJacksonspoke. \"What about you?\"</p><p>\"What about me?\" Her voice was wary.</p><p>\"Trusting me.\"</p><p>She was silent for a long while. \"It's hard.\"</p> <p>He made himself ask. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"It's hard to forget.\"</p><p>\"Nick's father?\"Taylorwas a sensitive woman. From what she'd told him, he knew that though she hadn't been able to comprehend why her mother loved that bastard, she'd understoodHelena's pain at Lance's indifference. It would've twisted her impression of what marriage was about. What love wasabout. Not that he was any closer to the answer,Jacksonthought bitterly.</p><p>\"My mother loved two men. They both left her.\" It was a harsh explanation. \"I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget that lesson.\"</p><p>\"You are telling me that you do not believe you will ever love a man?\" he forced himself to ask.</p><p>The answer was a whisper. \"Yes ... I'm sorry.\"</p><p>\"There is no need for an apology, piccola .\" Anger burned in him for the hurts of her past, hurts that he could not undo, but he didn't allow her to see that. \"We are equals. I know even less of love than you.\"</p><p>She gave him a shaky smile. \"Equals, huh? Are you going to remember that after we're married?\"</p><p>\"If I do not, you will remind me. So, you do not trust men because of what two of our sex did to your mother?\"</p><p>\"Yes ... and because of what the others did ... to me.\"</p><p>Jackson's heart slammed into his chest at that lost, broken sound. He'd guessed that her sexual fears were rooted in events beyond her assault at the hands of Grant Layton, but having it confirmed was an unwelcome shock. Fury erupted inside him. Used to being calm and in control, he knew that if any man had hurt his Taylor, he'd rip them limb from limb and suffer no pangs of conscience.</p><p>He'd forgotten to tell her that while he wasn't a mobster, back inItalya branch of theSantorini line was very deeply enmeshed with themafioso . He could well understand why. Violence and rage roared beneath the surface of his composed front, demanding vengeance. His woman should never have been touched by anyone.</p><p>Moving the forgotten glass to a nearby table, he turned and sat down on the window seat. Holding Taylor's cold hands, he tugged her between his spread legs. Her eyes were bruised against her pale skin but she held his gaze.</p><p>\"Tell me about the others.\" His voice was harsh, a demand that she submit to his care. He was so angry for her that he couldn't be the civilized man she needed.</p><p>Her head jerked up. Whatever she saw on his face made her eyes widen. \"No. No. Nothing like that, Jackson.\"</p><p>To reassure her, he forced his anger below the surface. \"Tell me then.\"</p><p>Her hands became fists. Then she made a tiny movement that gave away her need to be held. He held out his arms and she fit her wonderfully giving body against him; sitting in his lap with her knees drawn up, feet flat on the window seat beside his thigh and arms tight around his torso. Fierce protectiveness shot through him. He'd never known that he could feel this much. When she began to speak, he tried to remain calm for her sake, even though her words provoked his most primitive instincts.</p><p>\"I think ... after a while, my mother lost hope, or lost the hope that she'd managed to nurture. At first, when Lance didn't come home for weeks, she'd wait for him.\" She nestled herself impossibly closer.</p><p>\"It was as if while he was out of her sight, she'd convince herself that this time, it'd be different. But, it never was.\" Her hands dug into his back. \"And one day, I don't think she could fool herself any longer.</p><p>I'll always wonder why they didn't divorce earlier. He was barely around long enough for Nick to be conceived.\"</p><p>Jacksonwanted to hurt Lance for being the cause of the pain he could hear inTaylor's voice. Only the fact that he was Nick's father was keeping him safe. \"Why do you think she lost hope?\" His voice sounded ragged to him but she didn't seem to notice that he was riding on the thinnest edge of self-control.</p><p>\"She didn't wait for him anymore. At first, I thought that was a good thing.\" She took a gasping breath.</p><p>\"Then she started bringing the men home.\"</p><p>He felt his jaw lock. \"Where were you?\"</p><p>\"She locked us in our room in the apartment.\"</p><p>\"Us?\"</p><p>\"Nick was a baby. I used to take care of him - I didn't trust her not to hurt him by doing something wrong.\"</p><p>Jacksonsqueezed his eyes shut to blink back tears. Loyal didn't begin to describeTaylor, She was ferociously protective of those she considered her own. Now he understood why she was so determined to keep Nick safe.</p><p>\"Sometimes, she'd make me come out and say hello to the men. She'd be drunk and not like my mother at all. It was horrible.\"</p><p>He froze. \"You said nothing happened.\"</p><p>\"I ... nothing really bad...\" She took a long, deep breath, as if the memories were choking her.</p><p>He resisted the urge to order her to tell him everything. \"What did happen?\"</p><p>\"Their eyes used to crawl over me.\" She shivered. \"I wanted to throw up. But I could cope with that.</p><p>Then the men she brought home started to hurt her.\"</p><p>Jackson's jaw was clenched so tight that his whole face ached, while his mind became quietly, dangerously, angry. She'd always made him feel protective of her sunny innocence. Now he saw that she'd been hiding very real wounds beneath that smile, and he adored her even more.</p><p>\"They'd ... hurt her,\" she repeated, as if she couldn't bear to elaborate. \"I couldn't stop them. I had to protect Nick because she certainly didn't. I think she hated him.\" Fierce blue eyes met his when he glanced down. \"It wasn't his fault that his father was a horrible human being.\"</p><p>\"Of course not.\"</p><p>As if reassured, she put her head back against his chest. \"Once, I got scared by the violence and I called the police. They came and took that man away.\"</p><p>Hairs rose on the back of his neck. He knew that her story couldn't have had a happy ending. \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"My mother was grateful. She said she'd picked a real mean one. He got locked up and that was okay.\"</p><p>\"But?\"</p><p>\"But he got out in a couple of months and he followed me home from school. I didn't know he was behind me until I was crossing a park along the way - I was rushing to get home to Nick. He jumped out from behind a tree and dragged me into the bushes. His hand was on my mouth. I couldn't breathe or scream.\" Her voice shook.</p><p>\"He pinned me against the tree, out of sight of the path, one hand on my mouth, the other around my hands. Then he let my mouth free but before I could scream, he gripped my throat. I thought he was going to choke me to death.\"</p><p>Jacksonknew she was crying silently and there wasn't anything he could do but hold her. No wonder she couldn't bear a sexual touch. She'd been bruised again and again, at the very time that her developing sexuality would have been at its most vulnerable.</p><p>\"He started whispering about what he'd like to do to a ripe young thing like me. All the things he said ...</p><p>they were sick and disgusting.\" Her hand clenched onJackson's shirt. \"He groped my ... breasts while I tried to get him to break his chokehold.\"</p><p>\"You got away?\" He needed to know that because if she hadn't, he couldn't do anything about the pain she'd suffered. He was a man used to taking control but this time, there was nothing he could do. His sweetTaylorhad been brutalized by a man who'd had no right to be near someone so pure and innocent.</p><p>\"He stopped touching me and started to undo his pants. His grip loosened for just an instant, but it was enough. I kneed him in the groin and took off.\"</p><p>Thank God she was a fighter. \"Did he come after you?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but when I was at school they started this program in my neighborhood. People who were usually at home and were judged good people by the community were asked to have their letterboxes painted bright yellow. That meant they were safe houses.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He remembered hearing something about a similar campaign. \"You found one?\"</p><p>\"I knew there was one just around the corner. By the time he caught up, I was halfway up the drive. For a while, I thought he'd follow me but then the door opened and Mrs. Willis took me in.\"Taylorsmiled at the memory.</p><p>Mrs. Willis had been the only good thing to come out of that day. The kindly widow had made her stay and drink several cups of tea until she'd stopped sobbing. \"She rang the police. The man was hanging around nearby - probably thought he'd get me when I left.\" She could still remember the bone-crunching, nerve-flaying fear she'd felt that day.</p> <p>\"Did he staylocked up this time?\"Jackson's body was taut against hers.</p><p>She found herself trying to comfort him . \"For a lot longer. I think he got hurt in jail. He never came back.\"</p><p>He didn't back off under her soothing but his tonegentled . \"Was he the only one?\"</p><p>\"Yes. But the whole time, I kept thinking that one day it could just as well be Nick taking the brunt of some man's anger.\" The blinding fear had been a mother's for her child. \"From then on, when our mother went out, I left with Nick and spent the night at Mrs. Willis's house.\"</p><p>\"You care for this woman.\"</p> <p>Her nod was sharp. \"She treats me like a daughter.\"</p><p>\"Do you keep in touch with her?\"</p><p>\"Yes. But, her health isn't so good anymore.\" Her voice was less than a whisper. Unlike her mother, this Mrs. Willis meant a lot to her. \"I worry. That neighborhood isn't the greatest but she refuses to move.\"</p><p>Jacksonmarveled at her. She'd told him of a terrifying experience, one that she must've been constantly afraid would be repeated, and all she was worried about was an old woman's health. He would ensure that her savior received the best care, because he was in Mrs. Willis's debt for saving her from unbearable suffering.</p><p>\"Taylor?\"</p><p>She looked up, lingering traces of memory turning her blue eyes cloudy. \"Yes?\"</p> <p>\"Thank you for telling me.\" For trusting me, he thought, with bittersweet joy.</p><p>Her smile was forced. \"You needed to know.\" She swallowed and he could see that she was gathering the courage to say something. He waited. When it came, it was so unexpected that he just stared.</p><p>\"Did you just ask me if I was going to keep a mistress?\" he repeated, dumbfounded.</p><p>She sat up in his lap, arms folded. \"What's so silly about that? I won't be providing ... what you need and you're a man.\" Her tone was belligerent.</p><p>He tried to tell himself that she knew only one kind of man and it wasn't personal. He shouldn't feel so hurt because she could be so blase about giving him to another woman. If she ever touched another man, that man wouldn't live to regret his mistake. AndTaylor? He might just handcuff her to his bed forever.</p><p>\"I can control myself. I don't feel the need to have sex with complete strangers and that's what it would be.\" He made no attempt to hide the growling edge to his voice.</p><p>\"I've put my foot in it, haven't I? You're angry.\"</p><p>Her honesty made his lips curve. \"I hardly think it'll be the last time.\" Tipping her chin up, he said, \"Tell me one thing. Do you find me personally disgusting or repulsive?\" He knew that his big body could be considered brutish and after hearing what she'd been through, he was surprised at the amount of trust she'd already shown him.</p> <p>She immediately shook her head. \"Of course not! I told you, you're gorgeous. And ... I like the way you kiss me.\"</p><p>\"Then, we will try, piccola .\" He moved the hand on her back, subtly coaxing her awareness of him.</p><p>\"Try?\" It was a whisper but he could hear the faintest trace of intrigue.</p><p>\"What could it hurt?\" Even as he spoke, he realized that it might shatter his heart. It would be worth it if Taylorlooked at him with passion in those vibrant eyes.</p><p>She lowered her head, uncertain. \"What if I can't?\"</p><p>\"I'll turn into a monk.\" He didn't bring up their one-year agreement.</p><p>There was wariness in her eyes, but she let him hold her. And the next day, she married him, in a ceremony that was quietly beautiful, just like her.</p><p>Dressed in a gown that kissed every womanly curve with a lover's tenderness, her wild black hair tumbling down her back, and her blue eyes fixed on him alone, she was his every dream come true.</p><p>When he slid the plain gold wedding band onto her finger, she beamed at him and something deep within him started to whisper in hope.</p><p>He would rather have spent his life alone than have a string of meaningless marriages like his parents, or a replay of the deceitful and hurtful first marriage he'd barely survived. Some kinds of loneliness were worse than others. But, withTaylorsmiling at him like that, he believed that, this time, it would be different.</p><p>It would be forever.</p><p>Understanding at last just how deeply she lived in his heart, he decided that the one-year time limit on their marriage was totally unacceptable. The thought of her in another man's arms, even unwillingly, had almost killed him - he would never let her go by choice. Unless his bride repudiated him, he was in this for life. He'd let her know that when she was feeling a little less overwhelmed by the speed at which he'd pushed for their union.</p><p>Perhaps, with this woman who made his heart awaken and body rejoice, he might find a way out of the darkness of his past and into the sunshine of her smile.</p><p>It was his wedding night.</p><p>The location was an exclusive resort on an island off the coast ofFiji. It was his wedding night and he was all alone in his bed, while his sexy new bride slept across the hall, in the other room of this luxurious seaside cabin. An erotic fantasy involving black lace and soft white skin had been tormenting him for the past hour.</p><p>Desperate, he went down to the floor and began doing push-ups, clad only in white boxer shorts.</p><p>Exhaustion might allow him to catch a few hours sleep.</p><p>The gentle knock came when he was on his fiftieth push-up and more aroused than he'd thought humanly possible. Groaning at his pretty little wife's timing, he growled, \"Come.\" The single word sent a cascade of sensual imagery flooding through his mind. He could imagine teasingTaylorto that final edge and then ordering her to \"come.\"</p><p>The door opened and the enticing scent of woman whispered over him. Dio! A hundred more, he decided grimly and kept going. His peripheral vision showed small feminine feet, toes painted bright pink, padding closer. The edge of an eyelet lace nightgown fluttered around her ankles.</p><p>He wanted to reach out a hand, grab onto one slim ankle and lick his way up his wife's gorgeous legs.</p><p>His wife. She belonged to him and he wanted to stake his claim.</p><p>\"What're you doing?\"</p><p>Grunt. \"Exercising.\"</p><p>\"It's almostmidnight.\" She didn't sound disapproving. He frowned. She seemed ... fascinated. But, by what?</p><p>\"I like it.\" He pushed down, feeling his biceps start to burn.</p><p>\"I can see that.\" Feminine interest laced her tone.</p><p>He almost jerked to a standstill but something forced him to continue. To his surprise, he saw her move around to sit on the edge of his bed. Her pretty little feet were flat on the floor, inches away from him.</p><p>\"Can I stay and talk?\"</p><p>She wanted to talk? \"Sure.\"</p><p>He waited for her to say something but she remained silent. He didn't dare break the moment. He had Taylorin his bedroom and at ease with him. That was a huge step. He just wished he knew what the hell she was thinking.</p><p>Taylorwas mesmerized by the rhythmic bunch and release ofJackson's muscles. Her cheeks flushed. She waved a hand in front of her face to cool herself down. The man was built . All strong lines and corded muscle that she wanted to sink her teeth into. Her sleeveless, Victorian-inspired gown was suddenly too hot. She undid the top two buttons. His back muscles had her fascinated but his arms rated a mention.</p><p>And those powerful thighs...</p><p>She shook her head. What was she doing? Why was she alone withJackson, with him almost naked?</p><p>Big and gloriously naked. Why was she feeling hot and needy, when no man had ever been able to touch the sexual core of her?</p><p>Because she was lonely.</p><p>And it was her wedding night.</p><p>And she'd missed him.</p><p>And, she'd wondered if he'd really meant it when he'd said that they could try. Wondered if the courage her therapist had kept saying she had, in their long-distance phone call tonight, was real, and not a figment of her imagination.</p><p>Now, she wondered if this aggressively male creature in front of her would be patient. She wondered if he'd be tender. Most of all, she wondered if a wife who'd been married for convenience was allowed to stroke her husband's beautiful body without consequences.</p><p>Have the courage to fight for him, she ordered herself. He's never hurt you. And ... he never will.</p><p>Mouth dry, heart in her throat, she reached out and ran a single finger down the bunched muscles of his back when he rose on his arms. Smooth, hot skin and rippling strength. She shivered.</p><p>Jacksonfroze and just about stopped breathing. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>Silence. Had he blown it?</p><p>\"T-touching you.\"</p><p>The slight hesitation got him back on even ground. \"I'm sweaty.\" Why the hell had he said that? That wasn't how you seduced a woman.</p><p>\"I don't mind,\"came the very quick response.</p><p>He lowered himself to the varnished wooden floor, not caring about dust or the comfort of his heavily aroused body. Resting his head on his arms, he silently gave her permission and wondered what she'd do.</p><p>After a pause that seemed to last forever, she knelt beside him, the fine material of her nightgown fluttering against his heated skin. He could feel the soft warmth of her, hear the whisper of her breath, almost smell her desire. The wait had his instincts tugging at the reins, fighting for the freedom to devour her.</p><p>Then she touched him.</p><p>Hesitant, exploratory strokes that tipped him into sweet insanity. When he remained quiescent under her, she put her hands flat on his back and stroked harder. Kneaded. Played. He could imagine those hands on other parts of his anatomy, all soft heat and soft pain. He wanted to tell her to use her mouth on him, to nibble and caress and kiss. Sweat beaded across his brow when he felt her straddle him, her gown resting atop his back and thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Am I too heavy?\" An intimate question.</p><p>\"No.\" His voice was raw.</p><p>\"Jackson?\" She halted her eager exploration. \"I'm hurting you. I'll go.\"</p><p>\"Don't!\" This was torture, but of a kind no hot-blooded man would resist. \"Stay, piccola .\"</p><p>To his relief, she settled against him again, her hands continuing to stroke and squeeze. Her teeth scraped at the bunched muscles of his upper arm and the sexy warmth of her generous breasts pressed against his back. \"You're so strong.\" Warm breath whispered over his ann. \"So wonderfully sexy. I want to just...\" With a groan, she laid an open-mouthed kiss on his upper back, before suckling the spot. Her tongue soothed even as it stroked the inferno burning up his body from the inside out.</p><p>He wondered if a man could die of unadulterated sexual pleasure. Then she was scattering teasing, nibbling kisses across his shoulders and he decided he didn't care. Her small hands were everywhere, tracing firm muscle and hot skin, shaping and learning. And caressing.</p><p>He'd never been petted like this. Bonnie had preferred heat and speed, not interested in this kind of erotic love play. Before her, the women he'd attracted had wanted hard, rough sex - what his strong, muscular body represented to them. He'd thought he hadn't minded but now found that he'd minded very much. He liked the wayTaylorwas exploring him, as if she was delighted with him, as if she'd been saving up all her fantasies just for him.</p><p>Wiggling down his body, she grazed her teeth over the taut skin of his lower back. Everything was taut, Jacksonthought, as she skipped over his buttocks and rested near his knees. Her fingernails grazed the backs of his thighs.</p><p>\"Dio!\"He jerked up so hard that he almost threw her to the floor.</p><p>\"Jackson?\" Those fingers had frozen on his thighs. \"Did I do something wrong?\"</p><p>He took a deep breath. \"Only when you stopped.\"</p><p>A second later, she was running those damnably gentle hands up the backs of his legs. \"I love the way you feel against my skin - so rough, so different from me. Your body heats me up from the inside out.</p><p>Sometimes ... I just ... I just want to rub myself up against you. Naked.\"</p><p>That halting confession shattered what was left of his mind. For the first time in his life, JacksonSantorini became a totally sensate being, focused only on the feel of the woman who held him in her sweet hands, who found his body delicious and seemed to want to spend hours at her pleasure.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Taylorwoke up feeling so fine. She grinned when she remembered why. PoorJackson. Wonderful, lovely, beautifulJackson. He'd let her touch him as much as she wanted, let her squeeze and caress and bite and taste. And he hadn't moved throughout it. He'd been on the floor when she'd left. Her delectable husband might still be there.</p><p>A masculine knock on her door put an end to that silly illusion. Remnants of fear infiltrated her heart.</p><p>Would he expect what any man would, after his wife had pretty much treated him as her property the night before?</p><p>\"Come in.\" She sat up, sheets pulled up to her chin.</p><p>He was dressed in blue jeans and a white T-shirt, his hair damp, as if he'd just showered. His T-shirt was loose, but did nothing to hide the definition of the upper arms she'd lavished such attention on, only hours before. She finally found the courage to meet his gaze, fearing she'd see the red haze of desire. All that met her was a coolness she'd rarely seen when he spoke to her.</p><p>\"We need to discuss some things.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" It was a shock to find that she hated her husband's expression. She'd rather see dangerous passion than this nothingness. \"Are you angry with me?\"</p> <p>He shook his head in a sharp negative. \"Come down when you're ready.\"</p><p>\"Tell me what's wrong. And don't pretend it's nothing.\" She glared at him.</p><p>\"Taylor.\"</p><p>\"I told you, don'tTaylorme. Tell me why you're brooding!\" Frustrated, she punched the pillow by her side.</p><p>He blew out a breath between clenched teeth and then stalked to the bed, dark eyes glittering. Leaning over her, he put his hands flat on either side of her hips. \"I am not angry,\" he repeated. \"I am also not a saint. You're dressed like an invitation and you spent last night with your pretty little hands all over me. I didn't mind. Feel free to do it again any time you please. But,\" he paused for breath, \"I can't be in this bedroom and talk with you as if we're just friends, so let me deal with it. Don't push.\"</p><p>Mouth dry at the quietly powerful confession, she said, \"I won't apologize for last night.\"</p><p>\"I didn't ask you to.\" A tiny spark of humor appeared in his eyes. \"I'm not an idiot.\"</p><p>Memories of tactile pleasure had her heart racing. \"Can I really do it again?\"</p><p>He groaned and went to push off the bed. She wrapped her arms around hisneck, caught in the tantalizing grip of a sensual world she'd never imagined could exist for her. Without warning, his entire face went taut.</p><p>\"Let go,Taylor. My control is so close to the edge that you don't want to continue.\"</p><p>She released him, convinced by the dark passion she saw prowling behind the civilized mirage of his eyes.</p><p>When she came downstairs,Jacksonwas sitting at the table on the verandah, waiting for her. Breakfast had been delivered while she was upstairs.</p><p>Taking a seat, she asked, \"What are those?\" when he lifted a document from the pile at his elbow.</p><p>\"Legal papers.\" He raised his head and those dark eyes wouldn't let her glance away. \"I want to adopt Nick.\"</p><p>She put down the melon wedge she'd chosen. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"I'm certain thatHegerty will back off on his custody application. But, if we manage to do this, it'll be almost impossible for him to come after Nick later on.\"</p><p>\"Is that the only reason you want to adopt Nick?\"</p><p>\"Is it not enough?\" Nothing in his tone gave her a hint of his emotions.</p><p>She shook her head. \"It will mean something to Nick. He's never really had a father and I don't think he could bear the hurt if you adopted him and then forgot him.\" As a child, she'd experienced that brutal truth over and over.</p><p>\"You'd share him that much with me?\" The quickly masked hope inJackson's eyes was unexpected.</p><p>Then she remembered his desire for a baby. Maybe, in spite of her recent courage, she might never give him a child who was his flesh and blood, but she could give him this.</p><p>\"Of course,\" she said, softly. \"He needs you but it'll only work if you can go the distance, even if we part.</p><p>If you adopt him, you'll have to be his father. Forever .\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" It was an answer so strong that she didn't need to hear any more. Nick's heart was safe with Jackson. Right now, she didn't want to think about her own.</p><p>\"Can I authorize the adoption?\"</p><p>He nodded. \"To a point. You're a legal guardian.\"</p><p>She picked up the melon wedge. \"Mrs. Willis suggested that Mom make me a testamentary guardian in her will.\"</p><p>\"Under the law, it's likely that we can dispense withHegerty's consent since he abandoned Nick. But, we have to consider the possibility that it might be needed in case the court refuses to make a finding of neglect.\"</p><p>Her head jerked up. \"He won't give consent.\"</p><p>Jackson's smile was without humor. \"Somehow, I think I can talk him around if it comes to that.\"</p><p>She believed him. No one could stand inJackson's way once he was set on a course. While she ate, he made a quick call that set the new train of legal proceedings in motion. Afterward, he sat opposite her, not eating, just looking out to the blue, blue sea with eyes that seemed to be lost in memories. She couldn't bear his withdrawal. Standing, she walked around behind him and bent down to hug his neck.</p><p>He looked up, one hand on her arm. \"Hey.\" Surprise was evident in his Italian-dark eyes.</p><p>\" Don't.\" It was wrenched out of her.</p><p>\"Don't?\"</p><p>\"Don't go away from me,\" she ordered. \"Please,Jackson.\" A softer plea.</p><p>Her mother had shut her out. Neither her biological father nor her stepfather had ever truly acknowledged her existence. Nick saw her, but today she realized it wasn't enough. She needed this beautiful man to see her, too.</p><p>Jacksontugged at her hands until she came around to stand in front of him. He pulled her into his lap.</p><p>\"I'm right here, cara .\" His attention was focused wholly on her.</p><p>Touched by his unexpected tenderness, her smile came from the heart. \"Where did you go?\"</p><p>\"It is not something to speak of this bright day.\"</p><p>She touched his jaw in a firm gesture. \"Yes, it is.\"</p><p>A hint of amusement softened his stern expression. \"Bossy little madam.\"</p><p>\" Your bossy little madam,\" she said boldly, testing her wings, seeing how far her very dominant husband would let her go, learning how much she would have to fight to ensure he didn't become a despot.</p><p>His smile widened. Leaning over, he pressed a hard kiss to her lips. \"Yes. Mine . Don't ever forget it.\"</p><p>She was startled by her enjoyment of the fleeting pressure. \"Don't you get ideas about beingpossessive. \"</p><p>\"Too late.\" The look in his eyes was dark fire, slumbering heat. And suddenly, she remembered the feel of his skin against her mouth. The hands she'd put on his shoulders clenched as desire flooded her bloodstream.</p><p>His eyes took in her flushed cheeks. \"You look at me like you want me.\"</p><p>\"I do,\" she acknowledged. \"Will you kiss me again?\" Her fingers stroked the vulnerable skin of his nape.</p><p>The look he gave her was pure male heat. \"My body is for your pleasure, mia moglie .\"</p><p>Fire rippled through her as he tipped her head down with a gentle grip on her chin and tasted her - slow and thorough, as if he had all the time in the world. He played with the seam of her lips and bit down on the lower one, suckling it into his mouth but never entering hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and parted her lips, greedy for the pleasure she knew he could lavish. Chuckling at her eagerness, he accepted the invitation with male enthusiasm that made her head spin. She moaned at the sensation of his tongue inside her mouth, flirting with hers. Desperate to deepen the kiss to a higher level of intimacy, she dared the slightest touch in return.</p><p>He broke off the kiss with a gasp. \" Piccola, you will kill your poor husband.\" Dark eyes glittered.</p><p>Then before she could protest, he took her lips in a kiss that was undeniably intimate, unquestionably possessive and incredibly tender. He tasted and licked and nibbled like a man who knew his woman's every desire, the quick jabbing of his tongue inside her mouth letting her know that while he'd wait for her passion, he wasn't averse to persuading her. She wasn't averse to being persuaded.</p><p>Waves of heat and almost painful desire rode her body, inciting her to cling to his male bulk, silently asking for more. In response, he gave her such arawly sensual kiss that had she been standing, her knees would have buckled.</p><p>This time, when the kiss broke, she lay her head down on his chest, breathing hard, trying to find her feet again. Maybe, her mind whispered, if this felt so good, the rest would be even better? Fighting to find something less inflammatory to break the tension, she recalled his earlier preoccupation. \"I haven't forgotten you know.\" She sat up.</p><p>\"What?\" His tone was very male, pitched to send her sensitized nerve endings skittering.</p><p>Struggling against her reaction, she realized that she was stroking the bunched muscles under the edge of his sleeve. Because she adored touching him, she didn't stop. \"That you didn't answer my question about what it was that took you so far away from me.\"</p><p>\"Taylor.\" He said her name as he always did when annoyed with her, a bit exasperated, a little stubborn.</p><p>\"Where?\" she repeated, determined to find out what was haunting him. This marriage would only work if he trusted her as she was being forced to trust him.</p><p>He looked at her for a long moment. \"Your speaking of Nick reminded me of my own childhood.\"</p><p>\"What was it like, being the child of a director and an actress?\" His parents were both winners of awards atCannesand the Oscars. His half sister, Valetta, looked to be following in their illustrious footsteps, while his two half brothers, Mario andCarlton, were having a somewhat rockier road to fame on the silver screen.</p><p>\"Lonely.\" The honesty was raw. \"I was the only child from their brief union, nine years older than Mario.</p><p>My parents were very young when I was born. My half siblings are strangers to me. My mother kept Carltonafter her marriage to his father, her third husband, broke up, and my father decided to build Mario and Valetta's mother a home next to his. I grew up with nannies and then boarding schools - aside from my name, all they ever gave me was the best care money could buy. Nothing more. Nothing less.\"</p><p>There was, she realized, no self-pity or anger in his tone at the injustice of being emotionally abandoned by his parents. JacksonSantorini's past had shaped a strong man, a man who would not easily break.</p><p>\"I began boarding school at age five,\" he continued. \"I saw my mother twice that year.\"</p><p>\"And your father?\"Taylorasked, hurting at the intense loneliness she heard behind the calm words.</p><p>Despite everything, she'd never really been alone.Helenahad not been the best of mothers but she'd never abandoned her children, and sometimes she'd even helpedTaylorthrough the things a girl needed her mother for. Then there had been Nick to love and he'd loved her back.</p><p>\"Once that year.\" His mouth quirked. \"To introduce me to Amber or was it Mandy? Another big-breasted blonde. They get younger with each wife.\"</p><p>\"They sound like absolutely terrible parents,\" she declared, without thinking that it might not be politic.</p><p>He stared at her for a moment and then started to chuckle. \"I guess they are.\"</p><p>\"Sorry.\" She was abashed by her rude words.</p><p>\"No, you're right.\" He kissed her neck, as if hewas tasting her. His lips were soft, his breath hot. \"I was determined to never be like them.\"</p> <p>\"And you're not!\" Snapped out of the sensual fog he could spin so easily, she sat up, scowling at the self-disgust she heard in his tone.</p><p>\"I am my father's son.\"Jacksonacknowledged the awful truth. \"I may have inherited his frailties.\"</p><p>Taylorrolled her eyes. \"Don't be silly.\"</p><p>\"I once married a young blonde.\"</p><p>\"You and the blonde both happened to be the same age at the time. Your father tends to go for the cradle.\" Her quick response was accompanied by a dry smile.</p><p>\"I can't promise you loyalty.\" He didn't trust himself, not when his father's philandering genes ran in his veins. He'd never once cheated on Bonnie, but who knew when the badness would kick in.</p><p>\"You're not a dog.\"</p><p>He scowled at her. \"Stop being flippant.\" He knew how hurt she'd been at being abandoned by Lance, and yet he couldn't help himself from telling her the truth, needing her to accept him despite his flaws. It was an impossible situation because once she knew thetruth, she would never trust him with the love he wanted. The love he needed.</p><p>One eyebrow rose. \"Why not? You're being overdramatic. Must come from working in the movies.\"</p><p>\"Taylor.\" Nobody else ever reduced him to growling.</p><p>\"That doesn't work anymore,\" she said, gleefully.</p><p>\"It never did.\" He was undone by her irreverence. \"Don't you want to know the truth?\"</p><p>\"I know all I need to know. You'll care for me and you'll care for Nick while we're yours and afterward, you'll make sure that we have what we need.\" Her words were practical, her tone even. Implicit was an acceptance that this marriage would end in a year. He wanted to shake her out of her blithe assurance that she could walk away from him, force her to accept his claim. \"That's more than anyone's ever done for me. It's enough.\"</p><p>It wasn't enough for him. He should have been glad at finding such a sensible woman. Yet he kept thinking that he was being shortchanged, if he accepted that this was allTaylorhad to give him. Taylor, who had so much spirit and courage and hope. Taylor, whohe'd thought would lead him out of the darkness into which he'd tumbled after years of cold loneliness.</p><p>He supposed he deserved it. After all, a practical arrangement was all he'd asked for and she'd promised to deliver - Nick's safety in exchange for a baby. His eyes narrowed. He had a year to make Taylorpregnant. Once he had her carrying his child, he'd teach her to trust him with her love, even if it took a lifetime. PoorTaylor, she had no idea who she'd struck a bargain with.</p><p>\"I think we have to at least show up at this party,\" he toldTaylorlater that day. They'd spent most of the previous hours working on legal documents, taking only a short break to explore the nearby coral reef.</p><p>The excursion had been worth making time for, if only to see the wonder onTaylor's face as they snorkeled through the reef's colorful and fearless inhabitants.</p><p>Though he was aware that after their returnTaylorhad spent time on the phone with her therapist, Maggie, he hadn't asked her about it. It was enough that she'd found someone who was able to help her.</p><p>\"It's being hosted by the resort owners.\" Knowing them was the reason he'd been able to get a spot on the exclusive paparazzi-free island on such short notice.</p><p>Scowling,Taylorsaid, \"No, we're not going.\"</p><p>He was so used to her sunny nature that he was momentarily stunned by the determined denial. \"Why not?\"</p><p>He heard her gritting her teeth. \"I was poor,Jackson. I won't know how to fit in there. It'd be different starting out in our home because it would be my territory.\"</p><p>Her response astounded him. She was usually so self-contained and confident that occasionally he wished she'd show a little more need for him, but he'd never wanted her so vulnerable that she was hurting.</p><p>\"You've worked in the industry...\" he began, at a loss. And yet, the primitive part of him was exulting that she'd forgotten herself enough to share her fears with him.</p><p>\"As a secretary!\" Her eyes glittered. \"They'll look down on me.\"</p><p>He walked across the verandah and clamped his hands on her shoulders. \" Cara mia, I would never let them hurt you.\"</p><p>She bit her lip. He knew about her lack of trust in men and their promises, and could even understand it, but it still hurt when she didn't immediately believe in him.</p><p>\"I won't let the vultures near you.\" He wanted to show her the tenderness she needed, but his voice came out rough, almost a command that she trust him.</p><p>To his surprise, she reacted favorably. Her back straightened and she threw him a glare for daring to give her an order. \"I don't have anything to wear.\"</p><p>\"We can go shopping in the resort boutiques. Whatever you wear, you'll knock 'em dead.\"</p><p>Her smile was brilliant, far more like the woman he was used to. \"Thank you. You're a kind man.\"</p><p>When she pecked him on the cheek, hegrit his teeth against the urge to haul her to the floor and indulge his starving senses. Kind? If he'd been a kind man, he'd have tried harder to think of a way to help her without marrying her. The truth was, when the idea had come, he hadn't looked any further, because he'd wanted sweetTaylorfor his very own. And he would fight to keep her.</p><p>Santorinimen weren't known for their sharing nature.</p><p>Taylorfound a long, electric-blue gown in a shimmering fabric that was light enough for the tropical weather, but had a shine to it that meant it would do for an evening gown. It had no sleeves, and the soft curves of material at the neckline emphasized her breasts. The only things holding up the flimsy creation were two small diamante clasps on the shoulders. Up to that point, the dress was lovely. It was the fact that it had practically no back that had her biting her lip in indecision.</p><p>Looking over her shoulder into the dressing room mirror, she found the curved line of her spine framed in blue. She knew that if she went out in this dress, her husband's big hand was going to be on her bare skin for long periods of the night. She'd always known thatJacksonwould be very, very possessive about his woman. So, he would touch her in public, make his claim, make certain no one had any doubts about the fact that she belonged to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shivered at the image, the tiny hairs on her body standing up. The thought ofJackson's hands on her didn't scare her, but it had taken Maggie to make her realize the depth of trust she had in him.</p><p>\"What are you afraid of?\" Maggie had asked earlier that day, deep into the long-distance session.</p><p>She'd remembered being pushed against the door in the basement, of the hand over her mouth in that park. \"Pain, humiliation ... of having my trust broken again.\"</p><p>\"Oh, soJacksonhurts you? Debases you?\"</p><p>\"No! How dare you say that?\" she'd yelled, furious.</p><p>\"If I'm so wrong,\" Maggie had paused, \"then what are you really afraid of?\"</p><p>It had taken her long minutes to answer. \"My own cowardice. What if I can't be what he needs?\"</p><p>\"What if you can? Take one step and find out.\"</p><p>One step. Like havingJackson's hands all over her. It was a distinctly tantalizing image after the way she'd run her own hands all over him and received such pleasure.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she slipped out of the dress. In the mirror, her breasts were almost quivering with desire. Oh, yes, the thought of having her husband's hands all over her wasn't a reason against buying this dress.</p><p>The party wasn't as harrowing as she'd feared. Though she'd worked hard to climb out from under Lance's shadow, sometimes his barbs about her worth returned to haunt her. But, it appeared that her panic had been for naught. True to his word,Jacksonwas by her side throughout the night and once it became clear that she was very much his, people treated her with a sort of cautious pleasantness.</p><p>Taylorhad to hide her smile. She'd never inspired fear in anyone, but her dark and very Italian husband certainly did. She approved. In this world, he needed every advantage. It was enough for his wife to know that he wasn't a man who would hurt those he'd sworn to protect. No one else needed to be aware of his tenderness.</p><p>The only sour point came toward the end of the evening. A buxom blonde sidled up toJackson, as if Taylorweren't held firmly by his side, his big hand flat on her lower back. As she'd guessed, he hadn't stopped touching her for more than a few seconds at a time. On occasion, he'd move his thumb in an idle movement and her breath would catch while the bottom fell out of her stomach.</p><p>The heat of him was enticing enough but when he moved his hand ... she wanted to beg him to move a little lower. Oh yes, havingJackson's hands all over her was becoming more and more intriguing.</p><p>Especially if he touched her whole body the way he'd touched her back tonight. No pain, extreme possessiveness and a hot, wanting look in his eyes.</p><p>She had the feeling that if she'd been an ordinary woman with no hang-ups, they'd have either arrived at the party very late or not at all. The minute she'd walked out of her room, his face had tensed and he'd growled at her to get her \"little butt back in there\" and change out of that \"excuse for a dress.\"</p><p>Of course she hadn't, but with any other woman she knewJacksonwould've probably won the fight by the simple expedient of tearing off the dress, and keeping her in bed until it was too late to make an appearance. The primitive desire that had glittered in his eyes when he first saw her had been an explicit indication of exactly what he wanted to do to her. If they did end up making love, she'd have to watch his tendency to take over her life and she had no illusions that he wouldn't try.</p><p>That was the man he was, difficult to handle, almost impossible to fight, but perhaps, she thought with feminine insight, he could be coaxed, gentled. And if he did allow her to tame him, even just a little, didn't that mean she had some power in the marriage? Being with him was very definitely a partnership - he expected her to match him.</p><p>TrustingJacksonwith her body became an even more attractive option when she understood the dynamic of their relationship, so attractive that she was involved in a heated daydream about her big husband and her naked body, when the top-heavy blonde sashayed over.</p><p>\"JacksonSantorini ! I thought it was you.\" The twit made the mistake of laying a hand onJackson's sleeve.</p><p>Eyes narrowed,Taylorreached out and brushed the woman's hand off. \"Oops. I think my husband had some ... dirt, on his sleeve. You really should watch that, darling.\" She glanced up at him, a warning in her eyes.</p><p>He was trying not to grin. \"Thank you, mia moglie .\"</p> <p>The sensual glint in his eye told her that he was pleased at her little show of jealousy. She didn't care.</p><p>Forget anything she'd ever said about allowing him a mistress. If he touched another woman, she'd gut them both.</p><p>\"Do I know you?\"JacksonhuggedTaylorto his side, soothing her with his obvious display of ownership.</p><p>A spark of anger appeared in the blonde's eyes. \"BelleBouvier . We met at the Vanderbilt party last spring.\"</p><p>\"Apologies, Belle. You look a little different.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" The twit dimpled, apparently forgiving him. \"I remember! I'd dyed my hair black! Can you imagine?\"</p><p>\"Well, I did see you when it was black.\"</p><p>Taylorcould tell that he was fighting the urge to burst out laughing. \"Hello, Belle. I'mTaylor.\"</p><p>\"Nice to meet you.\" The poisonous look in her eyes said otherwise. \"I just wanted to congratulate Jackson.\"</p><p>\"For what?\"Jacksonasked.</p><p>\"My sources tell me that you've just been voted Glitter magazine's sexiest bachelor of the year.\"</p><p>\"No longer a bachelor.\" He looked down at Taylor, who was fuming. \"Thank you, Belle, but you'll have to excuse me. I believe our hostess is signaling us.\"</p><p>As they walked,Taylormuttered, \"Bouvier, my foot.\"</p><p>Jacksonsnickered, hugging her to him. It appeared that whileTaylorcould talk about him keeping a mistress, reality was another matter. He had a possessive little wife on his hands. Life had just become a lot more interesting.</p><p>\"Stage name, I would guess.\" He moved his hand on the smooth skin of her back, coaxing her back into a good mood. Not that he minded the reason for her temper. He was confident enough of his masculinity to enjoy being considered her personal property.</p><p>She made a little feminine noise but before she could respond to his physical cajoling, a man slithered to a stop in front of them. Henry Carey.Jacksondetested the man. It seemed their night for meeting unwelcome acquaintances.</p><p>\"Santorini.\"</p><p>\"Carey.\" He huggedTaylorcloser to him. She complied, a sleek, giving woman who fitted her bodyto his.</p><p>\"Congratulations on your marriage.\"</p><p>\"Word travels fast.\"</p><p>\"You know how it is.\" Henry smirked and turned toTaylor. \"So, it must be ... interesting, being married to a man of your husband's size ... and strength.\"</p><p>The insinuation was clear. The papers had had a field day afterBonnie's suicide, usingJackson's face and image to hint at violence and pain. He usually ignored Henry, finding him pitiful, but tonight his pride rebelled againstTaylorhearing the lies about him. If she heard them often enough, maybe she'd start to believe, maybe she'd start to fear him. He could bear anything but that. About to move toward Carey, he was stopped by his wife, who stepped protectively in front of him.</p><p>\"Why you odious little man ,\"Taylorsaid, her voice hard but low. \"My husband is a better man than you'll ever be, you weedy, pompous creature. I bet you don't even know what to do with a woman ...</p><p>when you can get some female drunk enough to cooperate.\"</p><p>Jacksoncouldn't believeTaylorwas defending him and insulting Henry, and doing it well. The other man wasn't used to trading barbs with a smart woman who didn't consider herself bound by the rules of their impolite society, which deemed that nothing must ever be said with blunt force, only covertly implied.</p><p>\"How dare you...\" Henry began, mouth pinched.</p><p>\"Oh, go away.\" She flicked her hand in a dismissive gesture. \"You annoy me. And if I ever hear you say anything against my husband, I'll tell everyone exactly how you got the funding for your last miserable picture.\"</p><p>Henry's face paled. \"How do you know?\"</p><p>Jacksonwas fascinated. Absolutely and utterly. He stood behind his wife, one hand curved around her body to lie on her stomach, not interfering. Delighted amazement kept him from taking over. No one had ever stood up for him. Not a single person. He was stunned at the feeling that spread through him at seeingTaylor's protectiveness.</p><p>She raised a brow. \"You really should be more discreet. Now, leave.\" It was a regal order.</p><p>Henry left, looking atTaylorwith more fear in his eyes than he'd ever shownJackson.</p><p>\"Piccola?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" She was scowling at Henry's retreating back, her arms folded like some avenging warrior-goddess.</p><p>\"What do you know?\"</p><p>\"Secretaries hear everything. I keep in touch with my friends in the movie business. Let's just say that Henry participated in a casting couch ... in reverse.\"</p><p>\"But, who'd want Henry?\" He was flabbergasted.</p><p>\"Exactly what I said.\"</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Jacksonhad just started unbuttoning the formal black shirt he'd worn to the party, having eschewed any kind of jacket because of the heat, whenTaylorwandered in from across the hall. She had her face scrunched up in concentration and her hands on the clasp of her necklace.</p><p>\"Darling, can you...\" She turned her back to him and swept aside her hair to bare her nape, creamy white against the electric blue of the dress.</p><p>He walked over, hands aching to touch her. \"Darling,\" she'd called him, like they were a normal couple.</p><p>Tonight had been an education, exposing bothTaylor's possessiveness and her protectiveness. But, the fact was, they weren't a normal couple and despite those delightful revelations, he was strung taut with desire for his sweet, sexy wife.</p><p>He undid the clasp without speaking, afraid he'd give away his frustration if he opened his mouth. Her damn dress was a husband's nightmare. He'd had to have a hand on her throughout the evening to warn off the predators. A lot of the men had had a look in their eyes that said they were just waiting until he was distracted, before they pounced. He hadn't being distracted by anything other than the feel of his wife's sleek body under his palm. She'd seemed perfectly happy to let him stake his claim so publicly, not that he'd given her much choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or ever would.</p><p>When the necklace fell intoTaylor's hand, she didn't turn and leave, but bent her head to look at something in the chain that had caught her interest. This time, he couldn't resist the urge. Leaning over, he put his hands lightly on her hips and pressed his lips to her nape.</p><p>A gasp of surprise. \"Jackson?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Since she hadn't moved, he kissed her again, his hands pressing a little more firmly. Lord but she was soft. The urge to pull her tight against his straining arousal was almost irresistible.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Pleasuring you ... and me.\" Another kiss. His hands itched to rise up and cradle her breasts. He kept them still on her hips by force of will alone.</p><p>\"Sexual pleasure?\" It was barely a whisper.</p><p>His gut clenched with guilt. He drew back. \"I am sorry, piccola , I should not have pushed. A kiss doesn't mean permission to ask for more.\"</p><p>She didn't look at him but shook her head. \"Push.\"</p><p>He froze. \"Taylor?\"</p><p>\"I'm tired of being afraid. I want to know what the fuss is all about.\" It was such a Taylor-like answer that he had no trouble believing her. \"And I meant what I said to that odious creature. You're a good man. You'd never hurt me so I have no excuse for fear. Show me.\"</p><p>He bit back a grin, passion tempered by tenderness at her bravado. \"Are you sure?\"</p><p>She sent him a scowling look over her shoulder. \"Yes.\" She reached out and threw the necklace onto a small table in one corner of his room. \"Jackson, what if I can't ... finish this? What if I freeze?\"</p><p>\"Baby, the finish line can be wherever you want. It can end with a kiss or with me inside you. Your choice.\" He put his hands back on her hips. Aware that he could feast on her forever if he did this right, he caged his rampant desire. Tonight, he'd be the tender lover she needed, not the marauder he was.</p><p>\"Just keep pushing until I say stop.\" Her words were flippant but her tone nervous.</p><p>He adored her. \"I'm at your command.\" A sudden thought gave him pause. \" Cara, are you protected?\"</p><p>He didn't expect her to be. After all, she was a virgin. And, he'd ordered her not to guard against pregnancy.</p><p>\"I know what we agreed,Jackson, but I don't think I could handle being pregnant with everything else that's happening. We need to use something.\" She sounded worried but resolute.</p><p>He kissed her neck again. \"Okay, piccola . One step at a time.\" Though his Italian soul rebelled against his wife protecting herself from his seed, the civilized man knew that she was too fragile right now. First he'd seduce her until all worry left her. Then he'd make love to her so often that nothing would protect her. And then, he'd gently love her as she grew big with his child.</p><p>A sigh of relief from his beautiful wife. \"Thank you. If ... we manage to do this, I'll organize a prescription for birth control when we return home. Have you...?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Despite his autocratic demands, he'd brought protection, wise enough to know that he couldn't push her too far, too soon.\"I am healthy, mia moglie .\"He'd had himself tested after he'd discovered Bonnie's infidelities, his pride in shreds. \"After you are on birth control, I want to be skin to skin with you.\" The image ofTaylor's body enclosing his in passionate heat momentarily blinded him with need, obliterating any painful memories.</p><p>Her neck flushed. \"Yes. What...\" He felt her swallow. \"What does mia moglie mean?\"</p> <p>\"My wife.\" He didn't bother to hide his simmering satisfaction at that fact.</p><p>He'd been gently stroking her hips the entire time they'd been talking. Now, he tugged her backward just a little, until their bodies touched along her entire length. He sucked in a breath at the lush feel of her against his erection. She didn't demur at the intimacy, so he moved one hand to lie flat on her stomach, while the other ran up the smooth skin of her arm. She gasped but let him do as he would.Jackson wondered if she'd be a passive lover. The thought didn't appeal.Taylor's fire was one of the reasons he found her so sexually compelling.</p><p>\"Jackson?\" Her tone was pure female temptation.</p><p>\"Yes?\" His voice was becoming hoarse as desire took a stranglehold on him.</p><p>\"Can I touch you, too?\" Fingers settled hesitantly on his arm, as gentle as butterfly wings.</p><p>\"Anywhere,\" he managed to answer, his body taut with memories of her stroking the night before.</p><p>\"Oh, good.\" A sigh of relief. \"You've probably noticed that I can't control myself around your body.\"</p><p>He couldn't help it. Chuckling, he hugged her around her middle and buried his face against her warm neck, breathing in the tart scent that was indisputablyTaylor.</p><p>\"What's so funny?\" Leaning back into him, she clasped slim hands over the hand he had on her stomach.</p><p>\"I was thinking that I am the same where you are concerned, piccola .\" He kissed his way up her throat.</p><p>She tasted like woman. Soft, delectable, welcoming woman. Her body melted for him, accommodating the hard angles of his own body with such sweetness that he was undone.</p><p>\"Jackson,\" she murmured, when he moved to the other side of her neck, pushing her hair aside. Her voice was slumberous, pleasured,as sultry as the tropical night.</p><p>\"Mmm?\" He placed both palms flat against her stomach, accustoming her to the feel of him.Taylorwasn't petite - her head reached his shoulder, but she had a feminine build that made her very vulnerable to his obvious strength. His shoulders were twice the width of hers. If Bonnie had called him brutish before he'd really started pumping weights, what wouldTaylorthink?</p><p>A hint of worry stirred but he fought it.Taylorwasn't Bonnie. She would never deliberately hurt him with cruel barbs. But, given her experience with the more brutal members of his sex, he wondered if she might find his body too big and bulky when he wasn't lying down on the floor, as he'd been when she'd touched him. Possessive, demanding and adoring as hewas, rejection from her might kill him.</p><p>Taylorinterrupted his shadowy musings. \"You know how you have your shirt half unbuttoned?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" He nibbled on her. She shivered and angled her head to give him easier access. He smiled and sucked her skin into his mouth.</p><p>Breathily, she asked, \"Can I undo it all the way?\"</p><p>It took a few moments for the soft question to penetrate his dazed brain. \"When?\"</p><p>\"Now?\" Not so confident a response.</p><p>He knew he could seduce her to a point where his body wouldn't matter. But she might wake with disgust in her eyes, and he couldn't bear that. He turned her in his arms, preparing himself to accept any reaction. She immediately started unbuttoning his shirt. Relieved more than he wanted to acknowledge at her continued fascination with his body, he kissed whatever part of her he could reach.</p><p>Until she pushed at him.</p><p>He moved back a step. Another push on his chest, small hands warm on his skin. Another step back.</p><p>Sable lashes lifted and dark blue eyes met his. He wondered what she was doing. Then the bed hit the back of his legs.</p><p>\"Sit.\" An order made palatable by her smile of anticipation, as if she couldn't wait to touch him.</p><p>He sat and was glad he'd obeyed when she moved into the V of his legs. Unable to resist temptation, he placed his hands on her back, just above her sweetly curved bottom. A sexy smile flirting with her lips, she ran her fingers down the sides of his face to his neck. Her gaze lowered. She licked her lips. His erection grew to impossible proportions. Bending, she pushed the now open shirt off his shoulders, fingers lingering on his skin as if she were indulging her sense of touch. Her breasts were so close that it was torture for him to remain still.</p><p>\"Move your hands.\" A husky command. \"Please,Jackson. I'm trying to be brave because I have to know if I can beat this fear, but ...well, maybe I'm not so very brave.\"</p><p>He was hers. Completely. How could any man deny helping this woman find her way through the world of the most intimate sensuality?</p><p>He obeyed and helped her get rid of his shirt. When he would've returned his hands to their former position, she shook her head and stepped back. Nervous courage and determination were stamped on her features. Facing him, their gazes locked in an intimate embrace that went far beyond thesexual, she reached up and released the diamante clasps on each shoulder.</p><p>Breath lost,Jacksonwatched the material slither to her feet. Stepping out of the pool of shimmering blue, she returned to him. Dressed only in black lace-topped stockings that reached midthigh, lacy black panties and a garter belt, TaylorSantorini had a body that drove her husband insane with lust and hunger.</p><p>He fixed his gaze on her face, knowing that if he looked at her bare breasts he'd devour her.</p><p>\"Jackson?\" She was back between his legs. When he looked up, she sat down on one thigh, arm around his neck and legs primly together between his own legs, the backs of her knees and calves touching his leg on one side.</p><p>\"Yes?\" One of his hands was resting flat on her lower back. Now, he placed the other on her knee.</p><p>\"You have to take over now.\" Her big eyes were solemn. \"I don't know what to do.\"</p><p>He didn't answer her in words, didn't think he could speak. Instead, holding that gaze, woman and girl combined, he leaned down and pressed his lips to hers. Her mouth opened for him at once and she invited him in. He knew she liked kissing, so he kissed her with tender heat, teasing and inviting and tantalizing.</p><p>He began to move the hand on her back, while he slid the other one to her thigh, just above the lace of her stocking. Almost at once, her body began to stiffen. WhileTaylortrusted him, she'd been afraid for too long to give in without fear. He remembered the look in her eyes as she'd stripped so sensuously for him, and wondered about the best way to seduce his wife. Utterly and completely. Until she was whimpering. And cajoling. And demanding.</p><p>When he drew back, her gaze fixed warily on him. \"What comes next?\"</p><p>\"Whatever you like,\" he whispered, moving his thumb along the top edge of her stocking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sat up in his lap, both arms around his neck, breasts grazing his chest. It took every ounce of self-control he had not to lower his head and suck a nipple into his mouth. He could almost feel the succulent flesh against histongue, almost taste the uniqueness that was her. \"I don't have any practical experience. I thought you'd like to be in charge this time around.\"</p><p>So serious, so solemn, like she was learning a lesson in school,Taylor's very innocence gave him the reins he needed to leash his escalating hunger. As a young man, he'd had very earthy appetites. He'd forcibly caged that part of his psyche for years, but when he'd seenTayloron that rainy night, it had shattered the chains and stretched awake. It had been gaining in power over the past week and tonight, he knew it would storm him. Before that happened, he needed to have her trust. Otherwise, he thought darkly, the strength of his passion could devastate her.</p><p>\"I'm afraid of hurting you,\" he admitted. He ran the hand on her thigh up her side. Her skin was so smooth and silky that he just wanted to lay her down and indulge himself in her body. Tugging her hand off his shoulder, he pressed his palm against hers. \"I'm so much bigger than you.\" Their differences were graphically illustrated by the way his hand dwarfed hers.</p><p>Eyes wide, she stared and then carefully intertwined her fingers through his. Pulling their clasped hands to her lips, she kissed his knuckles one by one, her lips velvety on his skin. The tenderness of the caress shook him. Biting sensual need was overlaid with a painfully soft emotion. No woman had ever touched him like that. As if she was afraid of hurting him.</p><p>\"Cara.\"He released her hand and returned his to her curvy hip. \"I want to give you only pleasure. Tell me what would pleasure you, my little wife.\"</p><p>\"I'm not little.\" She glared and pushed her hands into his hair. \"Well, only next to you.\"</p><p>\"I'm the only one who matters.\" He kissed her once more, loving the taste of her. \"What do you like?</p><p>This?\" He moved his thumb on her thigh again.</p><p>\"Yes.\" It was a whisper against his lips.</p><p>\"This?\" He reluctantly left her lips to press kisses along the tops of her breasts. He was careful to use only his mouth to caress her, aware that she had come to associate male hands on her breasts with pain.</p><p>\"Oh, yes. Can you...\"</p><p>He raised his head, the barbarian maleness within him scenting victory within his grasp. \"Yes, piccola?\"</p><p>Blushing, she shook her head. \"No, it's okay.\"</p><p>\"Tell me. I don't want to be a brute.\" He deliberately played up his helplessness. He was floundering, not wanting to scare her, but he also knew that for some reason he would never understand, his little wife was insanely protective of him.</p><p>\"You're not!\" She frowned at him, fingers digging into his flesh. \"Don't you ever let anyone call youthat. \"</p><p>He bit back his smile to nibble at her lips. \"Tell me then. What would you like?\"</p><p>She looked down and then back up. Her cheeks were pink. Dressed in strips of delicate black lace, she was sexy innocence personified. \"I just wondered...\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" He cradled her nearer, pressing her against the heat of his body. The pressure of her full breasts on his chest pushed him one step closer to insanity.</p><p>She snuggled impossibly closer. \"You know how I like to touch you?\"</p><p>Did he know? He'd never been as aroused as he'd been last night. \"Yes.\" It came out a rough growl.</p><p>\"Um ... I thought since you liked it so much and I liked doing it ... I thought it might work in reverse.\"</p><p>Crazed with desire, it took him a few seconds to understand. He buried his face in her hair, trying to relearn to breathe. The scent of her twined around him, turning up the heat several degrees. He burned.</p> <p>For her.</p><p>\"No?\" A faint whisper. \"You wouldn't like that?\"</p><p>Raising his head, he kissed her hard. \"Like it? I feel like all my Christmases have come at once.\"</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise. \"Why?\"</p><p>He smiled, finding his footing again. \"Because you're going to let me touch you.\" He stroked his hands to clasp her waist. \"Kiss you.\" He pressed his lips against her jaw. \"Fondle you.\" He ran one hand boldly to her breast and closed over it very, very gently, shocking a gasp out of her. \"And do anything else I please.\" Grinning, he kicked off his shoes,then put her on the bed, lying down beside her, propped up on one elbow. \"Can I touch you anywhere?\"</p><p>Wide-eyed, she nodded. \"It only seems fair.\"</p><p>Chuckling, he put one hand on her stomach. \"Do you like everything I've done so far?\"</p><p>Her immediate nod made him grin.</p><p>\"What did you like best?\" He leaned close, giving her the intimacy she needed to make her sensual requests.</p><p>She swallowed but said, \"Your hands on me.\"</p><p>He fought off a shudder. \"In that case...\" Moving the hand on her stomach, he brought it to her garter belt. \"Can I take this off?\"</p><p>\"I can...\" she began to offer, reaching between their bodies. Her knuckles brushed his abdomen and he had to bite back the demand that she move lower.</p><p>\"I want to.\" After a little fumbling, he flicked open the catches holding the entire contraption together.</p><p>Pulling it off her, he threw it aside. Now, his pretty little wife was dressed only in barely there panties and lace-topped black stockings.</p><p>He saw her swallow. Her eyes fluttered shut. It was just as well that she wasn't looking, because he was sure that the lust in his eyes would've scared his sexyTaylor. His teeth-gritting control after she'd first stripped had flown out the window with the garter belt.</p><p>He'd known that she had lush breasts, just right for his big hands, but he'd never thought that they'd be so delicate, traced with blue veins and translucent skin. He could spend hours adoring those breasts, topped with coral-colored nipples that peaked for him when he touched them with the tip of one finger.</p><p>\"Oh!\"Taylor's body arched and her eyes opened.</p><p>Looking up, he held her gaze as he closed a hand over her left breast. It was time she learned to associate pleasure with this particular man's hands on her. Because he intended to have them there on a regular basis.</p><p>Her body went taut. Her heartbeat accelerated.</p><p>\"Breathe,\" he instructed.</p><p>\"I can't, not when you're doing that!\" She sucked in a breath, giving lie to her declaration. \"That feels ...</p><p>good.\" Her surprised words trailed off into a moan as he began to massage her sensitive flesh. \"Jackson, please don't stop.\"</p><p>He had to bite back a smile of satisfaction at the little victory. \"Try and make me.\" He played with her breasts untila sheen of perspiration covered her body, a fine layer that made her skin shimmer. He thanked God that she hadn't thought to ask for the lights to be turned off. The sight of her long-limbed, luscious body coming to life for him was indescribable. Her nipples were very sensitive - a touch and she whimpered, a rub and shegasped, a squeeze and her entire body went taut.</p><p>When she was moaning, needy without knowing what she searched for, he leaned down and took one pouting nipple into his mouth and suckled. Hard. Her body shuddered. Against her, he smiled in satisfaction and moved to her neglected breast. He wasn't going to be merciful and let her rest. Not when he could feel his own need trying to buck the reins. Another wave of shudders rippled through her. Her hands clutched at his body, desperately trying to find an anchor.</p><p>Using his teeth to hold it for a moment, he finally released her nipple, sending tiny shock waves through her limp body. While she was half-dazed, he got rid of the rest of his clothing and took care of protection. She'd barely risen through the pleasure-fog when he rejoined her.</p><p>There was no fear in her eyes, nothing but surprised joy and welcome. For him. Certain of her acquiescence, he ran his hand down her stomach to the satin and lace protecting her core. Wet heat met his cupping hand. The wild hunger in him came within sniffing distance of freedom. He pressed his fingers against her, pushing her toward another precipice. Blue eyes, almost blind with desire, opened.</p><p>\"Jackson...\" She sounded lost.</p><p>He moved over her, careful not to scare her with his weight, but she relaxed at the touch of his body.</p><p>Arms around him, she parted her legs. The trust implicit in the action shook him. Sliding one hand under her neck, he tangled his fingers in her hair and lifted her head for a kiss that was lusty and wild and erotic.</p><p>She reciprocated stroke for stroke, meeting his demands and making her own, her breasts pressing against the crisp hair on his chest. With his other hand, he continued to stroke her through her panties, assuaging the need he'd aroused.</p><p>Possessive need roared through him when she squirmed under him. She was his . No other man had ever touched her like he was touching her. And, he vowed, no other man ever would. A yearbe damned.</p><p>Child or not, TaylorSantorini was never going to be allowed to leave her husband.</p><p>The sensation ofJackson's crisp, black hair against her breasts renderedTayloralmost insensate with bliss. All these years, she'd associated shame with her breasts. After tonight, if she survived, she'd think only of the pure heat inJackson's eyes as he'd indulged himself. After his attentive loving, her flesh was incredibly tender. Hardly knowing what she was doing, she rubbed herself against him and heard him groan, deep inside. The hand between her legs was removed.</p><p>She ripped her lips from his and said, \"No! Come back!\" and surprised herself with her own boldness.</p><p>Twenty-four years of sexual starvation had made her voracious. AndJackson's tenderness had made her daring. The joy she felt was overwhelming.</p><p>He growled at her as if he was almost over the edge, and kissed her again. When she felt close to mindless, he pushed her down into the pillow and she felt his big hand slipping under one side of her panties. She was puzzled by the action for only a second because by then he'd ripped the fragile material from her body. Then he did as she'd asked and cupped her again. Except this time there was no barrier between her most sensitive place and his big, possessive hand. Or his fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She writhed against him, loving the weight of him on her. When he nudged at her with his hips, she wrapped her legs around his waist. Hot male skin sizzled against the tingling skin of her upper thighs. He was naked. Opening dazed eyes, she said, \"When?\"</p><p>He didn't answer, intent on kissing the side of her neck while his fingers stroked and rubbed and did everything to make her lose her fragile control on reality. She dug her fingers into his arms and tried to tug him up.</p><p>Dark eyes slammed into hers when he rose. \"You want something?\" His voice was edgy, dangerous. If he hadn't been hers, she might've been scared. Except he was hers and the rough desire in his voice made her feel exquisitely, utterly sexy.</p><p>\"You.\" Against her thigh, she could feel the hard heat of him. For her. JacksonSantorini desired her. \"I want you.\"</p><p>\"You're not ready.\" He dipped his head to kiss her breastbone, his tongue stroking a line up to her neck.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out over her body. \"What?\" She tangled her hands in his hair. \"I am.\"</p><p>\"I'm too big. You have to be wetter.\"</p><p>She swallowed. Then his finger started rubbing a very, very, very pleasurable spot between her legs, and she stopped wondering just how big her big husband was. All she could thinkwas, please don't let him stop. He didn't. He kept going until she was whimpering, limp and aching with need.</p><p>\"Please,\" she begged. \"Oh, please,Jackson.\"</p><p>He was without mercy. \"I have to make you ready, piccola . There will be only pleasure for you this night. Absolute pleasure.\" He pushed one finger deep into her. Her body clenched around him, trying to capture his power. \"Feel the strength of what is between us. Give me your satisfaction.\" Demanding eyes met hers.</p><p>She tried to say that she had no more pleasure left to give, when he carefully slid another finger into her.</p><p>A scream was torn from her as tiny, exquisitely erotic quakes shook her body from the inside out. Even as she rode the storm, she could feel him gently but insistently spreading his fingers within her, an intimate invasion that sent flames racing through her bloodstream, marking her asSantorini's woman.</p><p>\"Why?\" It was all she could trust herself to say, her gaze locked with his in an intimacy so deep, it took the sexual connection to another level.</p><p>\"I'm stretching you, my little wife .\" There was an emphasis on that last word, an edge in his voice that could only be described as dominant. \"You must take one more before you will be ready.\" It was a sensual dare.</p><p>Pulling his head down, she kissed him, taking a sharp bite out of his lower lip in retaliation. He chuckled hoarsely against her and she felt him slide that third finger, oh-so-slowly, inside her. Unable to stop, she clenched around him, her body strung taut in expectation. This time, she wasn't going over alone.</p><p>\"Now!\" she ordered. \"Right now, JacksonSantorini !\"</p><p>His eyes flashed at the order but there was a curve to his mouth. \"My pleasure, Mrs.Santorini .\" He withdrew his fingers and rose above her, arms braced on either side of her head. Then he ran one hand down her side to cup her buttock and hold her in place, while his thighs kept her parted legs open for him. Without further prelude, he thrust into her in a single powerful stroke.</p><p>She screamed and bucked at the invasion.</p><p>\"Hush. The pain will pass.\" It was a low-voiced command, almost a growl. \"It was better all at once.\"</p><p>The sheer maleness of the comment snapped her out of her sudden shock. She hadn't expected it to hurt so much. Catching her breath, she glared at the sexy man holding her prisoner. \"Easy for you to say. Big, my eye! You're enormous!\"</p><p>She couldn't believe he started to grin through the strain on his face. \"Wait 'till I am really aroused, little one.\" It was clear that he was teasing her with that emphasis on \"little.\"</p><p>\"Ha, ha.\" In an effort to settle him more comfortably inside her, she wiggled.</p> <p>His eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>She froze. \"Jackson? Am I hurting you?\"</p><p>He sounded like he was struggling to breathe. \"You're torturing me.\" He opened his eyes. \"Do you suppose you're ready for me to move?\" The rough amusement in his tone made her sigh in relief.</p><p>His chest was as delicious as ever. The wide expanse of hot male skin had quickly distracted her from the sharp pain. It was the feeling of complete and utter penetration that took some getting used to. \"Can you goslow ?\"</p><p>He looked at her like she was mad. \" Dio! After I die in this bed, please tell the church that I am a candidate for sainthood.\" Despite his obvious arousal, he did move slowly, making her sensitive inner tissues feel almost too much. Under her hands, his back muscles moved in an erotic symphony. Fire began to ripple through her.</p><p>Two slow, deep strokes later, he stopped. \"I can't.\"</p><p>\"Can't?\" shecried , desperate. \"You have to! It feels wonderful.\" The sensation of his big body moving inside her was the best thing she'd ever experienced.</p><p>He glanced down at her with that dark male look that had always scared her. Except on him, it made her want to pet and soothe. And give.</p><p>\"I.Can't. Go. Slow.\" He was enunciating his words very carefully, as if he'd forgotten how to speak English. The Italian in him was very much apparent, all smoky heat and possessive hunger.</p><p>Wrapping her arms and legs tight around him, she whispered, \"Then go fast.\" Her trust in him was absolute.</p><p>\"Taylor.\" His eyes went darker than night at her consent and she could almost see his control snap.\"Hold on, mia moglie e bellissima .\"</p><p>Clasping her hard against him, he surged into her and then there was only passionate fury. Her husband's body drove deeper and deeper until she felt indelibly marked. Forever branded. Her skin tightened over her entire body as he stroked her closer to a shattering crescendo so magnificent that her mind could barely comprehend the sensory overload.</p><p>Then every muscle, in her body seemed to stiffen and barely a second later, explode. She screamed as hot, hard sexual pleasure short-circuited every nerve she possessed, shocking her into ecstasy so powerful that she felt singed. Her only anchor was her husband, big and powerful and hers.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Jacksonroused at six the next morning to findTaylorcrushed under him. He lifted himself off at once.</p><p>\"Whatchyadoin'?\" A sleepyTaylorraised her arms above her head and stretched. Her breasts rubbed against his chest, plump and inviting.</p><p>\"I was squashing you.\" He laid his hand on her rib cage, indulging in the feel of her sleep-warmed skin, like liquid satin under his palm.</p><p>\"Um.\" Lazy blue eyes blinked at him. She raised her hands and squeezed his biceps. \"You're kinda heavy but I didn't mind. It's nice. Like a sexy blanket.\" Then she tried to span one muscular upper arm with her small hands, without success. \"You're so...\" She just sighed.</p><p>His throat turned dry. \"I wasn't hurting you?\"</p><p>She leaned up and ran her teeth along the muscles she seemed fascinated with. \"What?\"</p><p>\"Never mind. Go right ahead.\" He let her push him onto his back, more than ready for her soft caresses.</p><p>To his surprise, she suddenly sat up wide-awake. \"Am I being selfish? I should be thinking about my brother.\"</p><p>\"We've done all we can for the moment.\" He reached up to touch her cheek. \"Enjoy yourself. It might be tough for a while once the paparazzi descend.\"</p><p>Her scowl was ferocious. \"If they hurt you again, I swear I'll kill someone.\"</p><p>He pulled her down to sprawl on top of him. \"Thank you.\" His heart was so used to cynicism that he could barely understand this new emotion shouldering its way in.</p><p>\"You're welcome.\" She made a solemn face, then leaned up on her elbows and kissed his jaw. \"Jackson?\"</p><p>\"Yes, piccola?\" He felt such tenderness for her that he spoke to her as he never did to another human being.</p><p>\"Thank you for last night.\"</p><p>She was thanking him for the most sensual experience of his life? \"I'm the grateful one here, Taylor. I've only one word to describe you. Hot.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" She propped herself up on his chest with her forearms. \"I'm hot?\" Her wildly tousled hair caressed his skin while her smile brought sunshine into the room.</p><p>\"Yes.\" He chuckled at her delight. \"I forgot to give you something last night.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"It's over there, in the drawer.\" He hadn't wanted to give her the intimate gift until she'd accepted him as a lover, but hadn't been able to stop himself from buying it.</p><p>She wiggled off his body and walked over, holding a sheet to her front. Grinning, he feasted on the back view instead. \"This big box?\" She pulled out a flat box, her long hair curling just above her bottom, drawing his eye to her perfect shape.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Hot was an understatement. She was giving him third-degree burns with that body of hers.</p><p>He sat up when she came to kneel beside him on the bed. Tearing off the paper, she bared the name of a well-known lingerie designer. \"Ooooooh.\" Eyes wide, she pulled off the lid to expose several pieces of lacey silk underwear. Picking up a tiny pair of panties, she gave him an arch look. \"Is this a present for me or you?\"</p><p>He kissed a nipple, biting back a smile. \"Both.\"</p><p>She dropped the silky creation back into the box and pushed her hands through his hair, her smile bright.</p><p>\"I think I'm okay now,Jackson. I'm not afraid anymore.\"</p><p>He looked up into her blue eyes. \"Perhaps you accept that you are safe with me in bed, but what about the fears in here?\" He touched her heart.</p><p>She looked troubled. \"Just being able to make love isn't enough, is it?\"</p><p>\"No, but it's a fine place to start.\" He tumbled her below him, vowing to teach her to entrust him with her love. For now, he'd work on obtaining her complete trust in bed, because despite her belief that she wasn't afraid anymore, flickers of fear still shadowed her eyes, her wounds too deep to be healed by one night of loving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her everlasting shock,Taylorfound that she liked sex withJackson. There was no painful groping, no horrible kissing,no embarrassment. It was just bliss. Two days of indulging her new addiction hadn't in any way lessened her ardor. Though it worried her thatJacksonwas holding back so as not to scare her, that worry wasn't enough to dim her delight at having overcome her fear of intimacy.</p><p>Keeping her end of their bargain was no longer an issue ... physically. But, what about the emotional scars?Jacksonhad alluded to her decision never to love, but he had no way of knowing that she feared having a child even more than simply loving. If her mother hadn't been pregnant with her, she might've been less vulnerable to a man like Lance. And, ifHelenahadn't had Nick to link her to Lance, she might not have descended into despair at his desertion.</p><p>But, she thought with sudden insight, she wasn'tHelenaandJacksonwas unlike any other man she knew.</p><p>Lance had never wanted her because she was another man's child. Well, so was Nick. Yet,Jackson's treatment of him had been nothing short of paternal.</p><p>But what about her? Was she strong enough, secure enough to giveJacksonwhat he wanted? The truth was, she didn't know. He was the only man she could ever imagine being with, but a part of her didn't believe that he'd never leave her and condemn her to the emotional hellHelenahad endured. Perhaps time would prove her fears to be groundless. But, the clock was running against her. If she wasn't pregnant within twelve months, she'd lose her husband. Yet, a year wasn't very long when she'd had twenty-four years to nurture her beliefs about marriage, children and a woman's dependence on a man.</p><p>Jacksonwalked out of the shower while she was sitting on the bed. Immediately, she pushed her anxiety aside. For this week out of time, she'd given herself permission to indulge. There would be more than enough time to face reality when they returned home.</p><p>Towel hitched around his lean waist, he shoved a hand through his wet hair. Instead of heading to the wardrobe, he stood in the centre of the bedroom, scowl on his face.</p><p>My, but he was sexy, she thought, her face heating. Sorawly masculine that it made her feel ultimately female. She might like sex but she was new at it. Her husband's thickly muscledbody made her want to squeeze and stroke and just plain old touch! She bit her lower lip as heat pooled in her stomach and spread throughout her body, fingers of flame that enticed and urged.</p><p>\"What're you thinking?\" she asked softly, shifting to kneel on the bed. Her frivolous and decadently short white nightie, part ofJackson's gift, brushed her upper thighs. The tiny hairs on her bare arms rose in anticipation.</p><p>\"Hmm?\" He walked over to stand in front of her kneeling form. \"The call this morning was about our newest picture.Britnee Case is demanding another million.\"</p><p>She raised a brow. \"That girl's not worth it.\"</p><p>He nodded. \"But she's the only one David wants.\"</p><p>\"Hmm.\" She ran a finger up his washboard stomach, still slightly damp. \"Can you replace David?\"</p><p>He slid his hands through her unbound hair. In the heat, she would've preferred to put it up, but she was well aware that her husband liked to play with it. And she wanted to please her husband, the way he pleased her.</p><p>Deep inside, she was afraid that he found her wanting. He always had to hang onto his control because, despite everything, she wasn't quite able to make love without fear yet. Groundless fear. He would never hurt her - she just had to remember that and she'd be fine.</p><p>\"No, he's too valuable,\" he said. \"The last movie he directed is the hot favorite for several Golden Globes. Even more important,\" he admitted wryly, \"his films make money.\"</p><p>Something floated up from her subconscious. \"David's proud of his rep as a straight arrow. Drop a few hints that if you meetBritnee's demands, it might look like you were doing favors for the director's lover.</p><p>He'll either talkBritnee around or get another actress.\"</p><p>\"Lover?\" His voice was becoming husky.</p><p>Screwing up her courage, she licked his stomach. Impossibly, the muscles tightened even more.</p><p>\"Uh-huh. A little birdie told me.\"</p><p>\"Taylor, you're an excellent source of information and you haven't even been in the business for a year.\"</p> <p>His hand fisted in her hair, a heavy weight that told her he liked what she was doing.</p><p>Used to the way he played with her hair, she found the gesture possessive butnonthreatening . \"I kept in touch with the staff I met while working for you.\" Her real objective had been to keep track of him, but gossip of all sorts had flowed to her. She'd be useful to him in that way as she had no intention of letting those contacts lapse. \"Is using that kind of stuff unethical?\"</p><p>\"Not when she's blackmailing us with the location shoot scheduled to start in three days.\"</p><p>\"Umm.\" Just to see if she could, she tried to take a bite out of his firm stomach. There wasn't enough excess flesh to do so.</p><p>He tugged at her hair. When she glanced up, he said, \"Only if you want to, piccola . I am in no hurry.\"</p><p>She was shocked that he understood her fears. \"I want to be the woman you need.\"</p><p>\"You are. Everything about you pleases me.\"</p><p>The simple statement rebuilt her confidence and the look in his eyes reignited her desire. \"How much do you exercise to stay like this?\" She kissed her way halfway up his chest, relieved to be allowed to just touch his body, without expectations or demands.</p><p>He tugged her head up with the hand clenched in her hair, dark eyes indulgent in a way that she'd only ever seen in bed. When he looked at her like that, she wanted to lay herself down for his delectation.</p><p>\"I always kept fit but after Bonnie began to cheat, I did it obsessively. Better than becoming an alcoholic.\" His smile was tight.</p><p>Bonnie, she thought with an inward flare of anger, had a lot to answer for. \"And now?\"</p><p>\"Habit. Once a day or at least once every two. Why?\"</p><p>\"Can I watch?\" she found herself asking, admitting to a secret fantasy that was at once exciting and scandalous.</p><p>\"Watch?\" He was aroused under the towel. In fact, she had no idea how the soft white fabric was staying in place.</p><p>\"You, working out. Do you wear a T-shirt?\" She saw him swallow. Her heartbeat accelerated.</p><p>\"Sometimes. Do you want me to?\" Rough and dangerous, his tone told her that she'd be well loved tonight.</p><p>If she wanted to be loved.</p><p>His hunger for her was a heady aphrodisiac that made her fight her fears. \"No. I want to see you sweat.\"</p><p>He groaned. \"Taylor, I hope you're trying to seduce me because if you're not, we're in big trouble.\"</p><p>She laughed and stood up on the bed, which made her a little taller than him. \"Am I any good?\"</p><p>A slow smile broke across that dark face. \"You're better than good.\" His hands rested on her barely covered bottom, moving in slow circles. \"How about you pay up?\" A far more serious question lingered in his eyes.</p><p>\"Promise, first.\" She pressed close, a silent answer to his unasked question. This play was more than okay. It was delicious and tempting and wicked.</p><p>\"Promise what?\" He seemed distracted by her breasts.</p><p>\"That I can watch.\" The heavy sensuality on his face made her want to give him the delight he gave her in bed, made her want to be bold and sexy and wild. She'd never know whether she had it in her if she didn't try.</p><p>He shuddered. \"Promise. Now, down woman.\"</p><p>Taylorslithered out of his arms and down his body beforeJacksoncould catch her, a look in her eyes that seared him from the inside out.</p><p>\"No.\" She pushed at his abdomen when he would've followed her onto the bed. \"I want to...\" Leaving the sentence unfinished, she knelt before him again, running her hands over his hips. The towel fell to the floor.</p><p>Taylor's gasp made his entire body go taut. Her captivated expression destroyed any will he had to press her down onto the bed and just take her. He'd been afraid that the way she was rushing her exploration of sensuality would backfire into fear, but the look in her eyes was one of dazed discovery.</p><p>His tough littleTaylorwas more than up to the challenge of facing her demons.</p><p>\"Does it hurt?\"</p><p>\"No.\" His voice sounded strangled to him. \"Yes.\" He contradicted himself. \"It hurtsgood .\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" She looked up, all big blue eyes, and he thought that maybe she was out of her depth.</p><p>\" Cara, let me...\" he began. It was enough that she'd come this far. More than enough. He wanted to adore that body of hers and tell her without words just how much it meant to him that she was able to be so free with him.</p><p>Then she smiled, a soft woman smile that let him know she was perfectly happy to muddle her way through this ... if he'd let her. Stunned, he stood there and let her.</p><p>Her gaze returned to that part of his body which declared his hunger. Reaching out, she clasped his erection in one slim hand, the action almost nervous.Jacksoncould feel his shoulder muscles screaming as he forced his body to remain still instead of thrusting as instinct dictated. He didn't want to scare her and lose this precious moment of complete trust.</p><p>\"Jackson?\"</p><p>\"Yeah?\" he groaned.</p><p>\"How hard can I squeeze?\" The concern in her tone pulled him back from the beckoning edge. Though they'd made love countless times, he'd always been the one in control. This was a first for them. Holding her gaze, he reached down and clasped his hand around hers and squeezed.</p><p>\"Harder...\" He removed his hand and let her do it herself. With every stroke, her confidence seemed to build. \"Harder ... yes, piccola . Yes, just like that...\"</p><p>With his peripheral vision, he saw her head bend, saw her lips part and closed his eyes. Next time he'd watch, next time he'd savor the indescribable intimacy. This time, he just wanted to survive. Then her hot, wet mouth settled on him and his mind blanked for an instant, before consciousness punched through him with such power and strength, he felt as if he were drowning in the influx of raw sensation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, he managed to let her kiss and caress him for at least a minute before he hauled her head away. \"Enough.\" He wanted to penetrate her deep and hard.</p><p>\"No.\" She scowled at him and went back to what she'd been doing, her hands clasping the backs of his thighs. He was so surprised at the unexpected sensual defiance that he didn't pull her away. Then it was too late. Shocking pleasure rocked his body. He clenched his hands in her hair, closed his eyes and wondered if his sweet little wife had expected what she got.</p><p>He collapsed afterward, sprawling across the bed on his front,Taylorby his side. He was aware that she was stroking him, like he was some great big cat. He lay there and enjoyed the experience, glad that his loss of control hadn't revived her fear. When he finally managed to rouse himself, he turned his head and muttered, \"Sorry.\"</p><p>She lowered her head until her lips brushed his. \"I am an intelligent woman you know. I knew what was</p><p>... coming.\"</p><p>\"Did you...\" he croaked.</p><p>She swallowed very deliberately. \"What do you think?\" There was mischief in her eyes and just a tinge of shyness. But, no doubt, his baby was coming out of her shell.</p><p>His eyes went wide. \" Dio! I've created a monster.\" Utterly delighted with her, he glanced at her little-nothing nightie. \"Why aren't you naked?\"</p><p>\"Should I take it off?\" she asked, a blush heating up her cheeks.</p><p>He just raised a brow at the silly question.</p><p>Sitting up on her knees, she grabbed the fluttering hem and pulled the nightie off, leaving her clad only in a pair of tiny lace panties. He recognized them.</p><p>\"You're wearing my present.\" Reaching out, he touched her between her legs. The material was damp.</p><p>White-hot heat radiated from her core. She remained in her kneeling position, legsspread, letting him lazily explore .</p><p>\"When are you going to give me another present?\"</p><p>Despite her continued blush, the cheeky question was so sensuallyplayful, he could hardly believe it was asked by the same woman who'd feared a simple kiss. \"What do you want, bellissima?\"</p><p>Her eyes were wide and her breathing hitched. \"Use yourimagination, you're pretty good at it.\"</p><p>Smiling smugly, he sped up his finger strokes, aware that despite her open desire, she continued to hold back part of herself. But each time they loved, that fear-inspired reserve lessened. Soon, soon he'd have everything.</p><p>\"Um ... oh ... more, please, please more.\"</p><p>He gave her more, wanting to satisfy her because she'd satisfied him so very well. A while later, when she was squirming, he pressed hard against the throbbing nubbin between her legs, then withdrew before she could crest.</p><p>\"Jackson!\" Her glare was pure heat, her shyness lost under the pleasure and frustration.</p><p>He chuckled, enjoying her feminine rage. \"You are so sexy. Come down here so I can kiss you.\"</p><p>\"Lazy.\" But, she started to move down. While she was doing so, he rolled over onto his back. Putting his hand on her shapely little bottom, he said, \"Straddle my chest.\"</p> <p>Frowning at the order, she asked, \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Do it and I'll showyou. \"</p><p>Curious, she followed the instruction. \"Now what?\"</p><p>\"Move up a little.\"</p><p>Her eyes wide, she obeyed. And stopped. He told her to keep going. She did. And then, hardly breathing, she moved that final inch. Chuckling at her scandalized expression, he shifted aside the gusset of her panties and returned the favor she'd done him. With interest.</p><p>\"Jackson...\" she began to protest and he thought that he'd gone too far for her.</p><p>He licked one long, slow lick.</p><p>She shuddered and clutched at the headboard.</p><p>\"Wet and hot,\" he murmured, satisfied that she'd let him have his way. \"Just the way I like my wife.\"</p><p>She was whimpering with his first kiss and sobbing with his second. By the time he began the third, her body had started to ripple with waves of pleasure.</p><p>They spent their last afternoon inFijiat the beach.Taylorlathered herself with sunscreen and coaxed Jacksonto let her smooth the cream over him, too. His body was vital in the sunshine, all golden muscle and strength against her fingertips.</p><p>\"How about a swim?\" He looked over his shoulder to where she knelt behind him.</p><p>Putting down the sunscreen, she thought over their earlier exertions. \"Not after that hike you talked me into this morning.\" Her complaint was without heat because seeing the tropically forested upper regions of the island had been worth the trek. \"I'll float, you swim.\"</p><p>Chuckling, he rose to his feet and tugged her up. \"Sexy,\" he murmured, a teasing gleam in his eye.</p><p>Taylorknew very well that her modestly cut one piece bathing suit was no such thing. \"Studly,\" she responded tongue in cheek, glancing at his board shorts.</p><p>Only his sudden smile gave her a hint of what he was about to do. Laughing, she tried to dodge him but he scooped her up in his arms and ran deep into the water before throwing her giggling body in. She came up still smiling and drenched from head to toe. Scraping her hair off her face, she took one look at him standing there laughing at her and narrowed her eyes. Using both hands, she splashed a huge wave of water onto him.</p><p>Dripping, he grinned. \"Is that a declaration of war, piccola?\"</p><p>In response, she splashed him again. Giving a mock roar, he lunged after her. The ensuing water fight was the most fun thatTaylorhad had in years. She laughed so much that her stomach hurt and when Jacksondeclared himself the victor, she was too exhausted to dispute it.</p><p>Dragging herself from the water, she collapsed on the fine white sand and sunbathed while her far too energetic husband struck out for a longer swim. As she watched his strong body cut through the water, she realized that she'd never been as happy as she was at that moment. Simple joy suffused her entire body, as if particles of happiness were trapped in the tropical sunshine which gilded her skin.</p><p>This was a memory she'd always cherish, she thought with a drowsy smile, setting down to wait for her husband in the joyful sunshine.</p><p>Coming back to real life the next day was a shock forTaylor. Especially since the first thing she saw was a large envelope from Lance's firm.Jacksonpeered over her shoulder as she picked it up from the pile of mail collected by their security people. Heart in her throat, she walked over to the big living room window.</p><p>Jacksoncame to stand behind her, hands on her waist. \"It's postmarked a week and a half ago.\"</p><p>\"It's been forwarded from my apartment.\" She tore it open and pulled out a letter and attached legal documents. \"He's filed for a priority date for the custody hearing ... oh my God, he's really claiming that I'm an unfit guardian and Nick's in danger!\" Panic started to gather in her body.</p><p>Jacksontook the papers from her, one arm still around her waist. \"Idiot.\" The single short and derisive comment calmed her at once. After a quick scan of the documents, he gave them to her to hold. Without further discussion, he picked up the phone and punched in Lance's number.</p><p>\"Mr.Hegerty ,it's JacksonSantorini .\" A pause. \"I'm fine. My wife isn't doing so well. It seems you've filed a suit for custody of her brother.\" A longer pause.</p><p>Taylorstood wide-eyed, wondering what was happening.Jacksonsounded very calm and collected but there was something faintly dangerous about his tone.</p><p>\"I understand, Mr.Hegerty , but I take my wife's unhappiness very seriously. Do you understand?\" Now she knew what it was about his voice that disturbed her. He sounded exactly like a mobster - a cool, slick, dangerous mobster. Then he said, \"My family doesn't take it too well either.Santorinis lookafter their own .\"</p><p>She just about collapsed at that ominous tone.</p><p>\"Yes, you think that over. Call me within the next three days or we'll take measures of our own.\" He hung up.</p><p>\"Your family? I thought you didn't really see them?\" She needed a moment to ground herself before she found out what was happening with Nick.</p><p>He gave her a narrow-eyed look. \"Italians have big extended families. When I turned eighteen and was free to make my own choices, I went to live inItalywith my paternal grandparents and uncles, who had always kept in touch with me. They are my true famiglia . In fact, they are already pestering me to bring you and Nicolas for a visit.\"</p><p>\"And they'd be ... unhappy if I was?\" She swallowed. \"They're not ... um...\" How did she ask if they were part of the criminal underworld without offending her new husband?</p><p>It looked likeJacksonwas smiling faintly. \"I might've forgotten to mention that some of them aren't exactly upstanding citizens.\" He released her.</p><p>She sat down on the window seat. \"I ... see. What did Lance say?\" She could only deal with one thing at a time. Her husband's underworld relatives would have to wait.</p><p>\"He blustered, but I know the lawsuit will disappear soon. Then, if necessary, he will consent to the adoption.\"</p><p>\"You sound very confident.\"</p><p>\"I am. We've already got legal motions in progress if he doesn't. Worse comes to worst, we'll just tie him in legal knots for years.\" He touched her cheek. \"Don't worry,Taylor. I'll keep my part of the bargain.\"</p><p>His eyes turned almost black. \"Come, I need to claim you again.\"</p><p>It was such an old-world way of speaking, such a masculine statement that she couldn't fight it, her body going soft and welcoming at the rich darkness of his tone. Something about his words disturbed her, though it was hard to hold the thought when he took her into his arms. Yes, they'd made a bargain, but that wasn't the only reason she'd married him. Then he decided to take her against the wall and all she could concentrate on was his big body, hot and hard and demanding.</p><p>The next morning felt like the true start of her new life. Nick had arrived home about an hour after their return, and was now on his way to school. She'd bitten her lip and letJacksonlead him away, because it was clear that Nick needed her husband to claim him publicly.</p><p>\"Be good, cara . Call me if you need anything.\" Before leaving,Jacksonhad kissed her with lazy thoroughness, mimicking the far more erotic kiss with which he'd woken her this morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the first time, she was alone in her new home. She took the opportunity to call Maggie and schedule another session before thinking over the rest of her day.</p><p>Jacksonhad suggested she organize a small dinner party. Though their marriage was already public knowledge, politics dictated that certain people be told in a more private manner. In addition, in a couple of months, they would spend a week inLos Angeles, socializing with those who lived in the heart of the moviemaking world.</p><p>Having kept her ear to the ground, she had no problem preparing a list of invitees. By eleven, she had the wheels rolling and was beginning to feel a little more settled. This was work, she realized. Very delicate work.</p> <p>Jacksonneeded these people to be willing to cooperate with him. Bonnie had antagonized a large number of them and the fallout had hit the beautiful manTaylorhad married. When the papers had ripped into him, not many in the business had come forward to defend him, still smarting from their brushes with his wife, and the coldnessJacksonhad cultivated to survive her.</p><p>By the end of the day, she was wearing a satisfied smile, sure of her ability to be the partnerJackson needed. Flush with newfound confidence, she was waiting impatiently at the top of the driveway when her men arrived home - her brother had stayed late to try out for soccer.</p><p>\"So?\" she asked Nick as soon as he got out of the car.</p><p>He smiled slowly. \"They want me to be goalie. The coach said I had quick hands.\"</p><p>Excited for him, she hugged his thin frame. \"Well done. Now get in there and shower, you muddy hooligan.\"</p> <p>After he'd run off, she turned toJackson. \"I'm glad you talked me into letting him try out.\" When Nick had asked her to sign the permission slip, her instinct had been to refuse. What if he was hurt? Then she'd glanced atJacksonand the look in his eyes had made her change her mind.</p><p>\"I'm glad I talked you into marrying me.\"</p><p>The unexpected response made her very pleased with her Italian husband. She smiled, stood on her tiptoes, and leisurely kissed him. He deserved it.</p><p>A flashbulb went off.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Startled, she jerked back.Jacksonimmediately shielded her with his body. But, before he could speak, she made a judgment call and moved around him. Though she hadn't wanted to be in his world, she now was and had to learn to deal with the repercussions.</p> <p>\"Hello.\" She smiled at the defiant man in front of them, wondering how he'd evaded the fence alarms.</p><p>\"Are you going to use that kissing picture?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" He held his camera protectively, obviously aware that he was trespassing.</p><p>\"I'd rather you didn't.\" Because paparazzi weren't known for their kindness, she asked, \"How about a deal?\" Feeling her husband's rising temper, she surreptitiously dug her elbow into his rock-hard stomach.</p><p>\"What're you offering then?\" The photographer's accent was distinctly British.</p><p>\"We cooperate with you for photos and give you a quote. It would be an exclusive on our marriage.\"</p><p>He looked atJackson. \"Good deal if you stick to it.\"</p><p>\"You have to surrender that whole roll of film.\"</p> <p>\"Don't you trust me?\"</p><p>\"Not as far as I can throw you,\" she said cheerfully.</p><p>He handed her the film, a wary look in his eye. \"Do you want your husband looking like a murderer in thepics ?\"</p><p>\"Give us a moment.\" She turned and forcedJacksonto come with her until they were out of earshot.</p><p>He looked furious. \"What the hell are you doing bargaining with that vulture?\"</p><p>She could see hurt in his eyes. These people had turned his pain into a spectator sport and here she was, consorting with them. She touched his arm. \"Whether we cooperate or not, they'll get pictures. This way, we have some control over the first impression people have of us.\"</p><p>\"Manipulate the media? Dangerous game.\" Yet, there was a spark of interest in his enigmatic eyes.</p><p>\"The truthis, your status in the business means we have to exist in the limelight at times. We can fight the press and lose, or we can use them to our advantage.\"</p><p>\"What do you suggest I do?\"</p><p>The fact that he was taking her lead made her glow. Unbidden, she recalled her conclusion that her wild husband could be gentled, if not fought. She leaned up and straightened the collar of his black shirt. \"You look gorgeous - tall, dark and dangerous. Just act as you'd do if you didn't want to eat a photographer for breakfast.\"</p><p>She thought he might have smiled. \"Right.\"</p><p>Reaching up, she unclipped her barrette and let her hair fall over her long-sleeved blue top. \"Come on.\"</p><p>They posed withJacksonwrapping his arms around her from behind. The photographer started snapping away.</p><p>She stopped him at shot ten. \"Enough.\"</p><p>\"Have you got any photos of Nick?\"Jacksonasked. Her heart jerked in panic. She hadn't even thought of that.</p><p>The photographer's eyes shifted. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"If you use them, the deal is off.\"</p><p>\"People want to know.\" It was a halfhearted attempt to justify himself.</p><p>\"Anyone who uses Nick will find their life being made very difficult.\"Jackson's icy calm emphasized the threat. \"You know how this works. I can't stop you invading my life, but his is off-limits.\"</p><p>The man sighed butTaylorthought that he was happy enough. He yielded another roll of film. Ten minutes later, he had his quotes and was gone.Jacksonimmediately rang his security company and ordered them to check the fence alarms now! Then he hauled a surprisedTaylorto him and proceeded to kiss her senseless.</p><p>After Nick went to bed that night,Taylortracked down her husband. He was in his study, staring at the front page of an old newspaper. She recognized it at once.</p><p>Furious, she snatched the paper from him. \"Why are you hurting yourself like this?\" This piece of gutter journalism had blamed him forBonnie's death, implying that domestic violence had caused her suicidal depression. Eyes narrowed, she scanned the room and found other newspaper clippings in an open file box on his desk.</p><p>\"Sometimes I wonder if I could've stopped her.\"</p><p>Grabbing the file box, she walked over to the shredder in the corner and started feeding in paper. \"This is what I think of that ridiculous suggestion.\" She was so angry, her hands shook. God, she hated Bonnie.</p><p>That woman had hurtJacksonso much that he'd probably never trust another woman enough to love her.</p><p>Not that she wanted the complications of love ... or did she? Did she want everything JacksonSantorini's heart was capable of feeling? Could she cope with such passion?</p><p>\"Taylor, you don't know - \"</p><p>\"Did you put drugs in her hands? Did you find her a lover to cheat with?\" Her words were clipped.</p><p>Inwardly, she was cursing the photographer who'd resurrected the past with his mere presence.</p><p>His mouth firmed. \"Don't go there.\"</p><p>She finished shredding and swiveled around to face him, throwing the empty box aside. \"Why not? Let's have this out, right here, right now.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" He'd never sounded more intimidating.</p><p>\"See me? I'm your wife now, not Bonnie!\" She slapped her hand against her chest. \"And I don't do secrets.\"</p><p>\"What do you want to know?\" Dressed in black, arms folded, he looked exactly what he was - a big, strong Italian male unused to taking orders from his wife.</p><p>A male who'd been betrayed by one wife.</p><p>Their friendship had eased her way butTaylorknew that she couldn't expect total trust until she'd earned it. But she refused to be the only one in this marriage who was starting to feel in over her head.</p><p>\"Stop acting like an enforcer for your famiglia and giving me a crick in my neck. Sit down.\" She walked around the desk and patted the back of his leather chair, expecting him to balk on principle.</p><p>To her complete surprise, he obeyed. \"Satisfied?\" There was an edge to his voice. For some reason of his own, he was letting her dictate to him, but it obviously chafed.</p><p>\"No. This is better.\" Fighting his ability to distance himself, she perched on his lap, relieved when his arm encircled her waist. \"Why are you angry?\" She hated the way anger made him cold, hadn't realized until now just how dependent she'd become on the attention he lavished on her.</p><p>\"You're imagining it.\" He sounded irritated.</p><p>Jacksonwondered why he was allowing her to see his aggravation. He had no intention of revealing that he'd found her practical response to the media a blow to his emotions. He'd made this bargain with her and she was definitely keeping up her end of it. It was his problem that he hungered for more from his wife than practicality and logic. Damn this sudden vulnerability!</p><p>\"Are you going to tell me?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>After a tense moment of utter silence, she looked up and shoved at his shoulders. He held her tight, shocked at the blazing anger in her blue eyes.</p><p>\"Then keep your secrets, I don't care!\" Too late, he remembered his little wife's big temper. \"All I wanted to do was protect you and this is what I get in return!\"</p><p>Protect him?</p><p>\"A big, brooding man who doesn't appreciate me. Who doesn't care that I'm just trying to keep the vultures happy so they don't peck at him! Who gets mad at me for noreason! \" She opened her mouth to continue and unable to think of how else to stop her tirade, he kissed her.</p><p>She refused to cooperate, wrenching her head away. \"No. Don't you kiss me when I'm angry, Jackson Santorini ! You're not seducing me out of being annoyed with you!\"</p><p>Jacksonwas stunned speechless. No one had ever accused him of using sex to control. Then again, no one had ever wanted him with the passionate hunger of his wife. \" Cara mia.\" He was appeased by her confession of protectiveness. \"I did not know that was why you did it.\"</p><p>\"Why else would I have done it? I was so worried for you, I didn't even think about Nick.\"</p><p>\"You had no reason to imagine they would sink low enough to exploit a child.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"They're bottom-feeders.\" She folded her arms across her chest. \"I couldn't let them turn us into something sordid.

Then she leaned over and hugged him hard. \"I'm not Bonnie so don't you ever think of me in the same breath as her. Understand?\"</p><p>He nodded. This spitfire was definitely nothing like his first wife.\"Apologies, mia moglie .\"</p> <p>\"You know what you do to me when you sound so Italian,\" she accused, eyes softening already.</p><p>He knew. \"What do I do to you, cara?\" He kissed the pulse in her neck, warmed by the fire of her temper. She didn't love him but she was protective of him. It wasn't the devotion his primal soul hungered for, but it was a start.Santorini men were nothing if not determined.</p><p>She drew back. \"What did she do to you?\"</p><p>There was no question who she was talking about. \"You know. Everyone knows.\" And that humiliation still hurt.</p><p>She shook her head. \"There was something the papers didn't find out, something terrible. Tell me about it.\"</p><p>The memory turned his voice harsh. \"If I don't?\"</p> <p>\"I can't make you.\" She touched his cheek with a hand that was soft and so tender, he ached. \"But, I want this marriage of ours to work, and to do that, I need to know who you are. I need to understand you.\"</p><p>What could it hurt?Jacksonthought. \"Bonnie was pregnant with our baby when she overdosed and she knew it.\"</p><p>Taylor's eyes brimmed with tears. \"That bitch .\"</p><p>The short, sharp expletive shocked him less than the deep anger in her.Taylorhad a mother's instincts.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he agreed, \"that's what she became at the end.\"</p><p>\"I won't give you platitudes - I can't imagine your grief. But,\" she said, eyes bright with unshed tears, \"let me hold you tonight. Let me show you tenderness. I know it isn't very macho, but I think you have hurts that need to be healed and I need to try and heal them.\"</p><p>He was stunned at the quiet power of her. \"Ah, piccola , when I am with you, I almost believe that there is true goodness in the world.\"</p><p>When she rose and tugged on his hand, he let her lead him out. And he let her stroke andkiss and make love to him with such feminine sweetness that he was lost. When she curled up beside him to sleep, her arms hugged him tight, keeping her promise to hold him through the night.</p> <p>Despite her care, he lay awake through the dark hours of twilight, thunderstruck by the riot of emotion in his soul. With her unexpected tenderness, TaylorSantorini had demolished the blockade guarding her husband's heart.</p><p>He belonged to her completely.</p><p>After his experience atBonnie's hands, it wasn't a weakness he welcomed, but he was no coward. He accepted the powerful feeling and swore to do everything in his power to teach his wife to love him back, because damn it, there was no reason for her not to trust him with everything in her.</p><p>As usual, the papers were delivered to their home in the morning.Taylorwas up and about, whileJackson was in the shower. Nick was still asleep. Anxious to save her husband any unnecessary pain, she flicked through the pile until she found the tabloid carrying their photos.</p><p>For a long time, she just stood there, stunned at the image. She'd expectedJacksonto look annoyed, in spite of her instructions. At best, she'd thought he'd attempt neutrality. Instead, the photographer had caught him as he'd glanced down at her, and there was something in his dark gaze that took her breath away.</p><p>\"What's that?\" Still in his pajamas, Nick walked out of his room and hugged her middle. \"Cool.Jackson likes you a lot, huh?\" He was looking up at her, seeking reassurance.</p><p>Reaching out, she stroked his hair. \"I think that maybe he does.\" She wanted to believe it was real, that expression of intense protective care, but more than likely, her own terrifying hunger for his passionate heart was leading her to imagine things.</p><p>\"What're you two looking at?\"Jackson,dressed in slate-grey slacks and a white shirt, unbuttoned at the neck, came to stand behind her. By unspoken agreement, neither of them referred to the powerful intimacy of the night he'd spent in her arms.</p><p>His willingness to let her hold him had shaken all ofTaylor's beliefs about men, about him. For such a dominant man to accept her need to care ... it had revealeda sensitivity to her emotions that forced her to confront some harsh truths.Jacksonhad trusted her despite the betrayals he'd suffered in the past. Did she have the courage to do the same? Or would she always be a coward, unable to commit to anything?</p><p>She saw him ruffle Nick's hair and he hugged her from behind before playfully biting her neck. \"Morning, wife.\"</p><p>Forcing the uncomfortable thoughts from her mind, she said, \"Morning, husband.\"</p><p>He reached out with one hand and shifted the paper so he could read the article. \"Well, there's nothing too objectionable in it.\"</p><p>Nick had wandered off to get ready for school, soTaylorindulged herself. \"Did you notice it describes me as your beautiful new wife?\" She peered over her shoulder, taking the same light tone as him. Surely he would've said something if the picture had revealed what she'd thought it had. Disappointment hit her hard, shocking her with the strength of her desire for his love.</p><p>Smoldering dark eyes met hers as he turned her around. \"Just as well he doesn't know of your temper.\"</p><p>She made a face at him and got herself thoroughly kissed for her trouble, his hands slipping under her thick terry-cloth robe to touch skin.</p><p>\"I have a meeting,\" he rasped against her lips. A minute later, \"Maybe, I can postpone it.\" He nuzzled her.</p><p>\"Hush.\" Her body was already itchy for him and he was only making it worse. \"Do you want coffee?\"</p><p>He grinned. \"I want you.\" He reached up to cup her breasts, teasing the tips with the pads of his fingers.</p><p>She swallowed at the gleam in his eye and tried to concentrate on his mouth rather than his clever hands.</p><p>But, looking at his lips only made her want to haul him down to her for a scorching kiss. He removed his hands from her robe just when she was about to start whimpering.</p><p>\"Coffee!\" She shoved a cup into his hands to stop him from doing further mischief.</p><p>After breakfast,Taylorwaved off her men and spent the majority of the day on the final organization for the dinner party. That accomplished, she got on the phone with her network of secretaries and other administration staff, inviting them to a very different kind of party.</p><p>\"A party at JacksonSantorini's ?\" one of them whispered, \"Are you sure he'll want the riffraff around?\"</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \"He married one of us, you dolt.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but you were always classier than average. I'll be at your barbecue with bells on. See you in a week.\"</p><p>\"Bye, Tina.\"</p><p>After hanging up, a hint of disquiet infiltrated her mind. She'd thought she had carte blanche withJackson</p><p>'s home but maybe he would mind. Nothing in their bargain said that she had the rights an indulged and loved wife would have. Feeling uneasy for the first time, she rang him.</p><p>\"Cara?\"</p><p>That warm tone put her at ease. \"Jackson, I'm inviting several of my friends, including studio people, to a barbecue, a few days after the dinner party.\" There was no response. \"Is that all right?\"</p><p>\"They are your friends?\"</p><p>She wondered at the odd note in his voice. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Then they are welcome in our home.\" He sighed. \"The secretaries aren't going to lynch me are they?\"</p><p>So, that was the problem, she thought in relief. \"No, I'll protect you.\"</p><p>\"Don't everstop, piccola .\" The request was quiet but her heart thundered. Had she imagined the incredible tenderness in that deep voice?</p><p>\"I won't,\" she promised. \"Have you heard from Lance?\"</p><p>\"Nothing definite but it looks like he's withdrawing his pleadings. If anything happens, I'll let you know.\"</p><p>After they hung up, she spent a long time wondering at the indefinable vulnerability she'd heard in his tone.</p><p>Jacksonsat at his desk wrestling with a strange mix of emotions. Part of it was an irrational jealousy that these people hadTaylor's affection and friendship, without paying for it. He'd made the decision to bargain for her and he'd made a very good bargain. She was a protective, affectionate and sexy wife. It was his problem that he'd been hoping for something more, something that had eluded his family forever, something he'd never touched.</p><p>What would his wife say if she realized that big, tough JacksonSantorini would lay his heart at her feet, if she would only give her trust and love into his keeping? If she would only let him banish the shadows in her eyes that told him she still expected him to walk away from her.</p><p>He snorted, crushing the starving creature inside him. His wife was far too practical to think about love in relation to their marriage. All her love was bound up with her brother, and she'd told him point-blank that she didn't trust anyone else enough to love them. Other men might have begrudged Nick her affection, butJacksoncouldn't, not when he'd been a child whom no one had loved. He wouldn't wish that utter loneliness on anyone.</p><p>Until he'd metTaylor, he'd thought that love between a man and a woman was a fool's dream. Maybe, despite his recent resolution to make her feel the passion he did, he'd been right all along. Look at his parents and siblings. They fell in love every other month and all they got for their trouble were divorces littering the world.</p><p>Hehad a family filled with joy, and he had to concentrate on nurturing it rather than trying to get his wife to give him something she wasn't capable of. Nick's loyalty was his without question, but he needed to fully bindTaylorto him. She'd never divorce him if a child was involved, so he had to make her pregnant as soon as possible. His desire for a baby now came second to his desire to keepTaylor. There was no way in hell he could lose her. He would never survive the loss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Late that night,Taylorsat at her vanity, her back toJackson. He was stretched out on the bed, dressed only in his boxers, watching her prepare for bed. Arms folded behind his head, he looked every inch the proprietary male. Though she was wearing an ankle-length silk nightgown, his hot gaze made her feel as if she were in the sheerest slip.</p><p>\"What are you thinking so hard?\" she asked, meeting his intense gaze in the mirror.</p><p>\"Lance has completely withdrawn his proceedings. It was confirmed at5:00 p.m.I've also managed to convince him of the wisdom of consenting to Nick's adoption.\" He lifted a cynical brow. \"Money talks very loudly to LanceHegerty .\"</p> <p>Joy made her giddy. \"Oh,Jackson! Thank you!\"</p><p>She put her brush down and turned to face him, intending to run into his arms. But, when she looked at him, she was startled to see that his expression had become even more intense. \"What is it?\" For something to do, she started plaiting her hair, uncertain how to handle her husband when he looked so unapproachable.</p><p>\"There aren't any more worries.\" His eyes went darker than she would've believed possible. \"I don't want you going on birth control.\"</p><p>She froze. \"I ... why can't we wait?\" Just today, she'd put a note in her diary to contact the doctor.</p><p>\"I'm not going to force you into it. What would be the point?\" He sounded calm but she could almost see his tension in the taut muscles of his upper arms. \"But, tell me one thing - do you ever want to have my child?\"</p> <p>\"I ... I haven't really had a chance to think about it,\" she lied, panicked.</p><p>If she hadJackson's baby, she would become ultimately vulnerable to him, connected in a way that would make escape impossible. Her powerful, possessive husband would never give up the right to watch his child grow day by day, and neither would she. Even worse, the experience of creating a life would bind their emotions together with such strength that she wouldn't be able to fight falling in love with him. And loving a man terrified her.</p><p>\"When do you want to have a child?\"</p><p>\"Soon.\"Jackson's Italian-dark eyes met hers. \"The child will have a trust fund, too. Have a think about it.\"</p><p>\"I ... I will.\" Stomach in knots, she walked out of the bedroom and into theensuite bathroom, where she began washing her face. She should have picked something harder. The simple act gave her too much time to think.</p><p>A baby.</p> <p>It had been part of their bargain. He had a right to expect it after he'd delivered his side of their agreement, yet he wasn't pressuring her. Of course, there was a time limit on his patience. And if he saw that she had no intention of trying to get pregnant, would he dissolve their marriage before the year was up? She clenched her fists on the edge of the sink, unable to bear the thought.</p><p>But, a baby?</p><p>Years ago, she hadn't even allowed herself to dream of it when she'd realized what it meant. Reliance.</p><p>Complete and utter trust in a man. Desolation and anguish if that trust was betrayed. Her hands shook as she dried her face. She'd never trusted any man enough to chance that kind of pain. Could she trust Jackson? He understood her need for a safety net - he'd offered their child a trust fund.</p><p>A bribe.</p><p>It hit her with the force of a roundhouse punch to the jaw. She sat down on the small stool by the handbasin , face white. Her husband was trying to bribe her for a baby. Just like he'd bribed her to be his wife. That time, the bribe had been Nick's safety. This time, it was security for the child they would create between them.</p><p>He'd bribed her into going to that party inFiji, and though the gift of seductive lingerie had come after the lovemaking, he'd bribed her for sex, too. Maybe that's not how he'd consciously thought of it, but the pattern of behavior was becoming clear. Today, an exquisite diamond necklace had been delivered to her from an exclusive jeweler - a present for the dinner party.</p><p>Suddenly, she understood the depth of hurts her silent husband carried.Jacksondidn't expect anyone to give him a gift without a price attached, or care for him without being paid, without compensation. She'd been so selfish and he'd let her, not expecting anything more. His childhood had been spent with people who demanded recompense for the slightest expression of care - baby-sitters, nannies and boarding schools. Tears pricked at her eyes. Stupid man. How dare he do this to her?</p> <p>Taking deep breaths, she began to think, remembering her earlier thoughts of courage and cowardice.</p><p>Yes, she would be incredibly vulnerable if she hadJackson's baby, but he was the only man with whom she could even consider such an act of trust. What was the alternative? Never to know the joy of nurturing a child in her womb, never to hold a little human being who was part of her, never to give Nick the happiness of playing the role of a big brother, and more importantly, never to give her husband the baby he needed to erase the pain ofBonnie's selfish choice.</p><p>Despite his own concerns, she knew that he wouldn't cheat on her. He'd been faithful to Bonnie and he'd had all the reason in the world to take a lover. He would never abuse her, having too much self-control.</p><p>And, if the worst happened and they separated, he had too much honor to leave her to survive on her own.</p><p>She frowned. If their marriage didn't last, they'd both be to blame. But, she had no intention of ever giving up the hope she'd found in his arms. A small light flared inside her heart.Jackson, too, wanted a lifetime commitment, unlike the rest of his family. He would stick by her, unless she gave him a reason to leave. And she would never give him such a reason.</p><p>JacksonSantorini belonged to her.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Jacksonlay there in the semidarkness of the bedroom, having dimmed the light afterTaylorslipped away.</p><p>The woman he'd shown such tenderness and care was hiding from him ... as if he was the monster Bonnie had accused him of being. Pain threatened to rip apart his heart.</p><p>Their bargain had been clear. A child within a year or they would separate. But he would never let her go. Even if it meant accepting that he would never father a child, because the awful truth was, his wife didn't want to give him that gift. He had no right to berate her but damn it, he wanted to. He adored her, would cherish their child as he cherished Nick, but it was apparent that she didn't feel the hunger he did to create another soul out of their feelings for each other.</p><p>In the dark, he knew his smile was cynical. As far asTaylorwas concerned, they had nothing more than a bargain. Unfortunately for her, he was too much like his grandfather Josef. He'd made his choice, and his heart was too passionate to accept anything less than everything from his wife. He would fight forTaylor until she had no choice but to trust him.Santorini men could be adoring husbands but they could also be merciless hunters.</p><p>The door to the bathroom opened. He blinked and pushed his pain and resolve to the background. It did no good to let anyone see your vulnerabilities. He'd made that mistake with Bonnie and she'd used the knowledge to rip him to tiny pieces, before he'd stopped letting her matter.</p><p>Taylorcame to sit beside him on the bed, placing one hand on his bare chest. \"I have to tell you something.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" he began, wanting the pain over with as quickly as possible.</p><p>\"Please listen.\" In the soft light, her face looked so young that his heart clenched.</p><p>He lifted a hand and touched her cheek, unable to stop the action. This small woman could hurt him far more than Bonnie ever had.\"Tell me, piccola .\"</p><p>She held his hand when it dropped, clasping it between both of hers. \"I'm afraid to have a child. Not physically afraid. Afraid of the vulnerability it creates.\"</p><p>\"Because of your mother.\" He understood at once.</p><p>She nodded. \"I've been afraid for so long - I can't forget what her life ended up like, all because she trusted a man with her body and her heart. I can't forget. I just can't and the fear is so strong, sometimes it chokes me.\"</p><p>He was pulled in two directions. ProtectingTaylorand protecting his dreams. There was only one real choice and he made it with brutal swiftness. \"It is all right, cara . We have Nick.\" She'd already given him a son to teach and love. It would have to be enough.</p><p>She shook her head, tears glimmering in her eyes. \"No, it's not all right! I don't like being afraid,Jackson.</p><p>I hate that feeling of being strangled. I am not Helenaand you're not Lance. We're stronger than them.\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" He was astonished by her ability to see the truth through her pain. Her strength of will had never been clearer, so her next question humbled him.</p><p>\"You taught me to make love without fear. Will you teach me to have a child without fear?\"</p><p>He was so stunned that he couldn't speak for a long time. \"How do I do that, little one?\"</p><p>\"By holding me, by being there whenever I need you, by never leaving me to flounder, by being there, just being there.\" Her hand was clenched around his.</p><p>Opening his arms,Jacksoninvited her in. When she came, he snuggled her face-to-face. His heart was painfully tight in his chest. \"I'll always be there, cara . Always.\"</p><p>\"Don't ever leave me or our children, Jackson.\" A single tear trailed down her face. She dashed it away.</p><p>For the first time he understood the depth of pain that she'd suffered at being abandoned, not only by her biological father, but also by the man who'd married her mother. His little wife had experienced as much loneliness as the rich boy sent to boarding school at age five.</p><p>\"On my family's name, I promise you, TaylorSantorini , that as long as I draw breath, I will never leave you or our children. Remember who I am, piccola - an incredibly possessive tyrant where you are concerned.\"</p><p>She gave him a shaky smile. \"I believe that.\"</p><p>He wiped away her tears, awed by the evidence of her trust in him. When he'd believed that she was rejecting having his child, he hadn't understood the courage it would take for his wife to fight the lessons of the past and take that step. And yet she was, for him. For him . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Hold me, Jackson. Hold me,\" she whispered, allowing him to see a need whose potency he'd barely suspected.</p><p>He held her all night and kissed her when she turned to him, warming her with his constant presence. He would never leave her to sink or swim. Never.</p><p>Taylordidn't think of herself as a needy woman, but she neededJackson. The wonderful thing was,he was always there. Like now. He hugged her before their dinner party, three days after she'd agreed to have his child.</p><p>\"You look ravishing, Mrs.Santorini ,\" he said, planting kisses on her neck. \"Do you think our guests will notice if we're late?\" Hands moved possessively over her body.</p><p>She laughed. \"You're looking far too gorgeous, yourself. Make sure the blondes don't touch you.\" She was only half joking. Around him, she felt positively feral.</p><p>His amusement at her possessiveness was overlaid with a hint of approval. \"Cross my heart.\" A glint of mischief lightened his dark eyes.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"I want to thank you for last night, bellissima . Your mouth is so...\"</p><p>She clapped her hand over his mouth. \"Behave!\" Her attempt to sound stern failed miserably, memories of their loving turning her tone husky. She hadn't yet conquered all her fears, but each night, she became stronger. Strong enough for the man she'd married. \"You're a menace.\" He smiled knowingly against her hand, and licked her palm with his tongue. Giggling, she pulled away. \"Jackson!\"</p><p>\"Nick was raring to go when I dropped him off tonight. I think he considers spending the weekend at his friend's house more exciting than hanging around with us.\"</p><p>\"I think you're much more fun.\" She rubbed her body against his in deliberate provocation. Having the power to arouse her sexy husband was an addictive feeling.</p><p>Jacksonkissed her, his eyes gleaming with a masculine warning that told her she'd have to pay for her teasing. \"Let's go, Mrs.Santorini . I suppose we have to show up at our own dinner party.\"</p><p>Wanting to create an intimate atmosphere,Taylorhad had the dinner party catered but limited the number of serving staff to two. The neatly dressed men had arrived an hour previously and were now standing in readiness for the arrival of the guests. Prior to dinner, one would tend the small bar set up in a corner of the living room, while his partner was to circulate with the hors d'oeuvres.</p><p>\"Thank you. Everything looks lovely,\"Taylorsaid to them both, after sampling one of their offerings.</p><p>\"Your firm has surpassed my expectations.\"</p><p>They beamed.</p><p>Just then the doorbell chimed andJackson's voice sounded in her ear. \"Showtime.\"</p><p>Linking her arm with his, she took a deep breath and let him lead her to the door. Their security firm was controlling entry onto the property, so once the guests passed through the gates, they were able to drive right up to the house. When that door opened, some very powerful people were going to walk into her house.</p><p>Jacksonpaused in front of the door and turned to say very quietly, \"Together.\"</p><p>Startled out of her nervousness, she glanced at him, only then realizing that this had to be hard for him, too. Some of these wary people had once been close friends. A slow smile bloomed inTaylor's heart as she understood that he'd let her know that deliberately, welcoming her support to negotiate what could be a difficult evening and offering her his.</p><p>Sliding her hand down his arm, she entangled the fingers of her right hand with those of his left.</p><p>\"Together.\"</p> <p>At first, the guests were on their guard, watching her as if they expectedBonnie's ghost to possess her.</p><p>But she noticed that they relaxed within minutes, warming in the glow of her husband's attention. Always charismatic, today, with a smile flirting with his lips, he was devastating.</p><p>\"I've never seen him smile, I swear,\"TempleGivens, one of the hottest scriptwriters around, said. \"Have you given him some happy pills?\" She laughed and took a sip of an award-winning chardonnay produced inGisborne .</p><p>Taylorliked the slender redhead and sinceTemplehad already invited her to lunch in a few days' time, she knew the feeling was mutual. \"He doesn't need them. Teasing me is enough.\" She was aware thatJackson</p><p>, standing a foot away, could hear her.</p><p>He turned from his conversation to throw her a grin. \"What drug could compare to you, Mrs.Santorini ?\"</p><p>Templegasped, the other guests laughed, and that set the mood for the party. People seemed fascinated by their relationship. She just shrugged and acted like herself. This was her home, no matter who these big shots were. The fact that they were invited to several events by their departing guests was a sure sign that she'd done well.</p><p>\"A roaring success, sweet little wife,\"Jacksonwhispered in her ear, as they got ready for bed. He'd undressed at the speed of light and come to hold her around her middle, chest to her back and chin on her shoulder. He often took that position and she loved the tiny intimacy. Just like she loved everything withJackson. Already nervy because of her decision to try and conceive, she was unwilling to consider what that meant. Instead, she concentrated on the physical fire he could arouse in her.</p><p>\"Thank you, honey.\" She smiled in delight. \"I think we're going to be hot together.\"</p><p>He cuddled her closer. \" Cara, we burn up together.\" And then he proceeded to ignite the passion between them.</p><p>The next day, she received several thank-you calls regarding the dinner party. Gifts started arriving, too</p><p>belated wedding presents.</p><p>\"We made some friends,\" she toldJacksonthat night. Clad only in a pair of black sports shorts with stripes of white on the sides, he was prowling around their bedroom, while she sat in bed. Needless to say, with her husband's body on display, the book in her hand was going unread.</p><p>\"It's allyour doing.\" He bowed to her like some old-world courtier. \"You are solovely, they couldn't resist your charm, mia moglie e bellissima .\"</p><p>She threw a pillow at him. \"I'm already your wife, you big Italian stud. You don't need to seduce me.\"</p><p>Her susceptibility to him should've worried her but she reveled in the intensity of their passion. In her ability to match him. Each time they made love, he lost a little more control and she conquered another piece of fear.</p><p>Catching the pillow, he grinned. The naughty light in his eyes warned her that he had something up his sleeve. \"In that case, I'm going to do weights.\"</p><p>Taylor's head jerked up. Against her short and barely decent white nightie, her nipples peaked.</p><p>He chucked the pillow back onto the bed, saying, \"You can watch,\" before he left the room.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>ToJackson's surprise,Taylordidn't come after him. Maybe, he thought, she was getting over her delight in his body. Scowling, he began to exercise. Some time later, he heard the door to the workout room being shut. Turning, he foundTaylorsitting on the last step leading down into the converted basement, a jug of ice water beside her and a full glass in her hand.</p><p>His whole body went taut. \"Is that for me?\" he said, watching her roll the glass against her cheek.</p><p>\"No. It's all for me. Now, exercise.\"</p><p>He'd never performed like this for any woman. But, then again, no woman had ever needed to cool herself down in his presence. Damn, but he enjoyed her reaction to him. Pleased with his little wife, he indulged her, doing arm curls with weights that made his biceps bulge.</p><p>Taylormoaned.</p><p>\"Want to come over?\" he invited.</p><p>She shook her head and lifted the glass to her lips. Her short nightie rode up as she spread her thighs without noticing. After draining the glass, she said, \"Will you do some push-ups?\"</p><p>\"For you, bellissima , anything.\" He put down the weights and with his body right in front of her, began to do as she'd asked, keeping his spine and legs in perfect alignment. He wondered if he could persuade her to kiss him all over, as she'd done last night. Though he'd never admit it, he had a weakness for the gentleness of his wife's caresses. After fifty repetitions, he got up. \"Enough?\"</p><p>\"Not hardly.\" She'd opened all three buttons at the top of her nightie and one hand rested in the opening.</p><p>\"But I think I'm getting heatstroke.\"</p><p>He walked over to the bottom of the steps. \"Maybe we should start slow. We can work up to chin-ups,\" he teased.</p><p>She put down the glass and stood up, blue eyes hazy with passion. Her small hands ran up his chest in a gesture that was as proprietary as itwas adoring . \"Maybe I could ... assist you to work out.\"</p><p>He wanted to groan at the images that inspired. \"You're not dressed for it. Here, let me help.\" Moving her hands aside, he pulled the nightie over her head and threw it to the floor. \"Now, you're dressed right.\"</p><p>\"I'm naked,\" she whispered, a sexy sparkle in her eye. Before his eyes, she'd blossomed into her sultry sensuality, until tonight, he could read no hint of reticence or fear in her. \"Don't I need a sports bra?\"</p><p>\"You're right. Come here.\" He pulled her along until she was standing in front of the machine he used for hislats . It had a black leather bench that he could sit on while pulling down on the T-shaped handle, which was connected to weights at the back of the machine.</p><p>First, he removed all the weights but one. Then, moving around, he sat down on the bench ... after taking off his shorts. \"Now, straddle me. Face away from me.\"</p><p>Eyes wide, she did as he bid. He held her up by the waist when she realized that the bench and his body were too wide for her feet to touch the floor. \"I don't think this'll work,\" she complained, clearly disappointed.</p><p>\"Sure it will.\" Grinning, he lowered her onto his thrusting erection. Starved as he was, the sight of her heart-shaped bottom coming down on him made him want to savage her. But he'd been saving up this particular fantasy since his wedding night. Because she looked so goddamn sexy taking him in, he brought her halfway and then lifted her up, only to slide her down again.</p><p>\"Oh,Jackson...\" Her words faded off into a groan as he oh, so slowly lowered her onto him a third time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was sotight, he always took the greatest care not to hurt her. Except sometimes, like tonight, she took matters into her own hands and pushed down. \"Oh!\"</p><p>Leaving her impaled, he gritted his teeth and pointed to the T-shaped handle near her head. \"Put your hands on either side of the bar.\"</p><p>\"What? Why?\" She wiggled on him.</p><p>He tightened his grip and made her stop. \"Do it,\" he commanded, unable to restrain the dominant part of himself. Then again, his wife didn't seem to mind the way he loved her. He'd never had a lover more suited to his temperament and sexuality. In bed, she could be a demanding tyrant or a sweetly submissive witch, but whatever mood took her, she was always with him to the end. \"We're working out, remember?\"</p><p>Arching her back just a little, she put one hand on either side of the horizontal bar. Once she was in position, he sat up fully and pulled her snug against him, cupping her breasts and squeezing just because he could.</p><p>\"Now you have a sports bra.\" She gasped and let go of the bar. \"Keep holding on. And pull down.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"I think it's time you did all the work.\" He wondered if she realized that the mirror on the left wall afforded him a very interesting view.</p><p>It took her a moment to gather the strength to pull the bar down. She could only bring it as far as her upper chest. \"Now what?\"</p><p>\"Release the weights but control their descent.\"</p><p>As he'd guessed, she wasn't strong enough to perform that part of the maneuver easily. And with her feet hanging off the floor, she had no traction. She almost rose off him, her inner muscles reluctantly releasing him, as she tried not to clank the weights.</p><p>\"Oh!\" Understanding his intent, she pulled again and slid lusciously down his body.</p><p>He kneaded her breasts with his hands, loving the feel of her skin, loving the way she fit him like the most exquisite glove, as if she'd been made just for his most extreme pleasure. His wife. Only his.</p><p>\"I like this.\" She sounded breathless.</p><p>He groaned. \"Why are we torturing ourselves?\"</p><p>\"Because it feelsgooood .\" She slid half off him.</p><p>\"I was going to lay you down and just thrust the first time, after allyour teasing.\" He squeezed a nipple with his fingertips, taking advantage of her sensitivity.</p><p>\"Me!\" She let the weights go and put her hands over his where they rested on her breasts. \"I'll show you teasing.\" And she did something with her inner muscles that just about brought him to climax.</p><p>\"Where did you learn to do that?\" His voice was hoarse as he fought the urge to pour his seed into her.</p><p>\"Secret.\" She was smiling smugly at him, looking over her shoulder. \"I think I could do with some thrusting now. It's probably good for making a baby.\"</p><p>He couldn't believe she'd said that. Just like he couldn't help himself from holding on to her hips and taking over. There was a lot of thrusting. Hard. He went deep and then deeper. His desire had gone over the edge into madness by this stage and it wasn't deep enough. When he pulled her off his body, she protested. \"Jackson, get back!\" There wasn't even a shadow of fear in her.</p><p>He nipped the side of her neck. \"I want you spread out on your back.\"</p> <p>In less than ten seconds, he had her arranged as his imagination demanded, lush and ready for his pleasure; creamy skin touched with pink, against soft black leather. The word sexy didn't begin to do her justice. With his hands under her calves, he lifted her long legs high, spreading her thighs wide. His original intent had been to put her in a position where he could indulge his need to thrust deep, but now that he had her where he wanted, temptation beckoned in the silky wet folds of her body. How could any man resist such a delicious feminine invitation?</p><p>Sinking to his knees in front of her, he pulled her bottom to the edge of the leather bench. Continuing to hold her legs high in the air with his hands, he spread her thighs farther apart. Musky heat and the scent of feminine arousal rushed over him like a powerful drug.</p><p>\"No!\" She tried to pull away. \"I won't survive.\"</p><p>\"Be still, wife. I want to indulge my hunger for you.\" Slow and deep, his first stroke down her parted flesh made her scream.</p><p>\"I'm going to kill you!\" Her whole body quivered as he stroked again. \"Oh ... oh!Jackson!\"</p><p>Using his strength to tilt her body a little more, he thrust his tongue into her, tasting her, marking her, branding her. Again and again and again. She thrashed and writhed but her body was a fountain for him, giving him the taste he craved - the flavor of her passion for him.</p><p>\"Again!\" He thrust his tongue into her after she went over the first cliff, forcing her to the second precipice. \"For me. Come, cara . For your husband.\" She didn't disappoint him, her spine arching as she trembled in a release that made her skin ripple.</p><p>His ownbody roared with triumph at her shuddering orgasm. But it wasn't enough. Not yet. Rising above her, he put his hands under her thighs and pulled her further from the bench, until her entire bottom was off the leather. Her body was on an angle that made his entry deeper than he'd believed possible.</p><p>She screamed as he slid into her and he felt her internal walls contract again and again as pleasure ripped through her, without mercy. Pulling out, he thrust deeper, clasping her buttocks in his palms. Forced to remain in position by his body, her legs ran up his chest to point at the ceiling. Her breasts moved as she rode the wave of ecstasy, but it was the sound of her calling his name over and over that finally destroyed any control he might've had. He surrendered to the rampaging heat inside him and thrust so deep, he thought he'd touched her heart.</p><p>Sometime afterward,Taylorpropped herself on his chest and said, \"I have one question.\"</p><p>Under his back, the exercise mat was cool. \"Hmm.\" He was idly stroking her bottom.</p><p>\"Did you think this was a one-shot thing? If you did, you'd better invest in some heavy-duty locks because I intend to watch at every opportunity.\" Her warning was delivered in a tone usually reserved for serious matters.</p><p>He thought it over. \"You can watch so long as I getpostworkout sex.\"</p><p>She nodded. \"Fair enough.\"</p><p>\"Lots of sex.\"</p><p>\"You get that anyway.\"</p><p>\"What did you mean about making a baby?\" He didn't want to get his hopes up, not when she had been so honest about her fears.</p><p>\"Pretty self-explanatorydon'chathink ?\" She began kissing his chest.</p><p>\"Taylor.\" He fisted a hand in her unbound hair and forced her head up.</p><p>\"I'm fertile and unprotected,\" she said simply.</p><p>A kind of hesitant wonder lit his face. He touched her cheek. \"A baby?\"</p><p>\"Yup.\"Taylorfelt the impact of that smile deep inside. Tonight for the first time,Jacksonhad totally let go of passion's reins and she'd never felt more powerful as a woman. Yet, the unexpected tenderness of his smile threatened to shatter her.</p><p>\"Are you sure it's not too soon? I know I have been arrogant in my demands but I can wait.\"</p><p>She felt her heart jump. \"You're the only man I can imagine taking this risk with. And now is the time to take that risk, while I have the strength to fight the fear.\" While she was still floating high on the success of conquering her sexual demons. \"Who knows what could happen in the future? I don't want to let this chance go by.\"</p><p>He hugged her tight. \"Thank you, cara mia .\" After a while, he freed her from his almost bruising embrace.</p><p>\"We haven't made a baby yet.\"</p><p>\"Yes, we have.\" He touched her stomach. \"Our child is growing inside you right now.\"</p><p>\"What? Are you in contact with all your little soldiers?\" She laughed. \"Has one breached the castle walls?\"</p><p>\"Wait...\" He curved one hand around his ear. \"I've just received a transmission. Castle walls have been breached. Our bambina is on the way.\" He smiled at her and it was a smile of such pure delight that her heart was shocked into a sort of frozen wonder.</p><p>\"It might be a bambino ,\" she whispered, amazed that she was going to have a child with this magnificent man. What a terrible and wonderful gift, she thought.</p><p>He chuckled. \"Have you been studying Italian, mia moglie ?\"</p><p>\"I have no idea what you mean, mio marito .\" She put the same possessive emphasis on the word husband that he'd put on wife .</p><p>His delighted laughter gave her hope. Yes, having a baby terrified her, but so had making love. With Jackson, anything was possible.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Amonth later, she toldJacksonhe'd been right. To her shock, they'd made a baby on the first go.</p><p>Standing in front of him, while he sat in his armchair, she couldn't miss the joy that lit his dark eyes from deep within.</p><p>\"A baby,\" hewhispered, his voice rough. Shaking visibly, he put his hands on her waist and looked up at her. \" Nostrobambina is inside of you?\"</p><p>\"Our baby is definitely inside me. I did six of those home pregnancy tests.\" She was touched in the most secret part of her heart that he trusted her enough to show her his vulnerability. JacksonSantorini's reputation did not allow for eyes glazed with elation at the announcement that he was about to become a father.</p><p>\"Come sit with me, piccola .\"</p><p>With a woman's instinct,Taylorknew that this was the closest her very masculine husband would ever come to asking to be held. Going into his arms, she embraced him while he digested the news, her heart overflowing with tenderness sogreat, she was afraid what it meant.</p><p>LikeJackson, Nick couldn't contain his happiness when he was told the news. \"Really, a baby? Cool!\"</p><p>He made a face. \"I won't miss anything when I go to the soccer camp?\"</p><p>Taylorhad to stifle a grin. \"No, honey. You've got almost eight months to look forward to.\"</p><p>He glanced from her toJackson. \"Are you ... I mean...\"</p><p>She frowned butJacksonapparently knew what was causing her brother's anxious expression. Tousling Nick's hair, he said, \"The adoption papers have been lodged. You are my eldest son, Nicolas. Make me proud.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I will.\" Nick hugged a startled but happyJackson.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes at the way her husband had accepted her brother, so hungry for male attention, but it was only when he was outside that she allowed herself a little sniffle. \"I'll miss him while he's at that training camp.\" Nick would always be her baby boy.</p><p>Jacksonput down the paper he'd been reading and came over to hug her from behind. \"It'll only be a few days.\"</p> <p>She leaned back into his strength. \"He's going to be all grown up soon, and then what'll I do?\"</p><p>Kissing her neck, her sexy man laughed in a way that sent tingles up her spine. \"Love our four other children.\"</p><p>\"Four?\" She laughed. \"Let's get this one out first.\"</p><p>\"I like to plan ahead.\"</p><p>She bit back a smile. \"Speaking of planning ahead - don't forget we have to go to that premiere tomorrow.\"</p> <p>\"Nick?\"</p><p>\"He wants to visit Mrs. Willis and she adores him, so we'll drop him off at her place on the way to the theater.\"</p><p>Jacksonmade a sound of agreement. \"There's a family film premiering in three months - Nick can come to that with us.\"</p><p>Emotion shot through her at the way her husband never forgot her brother, never tried to push him aside.</p><p>\"He'll love that.\" Reaching up, she clasped her hands over his arms. \"Is this premiere going to be like the last one?\" Three weeks ago, she'd attended her first glittering premiere byJackson's side.</p><p>The pre-movie get-together had been interesting. Relaxed because she knew several people from her dinner party, people who'd made it a point to introduce her to others who hadn't yet met her, she'd enjoyed the energy in the air as nervous actors and directors mingled with just as nervous producers.</p> <p>However, the movie itself had left her with a headache - from trying to comprehend the plot.</p><p>Jacksonchuckled. \"I promise this one's not a would-be art film that takes itself way too seriously. It's a chick-flick - sure to be a big hit for us.\"</p><p>Smiling at the resignation in his tone at being obliged to sit through the production, she turned to nuzzle him. \"You have good taste, darling. I would've had to kill you ifSantorini Studios had backed that other picture.\"</p><p>\" You are proof of my good taste.\" He kissed heruptilted lips, the caress an invitation. \"Nick's busy.Come upstairs, little wife. I have an intimate matter to discuss concerning our future plans.\"</p><p>TaylorgaveJacksona very female look but let him coax her up to their bedroom. Once there, her generous response soothed his possessive need for her. He was determined to teach her to trust him enough to gift him with her love, but sometimes, patience was difficult. His proprietary instincts demanded her devotion. But, JacksonSantorini was a man of honor and he would never go back on his word, in an attempt to forceunnegotiated concessions.</p><p>Love had not been part of their agreement.</p><p>He would persuade but not demand; fight his instincts to give her the emotional freedom she needed.</p><p>There was only one catch - he would never let her go. The minute she'd accepted his proposal, she'd become his. Forever.</p> <p>Almost two weeks after she'd confirmed her pregnancy,Taylorfixed Nick's collar one Friday morning and kissed him on the cheek. \"Have fun at soccer boot camp.\"</p><p>He grinned. \"I will. Bye.\" With an excited wave, he jumped in the team minivan and they drove out, followed unobtrusively by a bodyguard posing as a coach. It was a necessity that they were trying to downplay.</p><p>\"He'll be okay. He's got the cell phone if he needs us.\"Jacksonglanced at his watch. \"I'm due at a meeting in forty minutes.\" He kissed her a soft goodbye. \"Think of me, piccola .\" He turned to walk over to his car.</p><p>\"I'm not going to be so little in a while.\" She tried to make her words light, but disquiet whispered through her veins. Not for her body, but for her soul. A tiny piece ofJacksonwas growing inside of her, but an even more dangerous and amorphous thing was taking root in her heart.</p><p>Returning, he touched her cheek in a fleeting caress. \"You'll always be little to me, mia moglie .\"</p><p>For some reason, she wanted to stop him from going to work and ask him to hold her tight. But, putting on a bright smile, she waved him off. Only when he was gone did she drop the mask. What was the matter with her?</p><p>Something twisted in her stomach. She made a face. Morning sickness hadn't been a problem yet but maybe that was it; the yucky part of her six-week-old pregnancy was about to start. However, though she stood in the bathroom for a while, feeling nauseous, she didn't throw up.</p><p>Instead, tiredness seeped into her bones and barely two hours after she'd woken,she crawled back between the sheets, clad in nothing butJackson's discarded shirt. The masculine scent of his body lingered in the fibers, tangible and comforting, but it wasn't enough. The nausea had become something worse.</p><p>She hurt deep inside. Giving up trying to fight the urge, she rang his office.</p><p>\"He's on a video conference toNew York,\" Naomi, his new secretary, told her. \"I can get him...\"</p><p>A painful cramp brutalized her stomach. \"No,\" she whispered, almost unable to speak. \"Just ... just ask him to come home after his meeting. Okay?\"</p><p>\"It'll be a couple of hours.\"</p><p>\"That's fine.\" He probably wouldn't appreciate being called home to hold his weepy wife. Hanging up, she tried to slip into sleep.</p><p>But, a few minutes later, when she felt a warm wetness creeping between her thighs, she was wide awake. There was no pain, only a shocking emptiness where new life should've existed in nurturing warmth. Instead of confusion, sudden clarity wouldn't allow her to ignore the fatal truth.</p><p>\"No, no, no.\"Her voice was a hoarse whisper. \"Please, no!\" She fought the urge to look down. If she didn't see, it couldn't be true. But it was a futile effort - her gaze was pulled toward the horror.</p><p>On the blue sheets, the quickly spreading stain didn't look like blood did in the movies, bright and tomato-red. This was dark, almost black. And she knew her baby was gone. So quickly, so suddenly, so completely. Until that moment, she hadn't realized just how much she'd already come to love their baby, their precious bambina .</p><p>Clutching her stomach, she keened in grief, unable to stop that sound of utter anguish. How could she do this toJackson? How could her body betray her this way? Fueled by hormones in disarray, fear and suffering raked her with razor-sharp claws. The baby was gone. She'd lost their baby and failed to keep the only part of their bargain that mattered to her husband.Jacksonhad wanted to create life but she would only give him death ... he would hate her like he hated Bonnie. Her heart broke at the realization and her tears became heartrendingly silent.</p><p>Jacksonhad been irritated when Naomi interrupted the video conference barely after it had begun, but upon hearing her message, he decided she deserved a raise. Despite his reputation, she hadn't hesitated to stick her neck out forTaylor. AndTaylorwasJackson's life.</p><p>Disturbed by her report of his wife's fragile voice on the phone, he immediately called home. No one answered. Worried, he postponed the meeting and got in the car. When he arrived at the house, she didn't respond to his calls. He ran up the stairs to their bedroom, concernlaying like a rock on his heart. If anything had happened to hisTaylor, he wouldn't be able to bear it. The bed was a jumbled mess. His eyes told him that something was wrong with the dark blue sheets, but hearing movement in theensuite bathroom, he headed that way.</p><p>Taylorwas standing propped up in the corner, a white towel tucked haphazardly around her body. Wet hair lay limp and damp around her shoulders. Alarm for her health jack-knifed in his gut.</p><p>She looked up. \"The baby's gone.\" Her eyes were sunken, her face leached of color.</p><p>\"Gone?\" He couldn't help but remember Bonnie. Anguish at this second loss of a child shot through him like lightning. He was furious withTaylorfor a second, incredibly, unjustifiably angry, when he knew that she would've never made such a callous decision.</p><p>Her face went even paler and he knew she'd seen the anger. \"I'm sorry.\" Her voice was so forlorn and shivery that it scared him, reaching past the pain and fury to find the tenderness that he felt only for her.</p><p>Walking over, he put his hands on her shoulders. \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" she whispered again, eyes unfocussed.</p><p>He'd seen that expression before, on the faces of shock victims profiled in a recent war documentary.</p><p>He hissed through his teeth when he touched her bare arms. She was as stiff as wood, cold as ice.</p><p>Shoving aside his raging need to know what had happened, he took her into his arms. Nothing and no one else mattered. No one. OnlyTaylor.</p><p>It was at that moment thatJacksonrealized that if he lost his wife, he would simply give up on life. It was a shocking truth but he accepted it. TrueSantorini men, uncorrupted by the world, never loved with anything less than all their heart and soul. His grandfather Josef had lived only a few days after his grandmotherGia's passing.</p><p>\"Taylor.\" Gentleness had no effect. \"Taylor!\"</p><p>She looked up at his harsh tone, but didn't speak. It was almost as if she were waiting for a blow to fall.</p><p>Frustrated by his inability to reach her, he picked her up and stalked toward the bed, intending to sit on the edge.</p><p>\"No!\" Though weak, she began to struggle. Her tone was horrified and pleading at the same time.</p><p>Frowning, he bypassed the bed, and sat down on the window seat instead, holding her in his lap.</p><p>Because she loved to sit there in the sun and read, there was a soft angora blanket on the seat. He wrapped it around her, scared at her low body temperature. Then he began rubbing her arms under the blanket, clamping her cold feet between his thighs to warm them up.</p><p>After a long while, she asked, \"Why are you being nice?\" Her voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>\"Is there a reason I shouldn't be?\"</p><p>\"I told you, the baby's gone.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His heart almost broke at the pain in her voice. Even half mad with sorrow, not for a moment did he imagine that she'd deliberately hurt their baby. Not his piccola . Not this woman who'd taken every precaution to ensure that her brother grew up loved and protected. \"Are you okay?\"</p><p>She pushed up his chest and looked at him, all dark blue eyes. \"What does it matter? The baby's gone!\"</p><p>He shook her just a little. \"It matters. You matter. To me and to Nick. What would we do without you?\"</p> <p>She was shaking her head and tears were starting to gather. \"No, I didn't keep our baby safe. I couldn't!</p><p>I couldn't! I couldn't!\"</p><p>He thought that she was heading toward hysteria but suddenly realized that it was nothing more than pure anger-fueled pain.Taylorwas far more like him than he'd ever before guessed. She hated being unable to control her baby's happiness. He let her beat his chest with her clenched fists, let her cry and talk, almost certain that he knew what had happened.</p><p>\"I couldn't keep our baby safe! I couldn't!\" she screamed. \"There was just ... there was so much blood.</p><p>Our b-bambina got washed away.\" Wracking sobs infiltrated her body, turning her from a warrior to a grief-ravaged mother.</p> <p>Fighting his own tears,Jacksonheld her to him despite her protests, and rocked her. His poorTaylor. So used to protecting those she considered her own, so used to being able to control what hurt them.</p><p>Memories of her fussing over Nick merged into images of her bristling on his own behalf, taking on those who would dare to hurt him. He couldn't bear her pain. She cried for a long time and each tear felt like acid on his heart.</p><p>\"Have you called a doctor?\" heasked, when her sobs had faded off into silent weeping.</p><p>\"What for? I'm fine.\" She was belligerent.</p><p>His eye flicked to the bed and suddenly he understood why it had disturbed him. The blue sheets shouldn't have been that almost purplish shade. His heart froze. How much blood had she lost? Shaking, he pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and dialed an ambulance one-handed.Taylordidn't say anything, and when the paramedics came, she went quietly. He held her hand throughout the ride.</p><p>At the E.R., he paced like a caged tiger until they pronounced that she'd be fine, though they wanted to keep her overnight for observation. He sat with her as she was hooked up to an IV drip and afterward when she started crying again, he ignored hospital policy and gathered her into his arms, being careful not to dislodge the IV needle. Sitting in a chair beside her bed, he cradled her slender body, so unexpectedly fragile, against his strength. Except tonight, he didn't feel very strong. He could never erase her hurt.</p> <p>\"I don't know how to stop your pain, cara mia ,\" he admitted. \"Tell me what to do.\" He was used to doing things, not being a useless observer on the sidelines.</p><p>Lifting her head, she framed his face with her gentle hands. \"My pain? What about yours, darling?\"</p><p>He gave her a tight smile. \"I didn't go through what you did. I will be fine.\"</p><p>She shook her head, her lips set stubbornly. \"Don't shut me out,Jackson. Please don't.\" The vulnerability beneath the stubbornness was clear. \"I need you here with me. More than I've ever needed you before.\"</p><p>He looked at her earnest, tear-streaked face and felt something inside him shatter. \"I always thought our bambina would have her mother's eyes.\"</p><p>\"And her papa's heart.\"Taylorstroked his tears away, and it was only then that he knew he was crying.</p><p>For the first time since he'd been a mere babe, JacksonSantorini allowed himself to cry, held in his wife's arms. Her honest pain deserved nothing less. The honor of their bambina required it.</p><p>The next day,Jacksontook his wife home. While they'd been away, he'd had the bed replaced, knowing that neither of them would ever want to lie on it again. When they arrived, he madeTaylorsomething to drink and then they sat basking in the sunshine, on the steps leading down from the back verandah. She sat on the step below him, watching the butterflies as steam floated up from her tea. He put his arms gently around her and held her to him.</p> <p>\"The nurse said that if we let ourselves mourn, we'd heal better.\" Her voice was tentative.</p><p>\"What do you want to do, cara?\" He rubbed his face against her soft hair, reminding her that he was at her disposal. He needed to do something for her. Anything.</p><p>\"I thought we could name her - we don't know if the baby would've been a girl or a boy but we always thought of her...\"</p><p>\"...as our bambina ,\" he completed.</p><p>\"Yes. Maybe ... maybe we could plant something beautiful for her in our garden. It might help Nick, too, when he finds out.\"</p><p>He swallowed the sorrow that choked his throat. Nick was so much like his sensitive sister.Jackson knew that they would have to be very careful with his young heart. \"That sounds like a fine idea. What shall we name her?\"</p><p>\"What do you think?\" Putting her cup on the step, she tilted her head against his chest and met his gaze.</p><p>\"Rosa.\" He quietly admitted to his own dreams.</p><p>She nodded. \"That's a good name. RosaSantorini .\" For the first time since their baby's loss, she smiled a little, hisTaylorcoming back to him. \"I'm glad we're doing this. I don't want to pretend she didn't exist.\"</p><p>Despite the smile, there was such deep pain and sadness in her that he wanted to break something in despair.</p><p>\"We could try again,\" he suggested, hesitant to do so, but it was all he could think of to alleviate her hurt.</p><p>\"I'd like that.\" She smiled slowly. \"From what the doctor said, it happens to first babies sometimes ...</p><p>there's no reason for us not to try again.\"</p><p>He was glad that she no longer blamed herself as she had in those first shocked moments. \"But before we do anything, we will get you checked out. We will not do anything if it will hurt you.\" He refused to lose his wife.</p><p>Her face fell. \"You don't want me to be the mother of your babies? You said a year...\"</p><p>His tough littleTaylorwas still so vulnerable and he knew only one way to change that. What was pride, what was machismo , in the face of his wife's pain? Squeezing her tight, he leaned in close to her ear. \"If anything happened to you, I would notsurvive, miaamore . Do not ask me to.\"</p><p>Taylor's heart stopped at that powerful statement, made in such a quiet way. \"Jackson? But a baby...\"</p><p>\"...would be precious, but only if you were a part of him or her.\" His legs pressed close against her and it was like being hugged with his whole body. \"You are my heart, TaylorSantorini . You. Only you.\"</p><p>Taylor's whole world changed in that instant. She'd always guarded against love because the idea of being emotionally dependent on someone else terrified her. Never had she thought about what it would mean if she was loved in return, never had she imagined that a man with Jackson's passionate heart, a heart which had been hurt as much as her own, would surrender his love into her hands. Andnever, never had she thought that her proud Italian husband would admit such a great vulnerability to her, not when Bonnie had wounded him so very much .</p><p>Nick came home three days later and they held him while he cried. Then together, they planted a red rose bush Nick chose. Roses forRosa, he'd whispered. Jackson hadn't left Taylor's side for the past four days and now he was right beside her as they held hands and sang a lullaby to the baby they would never get to hold.</p><p>It took another week before he was convinced that she'd be okay on her own.</p><p>\"Will you be all right?\" He was cradling her face in his big hands. \" Cara, if you need me, I'll stay.\"</p><p>She knew that he meant every word. Her husband had shown her that she was the most vital thing in his life. Reaching up, she kissed his cheek. \"I'm okay, darling. Promise. I think I'll bake a cake to celebrate Nick's team winning their first game.\"</p><p>Jacksonnodded in approval. \"He's a strong boy. He's going to be fine.\"</p><p>\"We're all going to be okay. We went through the sadness together and we'll go through the joy that comes.\"</p><p>It was time for her to start living again, She was aware that both her husband and her brother had treated her like fragile china for the past week and a half. Though she'd held them in their grief, they were both indisputably male, her husband the most masculine creature she knew. Being who they were, offering her their protection and succor had calmed the rage and sorrow inside them.</p><p>She'd let them fuss, aware of their need to do what they could. Now, it was time for her to reclaim her own strength. HerRosawas in her heart, where she would always dwell,a precious first baby. But she was the only mother Nick had ever known and he needed her. So did her husband.</p><p>\"I'll be back between five and six.\"Jacksonkissed her once more and then he was gone.</p><p>Determined to banish the sadness, she went around the house pulling open every curtain. Light poured in from the windows and skylights while she prepared the cake mix.</p><p>As she did so, she thought over the game only two days ago. Nick would've understood if she'd missed it but she would have never forgiven herself for neglecting his emotional needs.Jacksonhad supported her decision to attend the match with him, though he'd bundled her up in so many layers of clothing, she'd felt like a stuffed goose.</p><p>The outing had been a good idea, breaking the spell of sadness that had hung over all of them. Watching Jacksoncheer for Nick with as much enthusiasm as any of the other fathers, she'd suddenly realized that somehow, they'd truly become a family.</p><p>Smiling at the memory of the stunned look on her brother's face when he'd saved agoal, she put the two cake tins in the oven. Then, when the house was bright with sunshine and redolent with the smell of baking, she sat down with a cup of tea and took the chance to think.

JacksonSantorini was a man of honor. He would never lie to his wife. Tears threatened. He loved her. Her husband, the man she'd adored from afar for so long, loved her. She had done well out of their bargain.</p><p>What had her husband gained?</p> <p>A wife who loved his touch and a child who worshipped him. It seemed like a fair trade but it wasn't.</p><p>Not when she was keeping her feelings locked up behind a wall of practicality and sense, too scared to trust someone with that final piece of her heart in case they abandoned her.</p><p>She'd marriedJacksonbecause he could keep Nick safe. But, what did she feel for him? She knew that she wouldn't be able to function if she lost Nick. Mouth dry, she asked herself the question she'd been avoiding, afraid of the answer - what would happen to her if she lostJackson? Her mind went black with pain so intense it was unbearable.</p><p>And she knew.</p><p>If she lostJackson, a piece of her soul would die and even Nick wouldn't be able to reach her. With his tenderness and protective possessiveness, her husband had become forever a part of her. Now, all she had to do was show him that truth. He wouldn't believe her confession easily, this man who'd been betrayed so publicly. He might think that she felt she had to respond to his declaration, or that she was grateful. Or even that she was emotional after the past week and a half.</p> <p>And yes, she was emotional, but not in that way. His care of her since they'd lost their baby had opened her eyes to the strength and loyalty inside of her big Italian husband. He would never stop loving her, not even if she failed to keep her part of their bargain. Most importantly, he would never abandon her, consigning her to an emotional wasteland. That certainty made her secure enough to tell him that he was the most treasured part of her life.</p><p>ConvincingJacksonthat she loved him without reservation or fear would take determination. But, he was going to believe her because he was hers for life. For the first time since her miscarriage, she felt true joy, knowing that other babies would grow from their precious relationship.</p><p>Jacksonfound himself walking up the steps to their home barely after two that day. Though he'd intended to stay away until at least five, givingTaylorspace, his protective instincts had refused to stop clamoring for a look at her. He even had an excuse prepared for why he was home, though it made him feel about ten years old.</p><p>The door opened before he could reach it. A softly smilingTaylorstood there, arms folded across her chest. \"Now, how did I know you'd be back early?\"</p><p>Her teasing question released the tension across his shoulders. He'd been afraid that she'd find his protectiveness overbearing, when it was anything but that. She was so important to him that he couldn't bear to see her hurting. \"No kiss for your husband, mia moglie ?\" Reaching her, he leaned down.</p><p>She met him more than halfway, her lips a whisper against his, a welcome home that he'd been starving for.\"Hello, mio marito .And yes, I'm okay.\"</p> <p>Loving her for understanding his need to care, he hugged her around the waist and nuzzled his face into her neck. \"I promise I'll leave you in peace for the rest of the day. I just came to get a kiss.\"</p><p>She chuckled. When he pulled back, to his surprise, she took his hand and tugged him inside the house.</p><p>He went, more than happy to accommodate her. She led him to the kitchen, where two cakes sat cooling. After sitting him down, she made coffee and then cut him a slice of cake. When he reached to take the saucer it was on, she shook her head and came around to sit on the chair facing him. Then, putting a bite of cake on her fork, she held it out, a smile in her eyes. Grinning, he let her feed him, something taut in his heart soothed by this sign of her healing.</p><p>\"Jackson?\"</p><p>\"Hmm?\" He accepted another mouthful.</p><p>\"I did some thinking this morning.\"</p><p>He looked up at the sound of her voice. The expression she was wearing made him refuse the next bite she offered. He wanted his mouth free to fight for her if he had to, because there was such purpose in that look that it shook him. \"And what did you think about?\"</p><p>\"Loving,\" she murmured, putting the saucer and fork on the table. \"And how it's the greatest trust a woman can give to a man.\"</p> <p>His heart jumped. \"Why were you thinking of it?\"</p><p>Her smile rivaled the sunshine. \"I was thinking that I love you so much it almost hurts, but that you might not believe me if I just said it, so I was trying to think of some brilliant declaration.\"</p><p>Joy shot through every vein in his body, hot and potent and blinding. Rising to his feet, he hauled her up and crushed her to him. \"I believe you.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure? I don't want a grumpy husband with doubts about why I'm his wife.\"</p><p>He let the conviction in her wash over him, her sharp words a dare to disbelieve. \"I know you're not a woman to say those words lightly. I know you.\" Lifting her up, he kissed her full on the lips, finding her more than ready, more than willing. When they finally parted, he slid her softly down his body.</p><p>Blue, blue eyes met his as she raised her head. \"Sometimes, I look at you and my heart feels like it'll explode with the intensity of what you do to me.\" Her voice shook. \"Loving you should terrify me but you know what?\"</p><p>Touched by her utter honesty and raw from the emotions rioting through him, he could barely speak.</p><p>\"Tell me.\"</p><p>\"All I feel is this overwhelming sense of rightness.\" Her heart was in her eyes. \"You were meant to be mine.\"</p><p>A lifetime of loneliness disappeared in the brilliant truth of her claiming. \"And you, mine. I will never let you go, mia moglie e bellissima .\" His beautiful wife. His .</p><p>\"Thank God.\" Then scowling, she muttered, \"Not that you'd get very far if you tried to walk away, JacksonSantorini . I keep what's mine.\"</p><p>Her tart tone made him grin.\"Tivogliobene .\"</p><p>\"You can't fool me - I know that one.\" Her kiss was a mix of fire and sweet tenderness. \"And, I love you, too.\"</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Jacksonhadn't thought that life could get any better but to his delight, it did. Not only was sweet, sexy Taylor his wife, she was now his lover in the most complete sense of the word. He didn't have a single doubt about her feelings - after all, his wife didn't tell lies. And that wife said she loved him so regularly that the Italian in him was coming to expect her adoration as his due.</p><p>One night, as she was straddling his back, torturing him with her hands and mouth, as she did on a regular basis, she said, \" Honey, Nick kind of wants a niece or nephew soon.\"</p><p>He frowned. \"I told you, we're waiting until you're perfectly recovered.\"</p><p>\"It's been ten months.\" He could tell she was pouting. She kissed his shoulder. \"Please, darling.\"</p><p>\"Three more months.\" He reached back and stroked her calf. She bit him on his bicep. \"Bad-tempered little witch.\"</p><p>\"One month.\" She was pressing her naked body along the length of his, knowing full well it drove him crazy. It was only fair, given that his body turned her mindless with lust. He smirked against the pillow.</p><p>\"Two.\"</p><p>\"One and a half.\" She was stroking his flanks now. \"Please. Please, please, please!\"</p><p>He laughed at her begging because they both knew that she'd get her own way. Turning, he flipped her under him. \"One and a half but...\" he scowled at her, \"only if the doctor gives his okay.\"</p><p>She made a face. \"Fine. How many children did you want again? One?\" Her gentle laughter at his expense had only become worse after she'd declared her love.</p><p>His delight in her grew with every moment. \"I always thought five children was a good number.\" He pressed his arousal into the pool of heat between her legs.</p><p>\"Five babies? You expect me to give birth five times?\" She didn't look too impressed.</p><p>\"No. Only four. I already have a son.\"</p><p>IfTaylorhadn't loved him rather madly by then, that casual acceptance of Nick as his son would have done it. \"Let me up, I haven't finished touching your back.\"</p><p>He ground his erection against her body. \"Later. I want to take you now.\"</p><p>\"You can't just take over. It was my turn!\" she protested. He had a tendency to become incredibly dominating if she didn't keep her eye on him.</p><p>He started to slide in with an expression of almost painful pleasure. \"Are you going to make me leave?\"</p><p>\"Later.\" There was something to be said for a dominant Italian husband in bed. \"Did you get bigger?\"</p><p>\"No. You got tighter, piccola . Probably because you exercise those muscles all the time.\" He was chuckling.</p><p>She wrapped her arms and legs firmly around him and squeezed those internal muscles in retaliation.</p><p>\"Like I do it on my own, Mr. Three Times a Day.\"</p><p>\"I'll get slower as I get older.\" He groaned.</p><p>\"It seems like you're only getting more demanding.\" She arched up. \"Ooooh. Deeper. Deeper!\"</p><p>Rain splattered against the skylight asJackson's body started driving into hers.Taylorsmiled and thanked the heavens for rainy nights, before her husband demanded her complete attention.</p><p>Eleven months later, Nick got his wish. Josef ReidSantorini was a little small to play soccer, butJackson assured the older boy that that would change. When Nick was scared to hold Josef, it was Jackson who gave him courage, standing by his side. His love for both his boys was apparent in the shining light in his dark eyes.</p><p>\"I kinda get whyTaylor's so protective of me. Do you think I used to be so little?\" Nick smiled down at the baby, already showing the same protective tendencies in his careful grasp.</p><p>Jacksonchuckled. \"We'll have to ask her. Don't worry, he's aSantorini like you and we're indestructible.\"</p><p>From the nursery doorway,Taylorwatched her men laugh and felt blessed. WhenJacksonturned to her and said, \" Cara, \" she walked over. \"You're heavily outnumbered now,\" he whispered to her, while Nick was occupied with Josef. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>She smiled against his chest. \"Ha!

But, most of all, it was full of love. Smiling,Taylorsighed and gave into an embrace she knew would never break and never hurt. Big, bad JacksonSantorini knew how to cherish his family. </p>  </body></html>"]
