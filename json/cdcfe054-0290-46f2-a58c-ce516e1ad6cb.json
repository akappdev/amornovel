She felt safe enough that she no longer took cover when she heard a vehicle approach. She\u2019d been walking for at least eight hours and saw the first rays of light coming over the mountains behind her. This reassured her that she was traveling west, toward the coast. She carried her three-year-old daughter, Mercy, and a backpack stuffed with a few items of clothing and forty dollars that had been given to her by the kindhearted stranger who had given her a ride.</p><p>She was exhausted but would not stop to rest until she reached Highway 101. Every so often she would put Mercy down and hold her hand, but that made the walking unbearably slow. When she heard a vehicle, she just kept her head down, staring at the ground.</p><p>It was a truck\u2014it drove past them, but then it stopped up ahead. It was cranberry-red and old, but in mint condition. A man got out and yelled to her. \u201cMiss? Need a ride?\u201d</p> <p>She walked toward the vehicle. \u201cAm I close to Highway 101?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going that way. I\u2019m on my way to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI can give you a lift.\u201d</p><p>He was an older guy. He wore a red, white and blue ball cap and his cheeks and chin were stubbled in places that he\u2019d missed with his razor. Though it was June, he wore a jacket. The early morning was misty, which told her she must be in a valley near the Pacific. \u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cThunder Point,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small town on the coast in Coos County. I work at a beach bar and I open the place in time for breakfast. Been there a few years now. It\u2019s mostly fishing towns around there.\u201d</p><p>Well, she\u2019d gotten out of Douglas County, but she wasn\u2019t sure where Coos County was. She didn\u2019t know where anything was\u2014she rarely left the compound and had never been to any of the small coastal towns. Still, she knew that Highway 101 stretched as far north and south as she needed to get. Highway 5 was bigger and closer to the compound and if anyone was looking for a couple of runaways hitching rides, they\u2019d probably start there. \u201cHow close to 101 is your town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlenty close. Want me to drop you there?\u201d</p><p>She walked toward the truck. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d he said.</p><p>She put her backpack in the truck bed. Holding Mercy on her lap, she buckled them in together. She kept her head down, her hands tucked between her knees.</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Rawley Goode,\u201d he said. She said nothing. \u201cYou got a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon,\u201d Devon said. She shouldn\u2019t use her real name. What if someone came poking around, asking if anyone had seen a woman named Devon? But she was almost too tired to lie. Not to mention nervous. At least she hadn\u2019t said Sister Devon.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not an escaped convict, are you, Devon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cIs there a prison around here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cJust kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere you headed?\u201d</p><p>For lack of a better answer she said, \u201cSeattle. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cYou\u2019re a long ways from there. What brings you to this old back road?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s where I was dropped off, but I\u2019m heading for 101.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hitchin\u2019 rides?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her ride over the mountain had been planned, but was kept secret. \u201cYes, 101 will have more traffic,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cUnless the police see you. Then it could get complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch.\u201d</p><p>Devon wasn\u2019t really headed to Seattle, but she just said that because that was where she came from originally. She thought there might be a shelter or charity of some kind in one of the bigger towns on the coast. \u201cI don\u2019t know this area very well. Is there a town or city near Highway 101 that\u2019s pretty big? Big enough that it might have a shelter or maybe a hostel?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cCouple,\u201d Rawley replied. \u201cListen, I have an idea. You decide exactly where you need to go and I\u2019ll fix you up with transportation. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked suspiciously. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI been in your spot, hitchin\u2019 rides, lookin\u2019 for the easiest way to get from here to there, takin\u2019 a little help sometimes. I normally went to the VA when I needed a little assistance.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou got room for a little breakfast? \u2019Cause that\u2019s my job in the morning\u2014perking the coffee, warming up egg sandwiches, watching the sun come over the mountains. It\u2019s not far from the highway, neither. I could show you a map while you and the little one eat something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I have a couple of apples for later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that look of no money,\u201d he said. \u201cBeen wearin\u2019 it and seein\u2019 it for forty years now. No charge for the map. Or the breakfast. Then I\u2019ll give you a ride to wherever you need to go to catch your next ride. It ain\u2019t no gamble. I admit, I ain\u2019t always been the best person in the world, but I ain\u2019t yet done nobody harm. You can hang on to those apples.\u201d</p><p>Rawley didn\u2019t know for certain, but he was pretty sure the young woman was from The Fellowship\u2014a small religious compound along the river in Douglas County. She was wearing their \u201cuniform\u201d or \u201chabit\u201d of overalls, sturdy shoes, long-sleeved T-shirt with one button at the neck and a long, thick, single braid down her back. He\u2019d donated to the group a couple of times himself and had noticed that the women were all attired the same while the few men in evidence all wore their own combinations of jeans, plaid or chambray shirts, hats and down vests. A few months back, when Cooper had been renovating the old bait shop and turning it into a first-rate bar and caf\u00e9, Rawley had taken the used industrial-size washers and dryers, along with a lot of kitchen wares they couldn\u2019t use, over to The Fellowship compound.</p><p>They were a private bunch, but he knew they had a roadside stand near their compound where they sold produce, quilts and woven goods. He\u2019d only stopped once and had seen a group of them gathered around the stall, the women doing the business and the men helping with the heavy work, but mainly just presiding over everything. And he\u2019d seen a few of them wandering around the Farmers\u2019 Market in Myrtle Creek where they sometimes had a stand, again the women together in a tight knot and the men following along or standing behind them, watching.</p><p>He had never given the group a second thought until this morning when he found the young woman and her child walking down the deserted road at dawn. Now he wondered what that group was all about. Beautiful, young, smiling, soft-spoken women apparently watched over by big, silent men who were clearly in charge.</p><p>The girl seemed skittish, so Rawley played his cards close to his vest. As they drove the twenty minutes to the beach at Thunder Point he kept the conversation light, only saying things like Gonna be a right fine day and Fog\u2019ll burn off the water early today and Should get up around seventy degrees, and that\u2019s a heat wave on the ocean.</p><p>She kept very quiet, offering the occasional Mmm-hmm but nothing more. Her little girl rested her head on her mother\u2019s shoulder and a couple of times they whispered quietly to each other. As they drove down the hill toward the bar she saw, for the first time, the beach sheltered by the rocky coastline, the bay studded with giant rocks and the fog at the mouth of the bay just lifting. All she said was, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty, ain\u2019t she?\u201d Rawley replied.</p><p>Moments later they arrived at the bar. Rawley parked out back behind the building and used his key to open the place up. It was 6:00 a.m.</p><p>\u201cCome on inside, sit up at the bar and I\u2019ll put on the coffee and heat up some eggs. Got some fruit, too. And Cooper, the owner, he likes his Tony Tigers\u2014you or the little one like Frosted Flakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is very generous,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I passed your way plenty of times. I got a lot to pay back.\u201d</p><p>As he turned to get things started, Rawley noticed the coffee was already brewing. He looked out the window and saw a lone man out on the still bay on a paddleboard. That would be Cooper, getting in a little early morning exercise. And as he watched, a Razor ATV came across the beach with a big black-and-white Great Dane riding shotgun\u2014Sarah, Cooper\u2019s woman, must have a day off from the Coast Guard.</p><p>Good, he thought. Cooper and Sarah would be out on the water for a while. That would give him enough time to figure out what to do with Devon. Because obviously something needed to be done. A woman and a small child with a single backpack out walking the back roads at dawn with no money and no plan... It didn\u2019t take a genius...</p><p>He wet a cloth with warm water and handed it to Devon in case she wanted to wipe the grime of the road from her hands and face, and she did so. Then wiped off her daughter\u2019s hands and face, muttering a very soft \u201cthank you\u201d as she put down the cloth.</p><p>Rawley got started with the food. He put out a fruit plate, a box of Frosted Flakes, two bowls, utensils, a carton of milk, a couple of small glasses. Then he pulled two egg sandwiches out of the cooler and popped them in the microwave.</p><p>Devon served her little girl, sharing everything. When the egg sandwiches arrived she gave voice to her thoughts\u2014\u201cSo much food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraveling makes a person hungry,\u201d Rawley said. And then he poured himself a cup of coffee. While they tucked into their breakfast he wandered out to the deck to think. He wanted to see where Cooper and Sarah were, and give Devon and her little girl time to get some food in their stomachs. If he watched them eat, they\u2019d try not to eat too much\u2014a man who\u2019d been hungry and had taken charity knew this.</p><p>Hamlet, the Great Dane, was tied to the dock while Sarah paddled out to join Cooper on the bay. Rawley propped open the doors to the deck so Cooper would know he was on duty and that the place was open for business. A few moments later as he stood on the deck with his cup of coffee, Cooper waved. Rawley lifted a hand back. Then he watched them glide over the calm water, chasing the fog out of the bay.</p><p>By the time he went back inside, Devon and her little girl had put away a good deal of food and that made him smile. He went back behind the bar with his coffee. \u201cFill you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, sir,\u201d she said, giving her mouth a pat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll write down your name and address for me, I\u2019ll try to repay the kindness when I\u2019m able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you pass it on, Devon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I try to do when I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll do that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. Looking for a larger town? One with a shelter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems a good place for me to start,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMind if I ask? What put you in these straits?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and stroked her daughter\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. I lost my job and couldn\u2019t find another. I got some benefits and food stamps, but it wasn\u2019t enough to pay the rent and I didn\u2019t have family to take me in. So, here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of work you lookin\u2019 for?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>Devon laughed a little bit. \u201cI\u2019ve been working since I was fifteen, I can do a lot of things. Office work, waitress work, worked in a nursing home for a while. I even worked on a farm. I cleaned, cooked, worked in child care a lot\u2014once I was a teaching assistant in a preschool. I went to college. But none of those things paid enough to keep me and Mercy comfortable. I had a boyfriend, but he left. See?\u201d she finished, tilting her head to one side. \u201cPretty simple. Just rotten timing. Bad luck.\u201d</p><p>Rawley leaned on the bar. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s this place on the river. Some kind of religious group. They call themselves The Fellowship. I could drive you out there, see if they\u2019d take you in for a while, fix you up with some\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said hotly. \u201cPlease, no! If you could just give me a lift to the highway.\u201d</p><p>He held up a callused hand. \u201cShh,\u201d he said. \u201cDevon, I know you\u2019re from there. I don\u2019t know why and you don\u2019t have to tell me, but it\u2019s pretty clear you needed to be out of the place if you\u2019d drag your kid out in the dark of night and walk over a mountain.\u201d He frowned. \u201cShe is your kid, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She looked down. \u201cI got a ride over the mountain. I should just get going....\u201d</p><p>The child looked like her mother. Rawley was just checking. \u201cJust sit. I can help you out here. You and the little one would be safe while you figure things out. You don\u2019t have to be out on the highway, takin\u2019 your chances.\u201d</p><p>She just looked at him with those big blue eyes, her peachy lips parted. Her daughter continued to move Frosted Flakes around in her bowl, apparently oblivious to the conversation. \u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI told you why. You need details? There was this war you\u2019re too young to even know about and I came home a mess and no one wanted any part of me, of any of us. A lot of us wandered, just trying to forget or get the noise in our heads to stop. We had the VA but folks didn\u2019t even know how to help Vietnam vets. Like I said, I took a lot of charity. I worked some here and there, slept on the street some, helped out at the VA some. Now\u2014I got a house and a job. That\u2019s my story. You keep yours till you feel safe. But, girl\u2014we\u2019re gonna have to make some changes \u2019cause I knew where you came from the second I seen you walkin\u2019 down the road.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got pretty round at that, but she remained mute.</p> <p>\u201cThe overalls, the braid... Once Cooper\u2014the boss\u2014gets in here and decides to start work for the day, I\u2019ll take you somewhere to get clothes that don\u2019t just holler commune-for-Christ or whatever that is you come from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Fellowship,\u201d she reminded him quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd, if you are trying to keep a low profile around here it wouldn\u2019t hurt to cut off that braid or something. You think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip a little bit, thinking this over. When she did speak she said, \u201cI know about Vietnam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad you don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>Thinking again she said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not far enough away. From the compound.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think some of them might come lookin\u2019 for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so, not really. They\u2019re not bad people. But...\u201d</p><p>Rawley let that hang a minute. \u201cBut?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to leave. And I did anyway. And we\u2019re not going back,\u201d she added vehemently.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cThen we play it safe. If you see any of \u2019em snoopin\u2019 around, you better sound the alarm. I\u2019ve been in this town almost every day for over four years and no one from that place ever came here. My house is in Elmore, a thirty-minute drive from here and I ain\u2019t never seen any of \u2019em there, either. I guess there\u2019s a chance some folks from around here have been to that produce stand, or what you call the compound, so I reckon getting yourself a new look makes sense. There\u2019s just one thing you\u2019re gonna have to do to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Mr. Goode?\u201d</p><p>She remembered his name. Sharp for someone who\u2019d been up all night and was probably worn to a nub.</p><p>\u201cGonna have to trust a stranger, miss. That\u2019s what.\u201d</p> <p>Again she dropped her gaze. \u201cLast time I did that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can figure that much out without the whole story,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that place was safe. A refuge. Bent on charity and good works. But if it was a good and decent place, you\u2019d have left in daylight with money in your pocket. I\u2019m old and I\u2019m jaded but I ain\u2019t stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while, it was a refuge and it saved me. For a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what we do, miss. We get you some Walmart clothes and I\u2019ll take you and the little miss here to my house. You\u2019ll have a safe and warm place to lay your head. There\u2019s food in the fridge. You might wanna pretend to be kin\u2014like my second cousin\u2019s daughter. I didn\u2019t have no direct family.\u201d</p><p>Devon actually smiled at that. \u201cNeither did I, Mr. Goode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight wanna call me Rawley for good measure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRawley,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon, you\u2019re stuck with trusting strangers right now. It ain\u2019t safer thumbing rides on the highway, I guaran-damn-tee. This\u2019ll at least give you time to think and be safe while you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>Spencer Lawson was new to Thunder Point. He\u2019d taken the job of Athletic Director and coach at the local high school and he and his ten-year-old son were living in Cooper\u2019s fifth wheel while looking around for a place to rent. He had to admit, while it was a little tight on space, especially in the bathroom, it was not only convenient but it was a pleasure to wake up every day and see the bay. He didn\u2019t have much of a kitchen in the RV, but then he wasn\u2019t much of a cook. Besides, right next door, Cooper had the equivalent of two kitchens and a nice big outdoor gas grill.</p><p>Spencer had been up for a while. With coffee still in his cup he decided to wander next door to Cooper\u2019s place. He left Austin, sprawled crossways, asleep in the big bed. They\u2019d been sharing a bedroom since moving into Cooper\u2019s RV but sleeping with Austin was like sleeping with the entire fourth grade. Most nights Spencer escaped to the sofa in the living room. As he walked across the deck toward the open doors of the bar, he heard voices...a woman\u2019s voice as she said, \u201cNo! Please, no!\u201d</p><p>And he stopped. He heard Rawley shush her and say, \u201cDevon, I know where you\u2019re from. You don\u2019t have to give me details and I don\u2019t have to know why...\u201d</p><p>Spencer saw Cooper and Sarah out on their boards, skimming across the bay smoothly, the movement of their paddles synchronized. Quietly he took a chair outside the opened doors, shamelessly eavesdropping on the conversation. In five minutes, he had the story\u2014this was a young woman with a child who had run away from some kind of commune or religious order. And Rawley was not only going to help her, but he would help her keep it secret. While he was dying to walk into the bar and get a look at this young runaway, he didn\u2019t want them to stop talking.</p><p>A few minutes later, Sarah and Cooper were coming in off the water. They stowed their boards against the dock and untied the dog from it. Hamlet made a beeline for the deck. This was Spencer\u2019s cue. He stood and waited for them. First he greeted Hamlet and gave him a vigorous head and ear massage. \u201cHey, old boy! How\u2019s it going, Ham?\u201d Sarah and Cooper strolled leisurely up the stairs to the deck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Cooper asked Spencer.</p><p>Spencer lifted his cup. \u201cI\u2019m out of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always out of something,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cCome on in, Rawley can hook you up. I\u2019m just guessing, but I bet you want breakfast, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSprawled across the bed. Snoring.\u201d</p><p>Cooper chuckled.</p><p>Ham was waiting anxiously, tail wagging like mad, hoping he\u2019d get a treat. The three of them\u2014and Ham\u2014all walked into the bar together. Right away they noticed the young woman with a long braid and a small child sitting at the counter. Rawley looked up from behind the bar and the little girl broke into a huge grin, pointed and said, \u201cMama! Pony in the house!\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed, putting a hand up to her mouth. Her blue eyes twinkled.</p><p>Ham went to the child immediately. He was excellent with kids.</p><p>\u201cJust a dog, kiddo,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWant to give him his cookie? Look out, though. He\u2019s got a real slobbery mouth but he never nips.\u201d He fished a huge dog biscuit out of the jar on the bar and let the little girl hold it out toward Ham. She held it in a flat hand, as if feeding a horse. Then Cooper looked at the young woman and said, \u201cHi. I\u2019m Cooper. This is my fianc\u00e9e, Sarah. And this is my friend, Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis here\u2019s my cousin\u2019s daughter, Coop,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cWell, second cousin, maybe even removed. Devon. Visiting.\u201d</p><p>Cooper tilted his head and queried with his eyes. \u201cDevon...?\u201d</p><p>But Rawley didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t answer because he didn\u2019t know Devon\u2019s last name. Finally Devon said, \u201cMcAllister. And this is my daughter, Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure. Rawley, you should\u2019ve mentioned you had company coming. You could have taken the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a last-minute thing but, if you can spare me, I\u2019d like to show her around a little bit. They might be tired from traveling, too, and I can leave \u2019em at home and come back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the day off if you want it, Rawley. I can handle the shop. Landon will show up to help out when he gets his lazy butt out of bed. And I\u2019ve always got Spencer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>Spencer looked at this duo\u2014mother and child. She was plain as a pancake, and yet she was beautiful. She looked very young\u2014early twenties? She was vulnerable, that was instantly obvious. He immediately wondered how she\u2019d gotten trapped in a commune that wouldn\u2019t let her leave. He had this sudden urge to step in, to offer advice or shelter or something.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIf you need more time, just let me know so I can make arrangements. How long are you staying?\u201d</p><p>Again, the young woman didn\u2019t respond but Rawley said, \u201cThat\u2019s up in the air. I told her she can stay for a few days or weeks\u2014it ain\u2019t like she\u2019ll be in my way. If you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll hit the road, then. You ready?\u201d Rawley asked her.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Nice meeting you all.\u201d</p><p>And the three of them moved slowly out the back door, climbed into Rawley\u2019s truck and the engine roared to life. It was two minutes before the truck was traveling up the road to the highway.</p><p>Then Cooper looked at Sarah and Spencer. \u201cRawley doesn\u2019t have any family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, second cousin, removed...\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cWith no warning they\u2019re coming?\u201d Spencer asked. \u201cNah, they\u2019re not family. I\u2019d bet my last dollar on that.\u201d For some reason he couldn\u2019t quite explain, Spencer didn\u2019t tell them about the conversation he had overheard between Rawley and Devon.</p><p>\u201cIt does seem strange,\u201d Cooper agreed. \u201cRawley\u2019s a little odd, but he\u2019s not, you know...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kidnapper? A serial killer?\u201d Sarah offered.</p><p>\u201cMore likely he found \u2019em hitching or panhandling. People don\u2019t know this about Rawley, but he\u2019s generous. Softhearted. He doesn\u2019t like to let on that he has a helpful nature. He\u2019s on the gruff and silent side, but he\u2019d give anyone the shirt off his back. When we went through all Ben\u2019s things after he died, Rawley took the old clothes to the VA, but he washed \u2019em first. Bags full of \u2019em. He has a generous nature\u2014he gives a lot. I\u2019m not so much worried about that woman and her little girl as I am about Rawley. I hope they don\u2019t fleece him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to him,\u201d Spencer suggested. \u201cWhat if that\u2019s what happened? What if she\u2019s desperate and takes advantage of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I could try,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut it might be hard getting anything out of him. That Rawley...he takes pride in saying as little as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl looks about fifteen,\u201d Spencer said, frowning. \u201cHe must\u2019ve found them in trouble somewhere.\u201d He glanced toward the dishes on the bar. \u201cHe fed them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Two</p><p>Rawley drove Devon to the Walmart nearest his home. He parked in the big lot and looked at her. \u201cYour people ever go to the Walmart?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I never did while I was there. But I have some clothes.\u201d The clothes were in the backpack left outside the fence for her. She hadn\u2019t looked at them closely and didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d fit, but the backpack was stuffed with things for her escape.</p><p>He reached up to the sun visor overhead and pulled out a ball cap. \u201cTuck that braid up in this,\u201d he said. \u201cGet yourself a few things, grab some stuff for Mercy. Get yourself any other lady things you might need. Things no sixty-three-year-old bachelor would ever have laying around. I\u2019ll get us some groceries. We\u2019ll try to be quick and not make a stir\u2014don\u2019t want you to give yourself away. Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, tucking up her braid. \u201cI have forty dollars,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried. I know you\u2019re suspicious of me and of everybody, and rightly so. But you\u2019re not a prisoner, and even if you decide you can\u2019t stick around you\u2019ll want to stay clear of that camp. You shouldn\u2019t look like you came from there. And you don\u2019t have to run off in the night, all you have to do is say you need a ride somewhere and I\u2019ll take you. Hang on to your forty dollars. You\u2019ll need it, I figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there by choice,\u201d she revealed. Until she wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s your choice not to be there now. Let\u2019s just get \u2019er done. Then you can relax and get a little rest.\u201d</p><p>As for not making a stir, the second they walked in the door, little Mercy used her loudest voice to look around and say, \u201cMama! What is this place?\u201d</p><p>It took Devon a second to recover, but recover she did. She pulled Mercy\u2019s little hand and said, \u201cJust a very big store, honey. Now please use your very quiet voice and come with me.\u201d At least Mercy hadn\u2019t called her Sister Devon. That was the way Jacob liked it; no one was a mother or a father, a husband or a wife\u2014they were all brothers and sisters. Which made his behavior seem pretty damned incestuous.</p><p>Of course Devon remembered visiting a Walmart\u2014it\u2019s not as though she\u2019d forgotten her life before the family. She grabbed her daughter\u2019s hand and a cart and sped through the women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes. Two pairs of jeans, a pair of shorts, two shirts, socks, underwear, tennis shoes. She bought the exact same items for Mercy. She added two hoodies, in case they had to flee in the night, and then a few incidentals including brushes, combs and toothbrushes. And\u2014because he was right\u2014she bought a pair of scissors. She had to stop looking like one of them.</p><p>She met Rawley by the checkout. Her heart was racing. So, here she was with a scruffy old guy who had given her a ride and now wanted to help her even more and just by the look of him alone she should be worried. But the tall, handsome, soft-spoken Jacob with the ready, welcoming smile, who had so much to offer when she was in need, had never worried her for a moment. And he was the one she should have been worried about!</p><p>In his cart Rawley had groceries and... She looked closely. He had a safety seat for Mercy for the truck. It was an old truck and the cab was small, but it had seat belts. She was touched beyond words. That safety seat meant so much more to her than all Jacob\u2019s promises.</p> <p>The new seat had to be strapped in by the door and there were no seat belts for the middle seat. She had to sit next to Rawley without belts while Mercy rode in the passenger seat. Still, it was better than walking or hitching.</p><p>Had it been possible, she would have held her breath all the way to Rawley Goode\u2019s house. She kept telling herself she was safer in this old man\u2019s truck, or in his home, than she would\u2019ve been had she stayed with the family at the compound. She kept telling herself this was safer than hitching rides. Despite her racing imagination there was something she had not been prepared for. When they pulled into the driveway of a small brick home in a neat little neighborhood, she felt a wave of nostalgia wash over her. It was like the house she\u2019d grown up in. When they went inside, she stopped right inside the door, right in the little living room, and almost collapsed in relief and emotion. This could be Aunt Mary\u2019s place! The furniture was different but probably just as old, complete with those familiar doilies on the tabletops and arms of the Queen Anne chairs and sofa. It was small, the rug over the hardwood floor threadbare, the wood furniture distressed but polished. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>She put Mercy on her feet. \u201cMama, where\u2019s the kids?\u201d</p><p>Devon got down on one knee. She put the bags she carried along with her backpack against the wall. \u201cWe\u2019re having a vacation. And I think you need a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a bacation,\u201d Mercy whined.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice. We have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to has to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Devon said firmly. \u201cStop right now.\u201d Then she hugged her close.</p> <p>Rawley took the groceries straight to the kitchen and began putting things away. Devon just waited by the door, holding Mercy\u2019s hand, afraid to invade the house. Momentarily he was back, handing her a slip of paper. \u201cThere\u2019s two bedrooms upstairs and you\u2019ll know which one is mine\u2014it\u2019s lookin\u2019 mighty lived in. There\u2019s food in the kitchen and I ain\u2019t savin\u2019 nothing for later\u2014it\u2019s all open season for you and Mercy. I eat at the bar and clean up dishes before coming home so you won\u2019t see me till eight or so. This here\u2019s a number for my phone.\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person to get it. I mean, Cooper has it, but only because he bought me the phone in the first place\u2014he got tired of me never checkin\u2019 in. You just call if you need something, or if something changes with you, or if... I don\u2019t expect anyone will bother you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cI could stay, Cooper wouldn\u2019t mind. But if I was you, I\u2019d still be nervous and me gone will give you a chance to think. Check over the place. Rest. Eat. Get comfortable. Pull the tags off your clothes. Nap. Whatever you need to do.\u201d He opened the door. \u201cThere\u2019s another room up there. It\u2019s where I keep the TV. Extra blankets in the hall closet. Towels and that stuff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we should wash off the road,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at his watch. \u201cYou got hours to do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Goode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Rawley,\u201d he said. And then he was gone.</p><p>Overwhelmed, Devon sat on his worn old couch, pulling Mercy beside her. Mercy. She had wanted to name her Mary in the first place, after her aunt. Mary had been failing fast the last time she\u2019d seen her alive. Five years ago.</p><p>Tears started to just run out of her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re free,\u201d she whispered to Mercy.</p><p>\u201cMama, where\u2019s the kids?\u201d</p><p>It was Sister Laine who had helped Devon find a way out of The Fellowship. Laine hadn\u2019t been with the family long, not even six months. And, unlike some of the women, she was very independent and didn\u2019t seem to get sucked into group thinking, nor did she vie for Jacob\u2019s favors. She was careful, though. Disciplined and obedient. Around Jacob she seemed skittish, maybe frightened, but there were other times when she threw Devon a secret grin and wink, or maybe a startled look. She didn\u2019t talk about her past, other than to say she\u2019d come from a bad place and that Jacob had promised her peace and safety. It was implied she had been abused by a man. Laine\u2019s story reminded Devon that they weren\u2019t all the same no matter how much Jacob wished it so.</p><p>Laine learned that Devon wanted to leave the compound and that Jacob wouldn\u2019t let her take Mercy. It was hardly secret\u2014Devon had been making noises about leaving once she first learned she was pregnant. But Jacob said no, absolutely no, because Mercy was his child. So, for several years Devon and Mercy made the compound their home.</p><p>They were gathering eggs one morning when Laine whispered, \u201cI know you want to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Devon said, hiding surprise, cautious in case of betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you want to go and if you do, I can help. If you turn on me, it will be bad, very bad. If you don\u2019t want to go, just ignore me.\u201d</p><p>But Devon said, \u201cHelp how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen carefully. On June 9 there will be a hole in the fence behind the henhouse, right over there. There will be a backpack with some clothes, bottled water, a couple of apples and granola bars\u2014look for it outside the fence behind a tree. At midnight there will be a truck down the road\u2014the lights will be off. The driver will take you over the mountain. He won\u2019t wait long. Go to the coast. You shouldn\u2019t travel Highway 5, it\u2019s too close to the compound and you\u2019ll be found right away if anyone decides to look for you. If they look, they\u2019ll only look as far as you can walk. Hitching a ride on Highway 101 is safer. If anything goes wrong, try to find a women\u2019s shelter and tell your story. As a last resort, if you have no other way to get help, tell the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy a last resort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Devon, once you tell, they might make a move on this place and everyone could be in danger. Jacob will fight back. So, only tell the police if that\u2019s the only way you can be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and said, \u201cI fixed it up at the Farmers\u2019 Market. I was planning to do it myself, but I think you should go first. I\u2019ll figure out something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could both go,\u201d Devon said, wondering if she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>But Laine shook her head. \u201cTwo of us and Mercy traveling together would be too easy to track. If you get in a fix, tell someone what\u2019s going on here. The moods, the threats, the little rages and the gardens. If you have to tell, tell to keep yourself safe. It is not safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was once. Or it seemed to be,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe now, I can tell. It\u2019s time to get the children out. I think you know that. Now let\u2019s find some eggs. And laugh at my jokes, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cYou have this one chance. Do it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s time to get the children out. Those words struck fear in Devon\u2019s heart and she knew she had to act. She had to take the chance that was being given to her. She had to trust Laine. But, once she had made her decision, Devon nearly counted her heartbeats until she and Mercy could escape.</p><p>Just as Laine had promised, everything was ready. And, before she knew it, she\u2019d done it.</p><p>Rawley got back to the beach bar around two in the afternoon. He walked in on one of the most unlikely friendships he\u2019d ever known about, and he\u2019d known of some odd ones since Vietnam. Cooper was behind his bar and Spencer Lawson was sitting on a stool facing him. This was a fairly new friendship. As Rawley heard the story, Spencer had been married to an old fianc\u00e9e of Cooper\u2019s and the poor lady died. She had cancer or something, Rawley recalled. And several months before her death, blood work had been done and revealed that their ten-year-old son, Austin, was actually not Spencer\u2019s biological son, but Cooper\u2019s.</p><p>Well, now, Rawley thought. That\u2019ll make or break a man.</p><p>But the men had worked it out. In fact, Spencer had just agreed to take a job in Thunder Point so both dads could live in the same town and be parents to one little boy. And ten-year-old Austin had the potential to be spoiled rotten.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rawley,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHow\u2019s your cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, she\u2019s okay. I left her to get a nap, relax or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you think she\u2019ll stay?\u201d</p><p>Rawley just shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t say. Might be she doesn\u2019t find an old Vet much fun to live with and just moves on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWell, what brought her here?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are sure the nosiest som-bitch I know. I don\u2019t have the details, don\u2019t really need the details, but I gather it was a bad situation or something and she needs a place to roost a bit. Don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m happy to give her a bed. She\u2019s got a kid\u2014you don\u2019t just ignore a kid. I don\u2019t want them staying in some damn run-down hotel all alone just because I\u2019m an old coot set in my ways.\u201d He craned his neck and looked out the windows to the beach. \u201cSpeaking of kids...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAustin\u2019s fishing off the dock with Landon,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI have to go look at a house in town, even though Austin wants to live in that RV next door for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t a bad place, as places go,\u201d Rawley said. Cooper\u2019s toy hauler had been operating as a guest house ever since he had finished off the upstairs of the bar into his apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for something a little bigger in the bathroom and kitchen department.\u201d Spencer laughed. \u201cNot to mention less sandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could train someone to wipe his great big ten-year-old feet, you could beat that problem. Have you noticed how big his feet are? Is that normal?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s normal on St. Bernard puppies,\u201d Spencer said.</p> <p>Leaving the men to talk, Rawley went to the kitchen. There was always work to be done\u2014cleaning, stocking, organizing. Now that Cooper had an apartment and a fianc\u00e9e, he stayed out of there. Cooper could clean his own house, do his own laundry. Cooper liked taking care of the beach, raking up, hauling trash, making sure there was no detritus that could harm people or wildlife. He said it gave him an idea of who used the beach and what they used it for. He maintained his stock of paddleboards and kayaks. And he spent a lot of time visiting with folks in town, on the beach, on the dock, in the bar. Cooper was a natural people person. Rawley had never been much for visiting.</p><p>Rawley kept himself busy working around the bar and in the kitchen till about seven-thirty. With the longer days there was plenty of sunlight left; Cooper and Landon could handle the place without him until sunset when folks tended to quit for the day, except those who liked the beach at night and enjoyed their fires.</p><p>His phone hadn\u2019t rung all day. He wondered what he\u2019d find when he got home. He had absolutely no idea. She was skittish; she might be gone. The place could be upended, valuables stolen...not that he had much in the way of valuables. But nothing prepared him for what he found when he got there. He could hear the TV upstairs and didn\u2019t want to startle her, so he called from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>She came to the top of the stairs and looked down at him. Her hair was cut right up to the nape, kind of messy-cute, falling over her forehead haphazardly. Gone was that thick mane that hit her butt. \u201cUp here, Mr. Goode,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, my God, I haven\u2019t seen TV in so long. We had popcorn\u2014I hope that\u2019s okay. You said anything. We didn\u2019t eat much. There\u2019s plenty left. But the TV\u2014my daughter is in a trance. She\u2019s never seen TV.\u201d Then she laughed and her whole face lit up. \u201cWell, she was in a trance and now she\u2019s asleep right on the floor and I\u2019m watching baseball. I love baseball. I haven\u2019t seen a game in years!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and remained at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cNo TV at the camp, I take it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo TV, no newspapers, no internet access, no phones. No distractions, no commercialism, no propaganda. At least for us.\u201d There was that grin again. \u201cOh, how I missed it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you find something for Mercy to watch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEvil cartoons. She was in heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten anything besides popcorn?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI scrambled some eggs and made some toast for Mercy. I had a sandwich, chips, soda...\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cSoda! It was so good! And then the popcorn. Should I turn off the TV now? So you can have peace and quiet?\u201d</p><p>Rawley smiled. She looked lit up from the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember being quite this pleased with himself. He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get my newspaper and a cola. I like sports. I used to watch with my dad before he died\u2014that\u2019s why there\u2019s two recliners up there. And you can watch the TV all night if you want to. It don\u2019t bother me. Half the time I fall asleep in front of the TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewspaper!\u201d she said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share it with you.\u201d</p><p>Mercy rarely asked about the other kids or the other sisters from the family once she was introduced to television and the undivided attention of one mother rather than six. They hardly ever left the house except to walk to the end of the street where there was a tiny park with swings and a slide, and that was just for a little exercise and fresh air. Every day Rawley brought them something new. First, a couple of toys for Mercy\u2014a baby doll with a diaper bag filled with miniature supplies\u2014this small child from a family compound didn\u2019t know about diaper bags. Then he brought some crayons and coloring books and bubbles. Next, some library books\u2014a few picture books for a three-year-old, a few novels he had asked a librarian to recommend for a thirty-year-old woman.</p> <p>\u201cClose enough,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>Then he brought home a laptop computer. He said, \u201cI thought maybe you might want to use this. It\u2019s an old one Cooper let me have. Do you know how to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to use a computer, certainly. We just didn\u2019t use the evil internet, which has probably grown to amazing heights in the last several years. And I can\u2019t tell you how much I want to have a look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t got no hookup. Cooper said to tell you to jump on some neighbor\u2019s or store\u2019s wireless\u2014and I ain\u2019t got the first idea how you do that.\u201d</p><p>But Devon smiled. She\u2019d have no trouble figuring it out.</p><p>For Devon, this time away from the compound was like sensory overload\u2014there were so many new ideas to talk about, and programs to watch and articles to read. She was in ecstasy.</p><p>Then came several days of rain in a row, which conspired with Devon\u2019s need to be immersed in the books, TV and computer. Rawley didn\u2019t spend quite as many hours at work but Devon and Mercy were so happily occupied it seemed he\u2019d barely left before he returned. She made a couple of dinners for the three of them and while Rawley wasn\u2019t exactly talkative, he was companionable.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s \u2019at computer working out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a revelation\u2014you can find out anything.\u201d Out of curiosity she checked out \u201ccommunes in Oregon\u201d online and found several references, but nothing really interesting. Compounds could mean a host of families, religious sects, cults and organizations ranging from non-certified health retreats and rehab facilities to known sovereign communities and anti-government separatists. She was fascinated and kept reading.</p><p>Then she found something that explained so much: a familiar name and story\u2014Jacob Glover. Glover? They didn\u2019t use last names\u2014they claimed there was no need. But there was a picture, and it was definitely the Jacob she had known. He was well-known\u2014he\u2019d been convicted of fraud in the past. He was known as the leader of a cult who had recently been investigated for fraud, tax fraud, conspiracy and kidnapping. Huh? she thought. Well, taxes...yes, that was an issue. She remembered that very well indeed. It was one of his favorite rants, taken right from his manifesto. What am I but a poor farmer? We eat what we grow; we own our land; we don\u2019t use any government resources\u2014we educate our own and we pay our good money for supplies we can\u2019t grow or breed or make. The only argument government has for our paltry income is our rare use of their roads! Property tax? For living? For paying our own way? I\u2019ll die first!</p><p>She remembered thinking that was a compelling argument, but it was one that would never work. As for paltry income for little supplies\u2014she was well aware that The Fellowship not only owned expensive farming equipment, but they also owned three black Lincoln SUVs with darkened windows that only the men drove. This could hardly be considered paltry by any stretch of the imagination. It was also hard to believe that the meager sale of apples, peaches, pears and vegetables brought in enough income for The Fellowship to purchase the equipment and the mammoth SUVs.</p><p>But kidnapping? There was not a chance The Fellowship could be accused of that! No one had ever come into the family unwillingly and if they ran away, Jacob looked the other way. At least he used to. When Greg had slipped away after just a few months, there was only sad disappointment. But when Caleb, who had been with the group for three years, left suddenly, Jacob\u2019s anger roared. All three SUVs tore out of the compound and went in search, a search lasting days. But when he wasn\u2019t found, the search was abandoned.</p><p>Then she realized that these investigations might be the reason Jacob and some of the others seemed to have changed in the past couple of years, becoming impatient and paranoid. When she\u2019d first become a part of the group, gentleness and ease had seemed to dominate their way of life. But over the past couple of years anger and even desperation seemed to creep in. I\u2019ll die first! The amount of time he spent writing\u2014some of the women called his writings a diary, some a manifesto, others claimed it was his new bible\u2014had increased. There had always been weapons that were kept locked up and managed by a few men, but they were for security and hunting, not because there was fear.</p><p>She looked up \u201ccult,\u201d though she knew well enough what one was. And she also knew that religious affiliation aside, The Fellowship was a cult. Synonyms were \u201cgang,\u201d \u201ccraze,\u201d \u201csect\u201d and \u201cdenomination dominated by extreme beliefs.\u201d Not always a bad thing, the L.A. Police Department was referred to as the biggest gang in L.A. They were but a group of like-minded people, bent on a single purpose. In fact, it was that alone that had caused the rift for Devon. She was no longer of a like mind.</p><p>In one of her last conversations with Jacob, right before Laine had offered her a way out, she\u2019d said, \u201cI miss my individuality, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want to be isolated and I don\u2019t want my daughter raised by six mothers. I want to pick my own books and music, read all the papers. I want to be a part of society again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if society is bad? Wrong? Dangerous? Greedy?\u201d he\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m here, then I\u2019m not doing anything to make it better,\u201d she\u2019d offered.</p><p>He\u2019d sighed deeply. Painfully. \u201cThis breaks my heart, but maybe it\u2019s for the best, Devon. You\u2019ve never really wanted to be a part of this, one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always did my share! I taught the children, helped with farming and ranching, tended animals\u2014I did everything everyone else did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She bit her lip and looked down, astonished that he could make her feel guilty over a purely righteous act. Once she\u2019d realized she had conceived Mercy and that Jacob had children with other women in The Fellowship, that other women in their group visited his bed frequently, she didn\u2019t want to be a part of that group. She wanted a partner, not a never-ending family. When she\u2019d made love to him, she had foolishly believed he loved only her, that he held the other women as sisters, family members, not lovers. He led her to believe that. \u201cThere were too many women. It wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a few, and we were all of one family, one mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI was of a different mind. I will only have one intimate partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our way,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably best that I separate now,\u201d she said. \u201cI gave my promised two years. In fact I gave more than two. I was committed and loyal even if I didn\u2019t agree with everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cFine, then. You really don\u2019t fit anymore. You hold yourself slightly above the rest of us, as if you\u2019re better.\u201d</p><p>Shocked and hurt, she\u2019d blurted, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one here who holds yourself above the rest of us!\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019d slapped her. He glared at her and was so angry. When she\u2019d first come to this family, he was so gentle, so tolerant. But lately he\u2019d become so short-tempered and his controlling nature was skyrocketing. \u201cI think as the man who founded this Fellowship and works every day to hold it together and protect it, I can be afforded some respect!\u201d</p><p>It was a black day that burned in her memory. That had been a year before she\u2019d finally left.</p><p>She read on about Jacob. Investigated and interviewed for allegations of kidnapping and human trafficking.</p><p>She thought she knew what human trafficking was, but looked it up just the same. The recruitment of human beings by means of kidnapping, coercion or purchase for the purpose of exploitation, usually for labor or commercial sex trade....</p><p>And she knew. She just had never thought of women over twenty-one who went willingly being the victims of human trafficking\u2014she\u2019d always assumed underage prostitutes or child laborers in dingy, dangerous factories were the kinds of people who would be the victims of human trafficking.</p> <p>Jacob had picked her up outside a shelter in Seattle, Washington. He\u2019d invested an hour in conversation with her learning that she was alone, that she longed for a family and was needy, afraid and desperate. She also fit his profile of wanting fair-skinned and blue-eyed members for his group. He treated them all so sweetly and provided a shelter that was clean and had plentiful food. She was introduced to a few other women who\u2019d joined the group for the same reason she had. They all worked hard to sustain it and to make it a success. Then they were all stripped of their identities\u2014driver\u2019s licenses, social security cards and other personal effects stored away...or perhaps destroyed.</p><p>And they all loved him. At one time, even Devon had had a deep love for him, or perhaps it was gratitude. Sometimes some of them joked behind his back in whispers: He\u2019s penning a new bible, you know.</p><p>Devon remembered Laine\u2019s words to her. Tell if you have to, Laine had said. Tell about the gardens.</p><p>While it was never discussed openly, they all knew that Jacob and the family financed their plentiful compound by their special gardens. No matter how well their organic gardens produced, the bounty of fresh fruit and vegetables was not enough to generate the kind of income needed to keep The Fellowship going. There were a couple of gardens that were kept concealed in a couple of warehouses. They used grow lights run on generators, going twenty-four hours a day and tended by only a few men. Devon had been a member of The Fellowship for a couple of years before she knew about their special cash crop\u2014it was marijuana.</p><p>Jacob explained it to her by saying, \u201cWe are only growing medicinal herbs that the government wants to regulate. If they find out what we are doing they\u2019ll take it all away. Strip us of everything. But it\u2019s harmless and helpful and some states have even passed laws making it legal, which this state will eventually do, as well. Then, they\u2019ll try to tax it to the moon. We have to grow our herbs in secret. The government would love to steal from us, which is not their right.\u201d</p><p>Brother Jacob was a drug dealer. His cult, his Fellowship, was a cover. That\u2019s why he kept the members close by, and why he had children with them knowing that would keep them tied to him.</p> <p>Although there was nothing in her research to indicate he was being investigated for running and operating a grow-op, Devon knew the feds must be getting closer. It would explain his behavior\u2014Jacob was now paranoid.</p><p>Three</p><p>Lieutenant Commander Sarah Dupre hadn\u2019t worn her diamond engagement ring to work when she\u2019d first gotten it. Rings on the flight line were a good way to lose a finger, for one thing. As well, she didn\u2019t want any of her coworkers figuring her out, for another. But the day her deadline for accepting or rejecting the orders that would ship her to a Florida Coast Guard Station expired, she wore the beautiful ring to work. She had written the two letters\u2014one, rejecting the assignment and two, resigning her commission and leaving the Coast Guard.</p><p>Her boss, Commander Buzz Bachman, accepted the letters for his files, though Sarah would send both to the command HR department herself.</p><p>\u201cGonna do it, huh?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m all that surprised. But what\u2019s next for you?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when she thrust out her left hand, diamond glittering on the fourth finger.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d he said. \u201cThrowing us over for a man? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that,\u201d she warned him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was a rash or quick decision. And I think he\u2019s a pretty good bet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, hell, I like Cooper all right, but what are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him and shook her head. \u201cAs soon as the Coast Guard approves my separation, I\u2019m going to take a vacation. At least through footfall season. And until we get Landon settled on a college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d Buzz asked.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig bash?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI had a big bash when I married Derek, and that didn\u2019t take. I think it\u2019ll be small, quiet and private. But we\u2019re still talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I shouldn\u2019t stand by the mailbox, waiting for my invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing personal...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the boys are going to want to give you a bachelor party.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at herself. \u201cI know it\u2019s not immediately apparent in this flight suit, but I\u2019m actually a girl.\u201d</p><p>Buzz grinned at her. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t stopped us in the past. Now get out of here. Go tell lover-boy you put your papers in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my exact plan,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sarah drove past the turnoff to the town of Thunder Point and her house and drove the long way to Cooper\u2019s bar on the other side of the beach, parking in the rear. When she walked in, he was moving the mop around the floor, something that needed to be done frequently, given all the sand that came in on the feet of friends and customers. He stopped abruptly and just smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see this every day,\u201d he said. He leaned the mop against the wall and grabbed her against him. He gave her a hearty kiss, holding her tightly. He shook his head and smiled. \u201cI flew helicopters for a living for fifteen years and you\u2019re the only pilot I ever wanted to peel a flight suit off of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it, Cooper,\u201d she said. \u201cYou better not change your mind. I put in my papers.\u201d</p><p>His grin deepened. \u201cWell, now. You do realize there\u2019s no exit date on the next deal you sign up for. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not get sick of me, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me at least try,\u201d he said, going after her lips again.</p><p>A noise behind them didn\u2019t do anything to disrupt their very passionate kiss. Then seventeen-year-old Landon said, \u201cLet\u2019s remember the rules, folks. Safety first. I hope we don\u2019t have to have another one of those talks.\u201d</p><p>Sarah couldn\u2019t help but laugh against Cooper\u2019s lips\u2014Landon was echoing her constant reminder. Landon, big, strong, beautiful and in a serious relationship with a wonderful seventeen-year-old girl who happened to be the town deputy\u2019s daughter, could easily be considered high-risk by his older sister. And of course Landon constantly chided her for her mothering. \u201cIs he too big to spank?\u201d she asked against Cooper\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cWell...by you,\u201d Cooper said softly.</p><p>Again she laughed, leaning her forehead against Cooper\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAt this moment, I am obscenely happy. Please don\u2019t screw this up or dump me or cheat on me or divorce me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, letting go of her. He turned her toward her brother.</p><p>\u201cRule number two,\u201d Landon lectured, mimicking her again. \u201cDiscretion. We don\u2019t want to embarrass people with our PDA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were alone, actually,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, how about giving me a beer? I won\u2019t turn you in for serving me. I\u2019m celebrating. I did it\u2014I put in my papers. I\u2019m getting out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, are you kidding me? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? I told you I was going to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you like being the boss of things.\u201d He pulled a bottle of beer out of the cooler and popped the top. He handed it to his sister. \u201cCooper, we are in trouble here. We should plan a strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, kid. I like it when she bosses me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so whipped. What are the rest of us men gonna think, you letting a woman get the upper hand like this? You should be ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Cooper grabbed his mop. \u201cI guess Eve would never get away with that, huh?\u201d he said, mopping.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Landon said with a big smile. \u201cEve is so not my sister. And when Eve is happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Rawley came into the bar with a rack of glasses, silently sliding them under the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rawley, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cYour cousin still around?\u201d</p><p>Rawley stopped short as if he had to think about that. \u201cHuh? Oh. Yeah. Still at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot crowding you, huh?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cBeen a couple of weeks now, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Maybe ten days or so,\u201d he said. \u201cShe don\u2019t bother me none. Kinda nice, to tell the truth. Remember, I had my dad full-time for years\u2014a young woman and little child don\u2019t take half the care my dad did. She helps out around the place. I haven\u2019t done a load of dirty clothes since she\u2019s been here. Besides, she doesn\u2019t know where she wants to go yet. She said she likes it around here. Well, she likes Elmore, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s she from, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeattle. But I don\u2019t think she wants to go back there. Bad memories, I gather. She\u2019s been talking about getting work. Hard deal when you have a kid. And there ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 in Elmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of work?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly Rawley seemed to light up. Shine. \u201cShe can do all kinda things. Cooking, cleaning, office work, you name it. She got herself some college degree right before she got in a relationship that didn\u2019t work out. She studied education. She was gonna be a teacher for the real little kids, or something like that. I guess that\u2019s what makes her such a good mom. She\u2019s a fine mother. That little Mercy\u2014she\u2019s something. Real smart, real nosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Rawley, I think you like having them around,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>Rawley shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I never thought I\u2019d know what it felt like to be a grandpa.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cI don\u2019t hate it.\u201d Then he turned and went back into the kitchen.</p><p>Sarah, Landon and Cooper exchanged smiles.</p><p>Rawley brought a second rack of clean glasses into the bar and Sarah said, \u201cSo\u2014has your cousin looked for work around Thunder Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know about. You got something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But Saturday is Dr. Grant\u2019s open house for his new clinic. You should bring her. It\u2019s not exactly a job fair, but everyone in town will be there. She could talk to people. Find out if anyone knows of any jobs or any child care or babysitting. In fact, maybe someone needs child care or babysitting. Wouldn\u2019t that be convenient?\u201d</p><p>Rawley thought about that for a minute. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell her. But I\u2019m not much for parties or a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her, I\u2019d be glad to take her,\u201d Sarah offered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Devon hadn\u2019t had a typical childhood, but it had been a safe and happy one. Devon\u2019s mother, Rhonda, was a nurse who became close to her neighbor, Mary. Mary immediately took Rhonda under her wing knowing Rhonda was pregnant and alone. And since Mary was a day care provider working out of her home, it only followed that after Devon was born, Mary watched her while Rhonda worked. And Rhonda named Mary as Devon\u2019s guardian, should anything happen.</p><p>And something did indeed happen. Poor Rhonda was struck by a drunk driver as she waited at the bus stop on her way home from work one evening. Devon had been only nine months old.</p> <p>Devon knew Aunt Mary was not her real aunt, was not her mother\u2019s older sister. What she didn\u2019t know was that Mary waited tensely for years for some distant, unknown family member to appear and lay claim to Devon. She clung to that will and birth certificate with a miser\u2019s zeal, ready to do battle with anyone who might try to take the little girl away.</p><p>Mary was old enough to be Devon\u2019s grandmother, but she was a popular figure in the neighborhood, at their church and in Devon\u2019s schools. She was kind, nurturing, energetic and helpful, and Devon\u2019s friends had always loved her\u2014especially the pizza parties and sleepovers. Mary was a great volunteer and she took responsibility as any parent would, participating in field trips and fund-raising, and when Devon was a cheerleader or on a team, Mary had never missed a game or meet. Never.</p><p>Mary had always told Devon she had pluck. And that she was tough. She was a survivor. She said the same things even when crises like Devon not making the championship girls volleyball team, or junior varsity cheerleading squad, or having to make do with a partial scholarship, instead of getting the big one. \u201cI just won\u2019t make it,\u201d teenage Devon had wailed.</p><p>And Mary had said, \u201cGirl, you will rise above this, and fast. You\u2019re strong. Do you have any idea how many times people have to start over and make a new path? For myself, I can\u2019t count the number of times! I buried two husbands before you were born! Lost the first in Vietnam and the second to cancer! And just when I thought my life would slide gentle into old age, who comes along but Miss Devon!\u201d And then she would laugh and laugh. \u201cThe Lord blesses me with work and new ideas every day of my life!\u201d</p><p>So Devon had grown up with a devoted parent and a house full of small children who were picked up by their parents by five. With the help of scholarships and part-time jobs, she\u2019d attained a degree in early childhood education and had begun work on her Master\u2019s when Mary first fell ill. Very ill. That\u2019s when Devon had said, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough pluck for this. I\u2019m not that strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are if you want to be,\u201d Mary had said. Not long after her hospitalization and subsequent death came Devon\u2019s dark, frightening period when there was no work, not enough money for rent and the constant worry about how she would make it through the next day. She constantly reminded herself\u2014I\u2019m a smart, educated, hardworking person\u2014how does this happen? She needed a miracle.</p><p>What do you need, sister? Tell me. Maybe I can help.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t she love Jacob? Why wouldn\u2019t she take to his Fellowship? She\u2019d grown up helping to tend other peoples\u2019 children and all she\u2019d ever really wanted was a family of her own. Perhaps this was an unusual family by normal standards, but at least she felt safe and invulnerable. And she fell for Jacob, as did everyone else\u2014he was not only sweet and kind but also commanding. Powerful. Charismatic. There was little doubt in her mind he was strong enough to keep all of them safe. He was just the miracle she thought she needed.</p><p>Little Mercy was quickening inside her by the time she\u2019d been in The Fellowship for a few months. That was when she realized that Jacob was not in love with her\u2014he was in love with everyone\u2014or so he claimed. On reflection, Devon realized that Jacob was incapable of loving anyone but himself. As far as Devon knew, all six children in the family were biologically his and their mothers were all very special to him, all sharing his affection. Devon\u2019s heart was broken and she was suddenly disillusioned. Who would hold her up and comfort her and support her now that she was pregnant? The only people she had were her sisters in the family.</p><p>There was Charlotte, who used to act out the children\u2019s stories, making everyone scream with hysterical laughter. Lorna could bake like a demon and throw a softball like a pro. Priscilla, who they called Pilly, was prickly except on days following one of her visits with Jacob and for that the others teased her mercilessly. Reese was the oldest of them at thirty-five and though no one had elected her boss, she took on that role all the time, something for which the others were, by turns, either grateful or petulant enough to reduce her to tears. But Reese played an important role in the family\u2014she was the one to deliver their children; she was a doula and a nurse. Mariah was the youngest, shyest, an innocent twenty years old, and all of them tried to shelter her from Jacob...and failed. And finally there was Laine, who hadn\u2019t been with them long and was the most devilish, making them all laugh at themselves and at their weird family.</p><p>They squabbled, giggled, played games, sat up late with ice cream or popcorn and told stories, cried for their lost lives, raved in happy delirium for their happiness, spied on each other, sought each other for comfort.</p> <p>She missed them so. Even the ones she didn\u2019t like so much.</p><p>Mercy had been in no physical danger in the family\u2014it was a family that loved and nurtured the children. The real danger was more subtle\u2014having no independence, no identity, no clear choices; no view of the outside world. And then there were the men whose faces seemed to change regularly, the men who tended and moved the marijuana. The women all knew this wasn\u2019t right, that it wasn\u2019t just medicine, but as long as they were safe and happy they seemed comfortable turning a blind eye to the reality.</p><p>And then Jacob began to change. He seemed to move from the morally superior position in his rants to being angry, desperate and paranoid. Now that she\u2019d read the online accounts of the investigation, it seemed obvious\u2014he must have changed as the feds encroached and threatened his authority, turning him into a frantic and anxious man. That\u2019s when the idea of leaving proved to be so much more difficult. He must have been afraid people who left The Fellowship would sell him out. Devon had actually thought about leaving for a long time. The minute her baby was born, Devon thought about leaving, trying to think of what she\u2019d do, how she\u2019d manage, because she didn\u2019t want Mercy growing up in that compound in a pair of soft denim overalls and a long braid. But she didn\u2019t want her to grow up hungry and afraid, either.</p><p>And now here she was, back at the beginning, living with a grandparent-type figure taking care of her in a comfortable old house in an old neighborhood.</p><p>She poured herself a cup of coffee in Rawley\u2019s kitchen. Rawley and Mercy sat at the kitchen table together, coloring on large sheets of paper he\u2019d brought home.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mercy asked, pointing to Rawley\u2019s drawing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what that is? That\u2019s a boat! I have to take you to town pretty soon, to the marina and show you the boats. Those fishermen catch all the fish and crab we eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they catch dem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of these days I\u2019ll show you,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, pointing to a scribbled picture.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said. And then she giggled.</p><p>He studied the picture closely. Then he made a whole bunch of dots on the bottom of the drawing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>\u201cWhiskers,\u201d he said, and then he grinned at her.</p><p>Rawley looked up at Devon. \u201cRemember Cooper\u2019s girl? Sarah? You met her that first morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked about you, asked if you was still around. I told her you liked it here, that you were talking about looking for work. She said you should come to the new doctor\u2019s open house this weekend\u2014everyone will be there. You can visit a little bit, ask around if anyone is hiring or looking for help. And you can get a feel for if anyone seems to recognize you\u2014you\u2019re going to have to step out of hiding if you really do want work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I left The Fellowship\u2014I wanted to live in the world again. I wanted to read everything, hear everything, see everything. I know the world is hard and scary, I know. But, Rawley, prison is scary, too\u2014even if it\u2019s a fine, bountiful prison. I was a teaching assistant in an elementary school for a year\u2014the teacher asked the eight-year-olds, \u2018Would you rather be on a deserted island alone or with someone you hate?\u2019 And one little boy answered, \u2018With someone I hate so I\u2019d have something to eat.\u2019 We laughed so hard. But that\u2019s what a pure, controlled, perfectly constructed and protected commune can be like. Everything is thought through, down to every chore, every meal, the schedules down to the minute, even what we wore so there\u2019d be no competing or envy. Everything except what people feel. It\u2019s a deserted island stocked with your favorite foods, cozy shelters, protection and comfort. And the inhabitants eventually eat each other.\u201d</p><p>Rawley just stared at her for a long moment while Mercy scribbled on her page. Finally he said, \u201cI gotta ask. If someone recognizes you, are you in danger?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. Sometimes people left and it wasn\u2019t given any notice, like everyone just looked the other way. Sometimes they left for good, but others would stay away for a few days and then return. I didn\u2019t leave with permission. I was told I could not take my daughter away. But she\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Rawley thought about this for a moment, then he said, \u201cHmm. So, you want to try the doc\u2019s open house on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>Again the shrug. \u201cI have to do something. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon, if you need to get farther away, like way far away, I\u2019ll scrape up some money for a bus ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I should do. But I ask myself\u2014why would they look for me here? Why would they look for me at all? They\u2019re very busy\u2014there are the gardens just starting to yield summer produce, there\u2019s stock, there are children to tend. And they don\u2019t like spending time on the outside. Jacob believes he\u2019s being spied on by the government and by law enforcement, because they want his money and his property. I don\u2019t know how true it is but that doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob?\u201d Rawley repeated.</p><p>\u201cThe founder. The leader of The Fellowship.\u201d And then she gazed briefly toward Mercy.</p><p>Rawley seemed to understand at once. \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, you look different, Devon. You don\u2019t stand out so much. You can be my second cousin, twice removed, takin\u2019 refuge from a bad relationship, looking for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink that would work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna kid you, chickadee\u2014if someone from that camp of yours wanders into town and looks you square in the face, they\u2019ll know you. But if one of \u2019em comes into town lookin\u2019 for a blue-eyed blonde with a long ponytail, Thunder Point folks will say they don\u2019t know any such person. But, you could always scream if you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. And I used to run track in high school.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile. \u201cYou got a driver\u2019s license?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad one,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I joined The Fellowship, they took all my personal things and said they\u2019d be stored for me. When you sneak out in the dark of night, you don\u2019t get those things back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Guess that means you got no birth certificate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse not. But I think my driver\u2019s license is still valid. I just don\u2019t have it. And I memorized my Social Security Number. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re gonna have to get around, that\u2019s why. I been working on another truck\u2014one left to me. Eventually it\u2019ll be as fine as that old classic red job, but for right now? It runs fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>When Devon and Mercy arrived at the beach bar, ready to go to the job fair, she found Sarah and Spencer sitting on the deck with coffee. She didn\u2019t want to intrude, so she just said, \u201cHi. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Spencer said, nearly jumping out of his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s darling,\u201d Sarah said, smiling. \u201cGood cut\u2014you look like a young Meg Ryan. It must\u2019ve been hard to part with that long hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I was ready to let that go. It\u2019s more trouble than you can imagine.\u201d But she often found herself reaching for that long braid, running a hand down the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair, we have time. I was just watching Cooper down on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Rawley came out onto the deck. \u201cIf you want to leave Mercy with me, I\u2019ll show her how we catch the fish. After Cooper gets done on the beach and comes up, we\u2019ll go out on the dock. I\u2019ll make sure she has a life vest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be stuck babysitting, Rawley,\u201d Devon said.</p> <p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI know how to run the bar if anyone shows up. Austin\u2019s down there already, trying to empty the bay of fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think Landon\u2019s coming in,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cHe\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t swim, Rawley,\u201d Devon said nervously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not gonna swim. She\u2019s gonna fish. And she\u2019s not gonna eat worms, either. I hope.\u201d He reached for her hand and she looked up at his grizzled face and beamed. \u201cWanna catch some fish?\u201d he asked her. And she nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>Sarah got up, draining her cup once she was standing. \u201cI\u2019m going to run upstairs and change\u2014I\u2019ve been out on the bay this morning. I\u2019ll be back in a minute. Help yourself to coffee. Then we\u2019ll make a run on Carrie\u2019s catered delights at the open house.\u201d And with that she was gone.</p><p>Neither Spencer nor Devon said anything until Rawley and Mercy were down the stairs and Sarah had closed the door to Cooper\u2019s upstairs apartment. It was Spencer who said, \u201cRumor has it you\u2019re thinking of sticking around awhile.\u201d</p> <p>Devon looked at him sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s rumors about me already?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNot the scary kind, like that you dabble in witchcraft or eat puppies for breakfast. Rawley mentioned you were thinking about looking for work around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Of course. Well, it all depends. I\u2019m unknown here. If there were jobs, I\u2019m sure people who have lived here a long time would have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think so, wouldn\u2019t you? I\u2019m from out of town. I came here for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What job?\u201d Her interest was immediately piqued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the new Athletic Director and coach at the high school.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cReally, though, I\u2019m a gym teacher in charge of gym teachers.\u201d</p><p>She sighed audibly. \u201cA dream job,\u201d she said. \u201cIs your wife athletic?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away. \u201cMy wife passed away a few months ago. That\u2019s why I wanted to move. Austin and I needed a fresh start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cMy gosh, I barely meet you and I put my foot in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm done. And no, she wasn\u2019t particularly athletic. She liked boating and a little waterskiing, but that was it. And I have to give her a lot of credit\u2014she came to all the games I coached. Not sure she had fun,\u201d he added with a laugh. \u201cBut she was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must miss her so much,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere are tough days. I try to take comfort in her relief. She fought a battle with cancer.... I\u2019m glad that\u2019s over for her....\u201d</p><p>Devon swallowed hard. Yet another reminder that as bad as she thought her life to be on some days, here was a brave man who had weathered the ultimate storm\u2014parting with a loved one who had suffered.</p><p>\u201cAnd why Thunder Point? Just the job?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot just the job, but I\u2019m real happy about that. It\u2019s a surprise, really. I was looking for something in Oregon because Cooper\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re good friends....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting there. Cooper\u2019s a pretty okay guy. He\u2019s also Austin\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were Austin\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cWell, it\u2019s complicated, but here goes. We were living in Texas where I taught and coached. Just before Bridget passed away we learned that Austin is actually Cooper\u2019s biological son. Cooper was engaged to Bridget way back\u2014we honestly didn\u2019t know. So we did the right thing\u2014contacted Cooper, explained to Austin.\u201d He gave a shrug. \u201cSo it goes. Life isn\u2019t always cut-and-dried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d she said. Co-dads? Just what she needed\u2014another commune. \u201cAnd it\u2019s working out?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cSo far. What about you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, you. Divorced? Widowed? And why Thunder Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever married,\u201d she said. \u201cI was involved, that\u2019s about it, and I am no longer involved. And Thunder Point was just the town at the end of the road. And, of course, Rawley is here and he\u2019s been so kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd Mercy\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>Jeez, she thought. She\u2019d better get used to people coming right out and speaking their minds. \u201cUm, not a great father figure. I\u2019m trying to keep a low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. He doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he knows Mercy is with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he want you to come back to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, he was clear about that. We haven\u2019t been involved in over three years. And before you pass judgment, he has other women and children\u2014a veritable tribe. Now please, can we let the subject go?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her and she could read his mind. He was a single father; he would have opinions about a woman stealing away his child. He wouldn\u2019t understand, wouldn\u2019t be able to give her the benefit of the doubt. Nice as he seemed, she didn\u2019t know Spencer well enough to trust him with the truth.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sarah announced, coming suddenly from within the bar. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Devon said, standing. \u201cLet me wave to Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Sarah said. She let go a piercing whistle and everyone on the beach, including Rawley and Mercy, turned toward the deck. They all waved at each other.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Cooper taught me.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>When Sarah was slowly making her way up the road to Highway 101 with Devon in the passenger seat, she asked, \u201cDoes this outing make you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cJust take it slow\u2014it\u2019s not a job interview. I mean, if you hear of something promising, don\u2019t hesitate, but probably the most important thing is just getting a feel for the Thunder Point people. They\u2019re very nice. Sometimes nosy, but good, honest people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Listen, I was divorced after one miserable year of marriage so I\u2019m well aware of how hard it can be. In fact, I moved here a little over a year ago, before my divorce was even final. Getting your confidence back after something like that\u2014it\u2019s not easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon\u2019s not your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cMy younger brother. It\u2019s been the two of us since he was six. Ten years of being a big sister slash single mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You did it on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur parents were killed in an accident\u2014there weren\u2019t any choices about it. And it worked out\u2014more due to him than to my parenting skills, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s a great kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now? You\u2019re engaged....\u201d</p><p>That caused Sarah to glance at the ring. \u201cI wasn\u2019t divorced long when I met Cooper. I wasn\u2019t going to get involved with a guy, especially one like Cooper, but he\u2019s relentless. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy like Cooper?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><p>Sarah laughed. \u201cOne look at him and I took him for a player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayer?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he, though? Look like the kind of guy who could give women a real run? But he\u2019s not\u2014he\u2019s so committed, it\u2019s almost shocking. I was the one on the run\u2014he had trouble catching me. But I am now very, very caught. If you had told me two years ago I could be this happy, I\u2019d say you were crazy. Out of every storm...\u201d</p><p>Devon just listened, thinking players don\u2019t always look the way they\u2019re supposed to look. That sexy guy in the torn jeans and T-shirt who showed off his broad chest and muscled arms and shoulders is ready to settle down, but the one she fell for\u2014so morally superior and always quoting scriptures\u2014proved to be a bad choice.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t always look like who they really are.\u201d</p><p>Sarah pulled off the highway and headed for town. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, sister. I caught my husband banging the maid of honor. A stunning moment in my romantic history. So, this doctor\u2019s office, this open house, it\u2019s a small space. I\u2019ll be close by, even if the gathering spills out onto the front sidewalk. If you do lose sight of me, I\u2019ll be waiting at the diner across the street. All you have to do is say hello, visit a little and then let me know when you\u2019ve had enough. And you don\u2019t have to explain anything, even if you\u2019re asked. You\u2019re visiting your distant cousin because he offered, things are fine, you\u2019re just looking around the area, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, but in fact she was very grateful for this reminder. She didn\u2019t have to answer those difficult questions\u2014the kind Spencer asked.</p><p>Sarah parked across the street from the new Family Practice. There were some streamers and balloons and the front door was propped open. And yes, the office was small. It looked like a storefront in a row of storefronts, sitting right between the sheriff\u2019s department and Carrie\u2019s Deli.</p><p>The first person Devon met was Scott Grant, the new doctor, who was greeting people at the door. And the inside of his new practice was smaller than small. She counted room for ten chairs and a coffee table right inside the door, a counter with a swinging half door leading to the back. On the other side of the counter was one desk, some shelves, a desktop computer and a room divider that opened on the right side for people to pass into the back where there must be exam rooms. Though it was crowded, there was room for a small table covered by a festive tablecloth on which sat the snacks and punch bowl. This office space could easily be used for a dress shop, a greeting cards and notions store or a travel agency.</p><p>The next people she met were Carrie, her daughter, Gina, and granddaughter, Ashley. Ashley was filling cups with punch while Gina was putting out trays of bite-size sandwiches and cookies. Devon saw Carrie pull a cooler out from under the table and withdraw a storage container filled with a variety of hors d\u2019oeuvres, which were then placed into a cute arrangement on a large tray.</p><p>There was a little polite small talk. She met Gina\u2019s boss, Stu, who owned the diner; Gina\u2019s husband, Mac, the town deputy; and a couple of neighboring business owners. Having noticed a few people wandering around in the back of the clinic area, Devon couldn\u2019t resist. It was, after all, an open house. She walked behind the room divider and what she found was a series of cubicles and she knew what they were for. There was a treatment room with a bed, counter, sink, chair, supplies. Then another exam room. She found what must be the doctor\u2019s office\u2014there was a desk and shelves laden with books, and the door actually closed for privacy. There was what could pass for a very small break room containing a little table and two chairs, refrigerator, microwave, cupboards and sink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Then she heard Sarah\u2019s voice asking the doctor when he would be open for business. \u201cMonday. I\u2019m planning on being open Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday\u2014but I\u2019ll come in if someone needs me. I\u2019m keeping some E.R. hours in Bandon,\u201d he said, then laughed. \u201cI\u2019m working in Bandon to afford this practice. I still have some equipment on the way\u2014most of it is small and portable for now. I doubt I\u2019ll ever have an X-ray but I have a small lab and can do simple tests here. It\u2019s a very compact little setup. And I\u2019m planning to run some specials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sarah asked him.</p> <p>\u201cCut-rate school and sports physicals and, in the fall, ten-dollar flu shots.\u201d Devon smiled as she noticed his chest puff up a little.</p><p>It was sweet, she thought. Handsome young doctor, brand-new practice, good ideas for bringing in new patients.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s helping you?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing everything myself, so far. I need an R.N. or, even better, a physician\u2019s assistant, but no one really wants to work for a part-time practice, and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be a while before I can give up the Bandon E.R. to keep this place open six days a week. I can cover for a good nurse, but the paperwork is going to kill me. What I really need is a top-notch office manager, one who can triage patient needs and keep the forms moving whether I\u2019m here or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be out of work by the end of the summer, but I have no idea what a person does in a doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Sarah responded.</p> <p>But I do, Devon thought. It had been a long time, but she\u2019d been a clerical worker in a small neighborhood doctor\u2019s office. She knew how to keep charts organized and up-to-date, file insurance claims, schedule appointments, all that sort of thing. She wondered if she\u2019d find the courage to put herself out there. And just as she was considering this, she was snagged by a woman.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the new girl. From Seattle, I hear.\u201d</p><p>Devon looked around a little nervously and the woman laughed.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, there\u2019s only one new girl that I know of,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you like the town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hardly seen it,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lou McCain. That\u2019s my nephew, the big guy who won\u2019t leave Gina alone. Come with me, I want to know all about you.\u201d</p> <p>The woman turned, clearly expecting to be followed, and Devon did so. She wasn\u2019t about to argue.</p><p>Lou sat down on one of the chairs in the small waiting room and patted the chair beside her. Devon took the chair obediently, hoping this woman didn\u2019t ask difficult questions because she would be impossible to refuse.</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and laughed self-consciously. \u201cDevon. How do you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid, thank you. Now, tell me all about yourself. Where are you from? What brought you to Thunder Point? How long will you stay? What do you do?\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m used to dealing with middle-school kids and my nephew\u2019s kids, who I help raise. I\u2019m an eighth grade English teacher. It\u2019s made me very direct. Kids that age live by the \u2018literal minimal\u2019 law\u2014if you give them a question they can answer with one word, they will.\u201d</p><p>So will I, Devon thought.</p><p>\u201cI grew up in Seattle. I\u2019ve been kind of a...well, I was in a relationship, but I wasn\u2019t married. I was...ah...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still single at just a titch over sixty. Never married. However, I\u2019ve had a relationship or two along the way. Just maybe more than two. Never lived with a man, however. I\u2019m thinking about it now, though. My nephew just got married and Gina has moved in with us. It\u2019s very fun, but we are bursting at the seams. And I do have this wonderful... Oh, you don\u2019t want to know about that....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cBut where are you staying, darling?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cMy very distant cousin, Mr. Rawley Goode,\u201d she said. \u201cJust when I didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do, he offered me a place. And it gives me time to think about what to do next.\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m also a teacher, though it\u2019s been years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a degree in early childhood development. I\u2019d just gotten started on my master\u2019s when I was...sidetracked, I guess you could say. I became a mother.\u201d</p><p>Lou smiled. \u201cIt sounds like you made good use of your time. We could use a preschool here. Desperately so. But the town can\u2019t afford it and paying tuition would be something most people here could not afford. A couple of people have run the numbers but the bottom line wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is there a day care?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>Right at that moment a young woman entered the office holding the hands of two preschoolers. She was welcomed warmly and Dr. Grant came from the back to greet them. He seemed very happy to see them; he picked up the little girl and ruffled the little boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor\u2019s children,\u201d Lou explained. \u201cVery cute. They\u2019re three and four. And yours is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter is three,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now she\u2019s fishing off the dock with Rawley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay care, you asked,\u201d Lou reminded her. \u201cThere are a couple of women in town who babysit in their homes for working parents, but no official day care center. People tend to rely on friends, neighbors and family for that sort of thing. Will you be looking for a sitter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I manage to find a job, I will,\u201d she said. \u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d Devon asked Lou.</p><p>\u201cHere? A little over four years, but I grew up not far from here in Coquille and lived there all my life until Mac took this assignment. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told, he\u2019s the law in this little town\u2014Sheriff\u2019s deputy with a few other deputies that work for him. It\u2019s a little office, right next door. I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I didn\u2019t want to move, but I\u2019m glad I did. I love the school where I teach and I\u2019ve made good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they\u2019re looking for a kindergarten teacher?\u201d</p><p>Lou put a hand on hers. \u201cNot that I know of, sweetheart. But there are a lot of schools in other towns not too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to call around. I\u2019ve been at Rawley\u2019s house for almost two weeks. I\u2019d better either find a job or move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would you go?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot back to Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have any family there anymore. I think it\u2019s time for a fresh start. Somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fresh start as a single mom,\u201d Lou said with a warm smile. \u201cHow exciting!\u201d</p><p>Devon felt her stomach clench. \u201cExciting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exciting!\u201d</p><p>Devon just shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My future looks pretty uncertain right now. And before my daughter came along, I had some pretty lean times....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my life, there seemed to have been cycles\u2014for five to ten years things were up, then followed a long struggle, then things would swing up again. Up and down. I don\u2019t think life is very consistent. But the secret is knowing there\u2019s no limit to the number of times you can reinvent yourself!\u201d</p><p>As the little doctor\u2019s office got busier and more crowded, Devon excused herself and told Sarah she wanted to walk around the town a bit and would be back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a new or highly polished town, but it was pretty. Devon walked down the sidewalk in one direction then crossed the street and went the other way. She passed lots of small shops, taking note of a store that sold secondhand clothes. There were pots of geraniums hanging from lampposts, window boxes holding roses, and while some of these stores had peeling paint, others looked freshly scrubbed and painted. She peeked inside the diner, an old-fashioned establishment with booths and counter stools. All that seemed missing was a jukebox. She headed down the street toward the marina.</p><p>All she had seen from Cooper\u2019s was a marina with some boats, but it was so far across the beach she wasn\u2019t sure what kind of boats there were or how many there were. She was surprised to see big fishing boats, trawlers, sailboats, crabbers. She walked down the street that led to the boat launch and dock. There was a big restaurant at the west end of the marina.</p><p>She felt the beach pulling her. It was like seeing a movie from her former life. There was a woman jogging down the beach, reminding Devon she used to love running. She ran track in high school. She saw a volleyball net set up down the beach and a few people batting the ball around. Out on the water were a couple of people on paddleboards and one kayaker heading out toward the mouth of the bay where the frothing Pacific waited. The surrounding hills were steep and rocky and beyond this protected bay, mountains rose in the distance.</p><p>It felt like a pocket of safety. And people were living. Having fun. Being part of the real world where everything was not limited or controlled. Devon made up stories about them in her head. The woman was jogging on her day off; the paddleboarders were on a date; the volleyball players were high school or college students; the kayaker was... Wow, she realized it was Landon! He was working his arms and shoulders like a demon.</p><p>As she traversed the beach and neared the volleyball game, a runaway ball came close to her. She dashed for the ball. She flipped it into the air and served it back to the players with all her strength, sending it sailing a great distance.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d one of the boys shouted. \u201cLady, you\u2019re on my team!\u201d</p><p>Devon laughed gaily and gave them a wave.</p><p>In her former life, she\u2019d worked while attending school and she\u2019d lived with Aunt Mary. She had belonged to a gym. She liked to run, play summer softball with friends, go to ball games and clubs. She hadn\u2019t had much of a savings account and she\u2019d had to supplement her scholarships with loans, but that was the life of a student. It was fun and fulfilling and tense and pressured and exciting. It was normal.</p><p>In Jacob\u2019s world Tuesday would look like Monday had\u2014the only variable was the weather. They worked. They were not without their own kind of fun, but it was very odd and lopsided. No one pulled on their spandex and went outside the fence and jogged down the road. They didn\u2019t load up in a car and head for the movies or the library or the coffee shop. They were all in good shape because their work was hard and physical but it was rare that they took a break from work to throw a ball around. Sometimes they\u2019d get a little game of hide-and-seek going and let it go out of control. Most of their diversion was just a private thing between the women\u2014popcorn, stories, a food fight in the kitchen while making cookies late at night.</p><p>But not only was there very little change, there was very little possible. Jacob\u2019s plan was simple: everyone would be safe and well cared for inside his walls and under his domination. Big Daddy. The world would end, but they would be safe together. They did not need to think as individuals or to have personal goals; they would not experience the heartbreak or the triumph of success in the mean real world.</p><p>There\u2019s no limit to the number of times you can reinvent yourself!</p><p>The volleyball came back at her and she served it back at the players again, better than before, and they cheered! She danced around a little for them, arms in the air. And for the first time since leaving the family she thought, Maybe it\u2019s not a choice between either yielding my free will and identity to The Fellowship, or experiencing complete devastation and danger on my own. Maybe there is a place in the middle. Maybe she could have her own life again! Why not? Not everyone in the world lived in a commune run by a controlling, bible-beating, drug-dealing man!</p><p>She looked at Cooper\u2019s place and saw him. He was on the deck, leaning on the rail, watching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>It was time to go back. She turned and went back across the beach to town. She peeked in the diner and when she saw Sarah and Lou sitting there with another woman, she went in. She was introduced to Ray Anne, a small, compact blonde about the same age as Lou but so different in appearance\u2014bleached hair, sexy clothes and flashy, while Lou was attractive in a much more sedate and conservative way.</p><p>\u201cSarah, I want to talk with the doctor for a second before we leave. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, Devon,\u201d Sarah said, looking a little bewildered.</p><p>Taking a couple of deep breaths as she crossed the street, she went back into the open house. The crowd had thinned a little. Dr. Grant was talking to Mac, Lou\u2019s nephew. Dr. Grant held his daughter on his hip. She stood back a bit, a little nervous, until both men stopped talking and turned her way, their brows raised in question.</p><p>\u201cDr. Grant, I\u2019ve been looking for openings, for work, and as it happens I\u2019ve worked in a doctor\u2019s office. It\u2019s been a long time, just over five years, and I was only part-time, but I know how to do all the things a medical secretary does. I answered the phones, I\u2019m up to speed on HIPAA regulation, have filed insurance claims, scheduled appointments, all that. The doctor said I did a good job, but she closed her practice. It was just less than a year of experience but it was an ob-gyn practice and there are hardly any crazier, more demanding patients, especially with a doctor who gets called out a lot for deliveries, leaving people waiting. So, if you\u2019re looking for someone... I mean, would you consider me? If there\u2019s no one else? I heard you say you didn\u2019t have anyone and...\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d love to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you come to the office Monday morning?\u201d</p><p>She let out her breath. Even though she was well aware he might not find her qualified, she felt as though she\u2019d just shed thirty pounds! \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to hear more about your short career in obstetrics,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll be here by eight and stay till five or so. Anytime you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll, ah, see you. Monday. Yes. And thanks for letting me come to your open house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped in.\u201d</p><p>After better than a year of pounding the pavement looking for work in Seattle, followed by four years in a commune, Devon had a job interview. All those old feelings of vulnerability and fear rose to the surface once again.</p><p>She had worried all weekend about what to say, how to say it, how to talk about her work history with that long five-year gap and not come off looking like some freak or loser. She had learned during her struggle to find employment that many people thought the poor, jobless, homeless citizens were all drunks, addicts, lazy or lunatics. They didn\u2019t recognize how many of them were senior citizens, war veterans and other victims of the failing economy. The high rate of business closures and escalating unemployment rate made it tough for anyone to find work. Many of the jobless were well educated and hardworking, just like herself.</p><p>Though she was very nervous about her meeting with Dr. Grant, she was also determined. And it was Rawley who gave her the courage to see it through. He said, \u201cListen here, miss. If you find yourself a job, it\u2019s a start. And if you don\u2019t get the job, it don\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll go on the same, and you\u2019ll just try again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so kind to me, a perfect stranger,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLike I told you before, I been on your end of things and I have a lot to pay back. And two, you ain\u2019t hardly a stranger anymore.\u201d</p><p>She left Mercy with Rawley at the beach bar. Cooper gave her a lift across the beach to town first thing in the morning. She was waiting when Dr. Grant unlocked his office door. He was surprised and seemed pleased to see her. While he brewed some coffee in that tiny break room, they chatted about general things\u2014how she liked the beach, the town, the people she\u2019d met. She asked him how long he\u2019d been in Thunder Point and was very surprised to learn he\u2019d only been in Oregon for about a year, working in Bandon, and had found a house to rent in Thunder Point only a month ago. He had come from Vancouver.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m originally from Seattle,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>When the coffee was brewed they sat down at the small table and Dr. Grant explained that he needed someone who was comfortable doing a wide variety of tasks. He was looking for someone who could manage the office; field phone calls; keep ahead of the paperwork; schedule patients; call in prescriptions and keep the office open six days a week, even though he would only be in for four of those days.</p><p>\u201cI have two small children, my wife is deceased and I have another part-time job in Bandon. I need someone with good management skills to help me make the best use of my time, so that I can take care of my family responsibilities. And it goes without saying I need someone who\u2019s good with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who brought your children to the open house\u2014I thought she must be your wife?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cMy babysitter,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019d be lost without her. Her name is Gabriella and I\u2019ve known her and her family for a long time. So\u2014this job? Is this something you think you can do?\u201d</p> <p>Devon stood and pulled a piece of paper from her back pocket.</p><p>\u201cResume?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI made a list of all the things I remember doing for Dr. Stadler. Imogene Stadler, if you want to try to locate her. She closed her office and joined an OB group, which left several of us out of work.\u201d Then Devon detailed for Dr. Grant her extensive list of experience\u2014filing; transcribing; writing prescriptions for the doctor to sign; taking patient histories; processing referrals; answering phones, to name a few. \u201cThere were times I was needed in the exam room as a chaperone and I learned to hand instruments to the doctor. I also went through lab tests, put results in charts and generally made sure Dr. Stadler had what she needed. Then there were things that just happened unexpectedly\u2014the doctor\u2019s seven-year-old threw up at school and I went to get her. We had an elderly patient suffer a stroke in the waiting room\u2014and I swear it was nothing I did! I called more than one ambulance\u2014a good number of OB patients want to see the doctor to ask if they\u2019re really in labor. Never a good idea. If you have to ask...\u201d She shrugged. Then she handed him the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s everything I can remember. It\u2019s been five years.\u201d</p><p>He took the page and glanced at it. \u201cGreat. You appear to be well qualified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a degree from the University of Washington\u2014early childhood development. I was a teacher\u2019s aide in kindergarten very briefly. It was a private school and it closed when funding ran out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your goal? To teach again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did love it, but these days any job is a good job. And I also liked working in the doctor\u2019s office very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re just the person I\u2019m looking for,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not,\u201d she said, bolstering herself. She sat straighter in her chair and lifted her chin. \u201cI have a three-year-old and no babysitter. Yet, that is\u2014I decided to find work before I looked for a sitter.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to be a problem. I can help you with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That would be amazing. There is one thing I think you should know, though. My lifestyle before coming here wasn\u2019t...typical. I lived with a group of people for four years. I worked very hard, and was very motivated, but I was mainly a domestic and a mother. And when I left, I left with no money and the clothes on my back. Mr. Rawley Goode, a distant cousin, has given us a place to stay.\u201d Then she looked down.</p><p>Dr. Grant said nothing for a while. When she looked up, his face was gentle. \u201cI take it you left a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI left before it became worse, before my daughter paid the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep this between us if you like. But a word of advice, Devon. Never feel embarrassed about taking your life back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hire you for a trial period. I have to protect the practice, so I\u2019ll have to do a background check, just to make sure you\u2019re not a criminal or wanted or anything that would put us in jeopardy. You\u2019ll have access to prescriptions and drugs and I have to be diligent.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never even had a traffic ticket. And I never have taken drugs\u2014unless you count beer. I was a college student once, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d he said, smiling back. \u201cIf you check out and if you do a good job of managing the office, we\u2019re a team. All of this could take as long as a month. I\u2019ll start you at this salary,\u201d he said, writing a figure on a notepad, sliding it toward her. Six hundred a week! Her mouth fell open and she blinked. \u201cIf all goes well and everything checks out, I\u2019ll double your pay in a month.\u201d</p><p>Her hand actually went to her heart and she fought the urge to go limp. \u201cBut...but what about work clothes...I don\u2019t... I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a uniform. A couple of sets of nurse\u2019s scrubs. You\u2019ll need white tennis shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need an advance on your pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but... Well, to do a background and check my employment and college transcripts, you\u2019ll have to look for the name Devon Anne McAllister. I\u2019ve been concerned that someone is looking for me. I don\u2019t know that for sure, but someone...the man I lived with could come looking for me. If he were to ask people...\u201d</p><p>Scott Grant was frowning. \u201cWere you abused, Devon?\u201d</p><p>Clear-eyed and calm, she answered, \u201cHe forbade me to leave. We weren\u2019t married but he said I was free to go without my daughter. Of course I couldn\u2019t do that. I left without his approval.\u201d</p><p>Scott Grant folded his hands on the small table. \u201cYou\u2019re clear now, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s abuse? Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be a lot of things, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you talk to Deputy McCain about your experience?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I should try to get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I understand the law, you are, as the mother, the assumed custodial parent in an unmarried situation. The biological father has rights, and he can assert those rights legally. But preventing you from removing your child from his home would be considered custodial interference. Now, if you refused to acknowledge his legal rights, you would be guilty of the same. But this is a court matter.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe will never go near a lawyer or courtroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well. Before we start working together, I\u2019d like us to make an agreement. I\u2019ll help you as much as I can. I\u2019d like you to give me your word\u2014if you discover this man is looking for you, I want you to talk to Mac. He\u2019s a good man. You can trust him. He would know what advice to give you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI can agree to that. I\u2019d rather just put it all in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d He sipped from his cup. \u201cSo? Tomorrow at eight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t planning on working on Tuesdays,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow will be different. We\u2019ll call it orientation. Bring your daughter and we\u2019ll take her to my house together to meet Gabriella. I\u2019ll check with her tonight, but I have no doubt she\u2019ll be happy to take on one more three-year-old. I think the kids will like having a playmate. I think it will work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much she\u2019ll charge?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but Gabriella is very nurturing and reasonable. We\u2019ll talk about it with her in the morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOkay.

I promise I\u2019ll do a good job.\u201d She took a breath. She was exhausted. She smiled tremulously. \u201cThat took more energy than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>He stood as well, taking her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve had some struggles, haven\u2019t you, Devon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she said on a breath.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad I can be the one to offer you a chance to turn things around.

And now, at her very first try at finding a job, she was found acceptable. In fact Dr. Grant said \u201chighly qualified\u201d! It was beyond her imagination. She had tears running down her cheeks before she even realized it. She wiped at them impatiently.</p><p>When she was halfway across the beach, she stopped and looked out past the big rocks to the Pacific. There was a boat out there, a mere spec on the horizon. Sarah\u2019s brother was on his paddleboard and it appeared he had a young boy along for the ride. The sun was high and bright; the air almost balmy. She passed a young mother with two small children playing on the beach, a stroller and a little cooler beside her towel. Mercy would like that\u2014to be able to play and read and romp on the beach under a warm summer sun.</p> <p>And she thought, God, if I\u2019m lucky enough to make a life for myself and my child in this small place, I swear I will never complain about anything again!</p><p>She was halfway up the beach stairs when she saw him again. Spencer was just coming down. As he made to pass her on the stairs, he frowned and stopped. He reached out a hand and rested it on her shoulder. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>He must have noticed her tears. She wiped her cheeks and smiled a little. \u201cI got a job,\u201d she said in a faint whisper. She cleared her throat and tried that again. Louder. Stronger. \u201cI got a job!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cGood for you. Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the doctor\u2019s office. Full-time!\u201d</p><p>He just laughed, silently.</p> <p>She pushed past him and ran the rest of the way up the stairs and into the bar. There was just Cooper behind the bar, putting things away. She knew her smile was huge and her cheeks bright with excitement. \u201cWhere is Rawley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now. Looks like that job interview went well,\u201d Cooper said with a smile. \u201cThey\u2019re in the kitchen. Rawley is making bread with Mercy\u2014a first. I hope she\u2019s taken charge. He\u2019s never done that before.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, she darted into the kitchen. With a stool propped up to the counter, Mercy was kneading green dough, rolling it out and making snakes. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMercy said she was good at making bread and pie crust,\u201d Rawley explained. \u201cI thought green would be fun.\u201d He wiped his hands. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d she said in a near whisper. \u201cI start tomorrow. And unless there\u2019s some problem I don\u2019t know about, I can share Dr. Grant\u2019s babysitter. He\u2019s a single father with two little kids, so he knows it can get complicated for single parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s \u2019at feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rawley, you can\u2019t imagine.\u201d Her eyes teared up again. \u201cAll weekend I prepared myself for the inevitable\u2014that he wouldn\u2019t find me qualified. Or even that I wouldn\u2019t look the part. You just can\u2019t imagine...\u201d</p><p>He turned to grab his coffee. \u201cI reckon I can imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should...ah...look around for a place of my own,\u201d she said.</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow and gave her a half smile. \u201cThat so? Last time I looked, you didn\u2019t have no truck full o\u2019 furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something furnished,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that if you want to, but it ain\u2019t necessary. I got used to the two of you. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think we were cousins. Family. Ain\u2019t hardly had any family. My mother, she passed when I was barely a man. I had no brothers or sisters and, don\u2019t tell anyone, but there ain\u2019t never been cousins. And there sure weren\u2019t no woman who could stand a crazy old vet like me.\u201d</p><p>Devon just laughed. She put a hand on his arm, bringing a slight blush to his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re the furthest thing from crazy I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs \u2019at right? Well, don\u2019t tell Cooper. He thinks he\u2019s doing me a good deed, keeping me in the bar like this, giving me work because I\u2019m an odd one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Mercy loves you a little bit. I should pay you rent at least,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>Rawley sipped his coffee then put down his cup. He leveled old blue eyes at her. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, missy. I know how important it is to you to be independent\u2014you wasted no time telling me. What I\u2019d like most of all is for you to find your way. You had a trial or two getting this far, you have a kid...it\u2019s high time your luck changes a little bit. It would do me good, being part of someone\u2019s luck changing. It\u2019ll probably do me more good than you. That old house is paid off. If you want to help with food, you go on ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very much help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou should prolly help with electric while you\u2019re at it\u2014you burn lights reading half the night or watching that TV or chargin\u2019 up that laptop...\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. She tilted her head toward Mercy. \u201cYou\u2019re not having any issues with a three-year-old taking over your house?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment. He sucked a little on his teeth. Then he said, \u201cIf I\u2019d a had a normal life, I mighta had grandchildren. Maybe a little one like this here who wants to make green bread. Nah, she don\u2019t bother me at all. I get a big kick outta her. You about ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to get ready for tomorrow. My first day.\u201d</p><p>He wiped his hands on a towel and reached in his pocket. He pulled out some keys. \u201cYou can take the truck. You got a seat for Mercy. You should have a ride so you can get back and forth\u2014my hours just ain\u2019t the same as yours. But you\u2019re gonna have to take care of your own gas, and it eats a bunch.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned silent for a moment. \u201cBut how will you get around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I have an old truck I\u2019m workin\u2019 on that runs fine. Loud and ugly, but fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen if I use anything, it should be the old one!\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cNah, that won\u2019t work. I need that truck. When my work\u2019s done here and things get quiet, I work on that truck out back. I use Ben\u2019s old tools\u2014he left \u2019em along with the truck. It\u2019s the most sensible way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRawley,\u201d she said, stepping toward him. \u201cThis is too much. I could ride into Thunder Point with you in the morning and come home with you at night. I can stay busy till work starts or till you finish. And quiet\u2014I can stay quiet. We won\u2019t make any trouble or fuss. Or get in the way.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the keys at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a stick. Can you drive a stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRawley...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy needs her sleep and I get up at five. And she needs a meal, a bath and bed at night. She needs cartoons or some kid show. Let\u2019s think about her right now. And when you get a little money saved and get used to this place, maybe you\u2019ll find just what you need. For now? It\u2019s a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rawley....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat truck\u2019s a hundred years old. It\u2019ll work another few. I\u2019m done talking about this now.\u201d</p><p>Devon was a little hard on Rawley\u2019s transmission going up the hill on her way to Elmore. She didn\u2019t dare look in the rearview mirror\u2014she didn\u2019t want to see him wince or cringe. But once she got going, once she was on the highway, she not only did fine, she found it exhilarating. She felt so free, driving herself and Mercy, headed to a safe and secure place.</p><p>Once she got back to Rawley\u2019s, after giving Mercy some lunch and settling her with thirty minutes of cartoons before her afternoon rest, Devon was back on the computer. She was researching Oregon driver\u2019s licenses and laws concerning custody to see if Dr. Grant was right. She also looked at the Washington State records of birth and her college transcripts. Although she had a Washington driver\u2019s license somewhere, now that she was in Oregon, that license wouldn\u2019t work for long. To get her driver\u2019s license in this state she\u2019d have to take a test and provide documentation. And she was thrilled to find that all she had to do was apply to receive a copy of her birth certificate, which she could do online, if she could get a credit card.</p><p>Then she read about custody and found Dr. Grant had it right. Certainly as an E.R. doc he would have run into domestic situations from time to time, so he\u2019d learned all about this.</p><p>Devon came to several sudden conclusions. She had done nothing wrong by taking her child out of a commune in which the biological father was conducting illegal business. He would never seek legal help to get Mercy back\u2014not only did Jacob believe he knew everything, he didn\u2019t trust courts or law enforcement or government. Then there was his elaborate marijuana growing operation. Devon had no idea who he sold it to or how the business was handled. There were new faces around the commune from time to time and the men who lived there came and went with regularity. And, of course, one of these days Jacob would be caught and he would go to prison.</p><p>What she now knew with blinding clarity was that his \u201ccult\u201d was a front for his drug operation. It was a perfect distraction to have a God-loving, hippy-dippy, granola-natural, free-spirited commune that only appeared to live off the land and to do so modestly. Devon also realized that each woman there, including herself, had been targeted and recruited very carefully by Jacob himself. Devon shuddered at the reality of it all.</p><p>The next day Devon went to work and Mercy went to Dr. Grant\u2019s house to play with his children, Jenny and Will, watched over by Gabriella, the sweetest and most beautiful nineteen-year-old Latina she\u2019d ever met. Gabriella had known Dr. Grant and his family since she\u2019d been a small child. They had a good arrangement\u2014she managed his household and he paid her college tuition\u2014organizing their schedules to accommodate his work and her class schedule.</p><p>Devon quickly learned the routine in the doctor\u2019s office, which could be boring at times, since it was so slow. She scheduled a few appointments; improved his filing system; updated his computer files and even swept, mopped and dusted the office.</p><p>Devon brought her lunch from home but she took her coffee breaks across the street at the diner where she could count on seeing some of the women she\u2019d met. Many people passed through the diner and in no time she\u2019d become a familiar fixture. Sometimes, when it was just Gina McCain and herself in the diner, or maybe Sarah as well, she found herself revealing parts of her story.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when those women both chimed in with their own stories of bad relationships with men. It was almost like a rite of passage, surviving relationships that were not meant to be.</p><p>Spencer often found a reason to stop by the new clinic. She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised as she knew he was very curious about her. But he claimed he was just interested in how the doctor could help out with physicals for the members of the football team and the other high school athletes. Devon prepared a flier for Spencer complete with a price list. Scott was pleased with her initiative and Spencer took some fliers back to his office at the high school. He stopped by a couple more times to pick up more fliers. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been back to the beach lately,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the weather\u2019s been perfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working,\u201d Devon said with a laugh. \u201cYou know, you can take more of these fliers and then you won\u2019t have to keep coming back here.\u201d</p><p>He counted out ten fliers. He grinned handsomely. \u201cI\u2019m good with these for now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And he was back two days later for ten more. Although the doctor\u2019s hours were posted on the door, Spencer always seemed to stop by when Scott wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>In fact, a lot of the townsfolk stopped in from time to time. They wanted to know if the practice was going well and if Dr. Grant had patients yet, and if Devon was getting along all right. Between the diner and the practice Devon grew into the town, and the town grew into her.</p><p>After just a couple of weeks, Scott was impressed enough with her job performance that one day, out of the blue, he said, \u201cI\u2019d say your trial period is over and we can increase your pay.\u201d</p><p>As her new life fell into place, Devon grew more comfortable. She always kept her eyes sharp but never saw so much as a suspicious vehicle drive through town. She made a trip to the DMV, took and passed her driver\u2019s license test, and now had ID to go with the rest of her new life. Once she had socked away a thousand dollars in her savings account she indulged in a few things for herself. A blow dryer and a nice circular brush, and a few cosmetic items she hadn\u2019t used in years. Now the proud owner of a credit card, she bought some things online where they were often cheaper, but were delivered right to her door.</p><p>Along with the other changes, her appearance began to take on a new and improved look. She began to feel like the person she could barely remember.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, Devon,\u201d Lou McCain said. \u201cI knew you were a pretty thing the first day I met you. But, child, I love what you\u2019re doing with your hair these days. And if I\u2019m not completely mistaken, you look like you\u2019ve gained a little confidence.\u201d</p><p>A lot of confidence, Devon thought to herself. A large part of that came from realizing she could get a good, stable job and do it well but, perhaps, a larger part came from having women friends again. It was great just having friends to talk to about everything and nothing\u2014from failed love affairs, new romances, family issues, even politics. The best parts of Devon\u2019s week were those days she took a coffee break at the diner with Gina, Sarah, Carrie, Lou and Ray Anne. She missed her sisters at The Fellowship. They hadn\u2019t always agreed or gotten along, loyalties shifted and adjusted, but they had relied on each other.</p><p>When Devon found out Ray Anne was a real estate agent, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been very happy staying with Rawley, but I\u2019d really like to have my own place. And I don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet old Rawley is just hats and horns all the time,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>Devon laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s actually a gem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalks your ear off, does he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne-on-one, he has plenty to say,\u201d Devon said. \u201cAnd he promises we\u2019re not in his way and that we can stay as long as we like, but I think Rawley would like having his house back. Even though we\u2019re comfortable there, I\u2019d like to be closer to Dr. Grant\u2019s practice and Gabriella. In fact, just about every street in town is close enough to be able to walk to and from work\u2014that would be so nice. I just don\u2019t have much money. Do you ever come across a room for rent? Or a garage apartment? Maybe furnished? Or anything like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot often. But I\u2019ll put the word out. What can you afford?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSo little,\u201d she said. \u201cA few hundred?\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne said, \u201cWhew. That\u2019s going to limit the possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no furniture,\u201d Devon said. And rather than explain how she\u2019d been living, she simply said, \u201cI left everything behind, just so I could get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I did that once,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cMy first husband. I was young, he was a real ass with a drinking problem and I needed to get that behind me. I asked for nothing\u2014I just signed everything and ran for my life. I had to start over. It wasn\u2019t easy but, once I was on my feet, everything was mine.\u201d</p><p>Devon was quiet for a minute. Then she said, \u201cFirst husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had three of them. The first one was a drunk, the second was much older and more stable, and he was controlling to the point of being abusive, and the last? Twenty years older than I was and cheating with every young thing he could round up. He had a lot of money so all the girls in their twenties were lining up to give him a go. But, after the first marriage, I never left with nothing again. I figured out a few things. Now I at least have a nest egg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Devon said. \u201cJust when you think you\u2019re the only one in the world who had lousy luck with men...\u201d</p><p>That made Ray Anne laugh. \u201cWell, don\u2019t believe everything you hear, but I\u2019ve also had some good luck here and there. Maybe it didn\u2019t pan out to be happily-ever-after in the white picket fence ideal, but I had good times with good fellas. So\u2014how\u2019d you get hooked up with Mr. Louse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she said. \u201cI might as well have been wearing a sign that said, \u2018Hi, my name is Devon and I have nothing, no family and my self-esteem is at its lowest ever.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do it,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>Then, in the second week in July Ray Anne called Devon and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a duplex at the end of Sarah\u2019s street. It\u2019s for rent. It\u2019s small\u2014only two bedrooms. And I\u2019ll warn you right now\u2014it needs a lot of love. But it\u2019s only four-fifty a month. And everything in it works\u2014appliances, wiring, plumbing. I might be able to talk the landlord into a few improvements, but he\u2019s stubborn. He just wants to forget it\u2019s there, which is why I handle the rental for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see it,\u201d Devon said instantly.</p><p>The duplex was located on one of the higher elevation streets in Thunder Point. The street itself was a bit of a mixed bag with a few large homes along with many that were small and old. Some of the properties were pristine and fussy while others had been left to ruin. The duplex, unfortunately, was one of the latter. There were weeds in the yard, cracked and broken sidewalks and the place had a neglected air about it. There was a broken-down overhang at the front of the house and the view from there was beautiful\u2014Devon could see the entire bay and the mountains beyond. There was a speck off in the distance\u2014that would be Cooper\u2019s place.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little scary,\u201d Devon said, pointing to the overhang.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things I think I could get repaired, if only to avoid a lawsuit.\u201d</p><p>If the outside looked bad, the inside was a disaster. Trash, peeling paint, holes in the walls\u2014mostly from doorknobs that hit the walls when the doors had been swung wide. A few walls showed signs of suspicious holes\u2014as if someone had thrown something or punched them. \u201cWho lived here?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cFour nineteen-year-old boys who had to be evicted. Mr. Dunwoody\u2014and the neighbors\u2014would like a quieter tenant next time around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who lives on the other side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marissa Bledsoe, an elderly widow, a little on the weak and wobbly side. She can\u2019t handle much in the way of upkeep, but she\u2019s pleasant and good-natured.\u201d</p><p>Devon looked at the filth, the scarred hardwood floors and the chipped and peeling paint. The place even had a bit of a smell to it, of what, she wasn\u2019t sure. The bathroom was a horror\u2014there was a shower curtain that was disgusting and the tub and tiles were filthy. The toilet was older than she was, and there was a large chip in the porcelain tub.</p><p>The kitchen was almost as bad. Fortunately the newest item was the refrigerator and since the electricity had been left on, it was only dirty. Nothing had been left to rot.</p><p>Behind her Ray Anne was saying, \u201cI know you left your things behind but I can help you find inexpensive secondhand items. Once the floors are scrubbed clean, they\u2019ll be safe, but you\u2019ll need area rugs\u2014this place gets pretty chilly in winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he paint and repair the walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says if he has to put any work into it, he wants seven hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the damaged overhang?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I can talk him into that\u2014it looks dangerous. And the agreement reads that if anything doesn\u2019t work or leaks, he has to replace or repair it. But it\u2019s four-fifty, as is. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have wasted your time. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>Devon had been thinking about the layout\u2014a small but functional kitchen, a good-size living room with a pretty little fireplace, two nice-size bedrooms and a rather large, disgusting bathroom. And a view to die for.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ll take it!\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Midafternoons on a weekday were a quiet time at Cooper\u2019s. Perfect time to have a little sit-down, and Landon and Spencer were asked to join Cooper and Sarah for a talk. Rawley passed the four of them as they were seated around a table on the deck and he headed back to his kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us if you want the latest news,\u201d Cooper said to him. \u201cWe\u2019re having a status update meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do meetings. It ain\u2019t in my contract. I\u2019ll tend bar and serve. Anyone want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Spencer said, wondering what this meeting was all about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Coke, Rawley,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019at right?\u201d he said, and went inside. But he didn\u2019t come back.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that work out for you?\u201d Cooper asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou need better help around here.\u201d Landon leaned back in his chair lazily. \u201cJust give us the update,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd be sure you clock my time.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at Sarah. \u201cDo we have to be married before I can cuff him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>But Landon got a wop on the back of the head from Spencer. \u201cI don\u2019t have to marry anyone to do that. I\u2019m his new coach. Now can we get to it? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019re getting married,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWe know this already, Cooper,\u201d Spencer replied.</p><p>\u201cSoon. Two weeks from Saturday. Carrie said she\u2019d cater a party right here\u2014could be very nice. We\u2019ll have a quiet ceremony out on the beach,\u201d he said, taking Sarah\u2019s hand. \u201cThen have a little sunset party on the deck, on the dock, on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d Landon said, bored to tears.</p><p>\u201cLandon, how would you like your own home?\u201d Sarah asked him.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re moving out on me instead of moving Cooper in with us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been knocking around plans for the past couple of weeks. Sarah\u2019s going to be flying the rest of the summer. At least that\u2019s the way it looks right now. But she\u2019s short\u2014her schedule is already lightening up and they have a brand-spanking-new Lieutenant Commander on his way in to take over most of her duties. So we started talking to builders. And we\u2019re going to build. Right there,\u201d he said, pointing to the steep hill next door to the bar. \u201cNice big picture window, big deck, stairs to the beach, big kitchen. We\u2019ll be excavating around the lot, making room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to disturb the wildlife?\u201d Landon asked. Cooper had been trying to respect the wishes of the departed friend who had left him the beachfront property; Ben had wanted the promontory on the other side of the bar left to the birds and flora\u2014a natural preserve.</p><p>\u201cThe land between me and Thunder Point doesn\u2019t have any wildlife except beetles on it,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m going to develop it. At least some of it. I have to\u2014I need a couple of decent roads. That\u2019s the price of a house. And I want a house.\u201d He reached for Sarah\u2019s hand. \u201cSarah\u2019s going along with me on this, at least until she figures out what she wants to do. While she\u2019s having a little time off to think, she\u2019s going to be a general contractor. She\u2019s going to help me build us a house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>There was quiet for a few moments and then it was Spencer who broke the silence. He cleared his throat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier for you both, but what does this have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been hunting for a house,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou hoped to get into something with a bigger kitchen and bathroom before football practice started and you ran out of time to look. I think we can help with that. Consider it another temporary situation, but Sarah\u2019s place won\u2019t move in the wind, it\u2019s in town, and it\u2019s small but nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Landon said. \u201cI might get enough of Spencer at practice, no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou\u2019re not my dream roommate, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, let\u2019s talk about you having your own place,\u201d Sarah suggested.</p><p>Landon sat up straighter, but suspiciously. And hopefully. \u201cLike an apartment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike the toy hauler, where Spencer and Austin have been staying.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at it, thought for a moment. \u201cHot! Can I move it? Like somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>He slunk back down in his chair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s better than sleeping in the same place with you two, I guess.\u201d He glanced at Spencer. \u201cThey\u2019re embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor abused thing,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cYou have a terrible life. Your big sister is going to know how late you stay out and how many people you have in your \u2018apartment\u2019 until you move away. I don\u2019t know how you will live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpence, why don\u2019t you and Sarah run over to her house, take a look,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt might not be what you want long-term, but while you\u2019re still trying to figure out if this is the right town and school for you, it might just work. It\u2019s close to everything. Drop-dead view of the bay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you over in the Razor,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cIt\u2019s on a month-to-month lease and it\u2019s cheap. Three bedrooms, but the third is like a closet\u2014only big enough for a small bed or a desk and a shelf. I\u2019ve been using that room to store boxes of stuff I have no room for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Landon,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><p>When everyone stood, Landon muttered, \u201cI came this close to having a bachelor pad...\u201d</p><p>Driving across the beach, Spencer found himself feeling guardedly optimistic about this opportunity. He\u2019d been all over this little town. Some of the neighborhoods were quaint, some very nice, some pretty run-down and worn-out, but one thing was a constant\u2014property didn\u2019t become available very often. He\u2019d looked at several rentals and even a few houses for sale, but nothing met his needs\u2014they were either pathetic dumps or far too big and pricey for a high school football coach. And as a transplanted Texas boy, he was getting pretty well hooked on this Oregon beach and the lifestyle here.</p><p>As Sarah drove them up the hill to her house, he recognized the neighborhood. Yes, he\u2019d driven up and down this street a few times; it was a pleasant, well-kept area\u2014large pines behind and between the houses. Sarah\u2019s place was one of the smallest on the block, but as they pulled up in front of it, what really caught his attention was the view from the front of the place. From right outside the front door he could see the entire bay, all the way to Cooper\u2019s bar and beyond.</p><p>\u201cIf I were going to be here one more summer, I\u2019d put a small patio right here,\u201d Sarah said.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve figured out about this town\u2014it is all about the view and Cooper\u2019s in the catbird seat. And to think he fell into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, want to just stand here or go inside...?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>Right then Ray Anne\u2019s car pulled up in front of the house. She rolled down the window to wave a greeting, and from the passenger side, Devon opened the door and stood in the street, waving over the top of the car. \u201cSarah! I found a house! Sort of! Right down the street!\u201d</p><p>Sarah walked toward the car and Spencer found himself following. \u201cWhat house?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cA duplex,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of your street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat duplex is that? I didn\u2019t know anything was vacant in this neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old Dunwoody place,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cYou know\u2014it\u2019s looking a bit...needy?\u201d</p><p>But Devon\u2019s face was absolutely shining. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots to do,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cIt\u2019s past its prime. But it\u2019s a solid little place with a very nice neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything to do that I can\u2019t handle,\u201d Devon said, beaming. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get this lucky! This fast! It\u2019s going to be wonderful. We\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne just shook her head and laughed. \u201cOh, if only all my clients were this easy to please. Have a great day. We have to go find Devon a bed.\u201d</p><p>Spencer watched as they drove away. The first time he saw Devon, he thought she was cute. As the days became weeks, she grew more beautiful to him. Striking, in fact. And that laugh\u2014it cut right through him. He couldn\u2019t seem to stay away from her and there was no logic to it.</p><p>He shook himself. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look inside, Sarah,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case I haven\u2019t said so, this is really nice of you.\u201d</p><p>She unlocked the front door and entered, looking at him over her shoulder. \u201cWe have to look out for each other. We\u2019re combining families here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t all good. He had no regrets about coming to Thunder Point. It was a great move for a lot of reasons and he was more than a little anxious to meet and start working with his colleagues and the team. Everyone he knew was growing deeper connections\u2014Austin had gained a second father and soon, a stepmom and stepbrother. Cooper had gained a son and would soon add a wife and brother to the mix. Sarah and Landon were expanding their intimate circle. But in the midst of all these people, Spencer was alone.</p><p>He missed his wife. The past few years she\u2019d been so sick, but he often missed the girl he\u2019d married. It had been so long since he\u2019d seen or held that girl.</p><p>The house was unremarkable, but had so many of the things he wanted\u2014a large kitchen, a comfortably big bathroom, a living room with a fireplace, a backyard, a view. It was a simple house. Nothing flashy. Not the kind of house one aspires to. Not what he\u2019d build if he could. Certainly not what Cooper was going to build next to Ben &amp; Cooper\u2019s.</p><p>And yet it was perfect. Just what he and Austin needed.</p><p>\u201cThis is great, Sarah,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and asked, \u201cHow many houses do I need?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cTwo weeks, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a hard sell,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cooper trying to tie you up before you can change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cHe wants to get married on the beach before he brings heavy equipment in to excavate the hillside for building. He doesn\u2019t really know how much of a mess that\u2019s going to make. Getting him to wait two weeks was a challenge. Cooper\u2019s been married in his head for a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...kinda sweet. Who would figure Cooper for sweet?\u201d Spencer dropped a hand and gave a pat to the head of Ham, who had come to greet them. \u201cI guess the dog won\u2019t stay with the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper would be devastated. He might be marrying me for the dog. But I assure you, some of the dog hair will probably stay with the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne phone call gets my household goods en route. You want to think about this?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m ready to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to put all this stuff?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to store a few things, put a couple of things in the RV or Cooper\u2019s loft apartment and then get rid of a lot. Cooper has me convinced my new house deserves some new furniture. Need anything?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI have more coming than I need as it is. Maybe we\u2019ll have a big yard sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>When they were back in the Razor, he said, \u201cDrive me past that place Devon just rented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m curious, too. I\u2019ve driven by it before, but never thinking it would have anything to do with me or a friend of mine.\u201d And she whirled down the street, past a lot of perfectly lovely homes.</p><p>At the end of the street, Devon\u2019s new place stood out like a wart on a nose. The grass was tall and mostly dead with a few green sprouts here and there. The driveway was covered in brown pine needles and the windows were streaked and filthy. The other half of the duplex was neat, except for the lawn, which was also a wreck. But the driveway on the other half was swept and the windows were clean. But that didn\u2019t help the overall effect much. \u201cWhat a dump,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cHold up a second,\u201d he said.</p><p>Spencer got out and went up to the house. He cupped his hands around his face and peered inside. Then he turned back to Sarah. \u201cWho the hell lived here? Hell\u2019s Angels? It\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cFilthy. Holes in the walls. Stains everywhere. Cigarette butts ground into the floor. A lightbulb instead of a fixture. It looks like a crack house.\u201d</p><p>Sarah came up beside him and pressed her face up against the front windowpane. \u201cEw,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s got her work cut out for her. It looks like a fixer-upper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was she so happy about?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this looks a lot better than what she had,\u201d Sarah said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s staying with Rawley, right? And he\u2019s a little different, but Cooper said he\u2019s dependable and a good man even if he\u2019s not the most talkative. And he has a good, clean, sturdy house with plenty of room for them....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always just about houses, Spencer. Maybe this represents more than that to her. You should ask her.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that for a second. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I run into her.\u201d</p><p>Spencer didn\u2019t run into her, at least not for a few days. He didn\u2019t go by the doctor\u2019s office or the diner. In fact, since seeing that god-awful duplex, he\u2019d been trying not to think about her. For something like that to make her smile, to make her happy meant her previous circumstances must have been so much more pathetic than she let on. And that made him just plain sad. It was crazy that a beautiful young woman with an adorable little girl had escaped something bad only to land in that disgusting hovel. It amazed him to consider the idea that she might see this as breaking free.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t get the girl off his mind.</p><p>He nursed a cup of coffee at the bar while Sarah and Cooper looked at their building plans\u2014not just for a house, but for the whole ridge that stretched between his place and the town, including roads. Austin was in the RV watching TV, laying around and eating cereal out of the box. Landon had taken one of Cooper\u2019s kayaks out on the bay for an upper-body workout and would come in for his work shift after that. There were two kayaks rented, two paddleboards, and since Spencer had been in the bar, six people had been in for coffee. Four of them took coffee cups down to the beach and dock; two customers sat on the deck and enjoyed the morning view.</p><p>Despite all this activity, Spencer couldn\u2019t get the girl off his mind.</p><p>Rawley came into the bar from the kitchen. \u201cI need a little time, Coop. You okay here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Rawley,\u201d Cooper replied without looking up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cCould be gone for a spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Cooper said, still studying the layout in front of him.</p> <p>A minute later, Spencer heard Rawley slam something into the bed of his truck outside. Then he was back in the kitchen. Next he was struggling out the door with a box full of stuff. Then he was back, then out again with a load of cleaning implements\u2014mop, broom, rags.</p><p>Cooper finally looked up. \u201cRawley, what the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The old guy stopped short, mops and brooms and stuff in his arms, and said, \u201cEvery night I beat Devon and the little one home and you know why? Cause she works all day, then takes the little one to that shit hole she rented. They eat a sandwich she packed up and then Devon tries to make a dent in the filth and damage of that house while her daughter either looks at her books or sits with that old lady neighbor next door. It just ain\u2019t right. I\u2019m going over there. See what I can do.\u201d</p><p>As if he had been hit with a cattle prod, Spencer was off his stool. \u201cI\u2019m in that with you, Rawley. Let me get my shoes and tell Austin I\u2019ll be gone awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your own car,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cI\u2019m putting in some serious time.\u201d And he was gone.</p> <p>\u201cCan you manage Austin?\u201d Spencer asked Cooper.</p><p>Cooper turned to Sarah. \u201cCan you handle Austin? The bar should be quiet. It\u2019s a weekday...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to go!\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed I didn\u2019t think of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we have a problem,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI can close the bar for a few hours, but we got us a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon will help out,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just tell him not to serve alcohol and to keep an eye on Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWhat does he get for that? Double pay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe gets me to not hate him,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIf we\u2019re helping out a friend, he can just suck it up.\u201d And with that, Cooper went out on the deck and split the morning calm with a piercing whistle.</p><p>By the time Spencer was back on the deck in jeans and shoes, Landon was coming up the stairs to the deck. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading out to help a friend,\u201d Sarah told him. \u201cWe\u2019d like you to keep an eye on the bar and Austin. Austin\u2019s watching TV right now\u2014don\u2019t let him get away. And just don\u2019t sell alcohol. Cooper will be back before five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat friend?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRawley\u2019s cousin,\u201d she said. \u201cDevon. She rented a house down the street from us and it needs...help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp because she shouldn\u2019t have to live in a completely demolished dump,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAustin goes no farther than the dock. In a life jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>They headed out in two cars and when they arrived the front door was standing open. Rawley\u2019s old truck was backed into the driveway with the hatch down and there was the sound of pounding coming from inside.</p> <p>\u201cNo moss growing under that old boy\u2019s feet,\u201d Spencer said as he stood outside the front door with Cooper and Sarah. Rawley was already involved in patching a hole in the wall with drywall he\u2019d obviously brought along. There were a couple of cans of paint sitting on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve we got, Rawley?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>Rawley looked up. \u201cBag the trash. She\u2019s got it in neat piles in each room. We got nasty kitchen appliances and while you\u2019re at it, pull \u2019em out from the wall and clean that nasty stuff under \u2019em. We got a bathroom that a vagrant wouldn\u2019t use. We got walls to paint, trim to scrub and paint, windows to wash. Leave the fireplace till last\u2014she don\u2019t need it this summer.\u201d</p><p>Sarah walked across the living room and peeked into each room. \u201cCooper, that bathroom is yours. It\u2019s awful. Spencer, why don\u2019t you help me in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Spencer took a look at each room. \u201cYep, Cooper gets that bathroom.\u201d And then he got started pulling out appliances. While Sarah worked on cleaning the inside of the refrigerator, he bagged the trash and threw it in the back of Cooper\u2019s truck. A little over three hours later, the kitchen appliances were clean and Spencer was washing the walls so he could paint them while Sarah got started on cleaning out the cupboards.</p><p>And then they were interrupted when Landon and Austin pulled up in the Razor with a cooler strapped to the back.</p><p>\u201cLunch!\u201d Landon announced.</p><p>Work stopped at once while Landon opened the cooler to reveal sandwiches and cold drinks. Austin carried a grocery bag full of chips and snacks.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with the bar?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cPut the closed sign on the door, just like you used to do before you had slave labor,\u201d Landon replied. \u201cWow, this place is a wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s already a lot better than it was,\u201d Spencer informed him.</p><p>After some serious hand washing, they sat on the living room floor in a circle, all of them, and ate the sandwiches. And then they went back after it with a vengeance. By four-thirty Cooper and Rawley were leaving to take care of the evening crowd down on the beach. Sarah was looking over her handiwork\u2014she\u2019d cleaned all the windows while Spencer painted the kitchen. The floors were clean but ill-used. She scuffed a toe on the floor. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what rugs are for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, if Devon is interested, I might\u2019ve found a home for some of the furniture I can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been thinking the same thing,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cLooks damn good in here.\u201d Sarah turned full-circle. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk down the block, let Ham out and take a shower. See you back at the beach?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cRemember, I still live at the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for too much longer.\u201d</p><p>When Sarah was gone, Spencer stayed behind. He started to envision furniture in the rooms he could see. A table for four in the kitchen. A sofa and chair and bookcase in the living room. A toy chest. A blackboard on the kitchen wall by the back door for schedules or shopping lists. A thick rug in front of the fireplace. He\u2019d never been much for decorating; it had never mattered to him very much. For some reason he wanted this little nest to be safe and cozy for Devon and Mercy. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure what she was running from, but he wanted her running to something decent.</p><p>He could have left. He should have left, but he stayed. It was almost five when she arrived with her daughter. He went to stand in the open doorway and when she saw him, she looked confused.</p><p>\u201cSpencer?\u201d she asked. She was wearing her scrubs and tennis shoes. He backed into the house wordlessly and let her enter. She put her hands over her mouth in awe. \u201cSpencer!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He realized what she thought and said, \u201cOh, no\u2014I didn\u2019t do this. I helped, that\u2019s all. It was Rawley. He wanted to help out so the rest of us came along. They had to get back to the beach\u2014people start showing up, looking for drinks and sandwiches and deli pizza at about four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d she asked in a soft voice. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was Rawley, Cooper, Sarah. And I helped.\u201d</p><p>She looked him over. \u201cHelped?\u201d</p><p>He was a dirty mess. He laughed. \u201cI did everything Rawley told me to do.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around. \u201cMy God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bedrooms aren\u2019t done. Well, they\u2019re swept and mopped, but Rawley\u2019s got some paint for the walls. It\u2019s boring. It\u2019s just \u2018renter\u2019s white.\u2019 But I think he\u2019s finished patching walls. And if I could just brag a little, I hauled trash and painted the kitchen....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s immaculate. It\u2019s shining.\u201d And then her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys did this for me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re Rawley\u2019s cousin, so I guess we\u2019re all family. And it\u2019s not like I had to work today....\u201d</p><p>She looked down for a long moment, frowning. Just what she didn\u2019t want\u2014another extended family. She wanted friends. Spencer couldn\u2019t know how much the idea of everyone being one big family caused her to cringe inside.</p><p>Mercy came in the door carrying her books and her blanket. She stood there, oblivious. Apparently a three-year-old couldn\u2019t see the improvement. Then Devon lifted her eyes to Spencer\u2019s face. There were tears on her cheeks. \u201cDo you know how long it would have taken me to get this far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to understand this, but I\u2019ve had great kindnesses given me but the price has been... Well, never mind that. \u2018Thank you\u2019 will just never be enough.\u201d She wiped the emotion off her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDevon, I want you to stop right there. There\u2019s not going to be a bill. It was just us being good neighbors, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want you to think you owe anyone anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll probably want to start with that\u2014just \u2018thank you.\u2019 The rest of the bucket brigade is at the beach. I need a shower. I have to check on Austin, make sure he hasn\u2019t driven anyone crazy. I\u2019m going to take off\u2014I\u2019m really ready for a cold beer.\u201d He headed for the door and she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was glad to help out.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Devon drove to Cooper\u2019s to thank the rest of the cleanup crew and, as she thought about it, she had to acknowledge that there was a difference between people helping one another in a small town, and relying on each other in a commune. And she had so much to give in return\u2014even managing the doctor\u2019s office, she could be of help every day. She could extend herself the extra mile, making sure those people who called or came in received the best she had to offer.</p><p>Then she remembered something she had known long ago\u2014that kindness wasn\u2019t only demonstrated by giving material things or labors. There were the simple gestures that people forgot, that were so important\u2014a little extra time, a smile, patience, conversation, gratitude. These were the things Aunt Mary had valued, she had never had much by way of material wealth but she\u2019d been one of the most generous people Devon knew.</p><p>She reminded herself of these things as she walked into Cooper\u2019s, holding Mercy\u2019s hand. She went first to the kitchen to find Rawley. \u201cYou wonderful sneak,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what you did!\u201d</p><p>He turned from the sink. \u201cI just meant to put a dent in it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all them others just jumped in. Looks darn good, don\u2019t it, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn good. Thank you. You are certainly my guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, flushed a little bit. \u201cAin\u2019t no one ever called me that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I buy you a beer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGirl, I don\u2019t drink nothin\u2019. I don\u2019t make all that much sense without ever takin\u2019 a drink. Those others, though\u2014they\u2019d prolly take your beer money.\u201d</p><p>She just laughed at him.</p><p>He bent at the waist and peered at Mercy. \u201cWanna help old Rawley wash up dishes?\u201d</p><p>Her little face lit up and Devon said, \u201cOh, Rawley, she\u2019s just going to make a big mess.\u201d</p><p>He scooped her up and planted her on the step stool in front of the sink. \u201cI reckon. There ain\u2019t no sharp things in there, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He tied an apron around her neck and it fit her like a long dress. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a break for once. Sit out on the deck and count seabirds.\u201d</p><p>Devon wandered back into the bar. Cooper was alone behind the bar and he was smiling at her. She leaned on the bar. \u201cHow can I thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even buy you a beer in your own bar,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something special. Something that will show you how much it means to me that you\u2019d take on that cleanup job for someone you barely even know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cListen here, you\u2019ve already done enough for me. For us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t done\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His voice was lowered when he talked, as if this was just for her. \u201cI\u2019ve known that old boy in the kitchen for almost a year now. He\u2019s a curmudgeonly old coot. He hasn\u2019t had an easy life, he doesn\u2019t trust people quickly. He\u2019s been mostly alone and hardly anyone knows how big his heart is. I\u2019m maybe the best friend he\u2019s got and he makes me work real hard for a few words. But since you and your little girl have been around, Rawley\u2019s a whole new man. Almost can\u2019t shut him up. And he\u2019s got a twinkle in his eye that I haven\u2019t ever seen before. He\u2019s been needing someone to take care of\u2014he\u2019s been needing family. And I wouldn\u2019t be saying this but it\u2019s pretty plain\u2014you\u2019re not just good for him, you\u2019re good to him. That matters to me, Devon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe is that, hard as he might try to keep it a secret.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him and in a hushed tone said, \u201cI\u2019m not his cousin.\u201d</p><p>And Cooper whispered back, \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe told you?\u201d</p><p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cI guessed, that\u2019s all. It was awful sudden, you showing up, but as long as it works out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt Rawley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s coming across loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really talk about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout why you cut off your pretty hair and won\u2019t talk about where you\u2019ve been? Look, hardly a one of us doesn\u2019t have stuff to get over, so you don\u2019t have to explain. I could make you blush with my past. In fact, let\u2019s leave that alone. There might come a time you want to talk about whatever it is, but know this\u2014it doesn\u2019t really matter that much. What matters is that you find what you need, that Rawley is happy, that your daughter is okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important to me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re bent on a single purpose. Now, what\u2019s your pleasure? Coffee? Soda? Wine?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed back some emotion. \u201cCan I have a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said, pulling a bottle out of the cooler. He popped the top and put it on the bar as she was struggling to open her wallet. He put a hand over hers. \u201cDevon, I\u2019m not taking your money. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. The families of folks who work here eat and drink for free. Now find a place in the sun to relax\u2014Rawley says you\u2019ve been working day and night for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could just kiss you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d he said with a handsome big grin. Then he leaned across the bar, presenting her with his cheek.</p><p>Devon sat on the deck with her beer. Down on the beach she saw Spencer throwing the football with Landon. So much for his shower. He was wearing the same jeans, but without his shirt or shoes. He had apparently been distracted by a little ball practice. He had amazing shoulders and arms, which she wished she hadn\u2019t even noticed\u2014but there was no denying it, he was a beautiful specimen. His boy, Austin, was fooling around on the paddleboard, very near the shore. There were a few people out on the water\u2014a couple in a small skiff, rowing around the quiet bay. Two people were on paddleboards, taking them farther out into the bay.</p><p>Her eyes went back to Spencer and Landon. They threw long, powerful passes. This was the coach and his star player, and they were impressive. She could hear them shouting at each other and laughing. She just couldn\u2019t believe she was here. Feeling for the first time as if she was actually living a normal life. Not just that, but in a setting millions of people would envy\u2014the beauty of the rocky sea, the long peaceful beach. It felt as though right up to this very moment, this very second, she had worried and wondered what was coming tomorrow, that she\u2019d been a little afraid each day that somehow the clock would be turned back and she\u2019d find herself again behind that fence.</p> <p>Sarah came out to sit beside her. Ham was by her side and Sarah sat down beside Devon. \u201cWhat did you think of your duplex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was speechless,\u201d she said. \u201cYou guys are my magic fairies. I don\u2019t know what came over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a day off.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m going to pay for it by sitting alert for the next two nights, but that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m almost done. I\u2019ll be on paid vacation by the end of the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you manage that?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you give the Coast Guard ten years, accumulate a lot of leave, fall in love with Cooper and marry him.\u201d At that precise moment he appeared at her side, handing her a glass of white wine. Sarah laughed. \u201cHe promises to serve me and pamper me for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Cooper disappeared again and Devon said, \u201cI\u2019d marry him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, now, I saw him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when is all this going to happen?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to happen right now. I\u2019m moving in with Cooper. Spencer is vacating the RV and taking my rental house in town. Landon is taking over the RV as his bachelor pad, under the watchful eye of his diligent and suspicious sister\u2014I even have a new pair of binoculars. And a week from Saturday we\u2019re having a wedding, right here, on the beach. Will you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, seriously?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very laid-back, just like my Cooper. By the way, I\u2019m getting rid of a couch. Interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, sitting straighter. \u201cAre you selling it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sarah said, smiling. \u201cHopefully I\u2019m moving it down the street to your house where it will find a good home.\u201d</p><p>Three days later Sarah\u2019s couch appeared in her living room along with two side tables and some lamps. A couple of days later she noticed a moving truck pulled up in front of Sarah\u2019s house\u2014Spencer was moving in. He had a dinette set he didn\u2019t need anymore moved into her kitchen. Then Sarah offered her two beds. \u201cNot like you got them off craigslist,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re almost new and I\u2019ll give you the mattress protector to go with them. And some linens I can\u2019t use anymore.\u201d Spencer gave her a dresser and chest that had been in his last guest room and, just like that, her little house was ready to move in to. Then Sarah and Spencer had a huge yard sale and Devon went, picking up a few extra items\u2014kitchen things, a set of old dishes that looked fine to her, even a couple of things to hang on the wall.</p><p>She ordered a few towels, a couple of blankets, pillows and some flatware online.</p><p>When she embraced Rawley at the front door of her little house, she said, \u201cWe will see you almost every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will. If you don\u2019t come by Cooper\u2019s, I\u2019ll check on you here so don\u2019t go thinkin\u2019 you\u2019re done with me. Me and Mercy, we bonded.\u201d</p><p>Rawley went to the Farmers\u2019 Market in Myrtle Creek one afternoon. He just roamed around, looking at the crafts and produce stands, taking his good old time, observing. He felt like a man in a foreign country, checking out the status of things. And then he saw what he was looking for\u2014a produce stand run by a couple of farm girls with long single braids. They were selling strawberries, early pears, root vegetables such as carrots, onions, red potatoes and scallions. There was leaf lettuce, butter lettuce, beets, peppers, small, early hook squash, little zucchini and green beans. They had small cucumbers for pickling and some fine looking tomatoes. He gave a tomato a gentle squeeze\u2014soft and meaty yet firm. \u201cWhat fertilizer you use on these?\u201d he asked one of the girls.</p><p>\u201cWe have livestock, so we make our own blend\u2014all organic, all clean,\u201d the smiling girl said.</p><p>\u201cWish I could get my hands on some of your fertilizer. I got me a couple tomato plants\u2014they\u2019re healthy and strong and still don\u2019t produce like this. Where does all this come from?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou grow it yourselves, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have some property down the river. In two weeks we\u2019ll have larger squash and in late summer the melons will start coming in. Plus apples and the tomatoes will keep coming as long as the weather holds.\u201d</p><p>He had never paid much attention to these ladies before, but now he was looking at them in a whole new way. The three young women did the selling and behind them, in the back of their booth, looking as if they were there to do heavy lifting, were two large men in jeans and boots. They looked friendly, but they didn\u2019t chat with any of the customers. They stood back, arms crossed over their chests, wearing half smiles, talking only to each other.</p><p>On their display stand they had big jars\u2014 old-fashioned pickle jars with hand-lettered labels: Veterans, UNICEF, Save The Children, Police and Firefighters Fund, St. Jude\u2019s Hospital. Well, covered their bases, didn\u2019t they? Rawley thought to himself. He tried to remember if these were the same charities they had been supporting the last time he stumbled on them. He took out a couple of dollars for the Veterans jar and asked, \u201cDoes any of the money you earn go to charity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything left after we pay the bills we donate,\u201d the young woman said. \u201cThe Fellowship supports a number of worthy causes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Fellowship, yeah, that\u2019s right. You have a produce stand on the road back by the river, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot open every day, sir. We don\u2019t get a lot of traffic back there so we\u2019re only open about four afternoons a week and always on the weekend in the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a couple of big bags of these tomatoes,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cAnd a bag of them green beans. You ladies do a right fine job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weave them things?\u201d he asked, pointing to a display of shawls and throws.</p><p>She laughed happily. \u201cYes, sir. Charlotte does that\u2014and she taught some of us how to knit and crochet. That occupies us on all those cold winter nights. Would you like to look at them?\u201d</p><p>He wandered down to the end of the stand and picked through them. The prices on them were pretty high. \u201cWow, you\u2019re awful proud of these. Seventy-five dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re handmade, sir. And original designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have this one here. I have an elderly neighbor lady who would really take to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I hope your neighbor loves it.\u201d</p><p>They wrapped up his vegetables and throw. Rawley paid in cash and left. Instead of going back to Cooper\u2019s to work, he went to the doctor\u2019s office. Devon was sitting behind the counter at the desk and looked up, surprised to see him.</p><p>\u201cWhat a surprise! I hope you\u2019re not sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever felt better,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought you a couple of things.\u201d He put his parcels on the table. \u201cI split up the beans and tomatoes, kept half for myself. Then there\u2019s this,\u201d he said, giving her the tissue-wrapped parcel with the throw.</p><p>She smiled at the beautiful vegetables, but when she saw the throw she frowned. \u201cRawley, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug and a fairly handsome smile. \u201cJust checkin\u2019 on things in Myrtle Creek. I thought you might like knowin\u2019 it seems to be business as usual. Not that I expected to see anything amiss. But they\u2019re still there, sellin\u2019 their tomatoes and woven things, wearin\u2019 their overalls and braids.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDevon, we\u2019ll be careful, but it\u2019s gonna be all right, I think.\u201d He gave her a gentle smile. \u201cI think you got yourself a new home.\u201d</p><p>She came around the counter, stood on tiptoes and kissed his cheek. \u201cThank you, Rawley. I not only have a new home, I have a table and chairs. When can you come to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon there\u2019s time tomorrow night. Wednesday nights ain\u2019t so busy at the beach.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. Consider yourself invited.\u201d</p><p>Devon had become a familiar face at the thrift shop in town. She was very careful with her earnings, but she was able to pick up some wonderful things for Mercy. Children grew out of clothes so fast that secondhand items tended to be in very good condition.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t worry much about things for herself\u2014she had her work uniform of scrubs and she was very happy with them. For the weekends she had her shorts and jeans and a few other casual things. But there was a wedding coming up and she found herself picking through the women\u2019s secondhand clothing, just in case she saw something suitable.</p><p>And there, hanging all wonky and kind of tied on to a hanger, was a sundress. She untied the straps and held it up...and fell dead in love. It was navy blue with pink flowers, along with a bit of white and yellow. It tied over the shoulders. She hadn\u2019t worn anything like that in years and without even looking at the price tag, she hugged it.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means you like it,\u201d said the woman who ran the thrift shop.</p><p>\u201cIf I can afford it, it\u2019s meant to be,\u201d she said.</p><p>The lady lifted the tag and smiled. \u201cCan you manage fifteen dollars?\u201d</p> <p>Devon let out a breath. \u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>She was so excited about her \u201cfind\u201d that she went straight to the diner to show Gina. \u201cBut of course I don\u2019t have shoes. I guess I can wear my tennis shoes\u2014that won\u2019t look completely dorky down on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Gina said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beach party\u2014anything will work. But you can also wear flip-flops\u2014that\u2019s what the bride\u2019s wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it. We\u2019re wearing strapless, breezy summer dresses and Cooper and Mac are wearing Tommy Bahamas island shirts and sandals. I predict we\u2019ll all be barefoot in no time. One thing you could use\u2014a wrap. The beach gets chilly at night, even in summer. Do you have one? Because I have a few\u2014nothing too fancy. I can loan you one. I have a yellow wrap that I think might go with this dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be so wonderful, thank you. How\u2019s Sarah doing? Is she getting nervous and excited?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNervous, yes, but not about the nuptials. Cooper told his family about the wedding and they\u2019re all coming. All of them! Not only are they getting a new daughter-in-law and sister-in-law they\u2019ve never met, they haven\u2019t met Austin yet. In just a few days, this place is going to be raining Coopers!\u201d</p><p>Sarah had to take a week of leave to be available for Cooper\u2019s visiting family and preparing for the wedding. Everyone started arriving on the Thursday before the Saturday wedding and she met them all except a couple of nieces and nephews who had been unable to attend. But there were promises of another summer visit before school started again.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s family met Austin and Spencer with caution, clearly trying not to overwhelm them with their sheer numbers. But once the kids got out to the beach and on the water, the adults began to relax.</p><p>Sophie and Hank, Cooper\u2019s parents, not only brought gifts but a cooler packed with Sophie\u2019s lasagna, homemade bread, extra sauce and meatballs. Apparently she was afraid Cooper wouldn\u2019t be able to make sure they were all fed. As the Cooper clan arrived in Thunder Point, things loosened up considerably. Cooper got a lot of teasing about falling into this fabulous property when everyone had always considered him just a wanderer who couldn\u2019t put down roots.</p><p>On Friday the preparations began in earnest; the Cooper family helped by stringing lights around the beach, attached to poles that were stuck in the ground. Sophie brought out the lasagna and Rawley added a huge green salad and compared recipe details with Sophie. Rawley tried to excuse himself from the family dinner, but he was denied and told to go find Devon and Mercy and make sure they were part of what appeared to be the groom\u2019s dinner. Anyone else who happened to be at the bar or on the beach was invited to partake. The McCain clan was there in force, and the place was jumping with kids and teens and adults everywhere.</p><p>\u201cHow many people will be coming to this wedding?\u201d Cooper\u2019s sister, Rochelle, asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cWe had a very loud disagreement about that. I wanted to write out some invitations and Cooper said no. He wanted to tell our friends\u2014both from town and from the Coast Guard station\u2014and anyone else who wandered by would be welcome. Poor Carrie, our caterer\u2014she\u2019s going to have to wing it. We obviously didn\u2019t have any RSVPs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beach wedding,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIf they come, they get a party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t run out of food,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cCarrie knows more about catering in this town than any other person. The only thing we have to worry about is rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t dare rain,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>It was quite early on Saturday morning when Sarah heard a vehicle on the beach and took her coffee outside to the deck. It was Carrie, delivering some items for the wedding and the party. As she surveyed the scene below she saw the bandstand that had been positioned at the base of the hill with reels of extension cords that would be run up to the bar to power the speakers and electric instruments. There were a couple of long tables for food and drink set up near the staircase to the beach. And finally, an arch covered with fresh flowers. Sarah put a hand to her chest and sighed deeply, feeling a rush of tears come to her eyes. It was beautiful.</p><p>She heard a sound and, thinking it must be Cooper, she turned. But it was Sophie, carrying a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cCome and see,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Sophie joined her at the rail and saw the beautiful arch. \u201cOh, Sarah,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCarrie said she\u2019d think of something. She\u2019s an amazing woman. I was all for just getting married privately, maybe up the coast. But Cooper said he wanted to be married on this beach and that he\u2019d take care of things.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe surprises me at every turn.\u201d</p><p>Sophie slipped her arm around Sarah\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen enough of our son the past twenty years. He\u2019s spent quite a few years traveling, no interest in claiming a permanent home. Now I see a changed man, Sarah. And he\u2019s happier than I\u2019ve ever seen him. I expect that\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s made me happier than I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no idea how all this happened. I came here to be alone, to lick my wounds after a failed marriage. Cooper\u2019s not only gained a son in Austin, but he\u2019s become a role model to my brother, Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think that, finally, after all these years, I won\u2019t worry about my son finding what he wants and needs to complete his life.\u201d She kissed Sarah\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you. As the mother of a painfully independent son, thank you for coming into his life. I can see you\u2019re a very good match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to make him happy. He already makes me happier than I thought I could ever be.\u201d</p><p>They were hugging and drying their tears when Cooper came outside with his cup of coffee. He looked at his mother and his bride and said, \u201cOh, brother.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Devon couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d attended a wedding. It was probably back in her college days. And she\u2019d certainly never gone to a wedding like this! Although children were welcome at the wedding, Scott convinced her they should leave them at home so they could be put to bed at a reasonable hour. \u201cWe\u2019re going to drink and dance and have fun!\u201d he insisted.</p><p>She drove Mercy to Scott\u2019s house where she was spending the night with Jenny and Will, leaving Devon and her boss free to go to the wedding. When they arrived at the Grant home, complete with all Mercy\u2019s overnight gear, she was actually happy to see that Gabriella\u2019s boyfriend was also there. Devon was introduced to Charles, also a college student.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with Charles spending the evening with Gabriella and the kids, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Scott asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved, in fact,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s not just a nanny or au pair or babysitter, but a completely normal nineteen-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. Gabriella has a very active social life when she gets time to have one. Follow me in your truck. We\u2019ll just park at Cliffhanger\u2019s and walk across the beach, if you\u2019re up to it.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out a foot, showing off her new flip-flops. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI even live close enough to the beach to walk home if it comes to that. You never know\u2014I could have the time of my life tonight.\u201d</p><p>He peered at her. \u201cHow long since you\u2019ve been to a party or a wedding reception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even remember. A very long time.\u201d</p><p>A lot of people had the same idea\u2014the marina parking lot was full. After they parked, he looped his arm with hers to walk her across the beach. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some fun tonight. I don\u2019t want to see you picking up Mercy before morning\u2014just enjoy yourself. You look very pretty tonight, Devon.\u201d</p><p>She flushed slightly. \u201cAnd so do you, Dr. Grant.\u201d</p><p>Even though it wasn\u2019t dark yet, the sparkling lights twinkled in the dusk, casting a glow over a wide area of the beach. There were no chairs set up, but there was a runner that led from the bottom of the steps to the arch and a box on the side of the bay where the preacher would stand. The band was set up and they were playing some soft, classic tunes\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll Be Seeing You,\u201d \u201cDeep Purple,\u201d \u201cWill You Love Me Tomorrow.\u201d People were milling around with plastic cups, visiting, laughing and generally getting into the party mood. The sky had never been more beautiful, the bay was calm and dark, the air warm and there was only a slight breeze.</p><p>Scott Grant pressed a cup into her hand. \u201cLots of people here I\u2019ve never met before,\u201d he said.</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cIt turns out I know a lot of them. I\u2019ve already met Cooper\u2019s family.\u201d She grabbed his hand and dragged him around the gathering at the beach, introducing him to those people he didn\u2019t know. They eventually found Rawley behind one of the long serving tables, wearing a shirt identical to Mac\u2019s and Cooper\u2019s, as if he were a part of the wedding party. Even Austin had a matching shirt. Austin was running around the beach with a kid about the same age, kicking up sand at the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>Gina wore a powder-blue strapless summer dress and held a lovely bouquet; Mac stayed close to her near the bridal arch, chatting with a man who must be either the minister or justice of the peace. He wore a Hawaiian shirt and sported a long ponytail.</p><p>The sun lowered. The lights twinkled. The band played and the sky was clear and deep, speckled with stars.</p><p>Devon\u2019s happiness at being included was almost too much to bear. People thought of her as a regular girl, worthy of their company. She pulled her yellow wrap, her borrowed wrap, around her shoulders. It was all so beautiful and happy....</p><p>In the small apartment above the bar, Sarah turned in front of a full-length mirror mounted on the closet door. Her dress was identical to Gina\u2019s except that it was pink. The contrast with her tanned skin and dark hair was perfect. She had a delicious bouquet of roses, calla lilies, baby\u2019s breath and periwinkles\u2014all white, yellow and blue.</p><p>Cooper leaned against the wall, appreciating the vision she created and she grinned at him. \u201cWill this do?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He took a couple of lazy steps toward her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you more beautiful. You ready to do it? It\u2019s a long contract. Ninety-nine years.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on his shoulders. \u201cJust ninety-nine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy little commitment-phobe has gone, I think. I have something for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She laughed and shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly give me one more thing, Cooper. You\u2019re giving me your life, your beachfront property...you\u2019re taking on my brother and supporting us both....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just something for you to wear to bed on our wedding night....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s very sweet...\u201d</p><p>He pulled a small box out of his pocket. He popped it open to display a pair of diamond stud earrings. She sighed and touched one. \u201cNot a nightgown?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have absolutely no need for a nightgown. Just these.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her earrings out of her ears and began inserting the diamond studs. \u201cThere are a bunch of Coast Guard down there as well as more townies than I can count. It might be very late before you get to fully appreciate these earrings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much they eat, drink and dance\u2014we\u2019re going to escape and lock the door. Spencer and Landon have charge of Austin. Carrie, Gina, Mac and Rawley have charge of the party. They\u2019re under orders\u2014shut it down before dawn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDawn?\u201d she asked with a laugh.</p><p>He lifted her chin and put a soft kiss on her lips. \u201cI want everyone to remember this night as much as I will.\u201d He put out a crooked arm. \u201cCome on, Mrs. Cooper. Let\u2019s tie the knot. And start our new lives.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her arm through his and went downstairs. Before exiting the bar, Cooper stopped and flipped the lights on the deck on and off a few times. Then when they stepped outside, the music changed abruptly and the band began to play \u201cThe Way You Look Tonight.\u201d As they descended the stairs to the beach, their guests applauded. There were a few whistles and catcalls as well, making them all laugh.</p><p>And then they stood in front of the floral arch, facing the preacher in the Hawaiian shirt and ponytail. The young man said a few words about commitment and partnership, the standard vows were exchanged, promises made, and then, per Sarah\u2019s request, a Native American blessing.</p><p>And then Cooper was invited to kiss his wife and the beach came alive with cheers. Mac, the best man, was handed a glass as were Cooper and Sarah. There was no elaborate toast, just a brief salute to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Cooper and followed by many a \u201cHear! Hear!\u201d And then the funky little band made up of middle-aged men broke into \u201cI\u2019m in the Mood for Love,\u201d punctuated by the popping of champagne corks.</p><p>While Sarah and Cooper stood in front of the arch, there were the flashes of cameras and most of the guests made their way over to congratulate them. When the receiving line was exhausted, Sarah and Cooper were first in the buffet line. A neat stack of beach blankets were stacked at each end of the long serving table and Cooper handed a plate to Sarah, grabbing a blanket at the same time. He spread it on the sand near the bottom of the stairs to the deck and soon others joined them, while still others continued to stand or spread their blankets on the other side of the band. A group of eight or ten teenagers including Landon and Eve took their blankets and set up some distance away from their parents and elders. Gina and Mac ended up beside them and when Cooper caught sight of Spencer trying to corral Austin as well as a couple of plates of food, Cooper motioned them over to join their party.</p> <p>Not everyone needed blankets\u2014there were several rocks and driftwood trunks scattered around that made for handy chairs. And before the first wave of guests had enjoyed the food, the dancing began\u2014mostly by those people over the age of thirty. The music was not the teenagers\u2019 style at all. Cooper\u2019s mom and dad twirled around the sand a little bit and once the eating was mostly done, Cooper took his wife onto the outdoor dance floor.</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t have possession of her for long\u2014her USCG friends and coworkers were present and wouldn\u2019t let her rest.</p><p>After dancing with his mother and sisters, Cooper gratefully returned to the blanket, sitting down beside Spencer. He noticed that Austin had already abandoned them for Landon\u2019s party, a safe distance away.</p><p>\u201cI guess you couldn\u2019t convince Rawley to come as a guest tonight,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. I\u2019m lucky I got him in that shirt, the only thing that identifies him as part of the wedding party. But have fun? Never.\u201d Cooper laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s a cautionary tale,\u201d Cooper said, nodding at the man behind the serving table. \u201cHe\u2019s exactly what I was destined to become if I stayed as solitary as I\u2019d been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou throw a good party,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou should do beach parties regularly, even when you\u2019re not getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to hand it to Carrie\u2014she sure can pull a party together under difficult circumstances, can\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she get that band?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of local guys. One\u2019s a mailman, one\u2019s a crabber and I don\u2019t know who the third one is. Not exactly American Bandstand, but you can\u2019t complain about their tone, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like ballroom music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out there, Spencer,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWrap your arms around something soft. Give Sarah a whirl, because after tonight you can\u2019t touch her.\u201d</p><p>Again Spencer laughed, shaking his head. \u201cYeah, I think I\u2019ll just enjoy the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like the new doc is circling a target,\u201d Cooper said. He nodded toward the other side of the bandstand to where Scott Grant reclined on a beach blanket and Devon was kneeling in front of him, talking animatedly with her hands, making him laugh.</p><p>Spencer had seen them arrive together. They came to the beach arm in arm. Then she held his hand, pulling him all over the beach, introducing him to people he hadn\u2019t yet met. Then they spread their blanket together.</p><p>Were they already a couple? he wondered. It would only make sense. They spent every day together. And Dr. Grant\u2014he seemed like a pretty nice guy.</p><p>But Devon, she was something else. Her transformation since the first day he\u2019d seen her was remarkable. She had arrived here as a skittish and shy runaway from some kind of cult or something. She didn\u2019t know he had overheard her when she was telling\u2014or rather, trying not to tell\u2014Rawley that first morning. By now Rawley might know the details, but Spencer didn\u2019t. Still, the changes in the girl were impossible to ignore. Or forget. She\u2019d become a cute, efficient, fun-loving sprite with a quick wit and spontaneous smile that just lit up her whole face. She must be feeling safer, more confident. She had a glow about her and he was inexplicably drawn to her.</p><p>She\u2019s a blonde, he thought. His wife had been blonde. Maybe he was just hot for blondes....</p><p>And of course, that was the last thing he was in the market for. He\u2019d laid his young wife to rest just a few months ago, after a long and ravaging illness. Now he was concentrating on raising his son, starting a new career, making a new home. There was no room for romance, especially with a woman hiding a weird and mysterious past.</p><p>Someone approached her\u2014one of the Coast Guard guests, he believed. He gave her a half bow that made her laugh, held out a hand and took her out in front of the bandstand to dance. There was a little more laughter, some barefoot twirling. He found himself smiling, glad she was having a good time. He couldn\u2019t believe there was anything creepy or sinister about her\u2014she seemed so transparent, except maybe for that part of her life she was fleeing. For no logical reason whatsoever, he was glad her flight had brought her here, because he believed this to be a safe place and populated with the kind of men who had the strength to protect her and her little girl, if that became necessary.</p><p>He shifted his gaze to Cooper, who was making the rounds, dancing with the women in his family and with friends from town. Sarah was being passed around pretty liberally as well\u2014lots of cutting in going on out there. Then there was Gina and Mac, the newlyweds, locked together in a sweet, close sway...until they were disrupted by Mac\u2019s aunt Lou and her steady, Joe, and partners were exchanged. But that didn\u2019t last long\u2014they were back together for the next song.</p><p>He looked for Austin, who hadn\u2019t moved in quite a while. He was still sitting with the teenagers, Landon, Eve, Ashley James and a young man by the name of Frank. When Spencer had decided to come to this town, he had no idea it would include kids like Landon. He was an expert on high school kids, especially athletes, and Landon and his friends were A-list, no question\u2014smart, healthy, responsible and very patient with ten-year-old Austin. Landon was bunking with Spencer and Austin while Cooper\u2019s parents borrowed the RV as their guestroom and he was a perfect houseguest.</p><p>Spencer wandered over to the outdoor bar for another beer and, while standing there, he talked with a number of folks from town. Yeah, this was a town excited about football season and it made sense. Their high school teams did well and were worth bragging about. People wanted to warn him about competing teams and ask him if he had some secret weapon. They wanted to go over details of performance in previous years and talk about their stars. Finally he was dragged out to dance by Ray Anne and, with beer in hand, he spun her around a little bit.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can even dance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve chaperoned a ton of high school dances,\u201d he explained.</p><p>She tapped his beer bottle with a long, pink, manicured finger. \u201cNo beer at those dances, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot where I could see it,\u201d he answered with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHard to believe times have changed so little since I was in school. It\u2019s been a couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it now?\u201d he asked, playing dumb.</p><p>Dance over, he found himself standing around with Coach Rayburough, Cliff and Mac. The talk was football, of course. And his eyes kept drifting to Devon\u2014she either danced or visited with women friends or sat on the blanket. It wasn\u2019t late, but inevitably the party dwindled\u2014people started leaving.</p><p>Spencer was tackled around the legs by his son. Austin looked up at him and said, \u201cCan I go home on the Razor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s driving?\u201d Spencer asked, joking.</p><p>\u201cHa, ha. You know.\u201d</p><p>He looked around and saw Landon was saying his goodbyes, shaking Cooper\u2019s hand, giving his sister a kiss on the cheek. Then Landon was striding toward Spencer. \u201cEve and I are going to head out. We\u2019ll take Austin home in the Razor, if it\u2019s okay with you. If it\u2019s not, I\u2019ll walk him and Eve will drive the Razor. Or we could leave it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as he has his seat belt on and you go slow,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cDon\u2019t hit any wedding guests. That\u2019s bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor sure.\u201d Landon laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll swing by and grab Eve and Ashley on the way home,\u201d Mac said. He glanced at his watch. \u201cHalf hour or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mac, it\u2019s Saturday night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna bring \u2019em home?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, later! After Spencer gets home.\u201d Then he looked at Spencer and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry on that....\u201d</p><p>They were walking off in the direction of the far side of the beach, Austin with four teens. And then the saxophone player spoke into the microphone and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a couple more, then this old band is packing it up....\u201d</p><p>Spencer handed Mac his beer bottle and said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d He walked across the dance area. He was thinking, Get a few beers in me and I\u2019ll do any stupid thing. In front of him Devon was talking with Scott Grant as he folded up that beach blanket. \u201cAlmost missed my chance,\u201d he said, holding out a hand to Devon. \u201cThe band\u2019s shutting down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s nice,\u201d she said, putting her hand in his. Then she looked at Scott. \u201cIf you want to go, I\u2019ll see you in the morning when I come for Mercy. I can get across the beach on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot your whistle?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She laughed at him, but Spencer, half expecting an argument, said, \u201cI\u2019m her neighbor\u2014I\u2019ll make sure she gets home.\u201d</p><p>And then to his surprise, Scott Grant said, \u201cOkay. Later, then.\u201d</p> <p>Probably shouldn\u2019t have done that, Spencer thought. He already knew he found the girl intriguing and attractive and complicated\u2014spending more time with her just didn\u2019t make sense for a man in his position, single father, recently widowed, vulnerable. But then he put his hand on the small of her back, brought her gently up against him, and that\u2019s where all thinking ended. He was vaguely aware of someone in the band singing You\u2019re just too good to be true, can\u2019t take my eyes off of you.... He swayed with her, their feet barely moving, her head resting lightly against his shoulder, her hair under his chin.</p><p>She lifted her chin and smiled up at him. \u201cDid you have a good time tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He just nodded and pulled her a little bit closer.</p><p>He tried to make sense of this. It had been so long since he\u2019d had his arms around the warm, soft flesh of a woman\u2014that\u2019s probably all it was. He\u2019d held his wife in her last months, weeks, days, hours...but that wasn\u2019t the same as this. This woman was all too alive. And her hair...the fragrance was just knocking him out.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that fragrance?\u201d he asked her in a whisper. \u201cWhat do you wash your hair with?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him and laughed. \u201cBaby shampoo.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he was clearly losing his mind. Baby shampoo? Whatever was filling his senses was much more serious and sensuous than that. The song ended and the next began. He felt her pull back slightly, but he just gathered her up closer. And she came to him. He heard the music, but he was also vaguely aware of the sounds of packing up. Coolers opened and closed, trash was gathered, there was talking and laughing, bottles clinked. He lifted his head, opened his eyes and they were the only couple dancing.</p><p>And then, too soon, the music stopped.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. I\u2019m going to see if I can help before heading home,\u201d she said. And with that she walked right over to Carrie, who gave her a brief hug and shook her head. It looked as if they were just about done with everything they had to do tonight. Once the food and trash was gathered and stowed, everything else would wait until morning.</p><p>Spencer went to where Devon had been sitting with Scott and picked up her flip-flops. He stood there at the edge of the party area holding her shoes, waiting. It seemed just about everyone was gone; Cooper and Sarah stood on the deck with his parents, saying good-night. Mac and Gina were halfway across the beach. The band was packing up their equipment. And he had an overwhelming desire to wait them all out, to wait until it was only himself and Devon on the beach, under the twinkling lights.</p> <p>She was beside him again. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, reaching for her flip-flops. She slipped them on her feet and they began walking toward the marina. \u201cWhat a nice wedding. I admit, I cried a little bit.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI think the little kids would\u2019ve liked it, but I\u2019m glad they weren\u2019t there. I would\u2019ve spent the whole night chasing them. And I haven\u2019t been to a grown-up party in so long, I can\u2019t remember when.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking and looked down at her. \u201cDevon. You and the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you with the doctor? Are you seeing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott?\u201d she asked on a laugh. \u201cOh, my gosh, no!\u201d She laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m sharing his babysitter so I can work for him, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s been wonderful about that\u2014but of course I do pay Gabriella. But seeing him? Spencer, I can\u2019t be dating my boss! I can\u2019t be dating anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a single mother! I have a lot of responsibility! I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking. He slipped his arm around her waist, pulled her up off her feet and planted a kiss on her, cutting her off midsentence. He moved over her mouth and decided immediately that the taste and texture were perfect. But her arms hung limp at her sides. He lifted his lips from hers. \u201cMe, either. I can\u2019t get involved with anyone, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a very strange way of demonstrating that, Mr. Lawson....\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me back,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, can\u2019t you see I can\u2019t help it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You smell so good. You taste like heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not dating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be friends,\u201d he said. \u201cVery good friends. While we figure out if we should date. I haven\u2019t been on a date in years.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him, shaking her head. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>He let go of her, let her drop to her feet. \u201cNo, I\u2019m horribly sober. So you don\u2019t want to kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be a bad idea. I only kiss boyfriends and I haven\u2019t had one of those in...forever.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou have no idea how much we have in common....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, taking his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home. And behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>They were almost to the marina when he said, \u201cDevon, we should...I don\u2019t know...spend some time or...\u201d He stopped walking again. \u201cDo you need someone to cut your grass? Help you paint something?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very helpful by nature.\u201d</p><p>She began walking again. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>When they got to the truck, she asked, \u201cDo you want a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll walk. It\u2019s just a few blocks. And I should clear my head. I\u2019m not usually so...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t grab and kiss women like that. And I could tell you didn\u2019t like it. I think I should probably do some chores for you or something. Prove I\u2019m not rude...\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on his arm. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, Spencer. It was just the twinkling lights and the wedding. Made you feel a little reckless.\u201d She tilted her head and he really wanted to dig his fingers into that messy, willful short hair of hers. So he put his hands in his pockets. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Be careful driving home.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>Devon sat in the truck, in the driveway of her duplex. She felt a slight trembling in her extremities and it was not from cold or fear or embarrassment. It was from that very alien feeling of desire that rippled through her arms, breasts, toes...and lips. He\u2019d kissed her. Really kissed her right off her feet. He\u2019d stunned and paralyzed her and it made her want to kiss him back.</p><p>Instead she\u2019d scared him away. Which was probably for the best. The last time she\u2019d felt anything like that, it had been for Jacob, much older, much more practiced in seduction, much more dangerous. At least she thought that\u2019s how Jacob seemed compared to Spencer.</p><p>It had been so long. Of the seven women she\u2019d lived with at The Fellowship, only three of them were regularly sharing Jacob\u2019s bed\u2014Charlotte, Pilly and Lorna. Devon had foolishly believed he had fallen for her\u2014the new girl. And the others didn\u2019t tell her, warn her, didn\u2019t explain that all the children were his. When she\u2019d realized the truth, she\u2019d wanted to run for her life, and then it was the women who convinced her to stay. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to accept his advances and we\u2019ll take care of you. He might try with you, but he would never hurt you or force you\u2014you\u2019re safe,\u201d Reese had said. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant and have nowhere to go\u2014just stay close to me and you\u2019ll have everything you need.\u201d By which Reese meant food and shelter and friendship. So at first she stayed because there was nothing else for her, then she stayed because she felt it was safe for her and Mercy. It didn\u2019t take long to realize what Jacob was\u2014a manipulative liar who liked having his harem, his kingdom. He was omnipotent and as long as he believed himself to be the Divine Ruler, he was manageable. But she was never his lover again and she could tell it made him angry. Reese made him angry as well, but he needed her medical skills in his camp.</p><p>She came from such an ordinary, white-bread background she still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d allowed herself to be duped into that lifestyle. But they all had. Jacob liked \u2019em young\u2014early twenties at the most.</p><p>She thought Spencer was all the things Jacob was not. She imagined him as generous, guileless, honest and innocent; she knew he was a single father, a widower, a dedicated teacher. She\u2019d been successfully ignoring the fact that he was also hot\u2014built, sexy, sweet. Those deep brown eyes with the golden flecks under sometimes brooding brows\u2014those eyes were deadly. There were plenty of hot men around, but they were all locked into very serious relationships, so they were easy to ignore. A little eye candy, that\u2019s all, because all Devon wanted was a way to sort out her life and be free of the kind of entanglements that could mean trouble.</p><p>Except Spencer, who was single, as new to Thunder Point as she was, was so kind. She\u2019d always been a sucker for this quality in a man.</p><p>She was going to have to ignore Spencer. She had a feeling he could complicate her life.</p><p>She should go inside, she told herself. The duplex was dark and although the summer night was mild, it looked cold to her. On instinct, she drove away from her home and across the small town to Scott\u2019s house. She parked, knocked softly on the door and waited until he answered. He was changed into plaid flannel pajama bottoms and a T-shirt. He was holding an open book and the house was dim and quiet.</p><p>\u201cDevon! Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering how... How\u2019s Mercy doing with spending the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriella said the kids were very good. They stayed up a little later than usual to watch a movie and were in bed around nine-thirty. They\u2019re curled up like a bunch of puppies, sound asleep. Gabriella and Charlie went out for a while. Want to check on the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I could just kiss her good-night...\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cJust down the hall.\u201d</p><p>She walked toward the bedroom\u2014it was Jenny\u2019s room, where the girls napped together. But there were only the two of them there and she circled back to Scott, a little panicked. \u201cScott, Will isn\u2019t there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not?\u201d Scott joined her in the hall, then looked in his own bedroom. He laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s already migrated to my room. Happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, this is the first night since Mercy was born that I haven\u2019t slept beside her.\u201d</p><p>She could see he was shocked silent for a moment. Then his voice came gently. \u201cWould you like to take her home, Devon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be so disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s been so excited. I\u2019ll just kiss her good-night. We both have to grow up sometime....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay down beside her for a while, if that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to bed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for an hour or so. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be out here, reading for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d And she went into the bedroom. The little girls were curled around each other, like sisters. She moved them over just enough to lay on the edge of the bed, an arm draping over them, pulling Mercy close, smelling her sweet little-girl smell.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she be tempted by Scott? Maybe because it was obvious he wasn\u2019t tempted by her? But Devon didn\u2019t want a man at all! Since birth, they\u2019d let her down, every one. After all, her mother had been alone, reaching out to a neighbor to step in when Devon was orphaned. The last man to be kind to her had betrayed her. Men had never proved to be a good idea for her....</p><p>Yet she was interested in this one, this Spencer, who was clumsy in his impetuousness, yet he made her feel all soft and gooey inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment. All she really needed in life was to be with Mercy, to be able to take care of her, make sure she was safe, strong and smart. She could do that, given the right circumstances.</p><p>And then those deep brown eyes under expressive brows came to mind again and she allowed herself the luxury of remembering their time together that night. Dancing with him and being held close in his arms felt so good. For just a little while, she indulged in that fantasy again\u2014that there was someone for her, someone real and normal and true.</p> <p>Scott finished the chapter he\u2019d been reading, closed the book and finally decided enough time had passed to go into the girls\u2019 bedroom to check not on them, but on Devon. He found what he expected\u2014she was sound asleep, curled around them. He laughed softly to himself. Her sundress was riding up a little, laying bare her strong, shapely legs. Her arm was holding both girls protectively against her.</p><p>He grabbed a throw from the living room sofa and covered her, tucking it in around her and she didn\u2019t even stir.</p><p>This is what he wanted, what he\u2019d been looking for\u2014a pretty young woman with a sharp mind who was completely devoted to the children. Someone dependable and smart; someone fun and energetic. He was ready; he\u2019d been ready for a while. He\u2019d been grieving his wife for almost four years, wondering if he\u2019d ever have another. But he was starting to believe he was ready for someone like her. And he\u2019d been looking, trying to find a woman who could slide into the place Serena left.</p><p>He found himself wondering\u2014Does Devon make chocolate chip pancakes? Does she knit or make soup or bread? Did she like being pregnant? The joke on him was that his wife had loved being pregnant, yet died of an aneurism postpartum. He\u2019d been in love with his darling Serena since high school; they\u2019d waited a long time to start their family, given the complications of med school and residency. Was Devon the kind of woman who could endure the demands of a doctor\u2019s life?</p><p>He decided he\u2019d find out. Dinner\u2014they could have dinner together. Let things evolve as they naturally should.</p> <p>Reese Brolin was prepared to leave The Fellowship with her seven-year-old son, Mark, but in the end she couldn\u2019t leave without Mariah, the pregnant twenty-year-old who felt as much like a daughter to her as a sister. Reese was the one who got them all through labor and delivery and she wasn\u2019t sure what would happen to Mariah if she was left to the other well-meaning but untrained women. None of them were nurses or doulas.</p><p>Sister Laine had offered her this chance. She told her about the secret opening in the fence, the backpack with a change of clothes, the bottled water and apples.</p><p>\u201cDid you also help Devon to leave?\u201d Reese asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Laine said. \u201cI had planned to follow her, but things didn\u2019t work out for me. You should take this chance while you have it. I know you want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that? I have a pregnant girl to deliver. I can\u2019t go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go, Reese. Take Mark out of here before something happens. I think Jacob is breaking down. It\u2019s time to get the children out. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know. He\u2019s not the same as he was when I first got here. The level of anxiety around here is growing by the hour. Something\u2019s going on. I think there might be trouble coming and you know Jacob will fight back. He\u2019ll never give up this acreage, his herb farm. You have a chance. You\u2019re strong enough and can keep Mark safe. Go south.\u201d</p><p>And it was then that Reese knew. \u201cYou\u2019re not who you pretend to be,\u201d she said to Laine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about who you think I am, just take this one chance. And, please, don\u2019t talk to anyone about this or it will be very bad for me. Deadly bad. Do you understand, Reese?\u201d</p><p>Reese said she did. She had suspected that Laine wasn\u2019t one of them. She could sense she was trying to fit in but there was something just a little off. Reese knew because The Fellowship wasn\u2019t her first experience in a commune or religious sect. She had been born in Africa to white missionary parents\u2014this was hardly her first tribe.</p><p>Laine was a spy and Reese knew it.</p><p>In the end, she whispered to Mariah late at night when everyone had gone to bed, \u201cShh, come with me. I\u2019ll explain...\u201d</p><p>Mark didn\u2019t utter a word, because Reese had told him to be completely silent. She had told him this was important and he mustn\u2019t make a sound. She carried what supplies she could and guided her son and her friend to the secret opening in the fence.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Mariah whispered as they climbed through the fence.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a second. Put these things on. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>They walked out to the road, difficult for Mariah\u2014the baby was a month away and she was big and ungainly, and the brush was thick.</p><p>As a child, Reese had been in the thick of African tribal uprisings. Her family had escaped death, and she had seen too much unrest and was no stranger to it. Her instincts were very good; a tribal leader in the Sudan once told her she had the intuition of a hawk and would always know what to do. So, when she saw the road curve where Laine had promised a truck would be waiting, she grabbed young Mariah\u2019s upper arms and said, \u201cJacob is in trouble. There\u2019s no doubt the police are coming and he\u2019ll fight to keep his possessions. People will be hurt, they will be taken away. If you come with me now, we might escape. If you don\u2019t, your baby will be born in jail. I can almost guarantee that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mariah said in a sudden panic.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Mark was suddenly frightened.</p><p>Reese crouched down to Mark\u2019s level, peering into his eyes. \u201cWe have to leave, Mark. We have to leave now or face danger. You have to do as I say.\u201d</p><p>Then she rose to Mariah. \u201cYou can refuse to come with me, but if you do, we are all in danger. You most of all, I think. See that truck? I was told it would be waiting for us. Let him take us to a safe place before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d</p><p>Reese brushed her hair back a little. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you, I promise. Never.\u201d Reese took Mark\u2019s hand, then Mariah\u2019s. \u201cSay nothing and trust me,\u201d she said, leading them down the road where a dark truck waited.</p><p>Reese opened the door and looked inside. The man wore a ball cap, but the hair on his head was short. There was a rifle in his gun rack. He turned his head to look at her and then immediately he started the engine. \u201cHurry up,\u201d he said.</p><p>She lifted Mariah into the truck first then Mark, then she squeezed in.</p><p>The man pulled away, using only fog lights until he\u2019d gone quite a distance. When he turned on the headlights, she said, \u201cTake us to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice it is,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was barely dawn when Laine was putting plates and flatware around the long table\u2014enough for fourteen people, and a high chair for a two-year-old. They were six women and four men, including Jacob who sat at the head, and five children including little Liam. The women were busy preparing the meal and rounding up the children. Lorna was making toast and bacon, Pilly was scrambling eggs and Charlotte was spooning oatmeal into bowls for the children. And then Jacob arrived.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the fence!\u201d he boomed. \u201cWho knows about this?\u201d</p><p>The women all looked fearfully at each other. Laine knew, without a doubt, she would be the most suspect, given the fact that she was the newest to this clan.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s missing?\u201d he thundered. He looked around the kitchen. \u201cWhere are Reese and Mariah?\u201d</p><p>The women exchanged even more troubled glances. Finally it was Lorna who said, \u201cGathering eggs, I think. That\u2019s where they should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one in the henhouse!\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stepped toward Jacob. \u201cBut they would never leave,\u201d she said. \u201cNot Reese\u2014this is her home. This has been her home for eight years! And Mariah is close to having her baby\u2014where would they go?\u201d</p><p>Laine braved his wrath. \u201cJacob, are there any vehicles missing? Mariah\u2019s too pregnant to get far on foot. Shall we go looking for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d he blustered, stomping around the room. \u201cGet the children downstairs right now!\u201d</p><p>And four women scrambled to do as he ordered.</p><p>Laine knew exactly who would be missing, but their lives depended on her ability to be convincing and helpful.</p><p>Tears ran down Laine\u2019s cheeks and she twisted her hands. \u201cJacob, Reese and Mark and Mariah aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>He let out a roar, picked up a plate from the table and threw it against the wall. Little Liam in the high chair began to cry and Laine rushed to pick him up. This broke Laine\u2019s heart; he was the baby of the house and she desperately wanted to get him on the other side of that fence. She just cried harder as she thought about this.</p><p>\u201cDid you betray us, Laine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked on a choked sob. \u201cWhy would I do that? If I wanted to leave and knew the way, wouldn\u2019t I go? Jacob, they can\u2019t have gone far\u2014let\u2019s look for them. I\u2019ll help. We\u2019ll all help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a conspiracy here,\u201d he thundered. \u201cAnd when I find it, you\u2019ll be sorry!\u201d</p><p>Laine just held the toddler against her, weeping.</p><p>But when he turned to leave, she sent daggers at him through the narrow slits of her eyes. If she\u2019d had a weapon at that moment, he might be dead.</p><p>A half hour later the men\u2014all four of them, armed\u2014left the compound in three big dark SUVs. Suddenly they were all gone, leaving the women and children behind.</p><p>It had taken Laine nine months to be picked up by Jacob. Her assignment was to infiltrate the commune and learn the extent of his fraudulent activities. As well, she was to look for evidence of kidnapping, human trafficking, antigovernment activities and custodial interference. What they hadn\u2019t known, going in, was that Jacob had developed a large and sophisticated marijuana grow-op. Once Laine had learned the extent of this operation the commune was placed under constant surveillance. At that point her job shifted from investigation to rescue. She had to find a way to get the women and children out before a warrant was served. Crazy Jacob, who said he\u2019d die before facing off with the government, might just kill all of them rather than surrender to authority. This could become another Waco or Ruby Ridge if it wasn\u2019t handled with finesse and intelligence.</p><p>Laine was FBI. Deep cover. And in grave danger.</p><p>Devon felt tickling on her face and opened one eye. Mercy grinned at her. \u201cMama, you spended the night.\u201d</p><p>She opened the other eye. Jenny was sitting next to Mercy, both little girls on their knees, giggling at her.</p><p>Oh, my, she thought. This is embarrassing. \u201cI just wanted to kiss you good-night and I must have fallen asleep right here,\u201d she said, trying to get her bearings. She sat up. Someone had covered her with a blanket and she still wore last night\u2019s dress. Beautiful. \u201cWhere\u2019s your daddy, Jenny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told us to wake you up. He\u2019s making clown pancakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d she said. She pulled herself up, visited the bathroom, rinsed her mouth and headed to the kitchen. Will was standing on a stool, stirring the pancake batter. The girls were already sitting at the table eating their breakfasts. Scott, still wearing those plaid pajama bottoms and a T-shirt, was flipping pancakes.</p><p>\u201cWell, good morning,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very embarrassed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo need. You were out like a light so I just went to bed.\u201d He lifted a handsome brow. \u201cI trust you slept well?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled to herself. \u201cOh, yeah. Just like old times. Wrapped around a couple of little girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I interest you in a couple of pancakes?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cSure.

I was just reading.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gabriella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping in. I have no idea when Charlie brought her home, but it must have been very late. Sunday is her day off unless I have something going on. I\u2019m on call for Bandon E.R. today and if they call, I\u2019ll need her. She usually spends Sundays studying or with Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could just call me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cHow\u2019m I gonna do that, Devon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRight. No phone. I\u2019m going to have to take care of that. Maybe I should take the kids down to the beach, let them see the flower arch, play in the water a little bit. I\u2019d be happy to do that. In fact, it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p> <p>He flipped a clown pancake onto her plate and she thought, This is so normal. I\u2019ve longed for normal for five years. A few kids, a nice guy in the kitchen, a regular house, work, family...the usual kind of family. She laughed and said, \u201cSo, you call this a clown, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best effort,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of looks like a...squirrel.\u201d She cut off what appeared to be the tail, popping it in her mouth. \u201cNow it looks more like a clown...or a hamster.\u201d</p><p>When breakfast was over, Devon took care of the cleanup and loaded the dishes in the dishwasher. Then she drove home with Mercy and they changed into clothes for the beach before heading to the marina to meet Scott and his kids. Will and Jenny were toting a mesh bag full of beach toys. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was called to Bandon. I could be a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle the three of them, no problem. But I can\u2019t get them all home. I just have the one booster seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can trade cars,\u201d he suggested. \u201cJust put Mercy\u2019s seat in my car. I\u2019ll take your truck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect. Now be gentle with her\u2014she belongs to Rawley and he restored her.\u201d</p><p>The transfer was made and Scott said, \u201cGabriella is at home, standing by, in case I get stuck at the E.R.\u201d</p><p>But Devon was leaning into his beautiful new vehicle. She was smelling the car. \u201cWow. I might just take this baby out for a little spin. Is this new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty new, yeah. You\u2019re going to have to drum up some business for me at the clinic so I can pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a great car. I\u2019ve never in my life had a new car....\u201d She removed the key to the truck off her key ring and handed it to Scott.</p><p>\u201cSomeday, Devon,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not while you\u2019re working for the tightwad doctor, but someday.\u201d He took the truck key from her. \u201cThis seems to be working out well. Kids and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids and all,\u201d she said.</p><p>With three little kids in tow, she grabbed up the towels, the sunscreen and toys. They went about halfway down the beach before they stopped. Devon spread out their towels and slathered their wiggly, excited little bodies with sunscreen. She laughed at their excitement and told them, \u201cWater\u2019s edge, only. No farther than your knees!\u201d</p> <p>This was Devon\u2019s comfort zone\u2014she loved children, especially at this age. She found them precious, hilarious, brilliant, trusting. They could also be very bad, but she\u2019d never wondered what to do\u2014Aunt Mary had had the patience of Job and had taught her well.</p><p>They had all played in the water and the sand for about an hour when someone plunked down beside her and she turned to see Spencer sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the dock. \u201cAustin wants to take out one of the boards and if someone isn\u2019t close by to watch him, he gets out too far. He wants to be like Landon\u2014taking that board all the way out to the mouth of the bay. And he\u2019s fighting us on the life jacket issue.\u201d He nodded toward the littler kids. \u201cThe doctor\u2019s kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s on call and I volunteered to babysit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cListen, about last night...\u201d</p><p>She laughed in spite of herself. \u201cRegrets, Spencer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I offended you, I\u2019m sorry. If I didn\u2019t offend you, when can we get together?\u201d</p><p>A huff of laughter escaped her. \u201cWhile I\u2019m flattered beyond reason, maybe we should talk....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how it might be way too soon for you to think about relationships. Your wife has been gone how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long and yet, a long, long time. And I think you should be aware\u2014I seem to have a drinking problem.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. He hadn\u2019t seemed the least bit drunk last night. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He circled his knees with his arms. \u201cApparently if I drink three beers I\u2019ll do any damn thing I please. Whether or not it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cSo this is about regrets....\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI can be more suave. You should try me.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cSpencer, you seem to be a very nice guy, but I warn you\u2014I\u2019m painfully out of practice at this. And it\u2019s possible you\u2019re just lonely.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her. \u201cDevon, my wife was a wonderful woman. I didn\u2019t deserve her. That\u2019s a fact. And she battled cancer for almost four years. She had brief periods of respite, but every time the cancer would come back harder. Stronger. We fought it together till the end. Was I lonely? Yes, absolutely. If I could\u2019ve taken it on for her I would have. In the end I was glad she could give up the fight\u2014it was terrible for her.\u201d</p><p>Devon was quiet for a long moment. Finally she said, \u201cYou must miss her so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But that\u2019s not why I danced with you. That\u2019s not why I kissed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened; his brows hooded them. \u201cI wanted to. That simple. I really, really wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Devon said. \u201cWe should probably put our energy into a friendship. I think maybe we both have a great deal to overcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I do,\u201d he said. Then he stood suddenly, whistled and shouted to Austin. \u201cToo far! Get back here!\u201d Then he sat down again. \u201cI really don\u2019t know much about you. We\u2019ll work on that friendship thing and maybe...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll tell me about it one of these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you really came from. Who Mercy\u2019s father is. What you\u2019re worried about. Your friends can\u2019t help you unless they understand.\u201d</p><p>Uncomfortable, she looked away. Just briefly. But it was long enough for her to catch sight of a black SUV with darkly tinted windows driving down the road from 101 to the bar. She gasped. She covered her mouth and then checked the little kids\u2014they were playing at the edge of the bay not fifteen feet away, digging deep holes and filling their buckets with wet sand. She looked back at the car. And she started to tremble.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Spencer asked. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She gripped his wrist. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.... I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they here for you? Looking for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to...\u201d She stood. \u201cI have to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stay right here. Sit down and don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll go see who they are, what they want. Don\u2019t run\u2014just keep an eye on the kids and Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who they are,\u201d she said, her face white as chalk. \u201cI know what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen know this. You\u2019re safe when you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Spencer whistled at Austin, giving him instructions to stay close to the dock, and telling him he\u2019d be right back. Then he took the stairs two at a time to the bar, entering from the deck just as a man entered from the opposite door that led from the parking lot. Cooper was not in sight, probably busy with his family the day after his wedding, and Rawley was behind the bar. He sat down on a stool at the bar.</p><p>The man wore jeans and boots and a light blue denim long-sleeved shirt, although it was summer. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and his hands and forearms bore a few thin scars, what you would expect from a farmer or rancher.</p><p>\u201cHelp you?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m looking for a woman, sir. She\u2019s kind of tall. Blonde. Around thirty-five or so. She\u2019d have a seven-year-old boy and a pregnant girl with her.\u201d</p><p>Rawley frowned and shook his head. \u201cShe got a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese,\u201d he said. \u201cBoy\u2019s name is Mark, her son. She has her sister with her and the girl is due to have a baby real soon. They\u2019re missing and I\u2019m out trying to track her down....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing from where?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t answer immediately. \u201cNear Myrtle Creek. Farm near Myrtle Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou family?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMore or less. I\u2019ve known her a long time. I work the farm and we\u2019re all...worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she driving?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take a car. I think she got picked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a number we can call if we see her around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen them, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t been anyone new around here in a long time. My cousin was here last year, going through a divorce, ye see, but she\u2019s gone back to Texas. Anyway, she\u2019s way over thirty-five. You worried they been snatched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to police?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s family business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen her, I\u2019ll just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna leave that number? How long they been gone?\u201d Rawley pressed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just been a day or two, but there\u2019s no reason they should go anywhere. Especially without saying where they were going. It\u2019s a mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to keep an eye out\u2014I\u2019m in this town ever day. And this here guy\u2014he\u2019s in town ever day. You\u2019ll watch for her, eh?\u201d he said, looking at Spencer.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. That number?\u201d He pushed an order pad and pencil toward the man and watched while he wrote down numbers. \u201cAnything turns up, I\u2019ll give you a call, Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnson,\u201d he said. \u201cName\u2019s Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing about this place, Mr. Johnson\u2014it\u2019s real small. One main street, no apartments for rent, no jobs\u2014most folks are either fishermen, local workers or they hold jobs out of town. There ain\u2019t nothing going on.... I been here for years. A couple of women and a kid come here, it\u2019s real obvious. We got tourists, mostly for the beach. And I watch over the beach. If your people pass through, I\u2019m bound to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d he said politely. \u201cAppreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Seconds after the door closed, Rawley looked out the back door and Spencer went out to the deck. He was hoping Devon wasn\u2019t watching the black SUV\u2014that might tip them off. But she sat on the sand, ball cap pulled down, watching the children and Austin, who paddled by them, remained very close to the shore. Good girl, he thought.</p><p>Rawley came back behind the bar and wrote down some letters and numbers\u2014license plate. Then he looked at Spencer with piercing eyes. \u201cDevon tell you about herself?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Spencer shook his head. \u201cThat first morning, when you brought her here, I heard you and her talking. I\u2019ve never said a word to anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Rawley shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s them. From that camp. She\u2019s gotta tell Mac now. And Cooper. We can\u2019t keep \u2019em safe if we don\u2019t know what or who to keep \u2019em safe from.\u201d</p><p>Spencer stood up. \u201cRawley, let me talk to her. We were just getting around to that when the SUV turned up. She got so scared. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d stay upright.\u201d</p> <p>Devon held her breath and concentrated on the kids, refusing to turn around and look back at the bar. Because of the surf, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hear if the SUV departed. Her heart was in her throat; she was afraid as she sat there that Jacob and his men might be sneaking up on her.</p><p>She heard a familiar whistle, then Spencer\u2019s yell. \u201cHey, Austin! I\u2019m back.\u201d And then he was sitting beside her again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, whoever he was. He said his name was Johnson, but I have my doubts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMid-thirties, maybe. He\u2019s looking for someone named Reese.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cShe has a son!\u201d</p> <p>Spencer nodded. \u201cHe said she\u2019d be with a boy and a pregnant girl.\u201d</p><p>She gasped again. They were getting out\u2014one or two or three at a time. But what of Laine? Was she just helping people to leave and then staying behind? And what about the other women? Laine wondered if any of the others would leave of their own volition.</p><p>But were they safe? Would she ever see them again?</p><p>\u201cIs he the one you ran from? Johnson?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>In spite of herself, she gave a laugh. \u201cNo, he works for Jacob, the leader of The Fellowship, a farming commune where I spent the past few years. He didn\u2019t mention me? They\u2019re not wondering where I\u2019ve gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention you,\u201d Spencer confirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible you\u2019ve been gone so long, they assume you\u2019re far away. But what are the chances they\u2019ll see you somewhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty slim, I\u2019d guess,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first arrived, there were more than twenty of us. Lately they\u2019ve been...leaving,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe men had some freedom\u2014they left in those big black SUVs all the time. The women went only to the Farmers\u2019 Market or the produce stand where we sold what we grew. Everything we needed from tampons to clothing was brought to us. I think it was Reese who made the shopping lists\u2014she tended to run things, whether she was asked to or not. She was the eldest woman there.\u201d She blinked. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s gone? That man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Rawley got rid of him pretty good. He was convincing\u2014said he\u2019d been in this town and on this beach every day and hadn\u2019t seen any women and children that didn\u2019t belong here. He said there weren\u2019t any jobs or apartments or anything here\u2014a newcomer sticks out\u2014especially a kid or a pregnant woman. He asked for a phone number to call in case one turned up and then he got the license plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Rawley,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should never underestimate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about him all right...he sure doesn\u2019t look or act like the clever dude he really is.\u201d He draped an arm over her shoulders. \u201cI think you\u2019re safe. I don\u2019t think you have to hide from those people. Just keep your eyes open, all right?\u201d He touched the bill of her cap. \u201cThe hat is probably a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Mercy was suddenly in her lap, whining. Sandy, hungry, cranky. Devon laughed. \u201cA little beach goes a long way\u2014I better get these kids home. I feel lunch and naps coming on. Talk about an interesting morning.\u201d</p><p>On the way home Devon thought about what had happened and was reminded of the promise she had made to Scott\u2014that if anything suspicious or noteworthy turned up regarding her past life, she would speak to the deputy.</p><p>Devon took the kids to Scott\u2019s house and moments after she arrived, he was home. She briefly explained what had happened and asked if he would mind looking after Mercy for a while. She then called and made arrangements to meet Mac McCain at his office in town. Scott offered to go with her and have Gabriella mind the children instead, but she wanted to do this on her own. Because she was terrified.</p> <p>Mac was already at the sheriff\u2019s office when she arrived, but he was not dressed in uniform. He wore a short-sleeved knit shirt with his jeans and seemed to have been busy working on some paperwork. He looked up when she walked in and put down his pen. He stood. He gave her a nod. \u201cDevon,\u201d he said.</p><p>Devon was shaking as she said, \u201cThank you for letting me interrupt your day off. I have a few things I think you should know about.\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward a chair that faced his desk. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>She gave a weak nod. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong. At least, not knowingly. But if I\u2019m arrested or sent to jail, away from my baby, my life is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear what you have to say before we start worrying about worst case scenarios. How about that?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cWell, it started about five years ago, after I had a run of real bad luck in the job market...\u201d She tried watching his features and expression as she recounted the events up to this morning, when the car appeared. The telling took an hour. Mac asked a few questions. Were you held against your will? Were you told you would be punished for leaving or attempting to leave? Did you tend, grow or distribute illegal controlled substance? Are there weapons in the compound? Were there statements to the effect there would be danger to anyone who shared the secrets of the commune?</p><p>\u201cWell, I did help gather and mix chicken manure for his men to use in the gardens and by then I knew what was in the warehouses.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wan smile. \u201cDo you know what they did with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what he claimed to do with it\u2014he said it was medicinal and used in healing, but he didn\u2019t have a permit because he staunchly refuses to have any dealings with the government. By the time he said that it was all medicinal, I knew it was a lie. We lived a rich life in that commune\u2014we had everything we needed. We women didn\u2019t have cars or televisions or computers or jewelry, but Jacob had a house of his own, a private residence across the river. I\u2019ve been there. He has everything a man could want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you sexually abused?\u201d he asked.</p><p>And she looked down into her lap. \u201cNo. He never forced anyone, to my knowledge. He seduced. He promised to share his personal utopia and care for us forever. I hadn\u2019t been there long before I was pregnant and it was then that I realized all the children there\u2014all tended by all the women\u2014were Jacob\u2019s children. He must\u2019ve thought he was Warren Jeffs with a pot garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he engage in sexual activity with underage girls?\u201d</p><p>Again she shook her head. \u201cEveryone was over eighteen, at least during the four years I was there. I tried to leave, but he wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he prevent you from leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides a lock on the gate and a couple of men who carried guns? He said Mercy was his daughter and I couldn\u2019t take her. The guns were downplayed\u2014everyone claimed they were for protection from government thugs and wildlife. And I was afraid if I took my daughter and ran, we might be shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid for your safety now, Devon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I am. I don\u2019t know that I have reason to be\u2014no one has threatened me. I\u2019ve been here for more than a month and no one has come looking for me. They seem to be looking for Reese, her son and Mariah, but maybe they decided to just let me go. The woman who suggested I run said that if things got scary, I should tell the authorities about the gardens. I know she wasn\u2019t talking about the tomatoes....\u201d</p><p>He sat a bit taller in his chair. \u201cWhat woman was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with us about six months, I think. Her name was Laine.\u201d Tears came to her eyes. \u201cI loved her. I loved Laine. I loved Reese, too. Reese delivered Mercy. She was so good to me.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. He leaned forward, folding his hands on the top of his desk. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell my boss about this, of course. And that property isn\u2019t in my jurisdiction, so my boss will very likely talk to someone in that county. But I haven\u2019t heard anything here today that creates a legal problem for you. I have no reason to arrest you. But if it turns out you have valuable testimony, I think I can get protective housing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew wide. \u201cLike secret witness stuff?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a lopsided grin. \u201cLike that, yes. If you need it. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone from the sheriff\u2019s department or another agency wanted to hear what you have to say. If that becomes necessary, we\u2019ll be very quiet and careful about it. Have you discussed this with anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRawley. A little bit. He took one look at me and knew where I was from. I\u2019m not his cousin. He picked me up along the road and gave me a place to stay when I first left the commune. I also gave Dr. Grant a few details when I first started working for him.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI have a job now. I really thought my life was getting back on the rails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think things are moving in the right direction for you,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s stay calm. I have ways of learning whether Jacob and your old community are being looked at by law enforcement....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you can do,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s spooky sometimes. Devon, the very second you think you\u2019re unsafe or suspicious or feeling jittery, I need you to call me and let me know. Don\u2019t run, please\u2014that will only make things worse. Our offices are next door to each other. We see each other almost every day as it is. We\u2019ll check in all the time. Just go about your business, keep a sharp eye, I\u2019ll let you know if I learn something. Now it\u2019s time to let the police do their job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I won\u2019t get arrested? For just being there? Because I thought there was this whole accessory thing in the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an advantage when you come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not lying, you look safe to me. I think you can leave this with me now.\u201d</p><p>She visibly relaxed, as if Mac\u2019s words allowed her to think, for the first time, that the worst of her worries were now in the past.</p><p>Devon was exhausted that evening. Once she got home she locked up her little duplex, gave Mercy a bath, then had one herself while Mercy stayed close and kept throwing beach toys into her tub. She didn\u2019t turn on many lights and they stayed mainly in the bedroom where they even had their dinner of mac and cheese sitting cross-legged on the bed. With all the windows closed up it was getting a little stuffy. By eight-thirty it was getting dusky and the sun was beginning to disappear behind clouds over the Pacific.</p><p>A light knock sounded at the front door. \u201cStay right here, please,\u201d she told her daughter. With her heart pounding, she headed to her living room. As she passed the living room window, she caught sight of Spencer\u2019s car sitting in front of the house. She leaned against the door and asked, \u201cSpencer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door. He stood there in sweatpants and a sweatshirt that had the sleeves and neck cut out; his hair was all spiky and he had a shadowy beard. He smiled at her, showing those excellent white teeth and she nearly melted into a puddle of goo. She was about to ask him what he was doing there when she saw he had a toolbox in one hand and a couple of big sacks from Home Depot in the other.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2014it\u2019s kind of late. And I have a couple of things I think you\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. Some of these paper shades. They\u2019re supposed to be temporary while you\u2019re waiting for your fancy custom blinds or shutters to be installed\u2014but here\u2019s a secret. They last a long time. My last neighbors\u2014young couple living on a shoestring\u2014had them in their windows for two years. They don\u2019t look bad, either. And you can\u2019t see through them. If you stand between the window and a bright light, there\u2019s a slight silhouette.\u201d He handed her a second, smaller bag. \u201cBetter locks. Really good locks. But this is the most important thing.\u201d He handed her a box. \u201cAn iPhone. With a GPS and all kinds of bells and whistles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOh, Spencer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat black car really scared you. I thought these were the few things that could make life simpler and more secure for you.\u201d He leaned aside to smile at something. Mercy was peeking out of the bedroom door to see what was going on. He grinned at her.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in bed?\u201d Devon asked her. And Mercy scampered back to the bedroom. \u201cWhere\u2019s Austin?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHome. I have my phone and I\u2019m just down the street. He\u2019s locked into some computer game that\u2019s slowly destroying his brain cells. He\u2019ll call if he needs me and I\u2019ll be back in an hour. I\u2019m taking him to Dallas tomorrow and his grandfather is meeting us there to take him the rest of the way to San Antonio. He\u2019s going to visit with his grandparents, cousins and friends from our old neighborhood before school starts. Oh, I also have this,\u201d he said, pulling a bottle of wine out of a big bag. \u201cYou might need a little sleeping aid. Trust me, when I\u2019m done here, no one\u2019s getting inside without making a lot of noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone will try to break in, but this is all so...perfect. But that phone\u2014it must\u2019ve cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you have to have this, even if no scary black car is looking for you. You have a child, a job, friends...you live alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking care of business from the clinic on the office phones. I check in with Rawley. I make calls for Scott. It\u2019s been working, but now...\u201d</p> <p>He put the box in her hand. \u201cNow you should have this. It\u2019s a safety precaution. I already programmed my number into the phone. I\u2019m just down the street. I can be here in less than a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted over him and she hoped he didn\u2019t see the attraction there.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI saw that. You like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think just because you buy me presents...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this better than grass cutting? It\u2019s very practical. I\u2019ve always been a practical guy.\u201d He put down all his stuff and got out his drill and tools. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of guy that always changes the oil when it\u2019s supposed to be changed. I put the toilet paper on the roll. I pay the bills on the due date. I think it\u2019s the teacher in me.\u201d</p><p>Why was that so sexy, she asked herself.</p> <p>He knelt before her front door, getting started, measuring. \u201cDo you have a pair of scissors? You can cut those paper shades to fit\u2014there\u2019s a tape measure in my toolbox. Put \u2019em up where you need \u2019em most. And when we\u2019re done here, you should call Rawley, let him know you have a phone now and the doors and windows are reinforced. Is it a little stuffy in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was nervous about having windows open, even though I haven\u2019t been threatened or approached or anything....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I got some window locks you can adjust\u2014you can have your windows open a few inches. Safely.\u201d</p><p>With her arms full of paper shades, she sat down on the couch. \u201cI talked to Mac. He was very nice. He\u2019ll be looking into that...situation. But I\u2019m not supposed to talk a lot about the details...some of the details, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you any more questions, Devon,\u201d he said, working on the door. \u201cI just wanted to do something that would help you feel safer.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything to that. He had voiced the thing most on her mind every day\u2014how to feel safe.</p><p>She got the tape measure and scissors and went to work cutting the blinds to fit the biggest window in the duplex. She measured and cut, then Spencer said, \u201cBefore you put that up, let me get the locks on that window.\u201d After about forty minutes Spencer was almost done. The doors and the windows all had strong locks on them and the windows were covered.</p><p>After checking on the sleeping Mercy she found Spencer sitting on the couch, packing up his toolbox that sat on the floor in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cYou look like you just came from a workout,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn a way. Football practice starts in the morning. I\u2019ve already been over at the high school most of the day getting ready for the year ahead\u2014inventory equipment, settling in my office, that sort of thing. You\u2019re probably going to be seeing a boatload of high school boys come in for physicals this week.\u201d</p><p>She sat down at the end of the couch. \u201cWe already have a lot of appointments booked. Aren\u2019t you going to Dallas tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to be at practice the first day\u2014they\u2019re just going to get equipment issued and paperwork passed out. My assistant, the former coach, and the equipment manager will handle it. But first thing Tuesday morning, the torture begins.\u201d He grinned evilly. He looked around the small room. \u201cHow\u2019s that? Locks and shades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd phone. I\u2019ll figure it out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it makes you feel more comfortable here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve struggled with safety my whole life, sometimes not even realizing it. Sometimes this need to feel safe is the bane of my life. I can\u2019t make peace with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do everything right and shit still happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you know, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealthy young wife, stricken with cancer... Yeah. Shit happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you handle that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He smiled slightly. \u201cI live. That\u2019s what I do, Devon. I live. I asked myself\u2014if I could build a bunker for me and Austin, and live there for the rest of our lives protected from the sun\u2019s rays and all car accidents and maniacs and slippery floors, would we emerge as very old men and feel like we\u2019d won? Like we\u2019d beat the system? Or would we crawl out of that bunker and look around and say, we had long lives, but empty lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you ever worry that you haven\u2019t been cautious enough with your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. I made a decision\u2014worry doesn\u2019t work. The only thing that will work is my best\u2014and we might still have huge challenges. I don\u2019t cut any corners, don\u2019t take any chances, especially with Austin, but being afraid to do anything fun, anything that brings happiness isn\u2019t going to be the answer\u2014I know that. Jesus, Bridget didn\u2019t do anything wrong or foolish or irresponsible. And living in a bubble wouldn\u2019t have helped her. There was a valuable lesson in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how am I supposed to make peace with all of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock the doors. Pay attention. Call me if you hear a noise.\u201d He smiled at her and reached out to touch her nose. \u201cEverything is going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a nod. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure how fast, that\u2019s the only detail.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>After the first night with locks and blinds and a phone, Devon began to grow more confident. The next night she slept and the night after that, she slept even better. The high school boys began to keep their appointments with Dr. Grant and, to her extreme pleasure, he asked her to run the patient histories, create their charts, weigh them, take their temperatures and blood pressures and, for those who had insurance, she filed the paperwork.</p><p>She remained vigilant, watching her surroundings both at home and at work, but she didn\u2019t see anything or anyone suspicious and, over the course of the week, she began to relax. Gabriella reassured her that she was very careful about things like keeping the doors locked when she was minding the children, so Devon did not worry about Mercy during the day.</p><p>When Friday came, Devon took an early lunch break, leaving Scott at the office, and drove to the high school with her lunch. From the parking lot she could hear the football team shouting, grunting and groaning. She walked toward the bleachers and smiled as she heard Spencer\u2019s voice rise above the rest. \u201cHump! What\u2019re ya, tired! Move it! Drop and give me twenty! Sorenson\u2014you lazy bum, let\u2019s see some action!\u201d And he would just use his whistle. A lot.</p><p>She went to the bleachers and sat there, taking out her drink and her sandwich. After pushups, he had a couple of them passing the ball, a few running a couple of plays, a few players\u2014suited up in pads\u2014smashing into each other with him yelling, \u201cHarder!\u201d He was jogging all over the field in his sweats and sleeveless T-shirt, sweat staining the shirt, and she hadn\u2019t really noticed until today\u2014what a fine male butt he had. He was full of gestures\u2014rolling his arm and shouting, telling them to rev it up. Leaning his hands on his knees, bending over and shaking his head as if someone had a long way to go, demonstrating some footwork by rapidly running in place, knees high.</p><p>Spencer was all over the field, sometimes yelling, sometimes slapping a player on the back or giving an approving knock to a helmet. She had headed this way because she was curious, but her curiosity was quickly giving way to an onslaught of other feelings. She was enjoying watching him. At first glance she wouldn\u2019t have thought he had such power. Such strength. And his energy was impressive. Some of the boys on the field were as big as he or even bigger, but he ran them ragged.</p><p>Devon had been an athlete herself at one time. She might still be an athlete, given half a chance. She should have been prepared\u2014his sweaty, muscled, graceful movements appealed to that part of her. She loved sports, always had. And she\u2019d been very competitive in high school. She hadn\u2019t had time for more than working out and running in college\u2014with classes and a job, she\u2019d been too busy. She thought about how fun it would be to play some fierce volleyball or soccer. A pickup basketball game would be fun, as well.</p><p>Then she realized, if she was still here in Thunder Point when Mercy started team sports\u2014which was not too far away\u2014maybe she\u2019d be one of the parents who coached!</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw a woman run onto the track from the far end of the football field. A jogger, she was long and lean with a glorious copper-colored mane, a full bosom, a tight fanny and...and she wasn\u2019t wearing much. Devon coughed suddenly, nearly choking. The runner was wearing a sports bra and tight briefs, almost bikini style, more what you would see on a beach volleyball court than here at a high school football field.</p><p>Maybe she was in training, Devon thought. It wasn\u2019t track-and-field season but that didn\u2019t mean a person couldn\u2019t train year-round. She could be training for a marathon.</p><p>She ran past the bleachers and all the way to the far end of the football field, where she ended her run and began to walk around in a circle, hands on hips, cooling down. After a couple of minutes of that, she began stretching out, touching toes, sitting on the ground, one leg outstretched, reaching for her foot. Then with legs spread wide, she stretched, touching first her left foot, then right.</p><p>Devon stole a glance at Spencer, but he wasn\u2019t watching the runner. He was watching his team. One young man was gaping openmouthed at the woman. Behind him Spencer pulled the towel from around his neck, wound it up real tight and snapped his player in the butt, getting a yelp out of him. The player whirled around, rubbing his backside.</p><p>Devon laughed in spite of herself.</p><p>Spencer blew his whistle twice and shouted. \u201cMile and a half, then hit the gym for weights!\u201d</p><p>The team converged on the assistant coach and equipment manager, returning balls and other training aids, grabbing water then running around the track as a unit. Spencer noticed Devon sitting in the bleachers and he lifted a hand in a brief salute, which she returned. Then he went about the business of gathering up gear with the assistant coach and equipment manager. There was a utility vehicle nearby, a modified golf cart, and all the gear was loaded onto it. Meanwhile the team rounded the curve once, twice, three times...</p><p>This would be a good time to take off, Devon thought. She\u2019d only taken a little over a half hour for her lunch break, but she didn\u2019t want to be a distraction. Like some people did, for example.</p><p>Back in the gym Spencer worked the team hard, supervising their weight training, then he loaded them up on protein drinks and water and sent them to the showers. He needed an athletic trainer pronto\u2014someone who could wrap strains and weak spots while he concentrated on the team. Coach Rayburough said he had always trained a student to do this work. At Spencer\u2019s last high school, they\u2019d had a certified professional with student assistants. Most college teams had physical therapists, trainers and orthopedists. But Thunder Point was operating on a shoestring. This town had a lot to recommend it, but it was not a rich town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Spencer decided to ask Scott Grant about doing a little volunteer time with the team. Spencer could cope with practice injuries, but game night was another story. He couldn\u2019t stop the game and couldn\u2019t turn a wounded young athlete over to distressed parents. He would need medical assistance to help with those issues.</p><p>Then there was that woman\u2014Miss Benjamin\u2014whom he had recently learned was a high school history teacher. \u201cWhat the hell is she doing on my practice field every day?\u201d he asked Rayburough.</p> <p>\u201cShe better be trying to get your attention,\u201d the older man said. \u201cIf she\u2019s not, I think she\u2019s close to committing a felony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we get her to stop that? To say that football is not on the team\u2019s collective mind when she shows up would be an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her? In fact, why don\u2019t you take her out for a drink and ask her\u2014that might be all she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not my type at all. She\u2019s a little too out there for me. She couldn\u2019t be more obvious if she was sending me private pictures on the internet.\u201d</p><p>Rayburough looked him up and down then shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a strange man, Coach. I\u2019m older than dirt and I don\u2019t mind looking at her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know pole dancers who are more discreet. She could wear some fucking shorts around those seventeen-year-old boys. What\u2019s she like in the classroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find a way to get her to stop, without ruffling her feathers or getting her in trouble.\u201d She pissed Spencer off but\u2014even he almost had a woody, so those boys must be a hot mess right now.</p><p>\u201cNow, I gotta have a trainer\u2014where can I get one right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the boys on the job,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring you one or recommend someone they know. There are plenty of boys who couldn\u2019t make the team but love to be part of the action. And if you need me, I\u2019ll train him.\u201d</p><p>Spencer handed Rayburough a notebook. \u201cI put together a weight training supplement that I think these kids should be on. How\u2019s the overall nutrition on this team? They typically get enough protein? They have to force carbs, but they need protein to build muscle. You have any way of watching that? Because we need a little more muscle on that field and I want them well fed and hydrated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI print out a workout diet guide every year\u2014I think you\u2019ll find most of these boys get great support from their families. They\u2019ll provide what you ask for\u2014they need the scholarships.\u201d</p><p>Spencer decided right then he was going to do a little investigating. He could probably ask Landon for input. There was no way a player would come to him and confess he wasn\u2019t getting enough food. But if there was anyone from a family who couldn\u2019t afford the five eggs or broiled beef or steamed legumes or cheese and cracked wheat, Spencer knew ways to supplement that would get a player strong and healthy. He wasn\u2019t going to have anyone collapse out there.</p><p>The locker room was filled with wet, half-naked boys, the showers still running. Spencer blew his whistle. It became instantly quiet as a church, even the water stopped running.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be here at eight tomorrow morning and at two tomorrow afternoon. It\u2019s not a training day but anyone interested in talking about the best nutritional program for energy and body building should show up. And, after a short discussion about that, I\u2019m willing to talk about some plays. I brought my playbook. I\u2019m pretty sure my last team had a few you\u2019ve never seen. This is not required\u2014I know many of you have work and family obligations\u2014don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll catch you up next week if you have to sit this one out. This is entirely optional. Hey, good workout today, men. If you keep showing me your stuff like that, we\u2019ll go far.\u201d</p><p>Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, the entire team was crowded into the locker room, waiting for him. Once he got over the shock of seeing them all there he realized that any of their parents or bosses would have excused them for anything to do with football.</p><p>Now the pressure was on....</p><p>Because school would start in less than a month, Dr. Grant\u2019s clinic was pretty booked on Saturdays. The only serious situation was a laceration on the palm of a fisherman who carried a good many scars in roughly the same place. Devon helped with the treatment and the cleanup and then she sat down and put her head between her knees for a few moments. Scott laughed at her.</p><p>Blood bothered Devon, it always had. Once she cut her finger, pretty deeply, and had to lie down on the floor with a towel wrapped around it until she was no longer faint. \u201cI\u2019ll get better,\u201d she told Scott. \u201cAt least I hope so.\u201d</p> <p>Around three that afternoon, Spencer came into the clinic. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI have an appointment with the doctor.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her computer screen. \u201cI don\u2019t have you down on the schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I just called him. He said he can give me some time. And then, I was wondering, do you have plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Plans?\u201d At least she didn\u2019t laugh out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou. Plans. I was thinking something simple. Relaxing. How about I bring a pizza over to your place. Or, I could take you and Mercy out for pizza, or something else if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t have plans to go to the mall or a movie or something....\u201d</p><p>Devon gave him a smile. She was a little surprised\u2014she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him since she\u2019d seen him on her lunch hour a day ago. With school starting soon she knew he\u2019d been busy. \u201cPizza would be nice. I\u2019ll give Mercy her mac and cheese and bath and we can have the pizza. It will be very quiet. There\u2019s no TV or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I\u2019m looking for. Seven too late?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust late enough. I need a refresh. It\u2019s been a long day in here. There was even blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwwww,\u201d he said on a laugh. \u201cNever expect that in a clinic, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s not with a patient right now so you can go back. I think he\u2019s either in the office or the break room.\u201d</p><p>The minute he was gone, she leaned her chin in her hand and smiled. She\u2019d been thinking about him a lot but hadn\u2019t expected that he would be thinking about her. He had a full and busy life.</p><p>The phone rang only twice while Spencer was talking to Scott, then they came out to the front together and Spencer was thanking him. Then he said to Devon, \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said.</p><p>And he was out the door.</p><p>Scott stood there beside her desk. She finally looked up at him. He lifted one eyebrow and asked, \u201cDate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exactly that. We\u2019re going to have a pizza together tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been out of circulation for a while, but that\u2019s a date in my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer is a friend. And neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Scott shook his head. \u201cDevon, friends and neighbors date...\u201d</p><p>The realization came to her slowly. She had gone to the wedding with Scott, danced with him and yet had not considered it a date. But this time she knew it was, because she wanted it to be. When you want a man to be your date\u2014whether it\u2019s champagne and flowers or pizza\u2014it\u2019s because you\u2019re hoping it might go somewhere. And where, Devon McAllister asked herself, where do you think it\u2019s going to go?</p><p>Her brows were drawn together fiercely, she could feel it. Then she heard Scott say, \u201cDevon, I know you have problems to sort out, but the world won\u2019t stop turning if you laugh. Have a good time. Enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s right,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre we done for the day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d she said. \u201cI have some charts to enter. So as long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll answer the phone and add appointments to your roster for next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to grab a cup of coffee, then head home. I\u2019ll probably see you there when you pick up Mercy. Unless you\u2019d like her to stay over so you can be alone with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, no, thank you. It\u2019s not that kind of date.\u201d</p><p>Scott could\u2019ve had his cup of coffee at the clinic\u2014they had a pot on. Or he could\u2019ve gone out to the beach bar and had a beer to go along with his self-pity. Instead he went to the diner where he found Gina behind the counter and only a few teenagers in a back booth.</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t usually see you this time of day,\u201d he said, sitting in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually long gone by now, but I\u2019m covering for Ashley until four or so. She\u2019s been out on the bay with a couple of her friends and Eric, her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must be kind of interesting, being reunited with her father.\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018re\u2019 about it\u2014Eric took off when I was three months pregnant. We were kids...he ran far and fast. I found him last spring when I was looking for medical history for Ash\u2014I realized I knew nothing about his side of the family and thought I\u2019d better get some basic information. That got the ball rolling and they wanted to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize,\u201d Scott said.</p><p>\u201cI raised her alone, with the help of my mother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like, seeing him again after so long?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe just says a quick hello if he\u2019s going to be spending a little time with Ashley. And he\u2019s not too intense about it\u2014he sees her every couple of weeks. They\u2019re developing a nice friendship, I think. But for me? Amazing how much water has gone over the dam. Life goes on.\u201d</p><p>Not always, Scott thought. \u201cYou know, you and I had a couple of dates, right before you married Mac...\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot any girlfriends? I\u2019m not doing that great in the dating department. And I\u2019d like my life to go on...\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and smiled sympathetically. \u201cScott, are you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife died almost four years ago....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But everyone is different. Maybe it\u2019s taking you a while\u2014no shame in that. Be patient\u2014when the perfect woman comes along, everything will fall into place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to know the perfect woman if I don\u2019t even date a potential perfect woman? I was just building up to asking Devon if we could go out to dinner and someone jumped in line ahead of me!\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed.</p><p>He put his elbow on the counter and leaned his head into his hand. He groaned. \u201cShit. I\u2019m pathetic, right?\u201d</p><p>Gina poured him a cup of coffee. When he finally looked up, she was smiling. \u201cScott, you\u2019ve known Devon for a while now. She\u2019s worked for you for over a month. You keep her three-year-old in your home. If you had the hots for her, it wouldn\u2019t have taken you this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes hots?\u201d</p><p>She nodded gravely. \u201cIt takes hots. Right now you\u2019ve got a real cozy deal\u2014a nice new clinic, a good babysitter, from what you say an excellent clinic manager, plenty of time with your profession and your family, everything covered, everything handled. You\u2019re free and clear\u2014when the right woman shows her face, you\u2019re ready. You\u2019ll know it in minutes. Until you\u2019re really ready, you might not recognize her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not ready?\u201d</p><p>Gina smiled. \u201cYou really want to hear this? Be sure, because I\u2019m not real crazy about saying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay it on me. Please.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over one of his. \u201cOur two dates? Were very enjoyable. You\u2019re a very good date. And I was interested in your life, your relationship with your wife, and your kids. But you talked about your wife through two entire dates.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He was stricken silent for a long moment. Really, he was shocked. Had he done that? He rubbed the bridge of his nose with a thumb and forefinger. \u201cJesus, did I do that? Aw, I\u2019m sorry, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. I was in love with Mac. I had been for years. I just didn\u2019t think he felt the same way, which is why I was very happy you asked me out to dinner. And I mean it, I enjoyed myself. I like you. But I knew right away, you\u2019re not ready to move on. Scott, I think you need to give yourself permission to accept some things\u2014your children are young. You were with your wife for a long time before they came along, before she died. I know you\u2019d like to be in a nice stable relationship again and I know you\u2019re frustrated, but you\u2019re not ready. You still want to be with your wife. Until you run into someone who makes you see a whole new possibility, a whole new kind of life, it just isn\u2019t going to happen. And lucky for you, too, because if you force this you and the new wife are going to have a third person in your marriage.\u201d</p> <p>He just looked down. \u201cYou might be right. But this is getting old.\u201d</p><p>She surprised him with a laugh. \u201cTell me about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent sixteen years between lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of time,\u201d he said glumly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Scott, you have as much time as it takes. Let yourself off the hook. It\u2019s okay if it takes a while to be ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot any suggestions on speeding up the process?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. No. But can I reassure you about one thing? As long as it took you to ask me out, as long as you\u2019ve been working up to asking Devon out, neither of us was The One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And how does that explain Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the short version of that story is that not long after we met, he kissed the daylights out of me and we were both a little overcome. I was ready for that, more than ready. But Mac, whose wife had left him with three small children, was terrified. And he had this secret plan\u2014he was going to use sheer willpower to keep away from any kind of romance with me until he felt safe, like until our girls had graduated from high school and were college bound.\u201d Then she smiled very widely. \u201cI think my couple of dates with you might\u2019ve made him decide to take a risk or two. When it came down to a choice between being together or being alone and safe, he took the chance.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWe were in love from the start. We just had lives that were too complicated.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his coffee cup and sipped. \u201cYou should be a bartender,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes everyone tell you their troubles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d she said, pouring herself a glass of ice water. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t tell anyone anything. But in a few more years, when I finish my master\u2019s, I\u2019m going to start charging for my advice.\u201d</p><p>Spencer arrived right at seven, balancing a pizza box on one hand and a six-pack of cold beer in the other. And the minute she saw him, she could feel her eyes light up, which made her cheeks blush just a little. He came inside and saw Mercy sitting on the sofa in her nightgown with a couple of her books. She looked at him and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Pencer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPizza. Are you going to have a taste before you go to bed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and gave him a shy smile.</p><p>\u201cThen come on, we\u2019ll have it in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>She jumped off the couch and hurried behind Spencer. He was right at home, putting the pizza on the table, opening a beer and asking Devon if she\u2019d like one. The pizza smelled so good she thought she might drool. She closed her eyes and just inhaled, making him laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t splurge on pizza, do you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut I make decent meals, just inexpensive ones. Oh, God, that looks so good. Brings back memories of school days and lots of pizza.\u201d She grabbed plates, napkins and a knife to cut a small slice for Mercy. \u201cDo you need a fork?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? No way. That\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s a hands-on dinner\u2014just hands.\u201d He sat down next to Mercy and gave instructions to her. \u201cThis is how you do it,\u201d he said, lifting a slice and aiming at his mouth.</p><p>And she copied him, but the bite she took was very small and suspicious.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had pizza before, just never from a box.\u201d She took her own bite and almost swooned. \u201cLove pizza. Love, love, love pizza.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou okay with the toppings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, chewing happily. She swallowed and said, \u201cI want to hear all about your week. Your team, your training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you sitting in the bleachers during one of our practices. What did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work them hard. But they don\u2019t look too bad. I wasn\u2019t there long but I saw some decent passes, a few good kicks. And you looked pretty...relentless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of those boys have been weight training in the off-season. They\u2019re eager, that\u2019s for sure. I had a good team in Texas, and a good booster club, but let me tell you something about this town\u2014football is important to them. It\u2019s necessary. It took me two days to see what Coach Rayburough meant about this high school and this town. They don\u2019t have all the advantages of a bigger school in a bigger, richer town. We\u2019ll go into this season with less training equipment, fewer personnel and with a team that has more personal responsibilities than the typical player. The academic requirements to play here are set higher, most of them have part-time jobs and family responsibilities, but they\u2019re committed. And determined. I called a meeting this morning\u2014purely optional on a Saturday morning. Just a meeting to talk about nutrition, weight training and some plays they probably haven\u2019t seen, and every single one of them was there.\u201d He took another big bite of pizza. Then he told her about the trip he made to Bandon to a big health food store to buy a special grain-and-nut mixture, heavy carbs to mix with fruit and yogurt as a start-up fuel. They talked about the importance of minimizing fat in their diets and doing all the other things to ensure their diets provided the correct sustenance for them to work hard on the field.</p><p>He would be talking to interested students about taking on training positions on the team, and told Devon he had asked Scott to be the team doctor on a volunteer basis.</p><p>And she was completely intrigued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m boring you,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot at all. I love football. It\u2019s as complicated off the field as on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis team is going to go up against some big, talented kids. Kids with better equipment in some cases. It\u2019s going to take more than a good playbook to keep these boys safe, strong and healthy.\u201d</p><p>Mercy wandered away, back to the sofa with her books and the blanket she liked to sleep with while Devon and Spencer finished the pizza and continued their conversation. When he took a pause she dared say, \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one watching your practice. Do you have an admirer?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMs. Benjamin? The half-naked history teacher?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew wide and she gulped. \u201cTeacher?\u201d</p><p>He took a drink of his beer and nodded. \u201cShowing her body to the student body. I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s getting away with that in a small town like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy, you\u2019re not happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan. I\u2019m going to remove her audience. When she shows up in her little tiny panties, we\u2019re leaving the field. If I have to, I\u2019ll change the practice schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of sounds like you don\u2019t like little tiny panties....\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cDepends who\u2019s wearing them. And no matter who\u2019s wearing them, sharing them with twenty-five young men during a training session isn\u2019t exactly classy.\u201d He tilted up his bottle again. \u201cDid it bother you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI played volleyball in high school. Our uniforms were kind of skimpy. But not that skimpy. And I ran track\u2014again, we didn\u2019t want much wind resistance so our gear was fairly brief.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile. \u201cYou do like sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? Someday, when I get things together a little better, maybe I\u2019ll get back into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo athletics the past few years, I take it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI lived on a small farm. Trust me, my muscles were worked plenty. But I\u2019d rather play soccer or softball or run to get my exercise.\u201d She turned to look into her little living room. \u201cMy pizza girl is out like a light,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to bed and tuck her in.\u201d</p><p>When she returned to the living room, Spencer was lying flat on his back on the floor. \u201cSpencer!\u201d she said, leaning over him.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention my back is killing me? To say nothing of my knees, calves, shoulders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>He rose up on his elbows. \u201cYes. It\u2019s the same at the start of every season, trying to keep up with boys half my age, trying to make them feel inadequate and competitive so they\u2019ll push it a little harder. Quite frankly? I\u2019m getting too old for this shit. But, God, it gives me a rush. Every new team gives me a rush but they\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re the one who needs off-season training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, I keep up. I work out. They still hammer me when football training starts.\u201d</p><p>She got down on her knees. \u201cRoll over. And remember I don\u2019t do this for everyone.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one brow in question, but he rolled over.</p><p>She started to massage his shoulders, first softly, then with more depth and strength. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better than muscles that are stiff and sore from a good workout.\u201d He groaned appreciatively and she laughed. \u201cOne of these years you\u2019re going to have to stop showing off in front of the high school boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have this fantasy\u2014that each one of them thinks I can take him down if I want to. Don\u2019t give me trouble, boy, because I can sack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgo,\u201d she said, drilling her fists into his back.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t ever stop. Lower.\u201d He stretched his arms out above his head. And she worked his back harder, deeper, half tempted to try walking on it.</p><p>She went after the small of his back, which was tight as a drum. \u201cYou take anything for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo Advil, one beer. I\u2019m thinking about another beer.\u201d Then he yawned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>And then in a swoop that she didn\u2019t see coming, he rolled, grabbed her and she was on the bottom looking into those deep brown eyes as he leaned over her.</p><p>Those dark eyes seemed to glow a little bit. Her hands rested on his biceps and she was frozen, gazing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we\u2019d end up like this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cKind of seemed like your intention....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw you, six weeks ago or so, with your overalls and long braid, I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d kiss you. I didn\u2019t expect to be holding you. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty new widower. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to pry for personal details, but is he out of your life now? The man? Mercy\u2019s father? Are you free from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>He tapped her chest above her left breast. \u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>That startled her; she didn\u2019t realize just how much of a mystery her life was to him. \u201cOh, Spencer, that was over almost as soon as it started. I was afraid and confused and...I was vulnerable and he was very protective and loving. I didn\u2019t realize he was a liar, that he didn\u2019t care about me, only about possessing me, making me a part of his vision, his family, his \u2018Fellowship.\u2019 I haven\u2019t been with anyone since Mercy was conceived.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAnd now, Devon? What now? Because I think you know\u2014my feelings for you are getting stronger....\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to even think about it. \u201cI just want a normal life. Like other people have.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled into her eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cNormal like who? Like Rawley, an old Vietnam vet who spent a lot of the past forty years homeless, battling PTSD? Or like Gina, who had a daughter at the age of sixteen and raised her alone? Like Scott Grant whose wife died just after the birth of his second child? Leaving him the single father of two? Or maybe a normal person like me\u2014widower who shares his son with another father? We\u2019re all just a bunch of flawed people, trying to slap together decent lives with the few tools we have.\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him, her mouth open slightly. She could feel her eyes threaten to tear and she swallowed. \u201cGod. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just completely naive or really insensitive. I\u2019m not the only one who has challenges.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little kiss. \u201cYour challenges haven\u2019t been small,\u201d he said in a comforting tone. \u201cLook how far you have come.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>The landscape of the hill behind the beach took on a ravaged appearance as the earth movers came in and began a complicated excavation for the new Cooper residence. The old switchback road from 101 to the bar was closed and would eventually disappear while two new roads would take its place, making things safer and more accessible. While he was at it, Cooper was enlarging his parking area, which would allow people easier access to the bar and the dock.</p> <p>These two roads were going to cost a small fortune. And that was not even considering the additional cost of a custom home. So why was he standing on the beach every day, watching those huge, noisy, exhaust-spewing earth movers and dump trucks with a big stupid grin on his face?</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t alone on the beach by any measure. Everyone arrived at one time or another to watch the action. Sometimes there were ten people standing on the beach near him, looking up at that vast hill. This was a momentous event for Thunder Point\u2014the development of new land. The town and the whole north promontory was pretty well developed and there were some who had hoped Cooper would sell this land to a resort or hotel chain but, mostly, people were just happy to see it improved. All of this development was bound to be good for the town.</p><p>Cooper had talked to a developer, of course. He had it in his head that he\u2019d sell lots along the beach for single family residential. It was even within his power to lease those lots with restrictions on the size and architectural style of each structure. \u201cI\u2019ll be the homeowners\u2019 association,\u201d he told Sarah. \u201cNo one\u2019s putting a purple shed with a neon sign that flashes Girls Girls Girls on my beachfront.\u201d</p><p>He planned to put some classy picnic tables and grills on the beach. Not a ton of them, but a few. He had an idea that once this part of the beach was further developed, and the new roads were built, they\u2019d have more visitors in the bar. And if they had more visitors, he would be able to add more kayaks and boards as rentals.</p><p>During the dog days of August, there weren\u2019t a lot of people on the beach, at least during the weekdays, so work progressed nicely. And the beach, while the road crew wasn\u2019t working, was completely unaffected.</p><p>He had a vision for this hillside development. Given it was a hill, tall multilevel houses were practical. Lower-level garages and even wood shops or rec rooms would fit perfectly on the lowest level with most of the living space on the second level. Then lofts or second levels could be built on top of that. Anywhere from twenty-five hundred to four thousand square feet, these family homes would have large oceanfront decks and staircases to the beach. That style of architecture was not only most practical but would maximize the use of the land.</p> <p>Even though he had an idea of how many single family lots this stretch of beach could handle, he was still focused on one\u2014his. Theirs.</p><p>Mac drove the sheriff\u2019s department SUV across the beach, stopped, got out and just stood with Cooper for a while, looking at the roadwork, as he did almost every day. After several minutes he said the thing he said every day. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna make a difference. But the beach might get busier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t look like Fort Lauderdale at Spring Break, I\u2019ll adjust. Maybe they\u2019ll buy sandwiches and drinks from me.\u201d</p><p>Rawley came down from the bar to stand with them and stare up at the site. \u201cDamn fancy, you ask me.\u201d</p><p>The men looked at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anyone ask. You hear anyone ask, Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like fancy,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI\u2019d kill to have one of those parcels. I don\u2019t need much\u2014those kids will get their own lives eventually. But I\u2019d take one of those windows. Or the deck\u2014I could use a deck like that as long as it had an ocean out in front of it.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at him. \u201cMaybe you ought to go see the bank.\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed. \u201cI walk into a bank in this uniform and they smile, thank me for the service to the town and offer to set up a little checking account for me. They know what I make, what I\u2019m worth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look at the map together. You pick out one of the lots. I\u2019ll make you a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I can do whatever I want,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Mac sighed. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to be sitting out on that deck having a beer with you,\u201d he said, lifting his chin toward the bar, \u201cand have you remember you cut me a deal and be all butt sore about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like that,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cYou might get like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Rawley interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll buy one and I\u2019ll cut you a deal. I\u2019ll be dead by the time I get around to complainin\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>Cooper and Mac turned together to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to buy a lot?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d Rawley said with a shrug. \u201cIf it made a difference in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you didn\u2019t have any money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you that?\u201d Rawley wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to sell your truck to bury your father!\u201d</p><p>Rawley shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a practical man. My dad, he socked away a little here and there. Over time, it piled up. I got no bills and a steady job. And I have another truck. I never thought it was a good idea to sell that old house. My dad died in that house\u2014it\u2019s good enough for me to die in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I paid to bury your father,\u201d Cooper grumbled. If Rawley had enough money socked away to buy one of these beachfront lots, he sure wasn\u2019t broke, yet he\u2019d let on that he\u2019d have to sell his truck or house to pay for a burial. He sure played broke.</p><p>Rawley slapped a hand on Cooper\u2019s back. \u201cThat was real neighborly, Coop. I didn\u2019t forget to thank you, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were very polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. My dad would be spinnin\u2019 in his grave to think I was ungrateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Ben leave this whole thing to you?\u201d Cooper asked him.</p><p>\u201cI had little use for it. All I wanna do is run errands and mop up now and then. I ain\u2019t innerested in dividing it into parcels and talkin\u2019 to a lot of people about what they can put on \u2019em. For that matter, I ain\u2019t the friendliest proprietor and have no intention of getting any friendlier. I reckon Ben made the right choice, all things considered. You\u2019re the talker, not me.\u201d</p><p>And then he just walked back up that long staircase to the bar. Once he was inside, Mac started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that funny,\u201d Cooper grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d he replied.</p><p>The landscape of the town was changing in many ways. School would start the week before Labor Day. Lou McCain, who had shared a house and parenting responsibilities with her nephew, Mac, for ten years, was ready to move on. Since she taught middle school in Thunder Point, she could continue to help with the kids even if she lived elsewhere. She was the perfect person to make sure they got to and from school, and when Mac or one of the seventeen-year-olds, Ashley or Eve, or Mac\u2019s new wife, Gina, couldn\u2019t carpool the kids to games or lessons, Lou would find a way to help out. But at the age of sixty-one she was ready for something new.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d she announced at dinner one night. \u201cI\u2019m moving in with Joe this week before school starts and on Labor Day weekend, while you\u2019re cooking burgers on the grill, we\u2019re leaving town.\u201d</p><p>There was silence around the table for a moment. Then Mac said, \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over twenty-one,\u201d she replied starchily. \u201cAnd so is Joe, though he\u2019s not quite as far over twenty-one as I am.\u201d Joe was African-American, ten years younger and a State Trooper who occasionally worked with the sheriff\u2019s department. So far there hadn\u2019t been so much as a blink at the biracial connection or age difference.</p><p>\u201cI mean no wedding, no reception, no friends or family along for the ride?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to going somewhere alone. I\u2019m not changing my name, either. I\u2019ve been Lou McCain a long time. I don\u2019t want to learn how to change my signature. And I\u2019ll still help with the kids regularly. I mean\u2014they\u2019re as much mine as anyone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are that,\u201d Mac agreed. \u201cWell. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get this done before football starts,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m missing a Thunder Point football game, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>In Cooper\u2019s apartment, the plans for the new house were always handy, usually rolled up and standing at attention in the corner. Sarah thought Cooper was a little addicted to them. He spread them out a few times a day, made too many calls to the architect and contractor. He had pronounced this as Sarah\u2019s special project, her responsibility since she was leaving the Coast Guard but, so far, he hadn\u2019t been able to let go of it for thirty seconds.</p><p>While they were lying in bed late one night, he pointed out to her that she was almost done with flying. \u201cYou have one more week,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a farewell party and you have to go. This time, no shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t been a problem of mine,\u201d he pointed out to her, since the last time they attended a Coast Guard party she was the one who got drawn into doing shots and he\u2019d had to practically carry her home.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s you and me. Mr. and Mrs. Cooper, beach bar entrepreneurs. We\u2019ll be looking at colleges with Landon, going to Friday-night games, paddleboarding on the bay. What else are we gonna do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBuild a house,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight. You seem to be all over that project. So\u2014what\u2019s the anticipated date of completion on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe date they promise or the date it will probably actually be?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause the rule of thumb is that it always takes longer and costs more than they tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go with your best guess on when we\u2019ll be in there,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say June at the latest now that the roads are almost complete. They\u2019re in but not paved. Damn, those suckers are pricey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do we have money problems?\u201d</p><p>He ran a knuckle over her cheek and smiled. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to have money problems?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows. \u201cNeed something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise not to laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never laugh at you, babe. You laugh at me, remember. But I take you oh-so-seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get pregnant. I want us to have a baby. I want me to have a baby and you to be the daddy. I want to throw away my pills. I want to just go for it. I\u2019ve wanted it for a few years and never dared. But with you, I feel safe. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m almost thirty-four and I want to have a baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Cooper\u2019s eyes got a little glassy. She thought he might be going into some kind of fugue state. He gave her hand a little squeeze and got off the bed and went to the corner. He gathered his rolled-up plans and came back to the bed. He unrolled one after the other until he found the floor plan he wanted to look at.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Can\u2019t you leave that alone for ten minutes and talk to me?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. His index finger ran over the lines. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can add a bedroom or two here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know how many bedrooms to add,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know I\u2019m fertile, even when I\u2019m trying not to be. You\u2019re the x-factor here. So how do you feel? Feel like one? Two? Three? Because I can still take the lot next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you crazy? The second I suggest throwing away my pills you\u2019re building on three more bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>He rolled over the plans and grabbed her arms, pulling her against him. He kissed her deep, hard and convincingly. And long. He didn\u2019t release her mouth for a long, long time. When he finally did, his voice was a little hoarse. \u201cThis is it for me, sweetheart. And I hope it\u2019s it for you. This beach, this town, this house. If you want to fill it up with kids or raccoons, there\u2019s no way I can say no to you\u2014so why don\u2019t we add a bunch of bedrooms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want one with you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready to get started.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll mess up your plans. Besides, I haven\u2019t thrown away the pills yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I can always use the practice....\u201d</p><p>Spencer, Devon and Mercy had dinner together most nights. Austin was still with his grandparents, but would be back in a few days to get ready for the start of school. Devon would pick up Mercy at the doctor\u2019s house and they went home to freshen up. Then either Devon would make something simple at her house and Spencer would join them or, with Mercy in her pajamas and toting a couple of picture books, some color crayons and a coloring book, off they went down the street. \u201cDoes Pencer know I don\u2019t like that pizza in the box?\u201d Mercy always asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI think by now he gets it. But don\u2019t worry\u2014Spencer has peanut butter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like peanut butter,\u201d she said.</p><p>But Spencer had a nice surprise for Mercy\u2014he usually served her favorite meals. Tonight it was spaghetti and meatballs. So while they ate, Devon and Spencer always talked about football practice, or her busy office, with all the kids showing up for physicals and immunizations. They covered town news, updates on the transformation on the beach and anything else that came up. After dishes were done, Mercy was found on the sofa, reclining on her special blanket, leafing idly through her favorite book or watching an old kids\u2019 movie on the hand-me-down DVD player that was once Austin\u2019s. That was the best babysitter Devon had ever come across.</p><p>\u201cI should take her home and put her to bed,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he whispered, leaning into her and kissing her neck. \u201cNot until you have to. Settle Mercy in Austin\u2019s bed with her movie and come back here. I have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m not going to be all that surprised,\u201d she said with a smile. More kissing and snuggling, is what she assumed. They\u2019d been sneaking kisses and caresses here and there for a week or more. But it was so wonderful to hold hands with someone, to not have to hide the affection. She had finally owned up to Scott Grant, who had asked, \u201cIs it that kind of date yet?\u201d And she\u2019d said, \u201cIt is,\u201d with a flush and a smile.</p><p>Devon went back to the living room where she found Spencer waiting on the couch. \u201cSpencer, there\u2019s a bell on the bedroom door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be safe to hang it around her neck.\u201d</p><p>She sat down beside him. \u201cHow\u2019s your back feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs bad as my legs and arms, but I\u2019m up to this, trust me.\u201d</p><p>With his arms around her waist, he pulled her closer and covered her mouth with his. Her entire insides began to smile and she was so overwhelmed with gratitude for having found this man. She put her arms around his neck, leaned back and opened her mouth under his. He moaned; she sighed. She was melting inside; she was melting into him. His hands, large and callused, were roaming up and down her back, then they were in her hair, pulling her mouth hard against his, then they were on her butt.</p><p>She broke away just a little bit and said, \u201cAs surprises go, you\u2019re pretty predictable. We make out like teenagers every night. And there\u2019s a three-year-old in the next room,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank God you have good brakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you go. If you say yes, I lined up a babysitter for your house tomorrow night. A couple of them, actually. Landon and his girlfriend, Eve\u2014Mac\u2019s daughter. I asked them to babysit so I can take you out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe can stay close. Maybe a bite to eat at Cliffhanger\u2019s? Walk on the beach? Whatever you feel like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be people around. But we can spend a little time here without a three-year-old in the next room, if you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>He pinched her chin with a thumb and forefinger. \u201cListen to me, Devon. You don\u2019t ever have to be nervous with me. I\u2019m not going to push you into anything. Here\u2019s what I want\u2014I want you to always feel safe and comfortable with me. If you\u2019re not ready for more than this, then I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer? Are you planning to break my heart? Because I\u2019m starting to care about you enough to take risks that a month ago I swore I would never take.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing\u2014I don\u2019t want you to take risks. I\u2019m a sure thing. You can put a stop to this anytime you want to. I\u2019m not pretending anything, honey. I didn\u2019t think this would happen. But I\u2019m glad it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no stopping it now,\u201d she whispered. She put her arms around his neck and held him fiercely while she kissed him for a while longer. Reluctantly they finally broke apart, knowing it was time to get Mercy into her own bed. He followed her home to make sure there were no problems. Once the doors were locked behind them, Spencer made his way home.</p><p>He was an angel. Not just a very nice man, but he was almost perfect. He was the best of sweet and gentle. He was a fierce warrior who drove his team hard, while nurturing them at the same time. He pushed those teenage boys to the limit, but he also drove himself just as hard</p><p>But they were both skirting the issue\u2014they both really wanted to make love.</p><p>But she was very nervous. It didn\u2019t exactly just dawn on her that she hadn\u2019t had a normal relationship with a man yet, even though she was twenty-eight and a single mother. There had been some high school and college romances, some of them quite satisfying even if they weren\u2019t real long-lasting.</p><p>And then Jacob came along.</p><p>Her genuine worry was\u2014what if she didn\u2019t know how to have a normal relationship now? What if she had this lovely, sexy man and screwed it up? The temptation to back off, to run, was always so strong in her. She knew it came from a lack of confidence and she had been trying to overcome it for the past few years.</p><p>Although Spencer had been through so much himself, he was so much braver and surer of himself. He knew what he wanted. He wasn\u2019t afraid of taking a leap of faith. And he didn\u2019t seem to be worried that she wasn\u2019t quite there yet.</p><p>She was nervous all day, anticipating her evening with Spencer. Scott Grant asked her if anything was wrong and she said no, only that they were so busy and she didn\u2019t want to get behind.</p><p>Finally the big night arrived and, as promised, Landon showed up with Eve and a couple of old board games. Devon wore her best jeans for their date and was so relieved that Spencer showed up in jeans, as well. She hoped he didn\u2019t notice her jitters. Something about a babysitter and a date out in public made this seem official and she so hoped he wouldn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>She was completely unprepared for the mood at Cliffhanger\u2019s\u2014they greeted Spencer like an old friend. They got a table in the bar, ordered a beer and a wine and that was the end of their date as she had expected it. Just about every person in the bar and the dining room stopped at their table, gave her a friendly hello and then either began questioning Spencer about the football team or giving him advice.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Devon. So, Spence, who\u2019s starting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who\u2014you saw every one of them last year. Although I do have a sophomore who\u2019s going to really surprise you. With the right encouragement, he could follow in Dupre\u2019s footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeam captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon Dupre\u2014it was unanimous. He\u2019s got strong leadership skills and is completely up to the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a game schedule yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being posted and published in two days\u2014clear the calendars.\u201d</p><p>When their crab legs arrived, they were left briefly alone. Devon said, \u201cEveryone knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\u2019re out to dinner? Yes. That we might make out like rock stars after dinner? Yes. That I hope I have a girlfriend? It\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think we\u2019re doing it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned toward her and just smiled. \u201cThey hope, just like me and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer!\u201d she said on a laugh.</p><p>He took a drink of his beer. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here too long, Devon, but there\u2019s something I know about this town. Unless you\u2019re a really bad person or someone who stirs up a lot of trouble, they just hope things work out. That\u2019s all. They want their kids to be safe and make something out of themselves, they want their neighbors to get by all right, they want their friends to be happy and they want to be blessed with work. Everyone around here seems to work real hard. They seem to always be pulling for the good guys. It\u2019s so uncomplicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we get together, you think it won\u2019t get complicated?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom time to time it will,\u201d he said. Then he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste a lot of energy worrying about it.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her wine. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be more like that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI know you have good reason to worry about things like this, but I think that\u2019s going to pass. Pretty soon you\u2019ll realize there\u2019s no fence around you here. You have nothing but choices\u2014it\u2019s all up to you. Plus, you\u2019re well-liked here. You help the doctor, have a sweet little girl, have friends who care about you\u2014nice friends. You even have old Rawley coming out of his shell. As time passes, you\u2019re going to relax into a new life and things will work out. With any luck, I\u2019ll get to be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>It seemed as if the second they were done eating, people were swarming by the table again. Cliff came from behind the bar and actually pulled out a chair, sitting down to talk to Spencer about some of the records that had been set in previous years. And when the waiter brought their coffee, he took a seat, as well. He had some opinions on the team he was sure Spencer would want to hear.</p><p>Devon relaxed. This gave her strange comfort, this familiarity. No one seemed suspicious of her; they all seemed very accepting. A couple of times she put in her two cents\u2019 worth on football matters and that seemed to be met with surprise\u2014a girl who knew a lot about football? Then they offered their approval that she should be so knowledgeable. Spencer was right again\u2014these people were just plain good folks. They were a tight bunch, however, and if she did anything mean or damaging to their football coach, they\u2019d behave very differently. Spencer hadn\u2019t been here much longer than she had, but he\u2019d clearly won them over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>And it appeared they\u2019d be having coffee with these folks for a long time.</p><p>Her cell phone rang and she grabbed it in a panic. It was Landon. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d he answered with a laugh. \u201cCan Mercy have some ice cream before bed?\u201d</p><p>She was speechless. \u201cOh, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cNot too much, though\u2014we don\u2019t want a bellyache. How is she behaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good. We\u2019re playing a little Candy Land. And eating ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks for calling.\u201d</p><p>She just gave a smile and nod to Spencer\u2019s questioning eyes. And then the men continued to talk football. It made her smile to herself\u2014any other woman would probably say, \u201cNice date, buster.\u201d But Devon was so reassured by the easy acceptance and sincere camaraderie.</p> <p>Finally, reaching for Devon\u2019s hand across the table, Spencer said, \u201cMuch as I\u2019d like to hang around, Devon\u2019s got a sitter and we should probably get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sure.\u201d Cliff pushed back his chair, the waiter stood up, one of the bar patrons gave a nod.</p><p>\u201cTell you what\u2014I\u2019ll stop by for a beer one of these days. We\u2019ll carry on this discussion later,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Cliff said, sticking out his hand. And then he nodded. \u201cTake care, Devon. See you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>She let him hold her hand on the way into the parking lot. He stopped beside his truck and put his hands on her waist. \u201cYou were a very good sport about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had fun. I think you\u2019re the most important person in town. At least during football season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was obvious right away the town gets behind all the school events. And they love their football.\u201d He pulled her closer. \u201cWalk on the beach? Feel the need to get home? My place?\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek with her palm. \u201cHow about your house.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Spencer had left on only a dim kitchen light. He pulled Devon in the door and it was barely closed when he pulled her close and just held her for a moment. He looked at her in the faint light, touching her face softly, gently. The light bounced off her golden hair and her blue eyes twinkled. He touched her lips with a finger. \u201cThis is as alone as we\u2019ve ever been, I think.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, slipping her arms around his waist.</p><p>He kissed her lightly on the lips. Then her forehead, her chin, her cheek, her neck, her ear. Then he was on her lips again, but his touch was so tender, almost hesitant. And he was kissing her slowly, very slowly. His fingers were in her short hair, running it back from her face, sweet and tempting, kiss after kiss. And then he licked her lips open and took her mouth firmly, but his touch was still achingly slow, gentle.</p><p>He pulled away a half inch. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think...yes.\u201d</p><p>He smiled into her pretty eyes. His hands circled her waist while hers went around his neck and he lifted her off her feet, straight up, so that she was looking down into his eyes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked him in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI was at yes a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands against his rough cheeks and kissed him, deep and hard. Tongues played and he reminded himself for the hundredth time, Easy, young man. It had been so long since he\u2019d held a woman with the intention of making love. Years, possibly. He was already aroused. No surprise there, he\u2019d been aroused since the first week he\u2019d known her. In fact, the minute he\u2019d seen her transformation from overalls and a long braid to more fitted clothes and that sexy, floppy short hair, he\u2019d wanted to get his hands all over her.</p><p>He walked toward his bedroom while she clung to his neck. He put her feet on the floor, sat her down on the bed, then went down on one knee to take off her shoes. He kicked off his own and rolled with her onto the bed, claiming her mouth now with more power. \u201cI\u2019ll go slow,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll take our time with this.\u201d Then he wondered if he was saying this for her benefit or his own. Since he was desperately close to wanting to ravage her completely, he wondered if he would be able to make good on the promise he\u2019d just made.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to even fantasize about taking her hard and fast. If he ever wanted to see her again, be with her again, he was determined to make her feel safe, good, right. Satisfied. Respected. Cared for. And with that in mind, he started touching her perfect breasts on the outside of her clothing while the zipper in his jeans threatened to break wide open.</p><p>And God bless her, she began touching him, his chest, his hip, his denim-clad erection. And he groaned with equal parts misery and jubilation. She unbuttoned his shirt so she could caress his chest and he slid his hands under her shirt. He hadn\u2019t lost his touch\u2014he had that bra clasp opened in one flick.</p><p>And he heard her softly laugh right before she claimed his mouth again.</p><p>He felt like a randy teenage boy, wondering how far she would go, how far he should go. He unsnapped her jeans and with his hands on her hips, began to push them down. She lifted her hips a bit to help and in spite of himself, he growled deep in his throat. When she kicked off the jeans, his hand instantly went to her panty-covered crotch while he dove at her neck, licking, sucking, moaning. She was a little damp and he thought, Yes!</p><p>With no more thoughts of an inexperienced teenager, he pulled her shirt up and away, made the bra disappear and slid those panties off. Holding her breasts in his hands, he licked one, then the other, his hand parked on her mound, one finger sliding a little deeper, massaging, circling, testing.</p><p>So ready...</p><p>He felt her tugging at his jeans and he said, \u201cGot it,\u201d and stripped off his clothes as quickly as he could. He gave his throbbing member a rub and she brushed his hands away and put her own on him. That growl came out of him again and he pulled her close. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. Then she said, \u201cMmm,\u201d and massaged him, gently at first, then with more strength.</p><p>He rose over her, took her mouth in a long, deep kiss and said, \u201cI meant to go slowly for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go slowly later.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou think so, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to feel you inside.\u201d</p><p>He rolled away briefly, just long enough to reach into the bedside table and get a condom. He had it applied in record time and he was over her again, pushing her down onto the bed, edging her legs apart with a knee, probing gently. And then he pushed inside in one long, slow, fluid motion. He held still inside her, listening to her breathing\u2014deep and rapid. She dug her heels into the bed and pushed against him.</p><p>He brushed her hair back from her forehead. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery okay.\u201d She wiggled a little bit beneath him.</p><p>Okay, he thought. And he began to move, slowly at first, holding her mouth, then her nipple, then the other nipple, sliding in and out. He grabbed her butt and shifted their angle so that he\u2019d be connecting with her clitoris; he picked up speed and she began to moan and gasp loudly, fiercely, gripping his shoulders, digging her nails into him, riding him as he rode her. \u201cCome for me, baby. Come for me.\u201d</p><p>She threw her head back, her eyes rolled back, she pushed against him so powerfully she nearly lifted him, and it came. She closed around him, pulsing, drowning him in liquid heat. \u201cLike that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust like that.\u201d He kept at her until the pulsing slowly ebbed, until she began to relax beneath him, and then he went after her with all the passion he\u2019d been storing, three, four, five hard strokes.... And he was overcome. His eyes watered; he ground his teeth; he throbbed himself empty. It was beyond what he had remembered.</p><p>He held himself over her, mindful not to crush her with his weight. It took a few moments for him to catch his breath, to open his eyes, to see her smiling up at him.</p><p>\u201cLike that,\u201d she whispered. She smoothed her hand from his cheek to his neck. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cWe did that pretty well for a first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy toes curled,\u201d she said. \u201cI think maybe I had a blackout.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very all right. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to probably be a pest now,\u201d he warned her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be even harder to be away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Spencer. I\u2019m happiest when we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Spencer pulled the cover over them and Devon lay in his arms, her head against his shoulder. She\u2019d been so worried, so nervous, and she needn\u2019t have been. Spencer loved her in a way that made her feel crazed with desire and yet cherished. She turned her head and looked up at him. \u201cSpencer, what does it mean to you when you make love with someone?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider this for a moment. \u201cDo you want the real honest answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, gently stroking her back, running his fingers down her spine, \u201cin younger days, before I found a woman I wanted to commit to, it meant pleasure. It meant getting deeper, excuse the pun.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it, she giggled a little.</p><p>\u201cI hear there are a lot of dogs out there who will sleep with any woman. I was never cursed...or blessed...with that quality. Sex was always important to me. Meaningful. I always hoped I\u2019d found someone I could love with a purpose. It didn\u2019t always work out for me, and it wasn\u2019t always my choice, either. I had some short flings where I wasn\u2019t the right man for her. I had a few longer affairs that sputtered out and it was no one\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with me?\u201d she boldly asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you know.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her brow. \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit soon for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon? We\u2019ve known each other two months. I painted your kitchen. I don\u2019t go around painting kitchens for women I don\u2019t care about. I\u2019ve been alternately trying to stay away from you and trying to get closer to you since June.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyebrows. \u201cYou were trying to stay away from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly successful at that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why, Spencer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides worrying that I wasn\u2019t ready? That I could be rebounding after Bridget\u2019s death? You were secretive. Mysterious. Obviously a little frightened and of what, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure. But it isn\u2019t too soon and I\u2019m not rebounding and I can wait until you\u2019re ready to talk about what happened to you because over the past few weeks I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that whatever you\u2019re keeping to yourself is a very small piece of who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already seems so long ago and far away, and yet something will happen like the appearance of that black SUV and I worry that it will be lurking forever. I\u2019m ready to tell you anything you want to know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She whispered the story of how an offer of help had turned into four years and a child in a commune with a morally superior cult leader. She explained how her desperation for safety and comfort and well-being had seduced her into believing in him and turning over her independence, her soul.</p><p>\u201cDid you love him? A little bit?\u201d he asked when she\u2019d told him the full story.</p><p>\u201cIt passed very quickly. If you love a person who\u2019s using you, you\u2019re sicker than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you ran,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cI had a brief window of opportunity and had to take it. There might not have been another chance and I was a little afraid that what he said was true\u2014that some government agency would take Mercy from me and send me to jail for being a part of his illegal operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s any danger of that, but I\u2019m going to have to cooperate with anyone who wants information that might lead to his arrest. He\u2019s guilty of a lot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He rubbed her back. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a special place in hell for a man who risks rather than protects children, any children. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be haunted by it for a long time. I worry about the ones I left behind. Only a couple of the women there are completely under his spell\u2014most of us just wanted peace and safety for our families. I worry about what might happen to them. Eventually he\u2019s going to be brought to justice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all have ghosts, honey. Over time we make peace with them\u2014they\u2019re part of a past that was difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want, for it all to be past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Devon? What does it mean when you make love?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cIt means I risked my most valuable possession next to my daughter\u2014my heart. It means I love. And hope I was right.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close, kissed her deeply and whispered against her lips, \u201cI\u2019m always on your team. I\u2019m always your loyal friend, no matter what. If you decide you\u2019re really in love with me, even better. But, Devon, you can count on me either way. I give you my word and my word is good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never doubted that,\u201d she said. \u201cI could feel it.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThen I guess you wouldn\u2019t mind feeling it again,\u201d he said, moving on her.</p><p>Cooper was on dad duty because Spencer was embroiled in football training and a couple of pre-season scrimmages. He flew to Dallas to meet Austin at the airport and fly the rest of the way home with him. Austin\u2019s maternal grandfather, Dale Cunningham, flew up with him to Dallas and he walked with him to meet Cooper\u2019s arrival.</p><p>Shaking his hand he said, \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been taking your vitamins.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cGood visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. And I think I\u2019ve aged ten years. His grandmother is in a coma.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper laughed again. \u201cOne of these days I\u2019d like you and Mrs. Cunningham to fly out to Oregon to visit. It\u2019s not fancy, but we have a good time and some of the best sunsets on the coast. I\u2019m building\u2014the place should be ready by late spring next year. Sarah and I will be in a bigger place on the beach. More room for company, but don\u2019t wait that long. We can always manage something with a door that closes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cooper. You and Spencer working everything out all right? Getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t get along with Spencer? He\u2019s a pussycat\u2014as long as you\u2019re not playing ball for him.\u201d</p><p>Dale chuckled. \u201cI hope you have a good trip back.\u201d He ruffled Austin\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop on the way home from Eugene and get some school things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma might\u2019ve put some new school clothes in the suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, she didn\u2019t have to do that!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, she did have to. His legs and feet grew while he was visiting. The kid\u2019s a weed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Dale. It\u2019s appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Dale Cunningham bent down. \u201cGimme a hug, kid. Your old grandpa has to get on a plane home.\u201d</p><p>Austin obliged.</p><p>\u201cSay thank you, Austin,\u201d Cooper advised.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCall when you\u2019re home safe.\u201d</p><p>Once Austin\u2019s grandfather was on his way to his plane, Cooper dropped an arm around Austin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about twenty minutes before boarding, bud. Let\u2019s hit the bathroom and grab some fast food for the plane. It\u2019s a long flight and there won\u2019t be any food on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it still be light when we get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna get out on the bay. Just for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of time tomorrow. We should call your dad, let him know we connected and are on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him once already,\u201d Austin said. \u201cCan I have pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cooper said. And while they waited in the food line, Cooper texted, The package has been delivered. They had about three minutes to spare when they got back to the gate and were immediately boarding. Cooper\u2019s phone chimed and he looked at the response, Tell the package I\u2019m ready for him to be home.</p><p>\u201cI think your dad missed you,\u201d Cooper said with a laugh. \u201cHe said he\u2019s ready for you to be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe three weeks is too long,\u201d Austin said. \u201cThey need naps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone who hangs out with you seems to need a nap. What do you suppose the common denominator is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have a new school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good school\u2014it probably won\u2019t suck. You\u2019ll make friends easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cOne of your dads is the football coach and the other one owns the beach bar. We\u2019re cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have two dads,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care, you know, but it\u2019s kind of weird...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as weird as you think. People get divorced and remarry all the time. There\u2019s the original dad and the next dad. Happens all the time. At least both your dads are very cool.\u201d Then he grinned stupidly, very uncomfortable with this ten-year-old\u2019s dilemma. \u201cSame thing with moms. I think Sarah is now your stepmom. And a lot of people have seen your dad around town with Devon, who I think he likes.\u201d</p><p>That got Austin\u2019s attention. \u201cDoes she like football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She does. I think she knows more about football than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know more about football than you do,\u201d he said, grinning his crooked-toothed grin. And Cooper thought, We\u2019re going to have to set him up with braces soon. Do we split the cost on that?</p><p>\u201cWatch it, now. I know a lot about football. The town\u2019s gonna look so different, you\u2019ll think I took a wrong turn. The hillside on the beach is a wreck, there are two new roads getting finished, in another week or two, they\u2019re going to start the foundation for the new house. They\u2019d like to get as much done as possible before they get weathered out. And, of course, football officially starts. Your dad says he\u2019s got a good team...and everyone in town has an opinion or some advice for him.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to watching Landon play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019m I gonna sit with?\u201d Austin asked.</p><p>Cooper had a flashback. He\u2019d been the new kid a lot growing up and there was a pang of memory about being at the end of a lunch table...alone. Walking to classes...alone. Wondering who would be his friend and half the time making a bad choice.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not obligated, but I always sit with the McCains\u2014Gina, Mac, Aunt Lou. Sometimes other friends and their kids join us. Once school gets started you\u2019ll probably find your own gang of kids you want to sit with, but Gina and Mac always go early to get a good spot and it\u2019s not torture, sitting with us. We bring a cooler and snacks. And you seem to be a bottomless pit. So until you get acquainted, you can count on sitting with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to meet up with my dad after...sometimes the team goes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make sure you meet up with your dad...\u201d And with a pathetic swirl in his chest he thought, Maybe I\u2019ll even get invited along. Then he realized, he was merely mirroring Austin\u2019s feelings. Empathizing. Poor kid\u2014he must feel very vulnerable. \u201cMost of the kids you\u2019ve seen around the beach will be in your school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to know \u2019em or anything.\u201d</p><p>At least for Austin, it was doubtful he\u2019d face this issue again. He\u2019d probably graduate from Thunder Point high school. Cooper sought a happier subject. \u201cLandon\u2019s been at practice every morning, but afternoons he spends at the beach. I bet he can be talked into taking you out on the bay. You\u2019re about ready to try out your own board, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That got a grin. \u201cI already have. When no one\u2019s looking. No one except Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think no one\u2019s looking,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWas your visit with your grandma and grandpa great?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPretty good. Being at their house... It made me miss my mom....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it would,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get your grandparents out to Oregon for a visit, get Grandpa out on the dock, fishing. Get Grandma on the back of that Jet Ski.\u201d</p><p>Austin laughed at what must have been an amusing mental picture.</p><p>\u201cThink you can show \u2019em how to get up on a board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need something, Cooper. Pretty soon I\u2019m gonna need a wet suit, like Landon has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on your wish list. We got birthdays and Christmas and grades...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrades?\u201d Austin asked.</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cSometimes when you get impressive grades, little rewards show up here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That doesn\u2019t usually happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens? When you get something like straight A\u2019s?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cYou get to live,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>Funny, that\u2019s what had happened at his house, too. But it was different when your mother was dead and you had to go to a new school. \u201cThere you go,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cOne more reason it\u2019s cool to have a spare dad.\u201d</p><p>Devon bought some princess decals and paint and Mercy helped her decorate the second bedroom in the duplex.</p><p>Mercy needed her princess chamber\u2014her own bedroom. Helping to decorate the walls interested her in having her own space, which gave Devon her own space. Devon\u2019s routine had changed, especially now that Austin had returned from Texas. The perimeters of her life had grown and now included important time with Spencer. They saw each other for at least a little while every day, but at night when their kids were settled, they talked on the phone. Devon was pleased to know Mercy had made a positive transition to sleeping in her own bedroom. They now had separate beds and separate bedrooms and Devon could not be happier about it.</p><p>Devon and Spencer came out as a couple in Thunder Point. At first she was reluctant to go public, but she soon realized no one was surprised. They now held hands in public. Spencer would drop an arm over her shoulders and give her a brief squeeze. There was the occasional chaste and socially acceptable kiss.</p><p>As they shared more and more of their lives together one evening Spencer reported that Austin had seemed a little unsettled after his trip to Texas and that he had asked Spencer if he \u201cmissed mom.\u201d Spencer had answered that he would always miss her and always wish she hadn\u2019t gotten sick, but that it was all right to make new friends, that it took nothing from Bridget\u2019s memory to have more people in their lives.</p><p>He later confided that Austin had told him they looked at a lot of pictures while he was in San Antonio, old pictures from when Austin was a lot younger. There were many pictures of his mom, back when Bridget was vital and healthy and rosy-cheeked. Austin told his grandparents that he didn\u2019t even remember his mom like that. And that had made Grandma cry and Grandpa got all moody and coughed a lot.</p><p>\u201cI had to have a talk with them,\u201d Spencer told Devon. \u201cIt was not what I wanted to do, but I had to. I understand their grief. I can\u2019t imagine losing a child, no matter how old that child is. But we have to let Austin move on. A ten-year-old has a hard enough life without being filled with sadness all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Spencer, how did they take it?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cVery emotionally. They\u2019re sorry I was unhappy with them. They only wanted to be sure Austin remembered his mother. But I explained that we have all those pictures and they\u2019re available to Austin if he asks for them. He knows where they are. They\u2019ll belong to him someday and hopefully he will show them to his own children. But I can\u2019t send him to Texas for a fun visit only to have it fill him with dread because it won\u2019t be fun, it will be sad. Of course they promised not to do that again. But Cooper has a solution\u2014we need to send the Cunninghams plane tickets and get them out here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWill it upset them to meet me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re together? A couple? In love?\u201d he asked her, smiling. \u201cI hope not, but their feelings won\u2019t change anything. We all need to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>That was all Devon wanted, to move forward and with each day she put Jacob and the commune farther and farther behind her. She wanted a new life, this life. She loved the doctor\u2019s office, loved Gabriella, the town, the beach, and most of all, Spencer. She had visions of one day being a real part of this Thunder Point family, being a family with Spencer and Austin.</p><p>School started and Austin was the new kid and friendless for about two hours after which Spencer\u2019s house and the beach hosted new friends on bikes. The Tuesday after Labor Day school resumed in earnest. There would be no more holidays until Thanksgiving, but there would be football games. Two a week during most weeks. Devon had not been this excited about how she\u2019d spend her time since she\u2019d been in high school herself.</p><p>But before she could attend her first football game the first week in September, a dark-colored sedan pulled up in front of the clinic one morning. Two men wearing sports coats over knit shirts emerged and came inside.</p><p>\u201cDevon McAllister?\u201d one of them asked.</p><p>She felt her face lose color. She nodded fearfully. She was alone in the clinic.</p> <p>The man who had asked her name pulled a thin wallet from his breast pocket. \u201cDouglas Freeman, FBI. You\u2019re going to have to come with us.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Devon asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to ask you some questions. There must be someone here who can cover for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today, I\u2019m here alone, with the doctor\u2019s cell number for emergencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and give him a call, Miss McAllister. Let him know that there\u2019s been an emergency in your schedule and you\u2019re going to be away from the office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know. We\u2019d like to ask you about your last residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I be long?\u201d she wanted to know, and helpless, she began to tremble. \u201cWill I be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. Possibly not,\u201d Douglas Freeman said.</p><p>Having seen the car parked in the street, Mac walked into the clinic, hoisting his gun belt as he entered. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>There was a lot of badge flashing, but Devon went to him instantly. \u201cThey\u2019re taking me somewhere. They won\u2019t say if I\u2019ll be back. Mac, what about Mercy? What does this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bring your daughter, Miss McAllister. She\u2019ll be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to be taken care of by strangers in a strange place!\u201d She turned to Mac and whispered, \u201cAre they putting me in jail?\u201d</p> <p>Mac took a deep, irritated breath. \u201cCome on, you guys. Lighten up. If you just want to ask her questions, tell her where you\u2019re taking her and when you\u2019ll bring her back.\u201d Then he looked at Devon and said, \u201cThey\u2019re probably just taking you to an FBI Field Office or maybe a police department. You don\u2019t have to go with them unless they arrest you, but if you want to cooperate with them, you should at least listen to their questions.\u201d He gave the agents a brief glare. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to intimidate you.\u201d</p><p>One of the agents glared back. \u201cWe don\u2019t need your assistance, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman is my friend and neighbor!\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe came to me with information that I passed on to the sheriff, who I presume involved you, so stop acting like the goddamn Men in Black. Devon is kind and cooperative and responsible. Tell her how long you\u2019ll need her today. And you\u2019re welcome to use my office if that will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a location. And Miss McAllister will be brought back if she wants to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to come back? My daughter is here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, look\u2014there\u2019s no reason for all this anxiety. Tell me where to take her,\u201d Mac said to the agents.</p><p>\u201cThis is our investigation, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. And I\u2019m the law enforcement officer who brought you Devon\u2019s information. If you want more information, she should be comfortable and feel safe in helping you. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged looks. \u201cCoquille sheriff\u2019s department,\u201d Douglas Freeman said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s easy. I could have saved you some time. Excuse me.\u201d He plucked his phone out of his pocket and called one of the deputies who worked for him. \u201cSteve? I have business out of town. Can you cover the town? Thanks, I owe you one.\u201d Then he called the dispatcher and signed out for Coquille, leaving Deputy Pritkus in charge.</p><p>Devon used her cell phone to call Scott. \u201cDr. Grant, I\u2019m going to have to leave the office. Mac is taking me somewhere to be questioned about you-know-what. Can you make sure Mercy is with you or Gabriella? I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be, but I\u2019ll keep in touch. I\u2019m planning to be back here as soon as possible. What should I do with the clinic?\u201d And then she said \u201cokay\u201d a few times, a thank-you and disconnected.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t quite as cryptic as I would have liked,\u201d one of the agents said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that,\u201d Devon replied. \u201cI\u2019m also getting that you get jollies out of frightening people, for which you should be docked pay.\u201d She texted something quickly.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She finished, hit Send and turned her phone around. She had sent a text to Spencer. Going with the police to answer questions about the commune. Back later.</p><p>\u201cAre you done notifying the public now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn off the coffeepot and some of the lights and lock the door. I\u2019m going to ride with Mac. I\u2019m happy to help, but you guys just give me the creeps. I guess you never heard that story about honey versus vinegar.\u201d And with that she walked to the back of the clinic to close it up.</p><p>\u201cFBI is taking priority on this case,\u201d Mac explained as he and Devon made the drive to Coquille. \u201cAnd, just so you know, they can be very proprietary. It\u2019s their case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s been made perfectly clear,\u201d Devon replied. \u201cThey better be a lot nicer to me or this isn\u2019t going to go as well as they think. I don\u2019t trust mean people, even if they have badges. After four years with Jacob, I could say especially if they have badges. He spent four years trying to convince us that anyone associated with the police or any government agency only existed to hurt honest, hardworking people. I knew that wasn\u2019t true, but these guys kind of make me wonder...\u201d</p><p>Devon continued, \u201cI knew Jacob was a fraud...but he seemed a harmless fraud with plenty of good food on the table and a nice place for me to live in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Mary, the woman who raised me, was devout. We went to church and bible study a lot. I\u2019m not as religious as Mary was, but I know my scriptures. And Jacob didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe his interpretation was intended just to meet his own needs,\u201d Mac said. \u201cUsing religion and the bible to his advantage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is definitely true, but he was so far off the map, anyone who knows their bible would know he was just making stuff up. As time passed, I began to see he wasn\u2019t so harmless. The women in that house\u2014some of them became dependent on him and believed every word he uttered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I still didn\u2019t have anywhere to go or any money or any driver\u2019s license or anything. A couple of people just walked off while we were at the Farmers\u2019 Market, but they didn\u2019t leave children behind. I could\u2019ve done that, but I would never leave my baby.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI was stupid. I got myself into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were hungry,\u201d Mac said. \u201cAnd scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nights were cold back in Seattle,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>She glanced at Mac out of the corner of her eye and saw his jaw pulse. It was quiet in the car for a while. Then Mac said, \u201cDevon, that\u2019s not going to happen again. You\u2019re a part of the town. You have friends. You\u2019ve been a friend. Tell the FBI what they want to know. That bastard has preyed on frightened young girls long enough.\u201d</p><p>Devon was taken to a small interview room with a table and a few chairs...and a recording device. Her two agents, McGrump and McGlower, were there, of course. But she was relieved to be joined by a pleasant young woman, also a special agent, who asked most of the questions. Emma Haynes was her name.</p><p>The process was grueling. She had to go through every detail of how she was first introduced to Jacob and The Fellowship. Then she was asked about everything she knew of the background and personalities of every woman in the family. She had to describe the men, who had changed over four years\u2014only one had been with Jacob the entire time Devon had been there and his name was Brody, big strong Brody, and he was mostly sullen and private and quiet.</p><p>Then she had to try to describe Jacob\u2019s evolution from the man she\u2019d originally met into an angrier, more paranoid man; a man who believed he had to protect his domain from outsiders and the invasion of government and their foolish laws and punitive taxation. There were many questions about the treatment of the women and children, even more questions about the growing of marijuana.</p><p>The interview went on for hours and Devon did her best to recall as much information as she could about every detail of life at the commune, including the little she knew about the actual grow-op.</p><p>\u201cCan you remember how many times you were in Jacob\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour times. Within two months of my arrival.\u201d Then followed a painful recounting of how she had been foolish enough to believe that Jacob loved her. She had listened to his grand plans and had believed every word.</p><p>The agents then turned the questioning to matters concerning the role of the women at the compound. Again, Devon was open and honest with the agents.</p><p>\u201cSome of the women were more agreeable than others,\u201d she told the agents. \u201cJacob never forced anyone to sleep with him, but he did belittle women who weren\u2019t inclined, painted them as not very giving by nature. The only woman brave enough to argue with him or disagree with him was Reese\u2014the oldest in our house. The only women to clean his house were Charlotte and Priscilla, and only when he was in his residence. When Mariah joined us and Jacob began to seduce her, Reese fought with him. But he overpowered her and it wasn\u2019t long before Mariah was pregnant. Getting a woman pregnant thrilled him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have hated him,\u201d Emma said.</p><p>Devon laughed. \u201cFor a little while. Until he started to complain about how impossible his life sometimes seemed, managing a home full of women and children who were expected to be gentle and get along. We didn\u2019t always get along. But we all had one thing in common\u2014no other resources. Nowhere to go. More than hating him, I felt like such a failure, such a fool. I felt like I had nothing and no one except the women I lived with. I\u2019d still be there if I hadn\u2019t wanted a different kind of life for Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us more about the barns where the marijuana was grown. Was it an acre? Quarter acre? Concealed? Did you have any contact with the plants or the transport or sale of the plants?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen inside the buildings through open doors; she knew what it was but none of her duties had anything to do with it. That was mostly up to the men. The women tended the vegetable gardens, livestock, chickens, household chores and children.</p><p>She had to list the names of people she could remember leaving the family\u2014there were quite a few over four years. But no women who had children while they were there were allowed to leave with their child. So they stayed.</p><p>Question after question, and the only one who cajoled pleasantly was the woman, Emma Haynes. She seemed to be just slightly older than Devon, maybe early thirties. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a break,\u201d Ms. Haynes said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get us some lunch. Anything in particular you\u2019d like, Devon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything would be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t like? Something I should avoid? I\u2019m thinking about a half a tuna sandwich, small salad and cola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect. I\u2019m a little worried about Dr. Grant and Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a few minutes to check in. You can use your phone\u2014you\u2019re certainly not suspected of any crime. If you could say as little as possible about our line of questioning, that would be appreciated. I don\u2019t need Jacob to be warned that we\u2019re looking at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he knows?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he suspects,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get your lunch. Make a couple of phone calls and ease your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much longer will I be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have you home for dinner, Devon,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we need any more information from you, we can get in touch later. One long day of answering questions seems like more than enough to expect from you. And we\u2019re grateful for your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have some privacy?\u201d she asked, glancing at McGrump and McGlower.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! Gentlemen?\u201d Emma gestured toward the door.</p><p>They seemed to leave the small room reluctantly. Although it made Devon smile to herself, knowing that anything she said within these walls was being listened to. Still, having a couple of \u201csuits\u201d bearing down on her like that was most disconcerting. Plus, she found them beyond rude. If they wanted her continued cooperation, they might try being a little more civilized.</p><p>She called Scott, told him where she was and that the police had many questions about the commune, which she was doing her best to answer helpfully. He assured her that Mercy was fine and probably didn\u2019t even know her mother was out of town. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, Devon\u2014as job security, I\u2019m saving all the paperwork for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are a givin\u2019 man, Doctor. I always said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Then she texted Spencer, told him all was just fine, that she was answering questions for the P.D. and would be home by dinnertime. He texted back that he would leave school and come for her if she needed him.</p><p>She was so lucky. She had Mac, who she thought might still be in the building waiting for her, Scott, who would guard her child and close up his business if she needed him, Rawley, who literally gave her a second chance...and Spencer, who loved her.</p><p>During lunch she was alone with Emma Haynes and Devon asked her questions about her work. Emma went from a degree in criminal justice to a master\u2019s degree to the FBI and loved going to work every day. \u201cLook at the people I meet, the wrongs I can help right. What\u2019s not to love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can you settle down and have a family?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, though my job might change. Right now I not only travel a lot, I also am regularly reassigned to new field offices. The hard part for someone like me is finding the right man. My whole world seems to be filled with men in law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if they\u2019re all sourpusses like the two who picked me up in Thunder Point today, I can see your problem.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cThere you go.\u201d She took a drink from her soda and said, \u201cThe afternoon is going to be taxing, Devon. We need your help in creating a diagram of the compound, the buildings, the location of weapons, of marijuana, fences, et cetera. We\u2019ll help you with the drawing\u2014I have an artist coming to join us. This is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019m afraid, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For theirs. There are friends in there. Children. Small children. I would never forgive myself if I told you things that would lead to them being hurt.\u201d</p><p>Emma gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cThis is why we\u2019re so exact with the questions we\u2019ve asked. We don\u2019t want any injuries. We will not take any action that will hurt innocent people.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Devon was exhausted by the time the afternoon came to a close. She had done her best to help develop a rendering of the compound she\u2019d lived on and the interior of each of the buildings. She told them as much as she knew and remembered. In the process, she had her first experience with Red Bull to keep her going.</p><p>\u201cToo bad for you I\u2019m not some sort of suspect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d admit to anything right about now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing before we take you home,\u201d Emma said. \u201cSit tight, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Devon wondered how much more they could possibly want to know. Just then the door to the little interview room opened and Devon looked up to see Reese standing there. She jumped to her feet so suddenly her chair tipped over; she gasped and tears sprang to her eyes. She rushed into Reese\u2019s comforting arms, holding her fiercely.</p><p>\u201cThere now, little darling. I guess this means you\u2019re glad to see me?\u201d</p><p>Devon backed away slightly and looked into Reese\u2019s smiling eyes. She touched her hair, now shortened like her own. But while Devon had cut hers short, leaving her with that slightly wild mop, Reese\u2019s blond hair curled at her chin. Reese was beautiful beyond words; Devon had always loved her, since the first day they\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know they had you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have me, darling. I came to the police and asked for help. I\u2019m living in a safe place in another city. I\u2019m looking for work. I\u2019ll stay there until this whole thing is resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it be resolved?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to get the women and children safely out of there before there\u2019s any kind of conflict between Jacob and the law. I have no idea how that can be done,\u201d Reese said. \u201cThe police don\u2019t confide in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPilly will never leave him,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cI worry about that, too,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Mariah?\u201d</p><p>Reese smiled and her face lit up. \u201cShe\u2019s with a family. She delivered a healthy son just last week. She\u2019s safe and has a good place with people who can help her rebuild her life. I left Mark with her for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working for a doctor in a little town not far from here and I saw one of them come in the black SUV,\u201d Devon said. \u201cThey were asking if anyone had seen you and Mariah.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThey never asked about me. I think maybe they don\u2019t care that I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jacob cares. He was in a rage. They left and went looking for you. I have no idea what went on there when I left with Mariah and Mark. I hate to think about it. I managed his family for him and Mariah was not only the youngest woman there, but she was pregnant. I can imagine Jacob just about lost his mind.\u201d She shook her head sadly. \u201cDevon, there\u2019s so much more history to that place than you know\u2014we\u2019ll talk about it someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we see each other again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, giving her hair a pat. \u201cI don\u2019t know when, but we will see each other again. Tell me about your life now. Are you safe? Happy?\u201d</p><p>Devon nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing. An old guy picked us up and took us in. He kept us in his home for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Reese frowned. \u201cDoes he dominate you?\u201d</p><p>Devon smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing like Jacob, nothing at all. He said he\u2019d had hard luck most of his life and he was just giving back. He pointed me in the direction of a possible job and I got it. I found a small place to rent, I share a babysitter with my boss, filled the little house with secondhand furnishings. I put in a lot of hours for the doctor, but I do a good job for him and he lets me know he sees it. It\u2019s a small place\u2014people get to know each other easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably get some counseling....\u201d</p><p>Devon laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can work that into the budget someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to think about it. Jacob worked so hard at making all the women think they had nothing, no options, no ability to do anything but exist inside his fence. That\u2019s a lot to overcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in counseling?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s helping. I\u2019ll tell you more about that when we see each other next. We really can\u2019t be in touch right now, but I hope it won\u2019t be too long before...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Devon asked. \u201cCan\u2019t we talk on the phone sometimes? Maybe meet here? Jacob would never come near a police building!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we want the FBI to finish what they started, we need to just live quiet lives until it\u2019s over. Then we can see each other again. I hope it\u2019s not too long.\u201d</p><p>Just as she suspected, Mac was waiting for her to take her home. He had gone back to Thunder Point, but returned for her. When they were in the department car he asked, \u201cWas it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the most exhausting day of my life,\u201d Devon said. \u201cThey wanted details about each person that I\u2019m not even sure I remember accurately. Basically we were slaves and we had a mostly benevolent master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cMostly. Let\u2019s face it\u2014he\u2019s a drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>Mac tapped his wedding ring on the steering wheel. \u201cI think, a major drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out her phone. How had she lived so long without this ability to communicate so easily, so rapidly? \u201cAnd I miss some of the women and kids so much,\u201d she said to Mac.</p><p>She texted her boss and Spencer to say she was headed home. By the time Mac pulled up in front of his office, the clinic was dark. \u201cListen, Devon,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat you did today was brave. And it was right. You could\u2019ve given us all a different name, hidden right in plain sight, started a new life here and disappeared from your past. Coming to me, cooperating with the feds, that was brave.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a weak smile. \u201cI hope it was also smart,\u201d she said.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Cooper\u2019s little apartment over the bar had one bedroom. When it was his turn to keep Austin overnight so Spencer could have a life, Austin slept in the same room with Cooper and Sarah\u2014on the pull-out sofa. It was not optimal. Not only was there no nooky on such nights, but Austin snored like a freight train. He also flopped around on that bed like a fish on the dock.</p><p>Cooper wanted to impose on Landon to keep the little guy in the toy hauler, but when he even led up to such a request Landon cleared his throat, lifted a brow and smirked. Then Austin asked Cooper, \u201cHow old do I have to be before I get a man cave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery old,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>The upside was, Austin did make friends right away because Austin was connected with one of the most important people in the town\u2014his own dad. Kids from school only had to see him at the first high school football game to get the message\u2014Austin\u2019s dad was the coach and Austin sat with Mac, Cooper and the others. But instead of Austin being lured away to hang with kids his own age, all the kids who liked the new kid wanted to sit with the in crowd.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you enjoyed having Austin around,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m nuts about Austin. But I would like to have him sleeping down the hall. So I can be myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sex maniac,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was your favorite part,\u201d he said, grinning lasciviously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly deprived,\u201d she pointed out to him.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he could admit. In fact, since Sarah had bid farewell to the Coast Guard, her days and nights were her own. The September air was still mild and autumn on the beach brought a whole new energy\u2014the after-game campfires had begun and the night was alive with the sounds of teenagers. Cooper dimmed the lights in the bar by ten o\u2019clock to keep the action down on the beach rather than running up and down the stairs for drinks. But he liked to sit with his wife on the deck and watch the partying. Thunder Point had scored a big win over one of their rival schools tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI think I was deprived by not growing up on a beach like this one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have so much fun down there.\u201d He grabbed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re a little crowded here, but I like the nights. Especially football nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have almost as much trouble coming down after watching Landon play as he does,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLet me get you a glass of wine,\u201d he said, moving as if to get up.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything? I\u2019m going to get a beer.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWater would be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said, going inside. He grabbed a beer and bottled water and was back on the deck before he began to wonder. He handed her the water. \u201cNo wine?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. Then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre you already pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a test yet, but I think so. Boy, I give you a job to do and you don\u2019t waste any time.\u201d And she laughed.</p><p>He sat down beside her and just looked at her beautiful face. He was stunned. He reached a gentle hand to tenderly cup her cheek and jaw and she covered his hand with hers. \u201cWhen will we know for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could try a pregnancy test now, but in several more days or even a week, the results will be more accurate. I\u2019m barely late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was my idea, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said reverently. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a father this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should ask if you\u2019re okay with it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI must be,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to carry you upstairs and make love to you. Now. I want to, I really do.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cCooper, does everything translate into sex for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything to do with you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell my dad. And Mac\u2014Mac is good for cigars. Landon\u2019s going to get a kick out of this. And Rawley, who thinks I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little while,\u201d she said. \u201cEarly pregnancy can be kind of iffy and I don\u2019t want to get everyone all excited and then have to start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a little while?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cThree months?\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his chair. \u201cSarah, I\u2019ll never make it that long.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him for a long moment. \u201cI guess you won\u2019t, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel all right, baby?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI feel very excited. Very happy. Thank you, Cooper, my love. You\u2019re very efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, huh? Come on, let\u2019s go to bed. Just on the off chance I haven\u2019t knocked you up yet, this would be a backup plan.\u201d</p><p>Lou McCain had married on something of a whim. Once her nephew, Mac, had taken a wife, the woman he\u2019d been in love with for years, Lou knew she was not quite so essential to his household. She\u2019d spent ten years living with him and helping him raise his children, but now Gina was in residence. And everyone knew, one woman to a household was a rule worth paying attention to. So she gave in to Joe\u2019s pleas to say I do. And she did.</p><p>Joe lived in a nice bedroom community between Thunder Point and Coquille in a house just right for a couple. It wasn\u2019t fancy, but it was perfect with a master bedroom large enough to keep them from tripping over each other. It was a little on the masculine side with leather furniture, dark wood and bold colors like rusty red, dark blue and army-green. He offered her a free hand with decorating, but she liked that it looked perfect for him. Lou took over the second bathroom down the hall\u2014she pointed out that she was too \u201cmature\u201d to be sharing bathroom space. Plus, they were on slightly different schedules\u2014four days a week Joe would go to work at 2:00 p.m. and get home at midnight, sometimes later. And Lou worked five days a week in the Thunder Point middle school from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Joe was usually sleeping in while she was getting ready for work.</p><p>But the best part? He loved to cook. When they had their three evenings a week together, he was in the kitchen. Lou was capable of getting something on the table, but she\u2019d just spent a decade working full-time, chasing kids, feeding her hulking nephew and his family. It had been the same dozen or so dinners for as long as she could remember, and she took every shortcut she could get away with, from spaghetti sauce in the jar to frozen pizzas.</p><p>She continued to spend a great deal of time in Thunder Point, helping Mac and Gina with the kids\u2019 activities. She wouldn\u2019t miss a high school football game for anything. And there were also her girlfriends, who she was enjoying even more lately because they envied her.</p><p>She met Carrie and Ray Anne for a glass of wine before meeting Mac, Gina and the kids at the game. They sat at the bar in Cliffhanger\u2019s and Carrie asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best part about marriage so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat none of the things I worried about are happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she pushed.</p><p>\u201cI thought there might be big adjustments. I\u2019m edging toward sixty-two and have never been married\u2014I\u2019ve never even lived with a man. I might\u2019ve shared a house with Mac and the kids, but I had my own space and no one dared invade it. I thought Joe might get under my skin, being around a lot. I thought I might annoy him....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Ray Anne said a little spitefully.</p><p>Lou flashed her a small smile. They\u2019d spent many years as rivals and now were dueling friends. \u201cHe adores me,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>Ray Anne leaned an elbow on the bar and put her head in her hand. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have some stud sneak into my bed around midnight?\u201d</p><p>Lou put her hand over Ray Anne\u2019s and frankly, she didn\u2019t understand it herself. Ray Anne was perpetually sexy with her boobs, tight skirts, jeans and heels. But she said, \u201cBecause you have sinned and you must repent.\u201d Then she grinned at Ray Anne. \u201cNow who\u2019s going to the game with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go till halftime,\u201d Carrie said. Mornings in the deli came early for Carrie\u2014she rarely stayed out late.</p><p>\u201cI can stay for the game,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cAnd for your information, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve sinned enough. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>As usual, most of Thunder Point turned out for the game and while the marching band played on the field, the women found their usual spot, reserved by Mac and Gina, Cooper and Sarah, Austin and Devon and Mercy. The stands were teeming with fans and their girls, Eve and Ashley, were down on the field with the other cheerleaders, warming up the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to have a sky box,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cPut it on your Christmas wish list,\u201d Mac advised.</p><p>But what Lou was thinking was that she had everything she\u2019d ever imagined wanting. She pulled Dee Dee, Mac\u2019s youngest, close, hugging her and asked her if she was warm enough. Then she joined her group in cheering as the team ran onto the field and the game began. No one enjoyed high school football more than this town. Two hours later, celebrating a nice big win, Lou was saying good-night to friends and family and driving toward Coquille to a little house on Bayberry Road.</p><p>She walked into the kitchen through the garage. He\u2019d left the light under the microwave on for her and she would leave it on for him. She took a deep breath and felt that amazing sense of being where she was supposed to be. After all the years either on her own or with Mac\u2019s family, she was really home.</p><p>Lou had certain rituals. She put on her pajamas, texted Joe to say she was home, sat on the bed with the TV on and a book in her lap. When she was at Mac\u2019s she hid in her room in the evenings to get a break from kids. After teaching all day and dealing with nieces and a nephew after school till almost bedtime, she needed a little time to herself. Now she shared the space with Joe.</p><p>Her light was off by eleven-thirty and she dozed, but at twelve-thirty she heard him come into the bedroom. He was quiet while getting out of his trooper uniform, but she stole a peek. Lou really thought he was too handsome for her, but he was persistent and convincing and here they were. He got down to nothing\u2014forget pajamas or boxers. He liked sleeping nude.</p><p>He curled around her and she wiggled against him. He chuckled deeply.</p><p>\u201cSo, you are awake,\u201d he said. \u201cGood.\u201d He gave her shoulder a tug and she was on her back.</p><p>\u201cLotta bad guys tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo idiots and a few dipshits. Uneventful.\u201d Then he kissed her. \u201cMmm. Perfect.\u201d He pushed against her. She could feel his grin against her lips. \u201cLet\u2019s get you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need to sleep,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Then sleep naked.\u201d</p><p>She touched his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised by this,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a little afraid we wouldn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve never shared space with a lover. Never. I wondered if I\u2019d get claustrophobic or maybe drive you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do drive me crazy. Who won tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she said, sliding off her pajamas. \u201cWe have tomorrow off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have Aunt Lou duties?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s always possible someone could call, looking for help with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they don\u2019t call before six,\u201d he said. He never complained about her familial obligations. With two grown children, he had his own to think about.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can recall, you\u2019re the only person in my life who\u2019s been able to tolerate me before six.\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cBecause I love all of you. And I\u2019m a damn lucky man.\u201d</p><p>Eric Gentry had a date with his new daughter, seventeen-year-old Ashley James. He hadn\u2019t known she existed until last spring when her mother sought him out in search of medical history from his side of the family. Oh, he\u2019d been more than aware that Gina told him she was pregnant almost eighteen years ago, but his life had taken a bad turn at about that same time and being the young fool he had been, he\u2019d never confirmed that she really had been pregnant or that she\u2019d chosen to have the baby. He rationalized that if he\u2019d been Gina, pregnant with such a loser\u2019s baby, he probably wouldn\u2019t have taken the chance.</p><p>But...Gina had brought their child to life and raised her, and had done an amazing job with just the help of her mother. And he\u2019d missed his daughter\u2019s entire childhood, but he could see very clearly that she\u2019d probably turned out so well because he hadn\u2019t been involved. Seems it had taken him a lot longer to grow up than it had taken Gina.</p><p>He was due to pick up Ashley at noon at her new residence, the McCain household. Gina and Mac had married and combined families and Ashley seemed to be very happy. He\u2019d offered to take her to lunch and a little shopping in Bandon. School had just started and he wanted to contribute a little something. Like school clothes. Gina was okay with that idea, except... \u201cDon\u2019t throw a lot of money around, please,\u201d she had asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve always lived on a tight budget and it works for us. I\u2019d rather you be generous with your time than your big bucks.\u201d</p><p>First, he\u2019d never had big bucks, so that wasn\u2019t going to be a problem. But he also hadn\u2019t had that much time, owning his own business. Then everything in his life started to change, and it felt like a chain reaction had begun. His relationship had fallen apart and he was on his own again. His auto body and restoration shop had grown successful and someone wanted to buy it\u2014for an offer impossible to ignore. There was a small service station with potential that had been for sale for months in Thunder Point and he had come to look it over. For the second time.</p><p>But that family he had run from so many years ago lived here. He liked the idea that he could see more of Ashley; maybe watch her cheer a game or two, maybe be in the crowd when she graduated. But he wasn\u2019t sure Ashley, or Gina for that matter, had any interest in seeing more of him. Even though everyone had settled into their lives, having the biological father show up could really bring attention to the fact that Ashley had been born out of wedlock. And her father was an ex-con. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Eric went to the service station and had his Jeep SUV gassed up. He pulled over to the side of the station and went into the garage to have a chat with Norm Sileski who had owned and worked this station for about forty-five years. He had a couple of grown sons who didn\u2019t want it. It was far beneath Eric\u2019s standards\u2014it was run-down, dirty, greasy, broken down and weathered. But it was the only game in town, had room on the lot to expand and Norm did most of the car repair in town. Eric suspected people got their gas other places when they could; he was a little high-priced. He\u2019d looked over the P&amp;L reports\u2014Norm made a decent living.</p><p>And no one knew better than Eric how to turn a run-down dump like this into a first-rate business. He\u2019d already done it once in Eugene. He\u2019d expected to be there for the rest of his life. But then some rich guy who wanted a chain of body shops came along and...</p> <p>\u201cYou need new pumps there, Norm,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cNeed new everything, Mr. Gentry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not putting another dime in this place to pretty it up. I\u2019m headed for seventy years old. Fast.\u201d And then he grinned. \u201cYou buy this place, I\u2019ll turn a wrench for you part-time as long as I\u2019m upright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to enjoy your retirement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I do. If Mrs. Sileski has her way, I\u2019ll be going on cruises and traveling to countries where I don\u2019t speak the language. Just gimme a wrench.\u201d</p><p>Eric laughed at him. He asked a few more questions\u2014who were his employees, mechanics, cleanup crew; had he ever kept a tow truck at the station; who was his distributor? They chatted about the weather for a little while. Eric asked Norm if he\u2019d lived in Thunder Point his whole life and how he liked it. \u201cLike it fine if you can take having everybody and their brother in your business all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Hmm, Eric thought. That might be a downside, especially for someone like Ashley. And her mother.</p><p>He was a little early when he got to the McCain home to pick up Ashley. The place was alive with activity. Mac was rushing off with his son, Ryan. Eve McCain and her boyfriend were taking the youngest, Dee Dee, to her dance class, Gina was still at work. Everyone said hello, shook his hand and carried on. And Ashley was ready. \u201cThis is a typical Saturday,\u201d she said. \u201cI usually have cheer practice, but we won last night\u2019s game and that bought us a day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, but I never shop after food. Can you make it another couple of hours? Two at the latest?\u201d</p><p>He thought he might faint by then. Of course if he had his hands in an engine or was in the paint bay or hammering out a classic car bumper, he could forget to eat. But, trying to play the good father, he was going shopping.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cJust lead the way.\u201d</p> <p>Eric hated shopping. He usually went about twice a year\u2014once for a bunch of clothes, underwear and socks and the second time to buy Christmas presents. But there was something about shopping with the daughter he hadn\u2019t known he had that was a whole new experience, and it was energizing. She tried on everything; she was very particular. And as if she was spending her own money, she was painfully frugal. She turned away many items even after he said he could well afford them. Her choices were mostly sale items. In the end she had a very full shopping bag for a grand total of $247.68. Most girls her age would have taken advantage of an opportunity like this. After all, he owed her.</p><p>\u201cShoes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cStarving. There\u2019s a Red Robin around the corner.\u201d</p><p>They got a booth and wasted no time in ordering. And while they waited for food, Eric asked about school and about Frank, two things he asked about whenever he talked to her. When he\u2019d first learned of Ashley and first met her she\u2019d been going through a painful teenage broken heart\u2014her serious boyfriend had gone off to college and found himself a new girl, throwing Ashley into a very vulnerable depression. That was, in fact, the reason Gina came looking for him. She\u2019d been so worried about Ashley she thought it made sense to find out if things like depression ran in Eric\u2019s family.</p><p>And then in one of those fateful episodes no one can plan or even guess, one of the people to help her pull out of it was Crawford Downy\u2019s younger brother, Frank.</p><p>\u201cFrank is good,\u201d she said. \u201cHe already has scholarship offers. He calls himself a nerd, but he\u2019s not really. Well, yes, I guess he is. But he\u2019s so interesting and so cute I forget about that. Besides, he\u2019s the nicest person in the world. And to think I wouldn\u2019t even really know him if Downy hadn\u2019t dumped me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that like? Dating an ex\u2019s brother?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes awkward. Thank God Downy went back to State. We see him around town when he\u2019s home for a visit and Frank swears Downy doesn\u2019t give him a hard time. I bet Frank would swear that even if it weren\u2019t true\u2014he\u2019s so protective. I think Frank is going to go to MIT. I\u2019ve lived in Thunder Point my whole life and not too many people I know scored that kind of education just based on brains. We\u2019ve turned out some decent athletes, but nothing like what Frank\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to community college in Coquille for at least a year, maybe two. I\u2019m just not quite ready to move away. Almost, though. I haven\u2019t decided where I want to go to school after that, but I can\u2019t wait to visit Frank on the East Coast. Something there might get my interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll come back to Thunder Point after college?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI have no idea what to study! I took one of those tests to show you what you\u2019re most interested in and have the best aptitude for and guess what it came up with? Coroner!\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cTalk about job security. Always a need for coroners, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so. Although I do like to watch TV shows like Rizzoli &amp; Isles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just interested in science. Maybe you\u2019ll be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I could,\u201d she said. \u201cBut every time I think about twelve years or so of college and residency, I think\u2014gimme a break.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed and right then their burgers arrived. \u201cI didn\u2019t even finish high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d she said. And then she did what so many females did\u2014she rearranged her sandwich, moving the lettuce, tomatoes around, making it all neat and then cutting it in half. \u201cAnd you have a little college.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten his GED in prison. He\u2019d taken a few more courses, mainly to pass the time, never having any idea he\u2019d one day own his own business. \u201cAnd Frank?\u201d</p><p>She took a dainty bite of her burger, wiped her mouth, swallowed. \u201cI think Frank might run the world someday. He\u2019ll be like the head of NASA or something. If he had the slightest interest in politics, he\u2019d be the president. You just have no idea....\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. He\u2019d met Frank. Nice kid, very cordial and respectful. But Eric hadn\u2019t been as dazzled by his big brain as Ashley apparently was. Then again, Frank hadn\u2019t really been showcasing his brain. He\u2019d been paddleboarding. And Eric had been studying his physique and the way he looked at Ashley. Frank really cared about his daughter. It was a very odd feeling.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s going on in the car business?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDay to day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an interesting development. Some guy wants to buy my business. He\u2019s been in contact several times over the past year. I\u2019ve been ignoring him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding? That\u2019s very cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it is. My lack of interest just makes him want it more. I\u2019m kind of proud of that\u2014that some guy with money is impressed with the shop. With the help of some friends, I built it from nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d never sell it.\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cPart of me thinks that would be crazy, starting over now after all the work I put in. Another part says, take the money and run. I could do it again. In fact I\u2019ve been looking around to see if there\u2019s anything out there.\u201d</p><p>She got a panicked look on her face. She swallowed. \u201cWould you be farther away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, funny you should ask,\u201d he said. He hadn\u2019t meant to bring the subject up like this, but he told himself he\u2019d learn a lot just from Ashley\u2019s expression. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility in Thunder Point.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled, it was unmistakable. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can confirm\u2014I haven\u2019t even decided it makes sense to sell the shop. But Thunder Point...the question is, is that little town big enough for both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley, it\u2019s one thing for me to spend a couple of hours there every so often. It would be another matter to have me there all the time. It would probably raise questions about our history. About your birth. It could be uncomfortable for you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cEric, everyone in town knows my mom wasn\u2019t married when I was born. I\u2019ve introduced you as my biological father even though I think you\u2019ll always be Eric to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be teased or criticized for having a father who served time in prison....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t mentioned that to hardly anyone, just my best friend, who is now my stepsister. And I\u2019m sure my mom told Mac. I don\u2019t know if anyone else knows, but I don\u2019t really care what anyone says about that. It\u2019s not on me, Eric. But I can understand if it bothers you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I gave up trying to conceal my past a long time ago. I sure don\u2019t brag about it, but if it comes out I don\u2019t deny it. But your mom, Ashley. She\u2019s in a new marriage.... Having an old boyfriend around...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters anymore. But maybe you should talk to her. If you moved here, would your girlfriend come? Is it Cara? Is that her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That ended. A couple of months back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnded? Oh, no, what happened?\u201d</p><p>He actually smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s a web designer, remember? She threw me over for a computer geek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay. She was pretty married to her computer and I was...\u201d He rubbed a hand along the back of his neck a little self-consciously. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting in long hours. It\u2019s probably my fault. I could have been more attentive.\u201d</p><p>Ashley sat back. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem all that broken up about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pride was hurt. But I think our relationship ran its course and we both knew it. The truth is\u2014I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t hurt anyone. I\u2019ve hurt enough people in my life. Which brings us back to... Ashley, I don\u2019t want to put your mother on the spot. I don\u2019t want her to feel backed into a corner. She\u2019s a nice person\u2014if I come right out and ask her if living in or near Thunder Point would be a problem for her, she\u2019ll probably tell me to do whatever I want to do. Even if it\u2019s not her first choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you could stand living in a little town like Thunder Point?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a good little town, I remember that much. And I think I\u2019d like running into you more often. But I\u2019m not making any assumptions\u2014we\u2019re friends. You can come to me with anything, but I\u2019m not going to try to step in as a father figure. I\u2019m not ever going to assume any authority over you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very funny, Eric. It\u2019s almost too late for anyone to have much authority over me. I\u2019m real close to being out the door.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess you are. So\u2014want to toss this possibility out to your mom and Mac? Give them time to think about how they want to respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that. But I like the idea, if it works out for you.\u201d</p><p>He felt a little funny. Kind of warm and fuzzy inside. He had never expected his life to take a turn like this, to have such a positive relationship with Ashley. He knew he didn\u2019t deserve it.</p> <p>Sixteen</p><p>Laine had screwed up. The compound was shut up tighter than a tick these days. If the men were leaving and returning, she was unaware of it, and part of her job was to be aware of everything. Last night, in the middle of the night, Lorna had made her escape through the woods with two children\u2014her two children. Jacob\u2019s two children.</p><p>Laine hadn\u2019t had contact with anyone on the outside for a couple of weeks. While they sold produce at their stand by the side of the road a farm woman stopped by in an old pickup truck. She was tired-looking, hump-backed, dressed in muddy jeans and worn boots. She was missing a couple of teeth and read from her list with a lisp\u2014six apples, six pears, pint of blackberries, squash. In the lower left of this ragged slip of paper was written 9-13.</p><p>Laine knew there was no hope of getting either Pilly or Charlotte to leave so she had confronted Lorna and given her the chance. And in the morning there was no one in the kitchen because that was Lorna\u2019s domain. Laine thought perhaps she should have gone with her, but there was one reason she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to flee\u2014sweet little Liam. She hoped to somehow rescue him. If she could think of a way to take Charlotte\u2019s four-year-old as well, she would, but Liam was too little to fend for himself. And for that she paid a large price.</p><p>Jacob stormed into the house at six in the morning, his face red, his fists clenched. He looked so frightening she jumped back with a gasp. And she thought, It\u2019s going down.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he said in a low, menacing growl. \u201cIt has to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cLorna\u2019s gone. She must have left on her own. Or one of the men, I think. Not me! If I\u2019d known she was going, I would have gone with her.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, his fist flew into her face, knocking her back about four feet. It was so sudden, so powerful, she was momentarily dazed. Had she guessed this might happen, she could have been better prepared, but everything they knew about Jacob was that while he could get very angry and abusive, he didn\u2019t seem to be violent.</p><p>He came at her again and she put up her arms in defense and began to scream, which brought Pilly and Charlotte running. Jacob was delivering his first kick to her midsection when they came into the kitchen, and they ran to him, trying to pull him away, joining in the screaming. And while Laine had not really bonded with these two, the sight of her down on the floor, under assault by Jacob, must have brought them naturally to her side.</p><p>Jacob had slapped people around\u2014he\u2019d even been known to grab one of the women and give her a shake, but he was more inclined to rant and shout, bluster and stomp around, maybe throw something. Laine would not be here if he had a known violent streak. He was fully expected to try to fight back against the law, but this assault was shocking.</p><p>The man known as Sam came in the back door and stood in shock at what must have looked like a pile of women on the floor and an enraged Jacob. Right behind him came the man known as Joe. Between them they pulled him back and held him, but they said nothing. Jacob was rigid with rage and strained against the hold his men had on him.</p> <p>Laine was so grateful that it was in character for her to cry. She was reduced to sobs; her mind buzzed from the blow. Pilly and Charlotte tried to help her sit up, but she was almost too dizzy.</p><p>\u201cJacob, what happened? Why are you doing this?\u201d Pilly asked. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorna is gone. Lorna and the children! Someone is doing this\u2014it has to be her. The only women left are you, Charlotte and Laine, and I know you two wouldn\u2019t betray me. I know it!\u201d He shook off his two men and said, \u201cTake her across the river and tie her. Then check the fence. The entire fence!\u201d Then he stormed out of the house.</p><p>The two men exchanged looks and then, apparently resigned, went to Laine and lifted her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cPlease, no... I didn\u2019t do it. I wouldn\u2019t do that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome along now,\u201d Sam said. \u201cLike a good girl.\u201d</p><p>How many Sams and Joes had worked for Jacob? she wondered. She looked beseechingly at Pilly and Charlotte who both looked shocked and scared. \u201cTell him I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she begged. \u201cPilly, don\u2019t let him tie me up. He\u2019s going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Laine knew better than to struggle against these two big men even if there was a chance she could get away from them. It was safer to stay in character and play her part. But to her dismay this meant that if she had a chance to flee she\u2019d have to take it and just hope that no harm came to the two remaining women and their children. Right then Laine vowed to herself that if she got out of this place, she\u2019d run far and fast and never look back. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d signed on for. This was supposed to be a simple fact-finding mission and when she had the information she needed, she was simply going to walk away from this compound. Then she found the guns, the pot, the danger to the children...</p> <p>They tied her to a kitchen chair in Jacob\u2019s house, her hands behind her back and her ankles bound to the chair legs. Then she heard the men talking with Jacob, telling him they were going to secure the perimeter and she thought, that sounded like police talk. But these men were not police. She heard one of them tell Jacob not to do any more damage. And then they left.</p><p>Every nerve in her body was on high alert and her heart was hammering so hard she trembled, but took comfort in the fact that this would be a normal reaction and would not raise suspicion. She watched the clock on Jacob\u2019s oven and it ticked by slowly. She could hear him talking on the phone but she couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. Who could he be communicating with? she wondered. He\u2019d led them all to believe his entire world was inside the fence; that he neither wanted nor needed anything else.</p><p>Around ten in the morning she heard a knock at his door, heard him get up and open it and heard Pilly talking to him. Her voice was faint and trembling, but Laine thought she could make out a bit of what she was saying. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Jacob, you\u2019re scaring us. Let me take her back to the house and we\u2019ll watch her. Please, Jacob, I\u2019ll do whatever you need, but don\u2019t hold her prisoner.\u201d</p><p>And then Jacob could be heard, and there was no mistaking his words. \u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this! I think it\u2019s her and she\u2019s ruining everything!\u201d</p><p>There was a bit more pleading then the door closed again, presumably on Pilly\u2019s departure. At almost two, the men were back and she distinctly heard three voices in addition to Jacob\u2019s. And she could hear their words, which were remarkably calm.</p><p>\u201cThe breach of our security has gone too far and has involved too many people. Too many have left and they\u2019re talking\u2014I\u2019d bet anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to shut it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not giving it up!\u201d Jacob shouted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never get another shipment out of here and I\u2019m not going to jail! It\u2019s time to follow the original plan. Burn it and leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! We fight back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob, they\u2019re bigger than we are, and too many people have left. We can\u2019t rely on their silence. They\u2019re going to sell us out\u2014these women. Burn it, and while they\u2019re dealing with the mess and the torch, we\u2019ll take what we can out the back way. We\u2019ll pick up a couple of cars and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving it up until they\u2019re here with a warrant. Then we can torch it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve seen this before. If you think the town constable is coming with a warrant, you\u2019re delusional. They\u2019ll come with a small army. And no one\u2019s getting away unless we get out before they try to get in. Leave the girls and their babies behind, take the cash on hand and let\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>Laine cursed under her breath because that was as much of a detailed conversation as she\u2019d ever heard among the men. And she had to pee like a racehorse.</p><p>They continued to argue, except that Jacob\u2019s men didn\u2019t try to get tough with him. They calmly advised him, and they were articulate. Very well-spoken drug dealers. These were businessmen. Jacob was half-loony, a self-aggrandizing fool. But the people around him, the women and the men, appeared to be intelligent and in control.</p><p>How had he managed that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not for taking more chances. We always said we were exiting this property before it got hot. When a dozen people take off, it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a little more time,\u201d Jacob said.</p><p>They\u2019re going to run, Laine thought. And her greatest fear was that Jacob could be willing to die for it. She\u2019d been here for months and his anger had been steadily escalating. He didn\u2019t like the size of his tribe getting smaller.</p><p>Finally the talk stopped and the door to Jacob\u2019s house closed. She used her small, pitiful voice. \u201cJacob?\u201d she called softly. \u201cJacob?\u201d</p><p>He stood in the kitchen doorway. He crossed his arms over his chest. One side of his mouth lifted in a half smile. \u201cSomething?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to... I need to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally dependent on me, are you? And if I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I might... I could have an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you piss on my floor, I\u2019ll beat you. And you already look like bloody hell.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was getting dangerous. \u201cI just want to use a bathroom, Jacob. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think it over.\u201d Then he turned and left her. And she put her mind in a Zen state that allowed her not to lose control. She would not invite another beating.</p><p>Devon\u2019s next-door neighbor, Mrs. Bledsoe, was very sweet and thoughtful and not only frequently brought a half-dozen cookies over for Mercy, but a couple of times she invited Mercy over to help make them. The only family she had in the area was a twenty-eight-year-old grandson who checked on her regularly even though he had to drive from Coquille to do so. And because Mrs. Bledsoe was more than happy to watch Mercy for a little while, Devon got back into running. Well, it was more like jogging, but she did like to sprint up the hill to her house. And it felt so damn good.</p><p>Rawley wasn\u2019t big on time off from work, but he loved it when Devon called his cell phone and asked him if he\u2019d like to come to dinner at her little house. The one thing she couldn\u2019t seem to break him of was bringing little gifts. Sometimes it was something inexpensive for Mercy or some item for Devon\u2019s kitchen. Although he was deadpan if not grumbly when he came to dinner, she could tell he was delighted. And while she was neither a good cook nor extravagant at the grocery, she did try to serve things she thought he\u2019d like. A small roast, red potatoes and green beans like the ones he\u2019d gotten her at the Farmers\u2019 Market. Or a meatloaf, mashed potatoes and sliced tomatoes. And, she remembered a dish of Lorna\u2019s\u2014sausage, squash, onion, peppers and spinach. Mercy wouldn\u2019t eat the sausage dish but Rawley seemed to enjoy it. Or maybe he was just happy to be asked.</p><p>\u201cRawley, you should come to a football game with us sometime,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. Cooper has to go on account of Landon. And I keep the bar open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone show up out there when there\u2019s a football game in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes someone comes in off the bay. But not often. I just ain\u2019t big on a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really fun,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI bought me a DVR,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned how to record shows and I record the sports. If you ever want to see some game...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI might join you sometime. But I have a confession to make. I spend some time in front of Spencer\u2019s TV because...well, I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>And Rawley showed her a wide expanse of dentures. \u201cLike no one knows? Chickadee, we all know you have a boyfriend. He nice to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s wonderful to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much my life works right now.\u201d</p><p>She felt that Spencer was made for her. She fought the feeling of greediness, because it would feel so good to be able to go places with him other than just Thunder Point, but that was impossible until something changed in the investigation of Jacob\u2019s Fellowship. And to her embarrassment, she secretly wished they could become more official, like maybe a couple with some sort of future plans.</p><p>She acknowledged that was probably not the best idea in the world. They\u2019d both just come out of difficult situations. Patience was definitely required.</p><p>But in addition to her sweet neighbor Mrs. Bledsoe, her good friend Rawley, her wondrous lover, Spencer, Devon now had girlfriends. She often went to the diner for an afternoon break because she would sometimes see Sarah and Gina, sometimes Lou and Ray Anne and Carrie. They laughed together, shared secrets, told each other things they swore secrecy on and, her favorite, exchanged town gossip.</p><p>Now when people came in the clinic, they usually said, \u201cHey, Devon, how\u2019s it going?\u201d When she went to the football games, as she made her way down the front of the bleachers to her spot with the McCains and the Coopers, people waved and sometimes yelled, \u201cHi, Devon, hi, Mercy!\u201d If she crossed the street to the diner, it wasn\u2019t unusual for a passing motorist to toot his horn and give a smile and wave. And when she ran down her street, down the hill to the marina and across the beach, almost everyone she passed raised a hand in hello. And once she heard someone say, \u201cThe coach\u2019s girl.\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t remember being this happy, ever. She had friends, family, love, work.</p><p>And then she screwed it up.</p><p>She was at Spencer\u2019s\u2014a pretty typical Saturday night. They played Candy Land with the kids followed by a bowl of ice cream. Then Mercy was tucked into Spencer\u2019s bed while Austin headed for his room to watch a movie. Spencer put on a movie for them. Devon reclined on the couch and Spencer reclined on Devon. They cuddled up for the movie. After about an hour, Devon asked, \u201cSpencer, do you think we\u2019ll last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I can\u2019t even think about giving you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, kissing her neck and pulling her closer. \u201cI think we give it a little more time then maybe talk about the future? Hmm? If you feel the same way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would be like a dream come true. But I have to ask something else. If you answer no, that\u2019s completely acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have almost everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. When The Fellowship is finally shut down and there\u2019s no more possible problems from Jacob, it will be like I\u2019ve been completely reborn. I can\u2019t remember being happier and a lot of that is because of you. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there a question in there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is. If we\u2019re still together and something should happen to me, will you take Mercy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could happen to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing will happen to me,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut there\u2019s no one. Well, there\u2019s Rawley, who I\u2019m sure wouldn\u2019t hesitate and Mercy loves him. I love him. But he\u2019s a sixty-three-year-old man who I\u2019m sure would find taking on a child full-time to be a huge challenge. And I don\u2019t think that would be the best situation for Mercy, no matter how much we love him. But you\u2019re a wonderful parent...\u201d</p><p>He was silent and she waited. The arms that held her relaxed a little bit. It was a long time before she said, \u201cUh-oh. I crossed the line, didn\u2019t I? I asked too much, too soon....\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her near again. \u201cOf course not. Of course I would do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if you want me to back off this question until...well, you know, until later. When we\u2019re more sure of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away a bit and looked at him. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d make the same promise about Austin, but Cooper and Sarah might object. He\u2019s set, should something happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Devon. You\u2019re right to ask\u2014you have to watch out for her. Yes, is the answer. Of course I\u2019ll take care of Mercy. Don\u2019t worry about it again.\u201d</p><p>But that night, after the movie, rather than trying to wheedle her into staying longer, he carried Mercy to her car and, for the first time, didn\u2019t follow her home. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t leave Austin alone. And you have your phone. If you\u2019re worried about anything or have a problem, call me. I\u2019ll lock the front door and run down the block to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Spencer. I think I upset you. I asked too much of you. It\u2019s not your obligation.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lightly on the lips and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You have to think about things like that. We\u2019ll talk more about this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>But she could feel the instant distance between them. And when she called him the next morning he said, \u201cI might be coming down with something. I have a headache and I\u2019m all plugged up. I\u2019m going to take Austin out to Cooper\u2019s and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Feel better. I\u2019ll be here all day.\u201d</p><p>Spencer didn\u2019t sleep. His mind was spinning all night and by morning he had a blistering headache. And all this because Devon had asked him to be Mercy\u2019s guardian should something happen to her while they were a couple? It was a logical request. And Mercy was cute as could be; well-behaved and smart. In fact, if he and Bridget had had a second child, he would have loved a daughter like Mercy.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t. Instead Bridget had left him widowed.</p><p>He walked with Austin to the beach, got him set up with his fishing pole at the end of the dock, grabbed a cup of coffee and went to the deck to keep an eye on him, make sure he didn\u2019t try diving off the dock. He sat on the deck and just watched the sea. And thought about things.</p><p>Less than two weeks after arriving in Thunder Point, three months after burying his wife, Spencer had been called to Missouri because his father had passed. It was far from unexpected. His parents had been in the same nursing home, his father suffering from the effects of a massive stroke that should\u2019ve killed him but left him completely incapacitated instead. His mother, suffering from advanced Alzheimer\u2019s and several heart attacks, survived him, but not for long. The last time he took Austin to visit his parents, over a year ago, his mother didn\u2019t recognize either one of them.</p><p>But he took his mother in a wheelchair to his father\u2019s burial. There were a few people there from the nursing home, but all their friends and family were gone. And his mother had been on another planet the whole time, gazing off at nothing, making weird little movements with hands that were crippled with arthritis. She had absolutely no idea what was going on.</p><p>The nursing supervisor from the nursing home said, \u201cSpencer, you\u2019ve had a very hard year. Let me be completely honest\u2014your mother isn\u2019t going to be with us much longer. In fact, some of us were surprised that your father predeceased her. All the arrangements have been made for her\u2014you made sure of that quite a while ago. Say goodbye to her now. It will be a matter of weeks at the very most. Just take care of your young son. It\u2019s time to get on with your life.\u201d</p><p>The call had come a few weeks later. Spencer silently grieved, but he didn\u2019t mention it to anyone except Austin, to whom he said, \u201cGrandma passed away peacefully. She\u2019s with Grandpa now and I believe they\u2019re dancing. When I was a boy, I remember, they loved to dance.\u201d</p><p>And Austin who was sometimes a thirty-year-old in a ten-year-old body, asked, \u201cDid she have a happy life?\u201d</p><p>And he nodded with a smile. \u201cUntil the past few years, after Grandpa had a stroke and Grandma\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s got the better of her, they were very happy. They laughed a lot. They had fun. They were thrilled when you were born and visited a lot when you were small. But then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Then she went around the bend. And Grandpa stroked out.\u201d</p><p>Exactly correct, Spencer thought. His father had been eighty-six, his mother seventy-nine when they passed. Not bad, considering Bridget hadn\u2019t even made it to forty.</p><p>After talking about it with Austin, Spencer mentioned it to Cooper, in case Austin ever brought it up with him. And he had said to Cooper at the time, \u201cLet\u2019s not get all emotional about it\u2014I expected it a year ago. I\u2019m relieved. Another chapter of suffering closed.\u201d</p><p>Cooper, who many consider a little hard-edged, said, \u201cBut, man, buddy, you\u2019ve had a real load this year. I\u2019m sorry. Really sorry.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about it much after that. He was relieved.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t cried about it. He wasn\u2019t the crying type anyway. He\u2019d let it all go and embraced his new life, his new town, his team\u2014God, what a team! And there had been that woman, Devon. Despite all adversity, what a fighter she was! She was so alive and, man, had he needed all that life. Especially in the ashes of his buried grief.</p><p>And then she\u2019d said, \u201cIf something should happen to me...\u201d</p><p>Devon thought it was the request that he be responsible for Mercy that had thrown him, but that wasn\u2019t even close. The minute Devon had said that, something roared to life inside him\u2014probably all that grief he hadn\u2019t let see the light of day. And like an arrow through the heart he thought, I can\u2019t do it again! I can\u2019t bury one more person I love! I don\u2019t have any more in me! Jesus, if he were a country-and-western song all he\u2019d need is a broken-down pickup and a dead dog and he\u2019d get an award.</p><p>Cooper came outside a couple of times, sat with him a minute, talked about his new house a little, though it was still just cement and dirt. Cooper asked him what was wrong and needing him to go away, he said, \u201cCould be flu. It\u2019s been running through the school. I\u2019m achy and my head is pounding.\u201d</p><p>He sat there, licking his wounds and feeling sorry for himself for at least a couple of hours when he saw her walking across the beach. She held something in her hands and she was almost to the base of the stairs before he could see it was a covered pot that she held. She stood at the bottom of the stairs, looked up at him, then began the climb. When she got to the top she sat down, put the pot in the middle of the table and asked, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlugged up,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a complete lie, since he was starting to understand that he was emotionally plugged up. Devon had scared him and he had freaked out.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvil,\u201d he lied. \u201cI probably need a decongestant. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you chicken soup. By now I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not hot, but Rawley will be glad to warm it up for you. Spencer, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. He leaned forward. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. Your question\u2014it took me by surprise, but the real surprise was in my head. And I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. I want to say two things, two important things. First, whether we\u2019re a couple or not, I will take responsibility for Mercy. I will be sure she\u2019s safe and cared for and loved, no matter what. I promise. I give you my word, and my word is good. And the second thing\u2014when you asked me that, it really hit me just how serious our relationship is and how fast it became serious. Devon, I love you, I can\u2019t help it. But I just buried my wife last spring. I buried my parents last summer. I need a few days to think about things, to be sure I\u2019m not just desperate for some stability, for an answer to some of the aches and pains the past couple of years have given me. I don\u2019t want to rush into anything. I don\u2019t want to rush you. I just want to think about this. For a split second, I felt ambushed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She flinched as if she\u2019d been slapped. \u201cBut I tried to discourage you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. I didn\u2019t realize I might be moving too fast. My feelings haven\u2019t changed. Give me a little time.\u201d</p> <p>She tapped the pot. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to cure what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Don\u2019t call me unless you think you know what you want. Because I\u2019m doing this exactly one time.\u201d Then she stood, ran down the stairs and across the beach.</p><p>He watched her go and asked himself if he was just some kind of fool or a man being smart. It was reasonable, wasn\u2019t it? They\u2019d met in June. It was September. A few months. When she was out of sight, he sighed and turned his head.</p><p>Cooper stood in the doorway from the bar. His arms were crossed over his chest and his heavy eyebrows were furrowed. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to eavesdrop, at least pay attention,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cI was paying attention! You brought your grumpy self out here, claiming to have the start of the flu, but what you were having was idiocy. You\u2019ve been sniffing after that pretty little thing for months! Did you really just cut her loose and tell her you needed space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I\u2019m warning you\u2014stay out of this. We\u2019ll sort it out in a couple of days....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen men say they need to think, that they need space, women know what they mean. When I was a teenager or idiot guy in my twenties, I thought I was getting one over on them, but they always knew\u2014it was an excuse because I couldn\u2019t make a commitment. You\u2019re such a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you! I\u2019m committed all over the place! I was with Bridget every day while she was dying! I\u2019ll be Austin\u2019s father till he\u2019s old and gray even though he\u2019s got your DNA! I took care of my parents the best I could! I\u2019m a teacher, a coach, a friend! I don\u2019t take this shit lightly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas one more commitment, the one that actually feels the best, just too much for little you?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cBecause she\u2019s already got a heap of worries and struggles and I think you probably just broke the hell out of her heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix that up,\u201d he said sulkily. \u201cBut right now I think I\u2019m getting the flu!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlu of the brain, that\u2019s what. If you don\u2019t run after her right now and beg for another chance, you\u2019re not getting any sympathy from me when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your sympathy. I also don\u2019t need your advice. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re that slick with women!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Spencer,\u201d he said, pulling out a chair and sitting at the table with him. \u201cI understand you might be a little gun-shy\u2014what you went through with Bridget, that would be rough. But Devon\u2019s a good kid and she\u2019s been through a lot, too. Maybe you\u2019d be better off working on holding each other up than taking a break to think things over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it,\u201d he said, drawing a finger across his throat.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, if that\u2019s the way you want it, do it your way. Just trying to share the wealth of my experience. You could be alone a long time. Just trying to be useful, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna be useful? How about a beer? And some silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Cooper said, going into the bar. But he didn\u2019t bring back a beer.</p> <p>When Devon got home, Mercy was still napping. Mrs. Bledsoe was sitting on Devon\u2019s couch, reading one of her novels. She slowly stood as Devon came in the house. \u201cHow is he feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s feeling like the ass he is,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Mrs. Bledsoe said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasted tears,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably my fault. I probably pushed him into a serious relationship. I didn\u2019t mean to, but I think I did. Because he asked me to give him some time to think about this. About us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about that, lovey. Men have an enduring reputation for things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking for think time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For being stupid.\u201d She shook her head sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. Men do things like that regularly. Take these silly time-outs. Like it erases all the important things on their minds. Haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d</p><p>Well, no, she hadn\u2019t. Because when had she had a man? There had been a couple of boyfriends when she was young and then there was Jacob, who didn\u2019t count at all because he was not a steady guy: he was a benevolent despot. Spencer was nearly her first. The first guy to love and want her exclusively.</p><p>\u201cI had a husband, a son, a grandson and I eat up these romance novels. Everyone knows men can\u2019t stand to be confronted with their feelings. They\u2019d rather wrestle alligators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should read more of those,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cI have a few recommendations and a ton of books if you ever want to borrow a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d Devon said. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have a little free time all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Ashley cornered her mother in the kitchen. \u201cCan I talk to you and Mac tonight? For a couple of minutes? Just you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Is anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I have something to run by you. It\u2019s not really for the whole family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me on pins now,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cIs Mac here tonight? He\u2019s not working?\u201d When Gina shook her head, Ashley said, \u201cSee you here right after dinner? When the kids have scattered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Before the dishes were even done, Mac and Gina sat expectantly at the kitchen table. Eve had gone to their room to talk to Landon on the phone while the younger kids were in the basement with the piano, computer and TV. Ashley looked at her mom and new stepdad and laughed. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to alarm you. I wanted to talk to you about Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cI went shopping with him, you know. And we had lunch. And he was telling me that someone has been after him to sell his body shop. At first he just said it wasn\u2019t for sale, but then he started thinking about it and wondered if just maybe he shouldn\u2019t do it. I guess the offer is pretty good, but I don\u2019t have any idea what that means. But...he said he\u2019s been looking around at other things, other opportunities, if he did decide to sell. He said it\u2019s almost an offer he can\u2019t refuse. I told him I hoped it didn\u2019t mean he was moving even farther away and he said there was a potential thing in Thunder Point, but he was worried about it\u2014he asked me if Thunder Point was big enough for the two of us. Everyone would take one look at us and know\u2014he\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez,\u201d Gina said. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve introduced him as my biological father to people we\u2019ve met. It doesn\u2019t bother me a bit. In fact, I\u2019m kind of proud that he wanted to meet me once he found out about me. But then the conversation went to you guys. He doesn\u2019t want to put it to you directly\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to blindside you. He said it might make you two uncomfortable. You know, dredging up the past, which was kind of a scandalous past for you. Mom, I know you didn\u2019t have it easy when you were this teenage mother with the missing boyfriend. Then, he reminded me, add to that the fact he went to prison. Holy crap, huh? I mean, that isn\u2019t a big deal for me\u2014I didn\u2019t go to prison! And he\u2019s pretty embarrassed about it, but he said he\u2019s never tried to hide it. He said it wouldn\u2019t work to try to hide it\u2014it would always be found out eventually, so he admits it and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe turned his life around. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>All Gina said was, \u201cThunder Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, here\u2019s what he said. He said if he approached you with the possibility\u2014and it\u2019s still just a possibility, he hasn\u2019t accepted the offer on his body shop or anything\u2014but he said you\u2019re the kind of person that would tell him to just do the thing that worked best for him. You\u2019d just be nice about it. That\u2019s why he asked me to tell you and Mac about this, give you time to talk about it, give him an answer that really fits what you feel and not just the nice answer. Because he promises no matter what he does next, he\u2019ll see me now and then, just like he does now. He doesn\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable if he lives nearby. So, could you guys talk it over? Really talk it over? Decide how you really feel about the idea? And then I\u2019ll tell him. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say he\u2019d turn down a good move to this town if it made me uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I know he\u2019s sorry about the past, about the loser he used to be. He said you\u2019re in a new marriage now and wants to make sure you don\u2019t feel, you know, embarrassed by him.\u201d</p><p>Gina looked at Mac. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of sweet.\u201d</p><p>Mac frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sweet as long as he doesn\u2019t have feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>Ashley laughed. \u201cDo you think he\u2019d dare? Actually I think he has feelings for me. And while we were driving home, he admitted he\u2019s scared to death of Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably should be,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cSo, don\u2019t answer the question. Talk about it. Be sure. Because you could be stuck with the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Ash? This would make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be okay. But, Mom, I\u2019m almost out of here. Another year or two, I\u2019m on my way to college and then\u2014whatever comes next. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live in Thunder Point the rest of my life. I know I\u2019ll visit a lot if you\u2019re here, but where Eric lives isn\u2019t that big a deal. We\u2019ll stay in touch. This has a lot more to do with you and Mac.\u201d</p><p>Devon was on the quiet side at the clinic. And to make matters worse, it wasn\u2019t very busy\u2014just young mothers with small children who weren\u2019t in school and one woman who stayed home from work with a terrible sore throat and fever. Scott fixed her right up with a strong antibiotic and did a throat culture for possible strep.</p><p>And of course he noticed Devon\u2019s mood, though she tried to act bright and happy. \u201cI sense trouble in paradise,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m coming down with the flu,\u201d she said, borrowing Spencer\u2019s excuse.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Devon. You don\u2019t have to talk about what it really is.\u201d</p><p>And she said, \u201cThanks. I can\u2019t at the moment.\u201d</p><p>She was being completely honest. She couldn\u2019t talk about it without tears threatening. She was trying so hard not to hope and pray he\u2019d call to say he\u2019d been a fool who overreacted. She wanted to be as over him as he apparently was over her. She was failing in her mission, but suspected Spencer was succeeding in his\u2014she didn\u2019t see him. At all.</p><p>She finally dragged herself over to the diner for a coffee break and found Gina in her usual place behind the counter. There was a trio of elderly ladies in a booth, gossiping and laughing up a storm. A lone man sat down at the end of the counter, finishing up either a late breakfast or early lunch.</p><p>\u201cWell, hey,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust working,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gina automatically poured her a cup of coffee. \u201cWhat did you and Spencer do over the weekend?\u201d</p><p>Well, she thought. Word usually travels much faster. She wondered if Spencer was keeping this little issue they had to himself. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d she said, sipping her coffee. \u201cWe had a raucous game of Candy Land with the kids on Saturday night...then a bowl of ice cream...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t being a single mother dating a single father romantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I think we broke up.\u201d</p> <p>Shock showed all over Gina\u2019s face. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Devon shook her head. \u201cI think it was something I did. I think I screwed up.\u201d</p><p>She could tell Gina was momentarily speechless. \u201cWhat could you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him for something, and I didn\u2019t think it through very well. I should have waited. It was too soon, but at the time it felt safe enough. I reminded him that I have no family, just Rawley, and he\u2019s not really family. So I asked if we\u2019re a couple and something happens to me, would he watch over Mercy. Take her on. Take her in. And it was like he closed the blinds right at that moment. Pulled down the shades. Closed the door. He said he thought he was sick, but that was an excuse to avoid me. I tracked him down at Cooper\u2019s on Sunday and he leveled with me\u2014he isn\u2019t interested in getting that serious. I haven\u2019t heard from him since.\u201d</p><p>Gina poured herself a cup of coffee, shaking her head. \u201cOh, brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really want more family. He\u2019s in a different place. His singleness is not so single as mine\u2014he\u2019s got Cooper and Sarah to look after Austin. He said he\u2019d take on Mercy if something happened to me, but he needs some time to think about us. He\u2019s been thinking for a few days, so I\u2019m done. I\u2019m adjusting to that idea.\u201d She sat back and pasted a fake smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019m all right on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little time is really all he needs?\u201d Gina ventured.</p><p>Devon sighed. \u201cYeah. Well, I spent a few days fantasizing he\u2019d call saying he just panicked...but the call didn\u2019t come. And tempting as he is, I really don\u2019t want a guy who feels like he\u2019s all in and then he suddenly freezes up like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it has something to do with his late wife?\u201d Gina suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. He mentioned that, but we\u2019ve talked about her before, about what a huge life lesson that was for him. He seemed so stable, so right with the world, you know? But he\u2019s got secrets\u2014did you know his parents both died last summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew about his dad. He left Austin with Cooper and went back east to see him buried. But I didn\u2019t realize...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think Spencer has stuff to work out. And I know I have stuff to work out. I think maybe this is for the best, much as it hurts. We shouldn\u2019t be working stuff out on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t argue with that,\u201d Gina said, sipping her coffee. \u201cI\u2019m just so sorry. And surprised. Not only do you seem like one of the least troubled people I know, so did Spencer. I don\u2019t know him well, but I know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t always advertise our baggage. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Someday we\u2019ll have a glass of wine and I\u2019ll tell you how well I know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess everyone has their stuff,\u201d Devon said. \u201cYou know, I look at all my new friends and they all look like they have everything in life figured out and sometimes I feel like the only person with a past to put in perspective. Sometimes I pray one day I can be like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no everyone else, Devon. Life is complicated and difficult for everyone. Absolutely everyone. And you shouldn\u2019t feel alone. You\u2019re just like the rest of us\u2014hard stuff to work through so you can have a stable, productive, happy life. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t. If you ever start to feel like the struggle is bigger than you are, there\u2019s help. I have the name of an excellent counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because that was suggested to me, but I\u2019m not sure I can afford one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a sliding scale based on income. My insurance helped, but I would\u2019ve had trouble paying her fees if it hadn\u2019t. If you ever want her name, if only to find out what the fee might be, just let me know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she a friend of yours?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart. She was my daughter\u2019s counselor. She got us through a very rough patch. Counseling works.\u201d</p><p>Devon gave the idea of counseling some thought through the afternoon. She might look into that, but for now she was determined to get on with her life. She picked up Mercy from Gabriella and took her home. Once there she asked Mrs. Bledsoe if she could keep an eye on her for a little while so she could get a little exercise. While it was still light, a run on the beach would solve some immediate problems, like feeling sorry for herself. And if she saw him or he saw her, she would just run in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cA half hour? Maybe forty-five minutes at the most?\u201d she asked Mrs. Bledsoe. \u201cShe had a snack and I\u2019ll give her dinner when I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>She was about twelve minutes into her run when the adrenaline kicked in and she was reminded that what had just happened with Spencer was probably normal. It was probably the kind of complication \u201cregular\u201d people go through when forming relationships, but she\u2019d gotten a little off the track because of her unusual circumstances. People who lived in the real world, people who weren\u2019t so alone and screwed up probably examined and reexamined their relationships constantly.</p><p>Spencer was not in evidence on the beach. She didn\u2019t see him on the deck, either. She ran across the beach as far as the dock, then back across and up the hill, past Spencer\u2019s house to her own.</p><p>And in front of her house was the deputy sheriff\u2019s car!</p><p>She sprinted to her door and burst inside. Mrs. Bledsoe, looking so small sitting on her secondhand sofa next to Mac, was weeping into a tissue.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she shouted. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bledsoe struggled for control. \u201cHe took her,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he was her father and he took her.\u201d</p><p>Devon looked at Mac. \u201cJacob?\u201d she asked. \u201cWas it him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it was. I\u2019ve notified the sheriff and the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Looking back at Mrs. Bledsoe, she demanded, \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the poor woman faltered. \u201cTall. Dark hair. A little gray, but not much. Strong. He told me not to try to fight him or I\u2019d get hurt. He said this was a dangerous world and he was taking Mercy to a safe place. Oh, my dear, I was so afraid of him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was he driving?\u201d Devon demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It was blue. It was a truck,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say, Mrs. Bledsoe?\u201d Devon said, getting right in her face. The older woman backed up, clearly frightened by Devon. \u201cWhat did he say? Exactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Mercy was his daughter. He said, \u2018Come here, Mercy,\u2019 and she went to him. He picked her up\u2014she wasn\u2019t afraid of him. He said, \u2018No one takes my child from me,\u2019 and that if I tried to stop him I\u2019d get hurt. I had to go home to call the police, but I came right back here. I couldn\u2019t stop him, please believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHalf hour, maybe. Not long after you left. I called Mac right away,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>Devon grabbed her truck keys off the kitchen counter and ran for the door.</p><p>\u201cDevon!\u201d Mac barked. \u201cYou should stay here! Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>But she was out the door and in the truck so fast no one could have possibly stopped her. She drove immediately across the beach, parked and ran up the stairs, through the bar and into the kitchen. There were people on the deck and inside, but she took no notice of them.</p><p>\u201cRawley! Jacob found out where I live and he took Mercy! About a half hour ago. Mrs. Bledsoe was watching her. I have to go get her. I have to have... Rawley, I need a wire cutter to cut through the fence. And I need... Do you have a weapon? Any kind of weapon?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her by the upper arms and gave her a little shake. \u201cShh! Do you think he took her back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hated to leave. I never saw him leave the compound alone. Where else would he take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get her,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cCan you tell me where to go once I get into the camp?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. We\u2019ll go together. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t go, you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine! She\u2019s my little girl! I\u2019m going to get her and I don\u2019t care if he makes me stay, I won\u2019t leave her there with him! I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going,\u201d a voice said from behind her. She whirled to see Spencer standing there. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together. I\u2019ll go with Rawley to the inside. We\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever done this before?\u201d Rawley asked him.</p><p>\u201cDone this?\u201d Spencer asked stupidly.</p><p>\u201cSnuck into a village or a prisoner camp to get someone out?\u201d</p><p>Spencer was clearly stuck for an answer. With something that sounded almost like a laugh, he asked, \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately. Been a while, thank Jesus. Get Cooper. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Spencer blinked a couple of times, then did as he was told. When Cooper followed Spencer into the kitchen he was muttering, \u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get in your closet,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cI need a black or dark green jacket or dark-colored sweatshirt with sleeves. Camouflage would be good, but you probably don\u2019t have that. Devon needs something real dark from Sarah\u2019s closet\u2014just a jacket\u2019ll do it. She\u2019ll be okay in those tennis shoes\u2014she\u2019s not walking far. We\u2019ll be going through the woods and can\u2019t be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Cooper said again.</p><p>\u201cMercy\u2019s father came for her. He took her back to that commune and we\u2019re going to go get her,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cHe\u2019s likely dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police were called,\u201d Devon said. \u201cI told Mac I was going to go get her. Jacob has some men who work for him and they have rifles. They always said it was for hunting and to keep us safe, but I always wondered about the protection part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to look out for them, too,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cCoop, I gotta have a little help here. There\u2019s no time to waste. Best chance is gettin\u2019 right on him, surprise him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He took the stairs two at a time, rummaged around in his closet, in his trunk, under his bed. He was back in the kitchen with his arms full of clothes plus one very large handgun. He threw the clothes and gun on the counter and pulled one dark brown hoodie over his head.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou have to stay here for Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah will take care of Austin and I have to go to make sure you don\u2019t get shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this old guy gonna do to get her back?\u201d Spencer wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThis old guy served three tours in Vietnam as a Green Beret and stands a better chance of pulling this off than you or I,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Rawley was pulling on a navy blue shirt, buttoning it up to his neck and around his wrists. \u201cI\u2019d have a better chance if you two dipshits would stay right here. If four are going, we\u2019re going to have problems....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Devon said. \u201cI can tell you every detail of the buildings inside the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Spencer said, picking up a pair of boots and a jacket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Rawley sighed and shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take your extended cab,\u201d he said to Cooper. He headed for the door. He looked back over his shoulder. \u201cWe on coffee break here?\u201d And then he was out the door, leaving them to follow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Devon followed first, still pulling on a jacket she\u2019d pulled out of the pile. She found Rawley digging around in the tool storage bin in the bed of his old truck. He removed a rifle and a very large, very intimidating knife in a leather holster of some kind. She didn\u2019t gasp but she did say, \u201cIf I had known you had these things, I would\u2019ve been afraid to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways locked up tight, chickadee. Wouldn\u2019t leave nothing like this around a child. You sit in back with me\u2014tell me the lay of the land while Cooper drives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She touched his arm. \u201cRawley, I\u2019ll get her back, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d do this for the fun of it? You wanna help? Do what I say to do and don\u2019t argue. What I sure the hell don\u2019t need right now is the Keystone Kops following me around the jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRawley, it\u2019s a forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is. Cooper!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>The man came scrambling out of the bar, Spencer behind him carrying a jacket and pair of Cooper\u2019s boots. Once Cooper was behind the wheel Rawley said, \u201cGet us over to Highway 5 and head south. Be quiet and listen to Devon\u2014she\u2019s the only intel we got.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer sat in the front beside Cooper and listened to Rawley question Devon; he listened to Devon answer. She had told him a great deal about her experience in this commune, but he\u2019d never really created a visual before now. He never really put himself in her position until tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the buildings in the front, by the gate?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>\u201cA long driveway, a long yard, a very big house, kind of an old country farmhouse, almost like an inn\u2014two stories with a wraparound porch. A barn and south of the barn, a chicken coop. Between the barn and house, a large dirt patch, a place we played, a place the men parked those big SUVs. Behind the barn is a corral. Pastures and our produce gardens back up to the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFence around all that land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just around the compound\u2014they let the stock out of the compound and there is just normal pasture fencing. They don\u2019t worry about the cows or horses getting away. There aren\u2019t that many animals. It\u2019s the people who are fenced in who are at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far to the river from the gate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least a half mile. Almost a mile. There\u2019s a bridge\u2014the men would drive their SUVs across the bridge because over there was Jacob\u2019s house, right between two big barns. They\u2019re not barns\u2014that\u2019s where Jacob was growing marijuana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other road inside except for that front road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I don\u2019t know. We never went over there. Jacob would take women to his house one at a time. I think there are only four women left there\u2014Lorna, Laine, Pilly and Charlotte. And four children. When I got there four years ago or so, there were eighteen women and six men and a bunch of kids. In the past couple of years, people started leaving and Jacob started getting strange. Angry and paranoid and weird. I think he knew law enforcement suspected him of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a hole in the fence behind the chicken coop and Laine told me to carry Mercy and to run down the road\u2014there was a truck waiting to give me a ride over the mountain. She arranged everything at a Farmers\u2019 Market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t people just walk away at that market?\u201d Rawley asked. \u201cThat market\u2019s a busy place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Rawley\u2014the kids were home, inside the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do the men keep the guns?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith them, I think. There\u2019s a bunkhouse back by the marijuana barns. There were never guns in our house.\u201d</p><p>Spencer listened as she described the property, a beautiful big farm on a lovely river in a valley where food and shelter and friendship was plentiful... And where they were surreptitiously guarded by men with guns, men who were there to serve the master, the man who took them one at a time to his house for sex and liked to say they were all one big happy family.</p><p>\u201cI think we were part of Jacob\u2019s fantasy or delusion,\u201d she told Rawley. \u201cHe wanted to be the grand pooh-bah, the big daddy, the king of his little kingdom, served by women, loved by his many children. He hardly ever left the farm. The men came and went pretty freely, but Jacob only left occasionally. He liked his animals, his gardens, his family. He liked to walk across the bridge to the house, sit at the head of the table with one of the children on his knee, ask us about our day, then lecture a little or talk about himself or maybe rant against the government. He wrote volumes on his beliefs, his philosophies and believed his writings would one day be legendary. There were times it seemed so lovely. Then there were times it seemed so sick and demented. One thing\u2014once you were there, there was no leaving. And they didn\u2019t let people inside. He used the excuse that we were a private religious order. But there wasn\u2019t much religion going on there. Reese, the oldest of us, called it a tribe. A militant tribe.\u201d</p><p>Rawley asked the same questions over and over again. Devon answered, and her answers were consistent. Spencer memorized her answers, as he assumed Cooper was doing.</p><p>Spencer was beginning to understand what she had been through in a way he hadn\u2019t before, even though she\u2019d told him about her experience. This was completely different and for the first time he was impacted by how trapped she must have felt and how much courage it must have taken for her to flee. And, to his shame, he realized how much trust she must have churned up to be able to trust someone like him.</p><p>Had he really done what he\u2019d done? Chased her, seduced her and then rejected her because of sudden terror that he\u2019d somehow be hurt again? He felt the fool and he wanted to stop everything right now so he could explain, beg her to understand and forgive him, to tell her he was really not that kind of wimp. If they got Mercy and got through this, he would never let her down again.</p><p>Ahead were the flashing lights of a patrol car.</p><p>\u201cDo not turn around,\u201d Rawley said sharply. \u201cPull up to the copper. Ask him why the road is closed. Tell him you\u2019re just taking a shortcut to Canyonville where your folks have a farm. Let the copper turn you around. You turn yourself around they\u2019ll be after you that fast.\u201d</p><p>And Cooper did just that, pulled right up to the officer and put down his window. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy folks have a spread near Canyonville. I been taking this shortcut for years. Can I get through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoad\u2019s closed, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He peered into the car. \u201cI better have a look at your driver\u2019s license and registration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Cooper said, fishing for those things in the glove box and his back pocket.</p><p>The patrolman shone a flashlight on those items while he asked, \u201cWhat takes you to your folks just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting, what else? We get there tonight, start up first light.\u201d</p><p>He looked into the backseat. \u201cYou hunt, little lady?\u201d</p><p>Devon laughed. \u201cPlease. I cook!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d he said. Another patrol car pulled up behind them. \u201cGet outta here,\u201d he said. \u201cRoad\u2019s closed.\u201d</p><p>Then Cooper took his turn and headed back in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cNow we go upstream and head down the river. I hope you swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a beaver,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they find out what we\u2019re doing, will we be in trouble?\u201d she asked Rawley.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cTrouble? I reckon we\u2019ll prolly go straight to jail.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Laine spent a couple of days at Jacob\u2019s house, in and out of her bonds. Jacob gave her water and he brought her back a small plate of food from the house now and then. It was hard to stay in character as a meek and submissive female while he kept her tied, and when he did talk to her he ranted angrily about how he knew she had betrayed him, had betrayed them all.</p><p>Of course he didn\u2019t know the truth. She hadn\u2019t confessed to a thing.</p><p>Laine slept upright in the straight-back kitchen chair, testing her binding, trying to scoot to the counter to see if she could reach into a kitchen drawer to get something that would cut her ropes. When he came home from the big house after dinner to find she had moved, he gave her a black eye and split lip and then lectured her for an hour on his plan for his Fellowship and the conspirators who would strip them of their bounty, leave them homeless and poor. Everyone who wasn\u2019t with them was against them.</p><p>And then he came back after what she presumed was his dinner at the house, except he had Mercy with him. She gasped when she saw him and said, \u201cIs Devon back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished with Devon, but this is my daughter and she stays with me. If I untie you and take you to the house with the other women, will you stay? Or will you just run?\u201d</p><p>Her mind raced. What had he done with Devon? Had he hurt her, perhaps killed her to kidnap this child? Because, as she knew, her former friend Devon would not have given up Mercy, not at the point of a knife. \u201cWhy would I run?\u201d she asked him. \u201cYou\u2019ll just catch me and bring me back. I\u2019ll take Mercy to the house, see she\u2019s fed and put to bed and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. He grinned and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put that kind of pressure on you.\u201d He untied her and said, \u201cCome with us, Sister Laine. We\u2019ll take you to the house\u2014you can help the women with the children. I\u2019ll keep Mercy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, Jacob. I\u2019m sure you have too much to do to take care of her. She needs to be with the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you really do think I\u2019m an idiot. Stand up.\u201d</p><p>She stood from the chair and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cMercy, I want you to sit at the table here until I get back. Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t leave the table for any reason or I will be very angry with you. Do you understand?\u201d The child looked up at him fearfully and nodded. Laine noted that the children were not ordinarily afraid of Jacob, but perhaps whatever act he had committed to gain the custody of this child had filled her with fear. And then he said to Laine, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He held the door for her and she preceded him out of the house, walking toward the bridge. She was almost there when he said, \u201cSister Laine, you really don\u2019t have anything I want anymore. Why don\u2019t you just leave now?\u201d</p><p>She slowly turned toward him. \u201cHow am I to leave? The gate is locked.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a patient smile. \u201cThen I suppose you should find a way. You\u2019ve found other ways. Maybe you left a hole in the fence somewhere. If you can get out, you can run down the road\u2014the police have blocked the road. You can just run to them\u2014they\u2019ll take you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob, why don\u2019t you just ask them what they want? It can\u2019t be anything so terrible. You always took good care of your family, you always\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take all of this if I let them in,\u201d he said, gesturing around. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t leave a single thing for them to take! And when they take me down, they\u2019ll be forced to show the world my work. Good work. Thousands of pages of brilliant work inspired by my beliefs.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly she feared the worst. If he didn\u2019t escape, he would be on a suicide mission. She had known for months it was possible he was a thundering lunatic and might do something desperate, but she wasn\u2019t sure what...or how. \u201cJacob, where are the men?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYes, where are the men? Well,\u201d he said, turning his head right and left as if looking for them. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d he asked facetiously. \u201cNot with me. And if they\u2019re not with me, then they\u2019re against me.\u201d And with that he left her there and went back toward his house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>So this would be it, she thought. It was going down. She ran for the house and burst into the kitchen where Charlotte and Pilly were cooking. Liam was in his high chair and four-year-old Abe was sitting at the long table. The room looked strangely forlorn, one small boy sitting at a table that could comfortably seat twenty to twenty-four. Jacob\u2019s dynasty; Jacob\u2019s legacy, down to two women, two small children and one undercover FBI agent. She was panting. Charlotte and Pilly looked at her in shock. It could have been their surprise at seeing her or maybe surprise at the condition of her face. \u201cJacob kidnapped Mercy. I don\u2019t know what he might\u2019ve done to Devon. He\u2019s keeping Mercy at his house. He\u2019s talking crazy. He says the police have blocked the road and he\u2019s not giving up his home, this home. He\u2019s talking about his legacy if they take him down. You have to get the kids out of here.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte put a hand over her mouth but Pilly looked enraged. \u201cI won\u2019t leave Jacob,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeeds you?\u201d Laine said. \u201cDid he even tell you he had Mercy? Do you even know what he\u2019s planning? Pilly, I\u2019m afraid for you and Liam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave if he tells me to go,\u201d she said indignantly. \u201cBut he won\u2019t!\u201d And leaving the pan she was stirring on the fire, she stormed out of the kitchen through the back door, headed for Jacob\u2019s house across the river.</p><p>Laine looked at Charlotte. \u201cTake the children, Charlotte. I\u2019ll show you the way out\u2014follow the road to the police. Jacob said they\u2019re blocking the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try to get Mercy out of his house. I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019m going to try. If Pilly won\u2019t take Liam, if she risks her life and her son\u2019s to stand by Jacob in his craziest hour, we have to get the kids out of here.\u201d She pulled Liam out of his high chair. \u201cCharlotte, if you don\u2019t do this, bad things are going to happen. Now come with me. Come!\u201d</p> <p>Laine didn\u2019t have wire cutters or tools or weapons, but even though she felt dangerously alone in here, she did have partners. She would walk along the fence with Charlotte from the front of the fence line to the river, kicking and shaking the fence as she went, and she would undoubtedly find a break in the fence for an emergency getaway.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Charlotte asked her.</p><p>And Laine gave the standard response. \u201cBecause I was going to go, but Jacob held me captive in his house and I couldn\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>They left the house from the front door so neither Jacob nor Pilly would see them if they were coming. They were just beginning their trek along the fence, partially concealed by the trees and bushes, when there was a smell. A pungent and thick smell. Laine knew what it was. \u201cHoly mother of God,\u201d she said, holding Liam against her and running along the fence. \u201cHurry! He\u2019s burning everything down!\u201d</p><p>They were almost to the river before Laine found a break in the fence. She held it open for Charlotte and handed Liam to her. \u201cGo through the woods and pasture to the road. He\u2019s burning the warehouses and he\u2019ll probably burn everything and if you\u2019re here, you\u2019re in terrible danger. Take the baby, hang on to Abe. Just go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do? Will you be safe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try to get Mercy. Don\u2019t worry about me right now, just go quickly. And when you get to the police, tell them who\u2019s left here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob will send the men after us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cThe men are gone.\u201d</p><p>Rawley told Cooper where to park in a small stand of trees near the river. He lit out at a pretty fast clip along the riverbank. He had his knife strapped to his waist and anchored to his thigh and he carried a rifle.</p><p>\u201cRawley, how far?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, chickadee. Just stay on my tail and don\u2019t slip. If I have to fish you out, it costs time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe odometer said it was six miles,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBy road. The river is a straight shot.\u201d Then he stopped, listened, sniffed the air. Everyone came to a standstill behind him\u2014first Devon, then Spencer, then Cooper.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cMight be burning green cannabis,\u201d he said. Then he put his head down and said, \u201cStep it up. This just keeps getting worse.\u201d And he began to jog along the riverbank.</p><p>Laine could see that a fire had been started inside one of the warehouses; smoke was pouring out through cracks in the roof and doors. Any minute the thing would combust and the outer shell would go up in flames. The whole forest could be at risk, but certainly Jacob\u2019s house, the bunkhouse and the other warehouse.</p><p>Laine ran past the burning warehouse to the bunkhouse and tried the door, only to find it locked. She assumed weapons must be stored inside, but she couldn\u2019t get in. She reared back and gave the door a furious kick, but it didn\u2019t budge. There was only an old blue pickup near the bunkhouse and now she could see one lone black SUV parked behind Jacob\u2019s house. The rear hatch was open and it looked as if Jacob might be loading up his belongings.</p><p>And between them, an ax sitting beside a stack of firewood.</p><p>She picked up the ax and ran toward the house. She softly opened the front door to the house and heard voices within, slightly muffled but she thought she could make out at least some of the words\u2014\u201cNo, take that box while I fill this suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that. Hurry\u2014there won\u2019t be much time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, just that we leave before they get here.\u201d</p><p>It was Pilly and Jacob, with no sound from Mercy. Ax in hand, she followed the sounds and peeked into a room to find the two of them in the back of the house, a room she\u2019d never seen before. It appeared to be Jacob\u2019s office. She dared to peek in the door and what she saw was surreal\u2014Jacob and Pilly were loading boxes full of stacks of papers\u2014it looked suspiciously like manuscripts. His brilliant opus; his manifesto. And from an open safe he was stacking what had to be tens of thousands of dollars in bills into suitcases.</p><p>But of course. If he\u2019d been selling his \u201cmedicinal herbs\u201d he was operating a completely cash business. He wouldn\u2019t have had the luxury of making deposits into a bank\u2014his illegal operation would be exposed. Law enforcement always followed the money in search for clues and suspects.</p><p>She crept through the house, beginning with the kitchen where she had last seen Mercy sitting at the table, but she wasn\u2019t there. She looked in the living room, in the bedroom, searched in vain for a cellar door, but the child was not there. Laine felt a rising panic. She had some theories about Jacob but in reality she wasn\u2019t sure how sick or crazy he was. Would he keep Mercy as some kind of hostage? Would he just kill her out of spite? And what of Pilly? Was she that bonded with Jacob that she\u2019d leave her baby behind in a compound in flames just to be with him?</p><p>When all else had failed, she went to the doorway of the office where the frantic packing up was happening and stood there, ax hefted in two hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Laine asked in her most threatening voice.</p><p>Pilly gasped, but Jacob turned toward her with a controlled expression on his face. He was composed. And then it happened so quickly, Laine never saw it coming. He picked up a gun from the top of his desk, a handgun that looked like a Smith &amp; Wesson .40 caliber, turned it on her and fired. He hit her in the upper right chest with a force so powerful it blew her out of the doorway and knocked the ax out of her grip. Laine whirled around and backed up against the hallway wall, leaving a large smear of blood on the wall.</p><p>Willing herself not to fall, Laine hurried down the hall toward escape, leaving a trail of blood behind her.</p><p>\u201cJacob, go get her!\u201d Pilly yelled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too late,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t get out. She\u2019ll just die out there. Get this in the suitcase. Hurry. We have only minutes.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s too late, Laine thought. And she ran from the house, around to the back where the SUV sat with its tailgate open. It was her intention to disable it\u2014maybe she\u2019d pull out a bunch of wires and close it down. She pulled open the driver\u2019s door to pop the hood and glancing into the backseat, there was Mercy, lying there on the seat, sleeping.</p><p>Laine had but one usable arm. She opened the rear door and pulled Mercy toward her with one hand, terrified that the worst might\u2019ve befallen the little girl. \u201cCome on, sunshine, come on,\u201d she cooed, jostling the little girl. And thank God, Mercy opened her eyes and sat up. \u201cCome, angel, we have to hurry. Come with me now.\u201d Laine\u2019s shoulder was injured and bleeding profusely; she held that arm tight against her body and with the other, she scooped Mercy out of the SUV and lowered her to her feet. \u201cYou have to help me, angel. You have to run with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d she asked, her voice laced with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to her right now. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>Jacob might not bother too much with Laine, feeling he\u2019d done enough damage to slow her down, but he was going to be enraged when he saw that Mercy was gone. Knowing this, Laine pulled Mercy by the hand in the opposite direction from whence she came, around the front of the house and toward the bridge, but after she crossed it, she huddled in the darkness beneath it at the river\u2019s edge. The rushing water would muffle any sounds they made should Mercy start to cry.</p><p>\u201cNot a sound,\u201d she cautioned Mercy. \u201cWe have to hide here now, long enough for him to leave and then I can take you to your mama....\u201d If she lasted that long. She was growing weak and a little dizzy. She shivered; the wet and night air were only making things worse. She tried to keep Mercy above the water, dry as possible, but poor Mercy shook with the cold. But little Mercy was so brave, burying her face in Laine\u2019s neck. It seemed a long time before she heard him roar in outrage, screaming Mercy\u2019s name. Then the SUV came to life, the headlights shining.</p><p>Laine heard a couple of gunshots, and with Jacob in the truck she wondered if they were under attack. She consoled herself that if he tried to escape out of the front of the compound, law enforcement would surely stop him before he got far. She waited tensely for the sound of that big SUV to rattle across the bridge, but it didn\u2019t come. She heard the engine, then heard it traveling away and she took a peek and saw something unreal. He was driving right down the river.... She shook her head in confusion, standing up to peek over the bridge and yes, he was driving down the river. There must be some back road out of here, totally concealed and blocked by the forest. The right jacked-up SUV could travel down the rocky river in the shallow parts, then exit the river to a road that Laine had never been aware of and she\u2019d poked around as much as possible.</p><p>He was going to get away.</p><p>Shaking almost too much to stand up, Laine pushed them to the shore beyond the bridge, pulling Mercy with her. \u201cCome, little angel, we have to hurry away...\u201d But she could barely move. She was on her knees, trying to stand. Mercy was on her feet and Laine tried to push up with her one good arm, but fell to her knees. Her only rational thought was, Shit, I\u2019m going to die from a damn bullet to the shoulder. Mercy was crying and Laine was literally crawling. Even if she had to crawl to the break in the fence, she was going to get Mercy out of this compound and as close as possible to the police barricade.</p><p>And then she was aware of footfalls, heavy thuds, running toward her. She glanced up to see a man in a dark ball cap and dark shirt with dirt on his face running toward her. He was carrying a gun and she did what came naturally\u2014she pulled Mercy down to the ground and covered her with her body. And there were more sounds of running coming at her.</p><p>As she was being lifted off Mercy, Laine struggled and fought, but it only caused her shoulder to scream in pain, matching the screaming that came from her throat. \u201cNo! No! Let the child be, leave her alone! No!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cEasy there, young lady, easy\u2014you\u2019re hurt,\u201d the man said.</p><p>And then a woman\u2019s voice cried, \u201cMercy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Laine looked up through blurry vision and saw Devon standing over her. And then she passed out.</p><p>\u201cWe better move out of here fast,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what threat we got in here, so best slink around the back side of that house up there. One thing is for sure\u2014we\u2019re gonna have us one big goddamn fire here pretty soon. We have to go out the fence and through the woods and to the road, see if we can meet up with that nice copper again.\u201d He pulled a large handheld bolt cutter off his belt and handed it to Cooper. \u201cStay to the shadows, Coop. Get us the hell out of here. This here girl is hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Laine,\u201d Devon said, holding her shivering daughter tightly against her. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who showed me the way to get out of here. Rawley, what if there are women and children in the house?\u201d</p><p>Rawley seemed to consider this for a moment, then he transferred his burden into Spencer\u2019s arms. \u201cWell, since I planned this circus, I guess I\u2019ll check the house.\u201d He picked up his rifle again. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me. Make tracks.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer lifted the young woman in his arms, getting her solidly against him. \u201cDevon,\u201d he said, \u201cfollow Cooper and try to be small as a shadow, in case there are snipers in here. I\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>They marched off in a group toward the back of the house and before going any closer to the buildings, Cooper stopped and made fast work of the fence, pulling back the loose aluminum so they could slip through. First Devon climbed through, and then Spencer ducked and maneuvered through. The woman was light in his arms, but she was so pale she almost gleamed in the moonlight. Cooper was the last to get through. \u201cWhat about Rawley?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>Right then there was the unmistakable report from a rifle and everyone froze.</p><p>\u201cI hope he didn\u2019t shoot anyone,\u201d Spencer muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not above it,\u201d Cooper said, pressing on. \u201cHe\u2019ll get out, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThat crafty old devil knows what he\u2019s doing. Follow me,\u201d he said. And Spencer doubted Cooper was a tracker, but he was the only one without a body in his arms, so he led them through the thick growth and trees. By the time they got through the woods and met the road, they also met Rawley.</p><p>\u201cWe heard a shot,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I blew the lock off the gate and opened it up. We need us a fire truck and ambulance,\u201d he said. He stripped off his shirt, draped it over Mercy and partly over Devon and asked, \u201cShe doin\u2019 okay there, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Scared and wet, but okay.\u201d</p><p>Laine stirred and groaned in Spencer\u2019s arms. He stopped walking, looked down at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you some help. Is there anyone left in the compound?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe got away,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMercy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her, Laine,\u201d Devon said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d she said, wiggling a bit in Spencer\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t make it two steps. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay behind me,\u201d Rawley said, handing off his rifle to Cooper. Then he took off at a jog down the road.</p> <p>They half jogged, half power walked down the road for a good half hour\u2014it was at least a mile, maybe closer to two. Rawley was ahead by a hundred yards and he approached the police vehicles with his arms high in the air. And suddenly the place lit up and was brought to life by a SWAT team, many police vehicles, Fire and Rescue and lots of guns pointed right at him.</p><p>\u201cWe got wounded,\u201d he yelled, and they charged him, guns drawn, securing him in handcuffs real fast.</p><p>Then they charged the rest of the party, same drill. Except, they didn\u2019t cuff them all. They just took the weapons and brought them forward.</p><p>Things began to happen fast. Rawley told them the place seemed to be deserted but for this wounded woman and the child, but one of the warehouses was on fire and it smelled like burning green cannabis. Laine was taken to an ambulance, Mercy and Devon were taken to another while Cooper, Spencer and Rawley were held and locked into the back of police vehicles. From where they sat they could see SWAT move down the road in their armored vehicle with lots of armed men hanging on. They were followed by the fire department at a safe distance, waiting for an all-clear to go in and fight the fire. More vehicles appeared, a helicopter flew overhead and a spotlight was shone down on the area. Dogs were pulled out of police cars by their handlers and they jogged to the scene.</p><p>While there had been a couple of Trooper vehicles a couple of hours ago, now there was a small army. Floodlights were up, sirens wailed, radios chattered.</p><p>And Rawley said to Spencer and Cooper, \u201cIt\u2019s always better when they don\u2019t shoot back. I can\u2019t believe we got \u2019em out that easy.\u201d</p><p>Spencer and Cooper exchanged looks and said in unison, \u201cEasy?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, showing off his straight, white dentures. \u201cYou\u2019re just pups. Spoiled little pups.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the rescue party was detained for questioning and because they were separated, Devon had no idea what had happened to Rawley, Spencer and Cooper. She was allowed to stay with Mercy and they were taken to the hospital together where Mercy was checked over by a pediatrician. It wasn\u2019t long before she was reunited with her friends from the FBI, including Emma Haynes. She explained everything that had happened and urged them to call Deputy McCain to verify. They didn\u2019t grill her like before\u2014this time they asked her some questions, then let her join Mercy in a hospital room where she lay down with her.</p><p>In the morning Agent Haynes informed her that the fire had been stopped before it spread into the forest, but some buildings were destroyed. Jacob had tried to escape down a hidden back road that led out of the compound via the river, but when he reached a closed road and was met with armed police, there was an exchange of gunfire. He was killed.</p><p>And she cried. Sobbed against Emma Haynes\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if it was relief, that he could never threaten her or hold her captive again, or if there was something inside her that was a sense of loss.</p><p>Devon asked about the other women and children. Charlotte had rescued her son and little Liam, but Priscilla had stayed behind with Jacob. Her body was found in the house. Not even Laine could explain what had happened, but clearly Jacob shot her. Perhaps with Mercy rescued, he didn\u2019t need her anymore. Of all the people in The Fellowship, she was the only fatality besides Jacob. She was also the only one completely loyal to him.</p><p>Hours later Devon was told that Laine had come out of a successful surgery removing a bullet from her shoulder and repairing the damage as much as possible. She had been able to give most of her story so the authorities understood that none of them were a part of any conspiracy\u2014they had merely gone on a mission to rescue Mercy. After many hours of statements and many dire warnings about taking such measures without the police, Devon was told that everyone had been released. Devon was asked if she\u2019d be willing to go over her statements again, add information if she could, help them to wrap up the entire investigation.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I think you\u2019re going to have to come to Thunder Point with your fancy equipment and try not to disrupt my life too much. I\u2019m the single mother of a child who has been through a lot and if I help you, you\u2019re going to have to help me a little.\u201d</p><p>Then Devon called Scott Grant and asked him if he\u2019d come to pick her up and bring her and Mercy home.</p><p>Of course he wanted all the details, and he deserved them, but she was tired and almost limp with relief. She gave him the quick version and then told him that when she recovered, she\u2019d tell him the whole story with all the little details. \u201cRight now I just need a day of rest and some time alone with Mercy. Can I have a day off?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and told her she could have whatever she wanted. \u201cSpence went with you,\u201d Scott pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, because he\u2019s that kind of man. He\u2019s a good friend. A good neighbor. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s sorted out how he feels about me. And Mercy. That\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p><p>There was a football game the next night and Devon didn\u2019t go. She tried pretending she didn\u2019t even know about the game, but she was completely aware and wondered if he looked into the stands, noticing she wasn\u2019t there. And she wondered if it would matter to him.</p><p>She invited Rawley to come to her little duplex for Saturday night dinner. After they\u2019d eaten and Mercy was occupied with one of her DVDs, they sat at the kitchen table over coffee and cookies and talked about their adventure. They exchanged information and filled in the blanks.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI has offered to get me some counseling,\u201d she told Rawley. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about taking them up on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight help,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s all a memory, you do what\u2019s right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mercy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t no expert, but if it\u2019s right for you, it\u2019s prolly right for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to thank Cooper for his help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I think he had fun, truth be told,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy\u2019s stronger than he looks,\u201d was all Rawley had to say. \u201cCarried that woman at a jog for darn near two miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she said. And right up until he decided he wasn\u2019t ready to be serious, he had carried her a little bit, too.</p><p>Devon called Cooper to thank him for his help. It was no small thing, what he\u2019d done. Not only could his life have been in danger, but then he had to suffer through at least twelve hours of questioning before he\u2019d been allowed to go home. But being the kind of guy he was, he just said anyone would\u2019ve stepped up just the same. \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t gone with Rawley, I\u2019d never have heard the end of it.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Spencer had dropped by the clinic the day after their rescue mission looking for Devon, and Scott had explained that she was relieved to have Mercy home and was exhausted, begging time off from work to try to rest and get her life back. He looked for her at the football game, of course, but was not entirely surprised she wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>He wanted to talk to her. Wanted more than talk, but he thought maybe she could use a little time. By the time Sunday rolled around, he could wait no longer. He made sure Austin was in Cooper\u2019s care then went to her house, but she wasn\u2019t there. He called her cell phone, but she didn\u2019t answer. He really didn\u2019t know what to do with himself, so like a smitten high school kid, he sat on her front step, waiting.</p><p>\u201cDevon isn\u2019t home,\u201d Mrs. Bledsoe said when she saw him there.</p><p>\u201cI know. I have to talk to her. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can walk down to the beach. The sun is out and she took that bag of beach shovels and pails that Mercy likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been to the bar, dropping off Austin, but he hadn\u2019t seen her on the beach. He decided to walk down the street past the marina and across the beach to find her. It was a little chilly although the sun was shining and there were only a few people on the beach. And Devon was on the part of the beach closest to the marina and farthest from the bar.</p><p>She must not have wanted him to see her from the bar. It filled him with dread.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look up until he was standing beside her. Mercy played in the sand a short distance away and she smiled at him. \u201cPencer,\u201d she said, and then went back to scooping sand.</p><p>Spencer dropped to the sand beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to call you to thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you did, it was far and away the bravest thing in the world. Thank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDevon, you were the brave one. You were ready to go alone.\u201d</p><p>She just shrugged. \u201cWhen your child is at risk, you don\u2019t even think. You just do what you have to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same deal when it\u2019s the woman you love,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to the clinic to see you. Scott said you were taking a couple of days to try to recuperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd think,\u201d she said. \u201cI really needed to think. It\u2019s like a bad dream. A four-year bad dream. And it\u2019s finally really over. I don\u2019t have to be afraid to leave Thunder Point...don\u2019t have to be afraid of some bogeyman just around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you. To explain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer, it\u2019s all right. I understand. After all you\u2019d been through you weren\u2019t ready to get involved with some woman with a mysterious and bizarre past, with a child, with baggage. You don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been sidetracked by Mercy\u2019s abduction, this would be coming sooner. I realized immediately, I made a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s all right. At least you caught it before it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon, my mistake was that I almost lost you. I almost let you get away. The idiotic part is that I let you go because I was afraid of losing you. When you asked me to be responsible for Mercy, it hit me like a ton of bricks\u2014if I let myself make a life with you and something happened, something completely unpredictable and catastrophic, like a car accident or...or cancer...\u201d He stopped for a second. He reached for her hand. \u201cIt makes no sense at all, but I panicked. I thought\u2014if something happens to her? How will I live? How many people can I lose before I go completely crazy? And you? Lose you? For just one split second I thought it would be easier not to have you at all than to face something like that. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, you don\u2019t. When you came to the bar to ask Rawley for a weapon so you could go after Mercy, I faced it head-on\u2014there it was, that thing I feared the most, that your life could be in danger. And, Devon, I love you too much to let you go. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll have six weeks together or sixty years\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that I have you in my life, in my arms, for as long as we\u2019re lucky enough to get.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, openmouthed.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cNow is the part where you say you understand.\u201d</p> <p>She turned toward him. \u201cSpencer, think about what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re not ready, you know you\u2019re not. This panic could rise again anytime. Don\u2019t get ahead of yourself here, because I don\u2019t want to love you and count on you and have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm around her waist and pulled her to him, holding her hard against his chest while he went after her mouth like a starving man. Her eyes flew open in surprise, but a moment later she was holding him, returning the kiss. He moaned in appreciation, wishing he would never have to release her. But eventually he did because there was talking to do. \u201cI love you, Devon. I wasn\u2019t looking for it, I didn\u2019t expect it, but I love you. I was so busy worrying about my own fears, my own losses, I didn\u2019t really think about yours. You\u2019ve been through so much, but you didn\u2019t even blink. You never panicked. You just faced it all head-on.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what life will throw at us, but I can\u2019t reel it back in. I\u2019m in love with you. It\u2019s a done deal.\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Spencer. I do love you, but I\u2019m afraid to get involved again. Maybe we should just give it some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time like the present,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ever feel like you\u2019re in over your head or if you\u2019re having second thoughts, you tell me. I\u2019m not going to hold you captive\u2014I\u2019m just going to love you as well as I can for as long as I can. I don\u2019t deserve it, but will you give me another chance? We were so good together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were,\u201d she said, giving him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait a minute. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m convinced enough to take that plunge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to negotiate one plunge at a time\u2014it\u2019s all up to you. Let\u2019s start with dinner and a game of Candy Land and after the kids are asleep...\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t help it, she laughed at him. But then she started to cry.</p><p>\u201cAw, baby, don\u2019t,\u201d he said, pulling her into his arms again. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I had a meltdown, that\u2019s all. You know I\u2019m not really that guy\u2014that afraid-of-commitment kind of guy. That was just an overreaction. I know how I feel, I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little too emotional to make a good decision about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scared you, that\u2019s all. I screwed up and made you think I\u2019m fickle. That I don\u2019t know what I want or how I feel. That I scare easy. But I\u2019m not any of those things. I\u2019ll prove it. Just let me try. Any time it doesn\u2019t feel right, all you have to do is say so, tell me what you want and you\u2019ll have it. I just want a chance. I can\u2019t walk away from you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me so happy, loving you, being loved by you.\u201d</p><p>He wiped away her tears with the pad of his thumb. \u201cDevon, I\u2019d walk into hell for you, I love you that much. Let\u2019s take it one day at a time. Together. Can you trust me that much?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand against his cheek. \u201cDo you have any idea how special I felt with you? Curled up on the couch, just watching a movie? Hanging out with the kids? Watching you train or coach your team? Making love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have all that again, I promise. I\u2019ll be there for you, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day at a time? You\u2019ll let me relearn that I can count on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I won\u2019t rush you, but I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed back her tears. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll give us a try.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her and kissed her again, deeply, passionately, holding her against him so tightly he was surprised she didn\u2019t break.</p><p>There was a tapping on his shoulder and he broke away to stare into Mercy\u2019s beautiful blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy you always kissing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love your mommy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. And she turned and went back to her bucket and pail.</p><p>He chuckled. Then he looked at Devon and said, \u201cThe first thing we\u2019ll do is spend some quality time together. Then I\u2019m taking you to a jewelry store so you can pick out a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer,\u201d she said in warning.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear it until you\u2019re ready, but I want you to have one. I want to spend my life with you. With you and Mercy and Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to rush me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGo easy on me, honey. I almost lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you, too, Spencer,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Eric got a call from Ashley\u2014Gina wondered if he\u2019d be willing to come to the house to have a chat with her and her husband. Here it comes, he thought. He didn\u2019t regret the way he played it out\u2014giving them plenty of time to talk it over and give him an honest answer regarding his possible full-time presence in Thunder Point. It had been the right thing to do. He didn\u2019t expect her to be happy with such a decision. After all, it brought into focus so many regrettable things from her past. Not only had she gotten pregnant by some loser who\u2019d abandoned her, but that loser had gone to prison. What woman in her right mind wanted regular reminders?</p><p>The service station in Thunder Point had been a good piece of property, one that he could easily renovate. It wasn\u2019t a rich town and he hadn\u2019t expected to turn a big profit on gas and repairs, however some of his customers had come from far away for his custom restoration work and if he added space and equipment to any property, many of them would follow him. Classic car restoration was not only good business, most of his customers collected cars\u2014it wasn\u2019t usually a matter of one or two, but many. To that end, Eric had looked at many similar properties. He\u2019d begun to like the idea of taking the investors\u2019 money and putting it into something new, some little gem he could grow into something good.</p><p>When he arrived in Gina\u2019s neighborhood at the edge of town, he felt an odd kind of happiness knowing that she\u2019d settled herself so well. Life couldn\u2019t have been easy for her, living with her mother and raising their daughter alone. But now, while she was still young, she had a fine husband, a good home and many nonjudgmental friends in Thunder Point. It gave him a sense of comfort, if not relief, to know he hadn\u2019t completely destroyed her life. And she\u2019d done an outstanding job with Ashley\u2014she was as fine a young woman as any he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>He had to park across the street and down the block. He walked to their house, up the walk and knocked on the door. Gina answered, smiling. \u201cHi, Eric. You\u2019re right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said four o\u2019clock. Listen, I hope you know I just want to be considerate of your feelings. Yours and Mac\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That was thoughtful. And I want you to know, we discussed it at great length and you will have an honest response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gina. I understand, I really do. I know I asked a lot. Ashley doesn\u2019t really understand what it\u2019s like to have ghosts and hard memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Eric,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cAshley understands that better than just about anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, I guess that\u2019s right,\u201d he said, remembering the rough spring she\u2019d had, terrible breakup with a serious boyfriend, some cruel texting going on meant only to cause her hurt. \u201cAnd I sure wouldn\u2019t want to cause her any more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the backyard, Eric. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked through the house. He passed by the kitchen and saw a couple of women who seemed to be preparing food in there. Then out the sliding doors onto the deck and there, in the backyard, mingling around a couple of barbecues and sitting at picnic tables were many teenagers and children and older couples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interrupting something,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cNo, Eric. You\u2019re definitely not.\u201d</p><p>Mac broke away from the grill, passing his spatula to a man beside him. He approached with his hand outstretched. \u201cWelcome,\u201d he said. \u201cGlad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Eric asked, immediately uncomfortable.</p><p>Gina put a hand on his arm. \u201cThe answer was easy,\u201d Gina said. \u201cIf you find a good business in this town and this is a place you\u2019d like to settle, we\u2019d be happy to welcome you to town. So we thought we\u2019d introduce you to some of our friends.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing he wasn\u2019t a crying fool, he thought. Not only was this one of the last things he ever expected, it was one of the kindest things anyone had ever done for him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, say hello. I\u2019ll make some introductions. Then you can tell me how you\u2019d like your burger, not that I\u2019m very great at getting it right,\u201d Mac said. \u201cMost of these folks have been here forever, but there are a few newcomers. They can give you some tips on settling in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you decide this is the right place for you,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWe just thought we\u2019d find a way to let you know\u2014it would make us happy to have a new business and responsible citizen come to town. This seemed like a good way to demonstrate that.\u201d</p><p>Good way to let him know? he thought. If these people had any lingering hope that he\u2019d give up this opportunity, they were going to be disappointed.</p><p>He wanted to be a part of a community that behaved with compulsive kindness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>There were only two more football games left in the season and the Thunder Point team was going to regionals. It was an outstanding team; Spencer was very proud of them. But on this overcast late October Sunday afternoon he stood on the beach with Cooper and Devon. They were looking not at the bay but up at the hillside. Cooper\u2019s house was framed already\u2014no doubt because Cooper was relentless and wanted that house done enough to move into before his new baby was born.</p><p>Cooper pointed at the hillside, designating lots as he had divided them. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the plot map, but understandably we have the lot next to the bar. There are twelve more single family sites available. I\u2019m leaving a large piece of land between the last home site and the edge of town\u2014I won\u2019t sell it. It\u2019s a nice buffer zone. Now how big a hurry are you in?\u201d</p> <p>Spencer dropped an arm around Devon\u2019s shoulders. She now wore a shiny diamond engagement ring, and it really hadn\u2019t taken that much convincing. \u201cWe\u2019re not as desperate as you and Sarah are, obviously. We have plenty of space for now. My house in San Antonio closed and there\u2019s no lease on the house I\u2019m in, as you no doubt know. Devon has four more months on her lease, but we can always work with that. Another month or two, she\u2019ll be ready to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when\u2019s the wedding?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still talking about that,\u201d Devon said. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I\u2019m still giving interviews to the FBI and I really want us to have some time to adjust. And maybe get married when we both feel we\u2019ve recovered from some of the challenges of the past few years.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tighter. \u201cI\u2019m ready right now,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready to build her a house by the sea. Right here. It appears we\u2019re going to have some excellent neighbors.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
