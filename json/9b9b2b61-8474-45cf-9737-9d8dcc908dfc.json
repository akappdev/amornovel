Here and there, gaslight gleamed, flashing will-o\u2019-the-wisp in the shrouding pea soup mist. It was the perfect night not to be seen.</p><p>Will Carver loped across rooftops and gables, leaping across an alley and coming to a halt behind a chimney near Brickbank.</p> <p>A man landed lightly on the tiles beside him, breathing hard from the exertion. He wore black leather from head to toe, and the only weapons he carried were a pair of razors, tucked in his belt. \u201cBloody \u2019ell. You tryin\u2019 to run me to death?\u201d Blade muttered.</p><p>The words were quiet, but the sound carried in the still night. Will\u2019s lip curled, and he glared at his master.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be listenin\u2019 for us, bucko.\u201d Blade straightened, staring at the ruddy pillar of smoke ahead of them. \u201cNot with that burnin\u2019. And none of \u2019em \u2019as your hearin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>A column of red glowed against the night sky ahead, barely muted by the fog. Every time Will breathed he could taste the ash in the air. Ahead, a massive brick gate and wall blocked the way into the city. A company of metaljackets paced in front of the gate, gaslight gleaming off the shining steel plates of their armored chests. With the flamethrower appendages in place of their left arms they looked formidable enough to keep the general rabble at bay. They were, however, automatons and not human.</p><p>He\u2019d long since learned they didn\u2019t look up.</p> <p>\u201cOver?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI got me pardon now,\u201d Blade said. \u201cCould waltz right on through them gates and they\u2019d not say a word.\u201d The devilish light in his eyes said he wanted to try. There was nothing Blade liked better than thumbing his nose at the blue bloods who ruled the city.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, we ain\u2019t all that lucky,\u201d Will reminded him. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a price on me head.\u201d</p><p>Blade sighed, eyeing the massive edifice. \u201cOver it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gettin\u2019 lazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be at \u2019ome, tucked up with me cheroot and a nice glass of mulled blud-wein.\u201d What he didn\u2019t add was the fact that he most likely wouldn\u2019t have been doing either of those things. If the fire hadn\u2019t called them out, Blade\u2019d be in bed with his wife, Honoria.</p> <p>Will took a few steps back. No point him being at home. The flat he rented these days was cold and uninviting. There was nothing for him to go back to.</p><p>A wide leap took him sailing across the street and onto a rooftop beside the gate. Taking a running start, he bounded up and over the wall before the guard on top had finished shaking out the flame on his match. Human eyes were sometimes just as bad as the automatons.</p><p>Bootsteps echoed him on the rooftops as he flitted lightly through the night. Fog parted around him, drifting in his wake, but he was moving too fast for anyone watching to see.</p><p>Here in the city the streets were a touch wider, the buildings not as jammed together as they were in the Whitechapel rookery he called home. Blood flushed through his veins as he leaped from rooftop to rooftop. He\u2019d been cooped up for too long; he needed this.</p><p>Screams caught his ear along with the organized shouts of people trying to marshal water pumps. Little snowflakes of ash floated through the air, almost thick enough to choke a man. Will paused in the crook of a chimney.</p><p>Ahead, the world looked like it was on fire. Billowing gouts of orange flame licked at the skies, and a thick dark pall of smoke hung over the river. Lines of people manned water pumps, desperately trying to stop the flames from spreading.</p><p>\u201cJaysus,\u201d Blade cursed as he knelt at Will\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThe draining factories,\u201d Will said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s fired the draining factories.\u201d</p> <p>It was unthinkable. The line of factories down by the river were owned by the ruling Echelon to filter and store the blood gathered in the blood taxes. This would be a huge blow to them.</p><p>Blade\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou and I ought to get out of \u2019ere, quick-smart.\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cThe place\u2019ll be swarmin\u2019 in metaljackets before we know it.\u201d</p><p>Will backed up a step. He knew what Blade wasn\u2019t saying. Two more perfect scapegoats couldn\u2019t be found. Most of the aristocratic Echelon had been furious with the queen\u2019s pardon and knighthood of Blade three years ago. And Will was just a slave-without-a-collar to their eyes.</p><p>A clink of metal caught his ears. Iron-booted feet on distant cobbles. A legion of metaljackets by the sound of it. \u201cGo,\u201d he snapped, shoving Blade in the back.</p><p>Blade needed no urging. He scrambled up the tiles on the roof, a break in the clouds bathing him in moonlight. Once, a few years ago, his hair would have lit up like a beacon. Now it had dulled to a light brown, and his skin was no longer as pale as marble.</p><p>Will followed at his heels in an easy lope, his ears alert to the slightest sound behind them. They\u2019d seen what they came to see. No doubt word of it\u2019d be all over the streets by morning.</p><p>Movement ahead caught his eye. A swirl of a black cloak stirring the fog. Will leaped forward and shoved Blade flat, covering him with his body.</p><p>\u201cOoof,\u201d Blade wheezed. He lifted his head. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ve already got a wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Will pressed his hand between the other man\u2019s shoulder blades, coming to a crouch. His gaze raked the fog. There. A metallic chink. Voices in the shadows.</p><p>From Blade\u2019s stillness, he\u2019d heard them too.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Will breathed, close to his ear. \u201cKeep your bloody head down and I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I need a friggin\u2019 nursemaid?\u201d</p><p>Will shot him a look. Three years ago, no. Blade\u2019d been the most dangerous thing to stalk the night. But his hair and skin color weren\u2019t the only changes in him since he\u2019d started drinking Honoria\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cYou go left,\u201d he finally murmured. Short of tying Blade to the chimney with his belt, there wasn\u2019t much chance of leaving him here.</p><p>Both of them faded into the fog. The voices ahead were getting farther away. Will moved like a wraith through the night, the movement rippling his dark wool coat around his hips. Beneath it he wore a heavy leather waistcoat that had been modified with steel inserts, as well as steel caps over his knees. You couldn\u2019t be too careful in a world where a man\u2019s main weapon might be a shiv or a heavy wrench. His loupe virus could heal almost anything, but being knifed still hurt.</p><p>Metal clanged and a pair of curses littered the air. Then silence, as though both people froze to see if they\u2019d been heard. Will slowed, creeping across the tiles with one foot placed carefully in front of the other. He knelt low, easing on hands and feet around the edge of a chimney. There was no sign of Blade, but then Blade was even better at this sort of thing than he was.</p><p>\u201cYou drop that again and Mercury\u2019ll have your head,\u201d someone snapped.</p><p>Two figures. Both dressed in black and moving with a footpad\u2019s efficiency. The shorter one picked up something heavy. A hollow metal tube, like the flamethrowers that the Spitfires used.</p><p>\u201cMercury ain\u2019t here, is he?\u201d asked the shorter man, hefting the flamethrower over his shoulder. \u201cAnd when he hears how well we done, then he\u2019ll be burying us in ale and whores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if the Echelon don\u2019t rip your guts out first,\u201d Blade said pleasantly, materializing out of nowhere.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Will leaped forward, even as the two men turned on his master. Despite their bickering, they moved with military efficiency. The shorter one snapped the flamethrower up, just as the other drew his blade. The tube coughed and then bright orange flame spewed through the fog, highlighting the roof and everyone on it.</p><p>Blade spun low, sweeping the knife-wielder\u2019s feet out from under him. Will grabbed the barrel of the flamethrower and elbowed the man in the face. There was a satisfying crunch, then his mind registered just how hot the tube was. He dropped it and it rolled toward the edge of the roof, catching in the gutter.</p><p>\u201cJust the two of you boys?\u201d Blade taunted, not even bothering to draw a knife. He bent backward, avoiding the swipe of the knife with a gravity-defying movement, before snapping upright.</p><p>The man he was facing stiffened. \u201cFrigging bleeders!\u201d He reached into his pocket to press something and then agony screamed through Will\u2019s head.</p><p>The sound was like an ice pick to the brain, wiping out all sense of time and place and even connection to his body. He hit the tiles, scrabbling blindly for purchase as he started to slide.</p><p>Something hit him hard under the chin, snapping his head back with resounding force. Words sounded, distorting the high-pitched scream, but he couldn\u2019t make any of them out. Then movement blurred at the edge of his vision. Another smashing blow against his cheekbone. Blood splashed over his face, wet and hot.</p><p>Will clapped his hands over his ears, collapsing back on the tiles. That sound! Like razors in his head.</p><p>In...his pocket. Something in the man\u2019s pocket. A device of sorts, making the noise.</p><p>Grinding his teeth together, he saw the shorter man lifting the flamethrower high. No time to think. He kicked out, aiming for the man\u2019s knee.</p><p>A heavy weight landed on him and they both grunted. The throbbing squeal of noise pounded in time to his heartbeat. Will clawed to his feet and staggered forward, searching for Blade.</p><p>There. On the roof. The other man knelt over him and Will realized he had a knife buried deep in Blade\u2019s chest. Trying to cut out his heart.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he roared, seeing red.</p><p>Anger rushed over him, swallowing him whole and burning him in its wake. He grabbed the man by the collar and flung him away. Blade gasped, clapping a hand to the knife hilt, but his reactions were still slow, disorientated.</p><p>The noise.</p><p>Will slammed the man down and yanked at his pocket. A small, vibrating device came free. He crushed it in his fist and the world fell silent.</p><p>Will staggered, throwing aside the crushed pieces. His ears were still ringing, but at least he could think. Breathe. Move.</p><p>The scent of hot, coppery blood washed over him.</p><p>\u201cBlade,\u201d he growled, leaping over the gasping man on the roof and sliding to his knees beside his master.</p><p>Blade lifted his head, then collapsed back down. \u201cBloody... Get it out...\u2019s silver.\u201d He lifted his fingers and flinched as they brushed against the knife hilt.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d Will snapped. A cold ring of sweat beaded on his forehead. The knife was buried to the hilt. He had no idea of the damage it had done, or what would happen if he removed it.</p><p>Behind him, the two men helped each other to their feet. Will spared them a glance, but they were trying to get away, now that the advantage had shifted once more to him and Blade.</p><p>\u201cGutted by a human.\u201d Blade laughed incredulously. \u201cAlways thought...it\u2019d be one of the Echelon. In the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop your whinin\u2019.\u201d Will wrenched his shirt off, a frisson of icy cold trailing down his spine. Blue bloods were notoriously difficult to kill. That was one reason the French revolution had guillotined their aristocrats. The only other way to stop them was to cut out their heart or cause severe damage to it. He swallowed hard and shoved his shirt around the wound to stop the bleeding. \u201cNothin\u2019 more\u2019n a scratch. We\u2019ll have you hale in no time.\u201d</p><p>Blade met his gaze. His fingers were surprisingly strong when they closed around Will\u2019s. \u201cSwear you\u2019ll look after \u2019er,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIf...if I don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Will dropped his gaze. \u201cAye. You know I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He owed Blade his life, no matter what he personally thought of Honoria. \u201cHold still. You need blood.\u201d</p><p>Darkness slithered through Blade\u2019s pale eyes. His head rolled to the side. \u201cFeels...numb...\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Panic speared through Will\u2019s gut. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Ripping at the heavy hunting knife he carried, he cradled his friend\u2019s head in his hands. \u201cHere. Have me blood. It\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>It was short work to slash the vein in his wrist open. He cupped the back of his head and held Blade\u2019s mouth to his wrist.</p><p>A moment of hesitation that never used to be there. He knew what Blade was thinking. He\u2019d stopped taking directly from any of his thrall\u2019s veins when Honoria came into his life. Now he drank his blood either from her or cold, out of the icebox.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. She won\u2019t mind,\u201d Will snarled.</p><p>That hint of darkness swept through Blade\u2019s irises again. Will\u2019s chest caught. Not in fear. Gods, not that. Anticipation swept through his veins, lighting them on fire. It\u2019d been a long time since he\u2019d been one of Blade\u2019s thralls. He\u2019d not realized how much he missed it.</p><p>As Blade\u2019s mouth closed over his wrist, his tongue sliding over the ragged wound, Will collapsed forward onto his hands. A gasp tore from his lips. Feeling flooded through him that he hadn\u2019t felt in years. It had confused him when Blade first took him as a thrall, but it was nothing more than his body\u2019s reaction to the chemicals in his master\u2019s saliva. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the moment of closeness...</p><p>This was all he\u2019d ever have of that.</p><p>He ground his teeth and tried to deny the pull. Twice as harsh after three years of abstinence. And just as confusing.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t feel this way with females.</p><p>Or he never had. Until Lena walked into his life.</p><p>And I\u2019m not thinkin\u2019 of her. Will bit his lip, trying to ignore the flush of pleasure that thought brought. Dark hair, dark eyes, that flirtatious little smile that drove him insane... His groin tightened and he growled, head bowed as the sensation against his wrist increased.</p><p>It was over all too quickly. Will collapsed onto his backside, clutching his wrist against his chest. The skin throbbed, still feeling the imprint of Blade\u2019s mouth. Heat flushed through the ragged edges of the knife cut\u2014his loupe virus, rapidly healing the wound. It would be gone by the end of the hour, barely a pink pucker against his swarthy skin.</p><p>Blade gasped, drawing his feet up. His eyes blazed with black fire, and he grabbed the handle of the hilt and ground his teeth together. Crying out, he drew it out of his chest and collapsed back on the roof, panting for breath.</p> <p>The wound was still bleeding, but sluggishly now. With his blood flushing through Blade\u2019s system, there was a strong chance he\u2019d pull through. Verwulfen blood was thrice as potent as a human\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHonoria\u2019ll...kill me...\u201d Blade gasped.</p><p>That\u2019s if he survived. Will took one look at the ashen color of his face and looked away swiftly. Damage to the heart was always dangerous. He had to get him back to the warren, where Honoria, with her medical background, might be able to help.</p><p>Rigging up a makeshift bandage, he held his coat in place to suppress the bleeding and then tied the ends of his shirt off. \u201cThere. That\u2019ll hold until we get you home.\u201d Sliding his arm under Blade\u2019s shoulder, he helped him to sit.</p><p>Blade gasped, clutching at his chest. The sight tore another shaft of ice through Will\u2019s gut. Followed by a hot stab of anger. Three years ago Blade would\u2019ve laughed this off. He was no longer standing on the edge of the Fade\u2014when the craving virus finally overtook a blue blood and he turned into something else, something worse\u2014but for a moment, Will didn\u2019t know if that was any better.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d</p> <p>Blade struggled to his feet, his eyes glassy with pain.</p><p>\u201cYou have to hold on,\u201d Will warned, bending and easing the other man over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to get you home. To Honoria. She\u2019ll know what to do. Just you hold on.\u201d</p><p>Honoria eased the blankets higher and then turned the knob on the gas lamp lower. Light muted, casting a variety of shadows across the room as Blade slept. Will paced in front of the fire, his wrist tingling as the skin healed.</p><p>Honoria washed her hands, moving away from the bed. Her face was composed, but deep shadows lingered in the hollows beneath her reddened eyes. As she turned, the light caught her profile and for a moment Will stopped breathing, seeing another\u2019s face in the shadows. Then she looked up, arching a brow at him and the image was gone. She shared the same dark eyes and rich mahogany hair as her sister, but Lena\u2019s face was prettier and she was a good inch or two shorter than Honoria.</p><p>Just the ghost of her image lingered, haunting him.</p><p>A quick jerk of the head meant Honoria wanted to talk to him. Outside.</p><p>Shooting Blade one last look, he strode to the door. An old shirt of Blade\u2019s hung loosely over his chest. He couldn\u2019t quite button it, and the sleeves stretched taut over his arms. Foolishness. But he wasn\u2019t knocking on Rip\u2019s door\u2014Blade\u2019s other lieutenant\u2014and asking for a shirt that might have a better chance at fitting him.</p><p>Honoria eased the door closed. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be fine. The bleeding\u2019s stopped and I\u2019ll get some more blood into him. Thank you for bringing him home to me.\u201d</p> <p>Will nodded. He never had much to say to her. They\u2019d tried, after she first married Blade, to find some common ground between them. But he knew what she thought of him\u2014had overheard it in quite explicit detail the night before he moved out of the warren.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>Unpredictable.</p><p>A threat to her sister.</p><p>Sometimes he wasn\u2019t sure if she hadn\u2019t been half right.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his wrist. \u201cDo you need tending\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to eat then? There\u2019s stew...in the kitchen. I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t hungry.\u201d He nodded his leave of her, then turned on his heel. The back of his neck was itching.</p><p>\u201cWill. Please.\u201d</p><p>He stopped moving and glanced back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can come home now. It breaks his heart that you\u2019re living on your own. And you know...she\u2019s not here anymore either.\u201d</p><p>Honoria would never understand. He shook his head. \u201cShe weren\u2019t the reason I left,\u201d he growled. Not the only one anyway.</p><p>Then he turned and stalked out into the darkness, feeling her eyes on his back the entire way.</p><p>No point going home.</p><p>Will stared at the fire in the distance, still raging out of control. Something bothered him about the attack. The mysterious device. The flamethrower. The silver knife. Those men had been prepared to face a blue blood and incapacitate them.</p><p>He breathed deeply through his nose. It was hard to pick up a scent trail with the overwhelming cling of ash in the air but not impossible. Moving east, he loped across the rooftops, his unease growing as the men circled back toward the north. Toward Whitechapel.</p><p>Just before the wall that circled the rookery, they dropped off the rooftops and disappeared into an alley. Will knew the area well. It was a dead end.</p><p>He followed them in and stared at the brick wall at the back of it. The ripe scents of the rookery spilled over into the surrounding streets. He wrinkled up his nose and looked around. There was a grate in the cobbles, but surely they wouldn\u2019t have gone down. That led to the sewers and from there into the notorious sprawl of Undertown. Weren\u2019t nothing living there now, only ghosts and whispers. People had tried to move back in once the vampire that had slaughtered its residents was killed, but something drove them back out.</p><p>If they came back at all.</p><p>All that space, the caverns and homes carved into the old underground tunnel scheme. Empty. Or was it?</p><p>Will hauled the grate out of the cobbles and dropped down into the dark, landing lightly on the pads of his feet. His nose told him there was nothing there. Nothing but refuse and the odd rat skittering away.</p><p>Without the ash or a breeze, it was easier to follow the trail. The men weren\u2019t moving fast, probably thinking they were safe from the Echelon and their metal army down here. Will shook his head. Dead men walking. The Echelon didn\u2019t just rely on the metaljackets. Give them an hour and the tunnels would be full of Nighthawks, the infamous guild of trackers that did most of the thief-taking in the city. Rogue blue bloods who could smell almost as well as he could and track a shadow over stone, or so it was said.</p><p>He\u2019d have to hurry if he wanted to get his hands on them first.</p><p>He waded into the sluggish stream, his nose almost shutting down. He\u2019d smelled worse things\u2014the vampire sprang to mind\u2014but right now they were only a distant memory. It was the curse of heightened senses. He could smell everything, from a woman\u2019s natural musk to the slight hint of poison in a cup; he could see for miles and if he listened, he could hear things people didn\u2019t want him to hear.</p><p>Like stealthy footsteps, a few hundred yards in front of him.</p><p>Will made no sound as he stalked them. Whispers echoed and then a light appeared. A shuttered smuggler\u2019s lantern by the look of it.</p><p>\u201cGot him,\u201d the short, fat one crowed. \u201cRight in the chest. Won\u2019t be so high-and-mighty now, will he?\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d the taller shadow snarled. The acrid scent of fear-sweat washed off him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see his bloody face?\u201d</p><p>A shrug. The short man sloshed through the water carelessly. \u201cAll looks the same to me. Pasty-faced vultures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was him,\u201d the other man replied with a shudder. \u201cThe devil himself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Devil of Whitechapel?\u201d The shorter man\u2019s face stretched in a delighted grin. \u201cCor, Freddie! All them years and the Echelon themselves ain\u2019t been able to get near him! And you done him in! You\u2019re famous now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloody dead, is what I am,\u201d Freddie snapped back. \u201cIf that were the devil, then you know who the other one was!\u201d</p><p>Will took another step forward, drawing the blade at his side. He smiled. That\u2019s right, you son of a bitch. You\u2019re in trouble now.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Beast,\u201d Will hissed, his voice echoing out of the darkness.</p><p>Freddie screamed and swung the lantern.</p><p>Will smashed it aside and it hit the water and hissed out. Darkness fell like a theatre curtain, but he was already moving, driving his fist up under the whistling swing of an arm and connecting with a pair of ribs. Bone snapped and then Freddie was down with a gurgling cry, splashing under the water.</p><p>Will stilled, listening to the frantic sound of breathing.</p><p>\u201cFreddie?\u201d the fat man whispered. He fumbled for the sides of the sewer, his breath high-pitched and panting.</p><p>Will took a slow step forward, water sloshing around his knees.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d The fat man tried to run. \u201cOh, God, no! I didn\u2019t have naught to do with it! It were Freddie! Leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>Will grabbed his cloak and hauled him back. He landed with a splash, his legs kicking in the sewer water as he squealed like a downed pig. Fisting the cloak, Will wrapped it around the fat man\u2019s throat and then hauled him up in a choking grip.</p><p>\u201cWho are you? Who do you work for?\u201d</p><p>The fat man kicked, making strangled sounds. Will held him long enough for the kicking to falter, then dropped him in the water.</p><p>Movement behind him. He lashed out, catching the heavy metal tube as Freddie swung it and followed through with a punch. Blood sprayed as his fist connected with Freddie\u2019s nose. The coppery tang of it flavored the air, and Freddie screamed and fell back into the water.</p><p>\u201cJaysus.\u201d The fat man sobbed, his throat hoarse.</p><p>Will caught him up by the coat and slammed him back against the slimy walls. He slid his hand into the man\u2019s coat, rifling his pockets. A switchblade the idiot was too dumb to draw, a piece of waxed paper, and an odd, finger-shaped device. Another one of those noisemakers. He pocketed both it and the piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cConsider yourself lucky he ain\u2019t dead.\u201d The thought set off the red-hot flare of rage in his head, and he slammed the fat man against the wall. Then again.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d</p><p>Careful, a little voice warned. Don\u2019t lose control.</p><p>Will growled, the sound echoing inhumanly through his throat. They already thought him a beast. Why the hell shouldn\u2019t he rip them apart? They\u2019d put a knife in Blade. Nobody touched his adopted family and lived to tell of it.</p><p>Shouts echoed through the tunnels. Will\u2019s head shot up and he clenched his fist. Nighthawks. On the trail already, damn it.</p><p>He leaned closer and sniffed the air beside the man\u2019s ear. \u201cGot your scent now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou ever come near Whitechapel again and I\u2019ll come for you. I\u2019ll rip you apart, one piece at a time...and feed it to you. You don\u2019t want that, do you?\u201d</p><p>The stench of urine filled the air and the man sobbed his agreement. Will dropped him with a splash then turned on his heel.</p><p>The Nighthawks would smell him, but they wouldn\u2019t catch him. This was Will\u2019s turf here, and they wouldn\u2019t dare cross the wall circling Whitechapel to hunt him. Time to get the hell out of here. He gave Freddie and his fat friend one last hungry look, then turned and fled into the darkness.</p><p>They\u2019d remember his threat. That was all that mattered.</p><p>Will tossed the shirt away with a wet slap and then started on the buttons of his breeches. Both stunk from the tunnels, but he felt a damned sight better. The tension between his shoulders eased with every blow he\u2019d dealt.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted blood. Wanted to kill. But sometimes it was best to leave them alive. Witnesses. Men who\u2019d spread the stories in hushed tones in local alehouses, warning others not to risk the wrath of Whitechapel\u2019s Beast. It was all part of the legend he was carefully cultivating. A lesson he\u2019d learned from Blade.</p><p>Fear was often the best defense.</p><p>The air was chilly as he kicked off the rest of his clothes and strode for the washbasin. He usually didn\u2019t notice the cold, but he\u2019d been wet for hours and his stomach was empty. Scrubbing the stink off himself, he draped a blanket around his hips and then turned toward the kitchen. There was bread and cheese left over, and a jug of clean water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Resting his backside against the table, he bit into his meal and stared at his shirt. There was something sticking out of it. A piece of paper. The note the fat man had carried.</p><p>He padded across the room and knelt, chewing slowly. The paper was thick with wax. Whoever had written it had wanted it to stay dry, which meant he thought the recipient of it would get wet at some stage. Will frowned. Just where had those two been heading\u2014in the sewers? The water this time of year was barely knee high.</p><p>There were whispers that it was deeper down below, though. In some parts of Undertown.</p> <p>Fishing it open, he tilted it toward the single lamp. Lines of symbols crisscrossed the parchment\u2014letters, numbers, and odd slashing marks. An incomprehensible mess.</p><p>What the hell had he stumbled upon? Will took another bite of his bread and cheese and stood, crossing closer to the lamp. The better light made no sense of the symbols, not that he\u2019d expected them to.</p><p>Will flipped the paper over, but there was nothing on the back. No scent but the odd waxy substance. He frowned. Burning down the draining factories, coded letters, strange devices that had obviously been made to incapacitate blue bloods... Somebody was looking to start a war.</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cHow spectacularly...gaudy.\u201d</p> <p>Lena glanced away from the curtained platform, her attention drawn by the dripping malice in her friend\u2019s tone. \u201cWhatever do you mean, Adele?\u201d</p><p>Adele Hamilton\u2014a former diamond of society\u2014leaned closer and turned her lip up. \u201cThey\u2019ve got puppets. I\u2019m surprised Miss Bishop hasn\u2019t invited an entire menagerie to perform for us this evening. Or a circus troupe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because she signed a thrall contract with Lord Macy and you thought he was going to offer for you.\u201d Lena turned her head to the balcony where Miss Bishop was sipping champagne and glowing with happiness. Having signed a thrall contract with Lord Macy, Miss Bishop was now set for life. It was the highest ambition of any debutante. To be protected. Showered in diamonds and fancy golden steam carriages. Dripping in pearls.</p><p>All it cost was a little something in return.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Lena shivered and looked down into her half-empty glass.</p> <p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d accept someone like Macy.\u201d Adele sniffed and drained her glass. Yet her pretty almond-shaped eyes watched the pair on the balcony like a hawk.</p><p>Macy rested his hand on Miss Bishop\u2019s gloved one and slowly stroked her fingers. Even from the gardens below, Lena could see her breathing quicken and Macy\u2019s eyes darken with desire. He seemed so much older than Miss Bishop in that moment. So much more powerful. It made Lena feel sick to her stomach.</p><p>Stop it, she told herself sharply. Don\u2019t think about it. It was Miss Bishop\u2019s choice. She wasn\u2019t being forced into this.</p><p>Except by circumstances.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re carrying on so in public,\u201d Adele continued. \u201cHe might as well throw her down now and have her.\u201d</p><p>Caught in her own discomfort, Lena\u2019s voice was sharper than she intended. \u201cSheathe your claws before you cut yourself.\u201d</p><p>Adele shot her a devastating smile, one that had won half the hearts in the Echelon. And then broken them. \u201cMiaow,\u201d she purred.</p><p>Despite her unease, Lena couldn\u2019t stop an answering smile from tugging at her lips. Adele was the kind of friend you certainly couldn\u2019t trust, but after the debacle last year where she was caught in the gardens with Lord Fenwick\u2014who later refused to contract her\u2014Adele was also an outcast of sorts. She\u2019d clawed her way back into society via an icy heart and an unwavering smile, but her time, like Lena\u2019s, was running out. And unlike Lena, who was here for a purpose, Adele had no other options in life.</p> <p>A crowd was gathering in front of the curtained stage. Service drones hovered, the silver platters fitted on their heads offering an array of beverages. Lena slipped another pair of champagne flutes from the tray, avoiding the drone\u2019s steam vent. They were highly practical, rolling quietly through the crowds, but more than one young lady\u2019s dress had been ruined and Lena was wearing crushed violet silk.</p><p>She kept an ear open as she moved through the crowd, idly listening\u2014and then discarding\u2014conversations. Being a debutante was the perfect disguise. In a way, she was almost invisible. People said things in front of her that they would otherwise have kept quiet.</p><p>It was a most convenient way to spy. She barely had to do anything at all.</p><p>\u201cPuppets.\u201d Adele shook her head. Yet, she too gathered in front of the stage, desperate not to miss a thing.</p><p>The night was mild, stars glittering overhead. Lena looked up, her vision adjusting to the light. A thousand diamonds, her mother used to say when she was a little girl. \u201cAll for me,\u201d Lena would cry, and her mother would laugh and kiss her good night.</p><p>Now the stars seemed to have lost some of their luster, and the diamonds too. The world around her was too bright, too shiny, all silk and gold and malicious laughter. The world of the Echelon had once been the only thing she\u2019d ever wanted, and now that she danced along its verge, she couldn\u2019t help wondering if there was something more out there for her.</p><p>Not that she would ever admit that.</p><p>She\u2019d begged her sister, Honoria, for this chance when it became clear that there was nothing left in Whitechapel for her. Pleaded for weeks to be allowed back to her former life, and the possibility of making a thrall contract.</p><p>Strangely enough, an ally had come from an unexpected source: Leo Barrons, her half brother. As heir to the Duke of Caine, Leo could never reveal the truth of their connection\u2014and his own illegitimacy\u2014but he\u2019d offered to take her as his ward and Lena had gratefully accepted. When her father had been alive, she\u2019d hovered on the edge of the Echelon. Now, with a man as powerful as Leo as her guardian, she was embraced completely.</p><p>And she\u2019d never felt more alone.</p><p>An uneasy feeling lifted the hairs on the back of her neck. The sharp, horrible sensation of being watched. Lena looked around but there was no one there. Something hissed and she flinched. It sounded like a kettle giving vent to its rage. The crowd pressed closer and conversation dimmed. On stage, the tinny sound of an organ grinder began to play.</p><p>It struck a chord in her memory; the raucous sounds and laughter of Whitechapel, the press of unwashed bodies, and the bawdy language that she\u2019d pretended not to memorize. Music on the streets, in the penny gaff houses. A sound best forgotten. She\u2019d left Whitechapel behind a year ago. It felt longer. In that time, she\u2019d lost all of her youthful pretensions and realized exactly what type of world she lived in\u2014and the fact that there was very little she could do about it.</p><p>But what she could do about it, she would. There was a movement brewing to restore humans to equal status as blue bloods\u2014no more blood taxes, no more martial law, no more involuntary thralls\u2014and she was in an ideal position to help them. Lena had access to a host of the Echelon\u2019s secrets...if she kept her ears open.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Miss Bishop has a monkey after all,\u201d Adele whispered.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d Lena said, rising on her toes to see. As she did, she ran her gaze across the crowd, relaxing only when she realized there was no one watching her.</p><p>Just nerves... She was safe here, with the crowd and Adele at her side.</p><p>The curtains parted with a melodramatic jerk. On the terrace, the gas lamps suddenly faded, the muted flames casting a surreal blue light across the gathering. Steam curled out, obscuring a figure on the center of the stage. Its arms jerked into the air, the strings clearly visible against the gaslight.</p><p>\u201cMarionettes,\u201d Adele dismissed.</p><p>The Contract Ball of Miss Bishop had been talked about for the last month as the event of the Season. Gossip had promised delights and curios far beyond anything ever seen, but so far the night had been disappointing. Lena relaxed down onto her heels just as the crowd gave an appreciative gasp.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d Adele said. \u201cLook, the strings have fallen!\u201d</p><p>And so they had. The marionette gave a feeble jerk, its arms collapsing to its sides. And then slowly, with the mysterious steam curling around its feet, it began to straighten.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an automaton,\u201d Lena said.</p><p>The metal creature began to move, his hands coming up as though he held someone in his arms. Against the tinny organ-grinder music, he began to waltz.</p><p>Lena\u2019s mouth dropped open. She\u2019d seen numerous service drones and dozens of the armored metaljackets that protected the streets and imposed the Echelon\u2019s will, but she\u2019d never seen anything like this. Why, the joints were streamlined, and the movement of the automaton was peculiarly fluid, almost human.</p><p>The performance came to an end, the organ-grinder winding down slowly. The automaton\u2019s pace slowed and it began to falter in time to the music. Whoever the handler was, he was a man of great skill.</p><p>Lena clapped enthusiastically. She wanted a closer look. She was talented with her steel clockworks, but this was artistry on a level she could barely comprehend.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the crowd wanted a closer look too. Lena found herself separated from Adele and eddied to the side, like a piece of flotsam in a raging current.</p><p>Dashing a feather out of her vision, she looked for Adele.</p><p>And that was when she saw him.</p><p>The warmth drained from her face. Alaric Colchester, the Duke of Lannister, watched her from across the crowd, a predatory smile on his thin lips as he sipped a flute of blud-wein. Her heart skipped a beat. Against the pale, powdered skin of his face, his red-stained lips flashed through her mind, reminiscent of a time long ago. But that time, the blood had not been watered with wine.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. She made certain of that before she accepted any invitations these days. With a meeting called in the Ivory Tower between the Council of Dukes that ruled the city, she\u2019d been sure she\u2019d be safe.</p><p>It must have finished early.</p><p>Lena tore her gaze away, her heart thundering in her ears. Don\u2019t run. If she\u2019d learned anything over the years, it was that fear roused a blue blood to uncontrollable hungers.</p><p>A swift glance showed movement through the crowd. The pale, shining blond of his hair as he stalked her. Lena strained on her toes. Where had Adele gone? There was sometimes safety in numbers.</p><p>If Colchester felt like playing by the rules.</p><p>He was a duke, after all. Head of one of the seven great Houses that ruled the city. If he wanted to take her here, right now, then he could drag her off and no one would dare say a thing. Her guardian, Leo, the only man with the strength to counter Colchester, had been at the Ivory Tower meeting, standing in for his father, the Duke of Caine.</p><p>Lena moved into the crowd, a smile pasted on her face. The patch of bare skin at the back of her neck tingled. Lifting her glass, she tried to catch a hint of his reflection, but the crowd was too dense.</p><p>Damn him. She shot a look over her shoulder.</p><p>Too many people, pressed together and laughing at the mechanized puppetry. No sign of Colchester.</p><p>Music and laughter assaulted her ears. The crowd was a riot of bright colors as she whipped her head around, a fist clenched in her skirts. Don\u2019t run. God, don\u2019t run. But where the devil had he gone?</p><p>A large pink ostrich feather floated through her vision. Adele. Lena pushed toward her. A pair of ladies gossiped behind their fans and Lena staggered between them, straight into a firm chest. Gloved hands caught her shoulders, as if to steady her.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d she murmured, then froze as she saw the ink-black velvet coat, with its gold epaulets and a tassel draped from his right shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou look pale, my dear.\u201d Colchester smiled his shark\u2019s smile and his hands tightened as she instinctively tried to draw back. \u201cLike you need some air.\u201d</p><p>His grip urged her to the side, toward the garden. Lena dug her slippers in and shook her head, a desperate smile pasted on her face. She couldn\u2019t let anyone see her distress. It would only start rumors she couldn\u2019t afford. A lady\u2019s reputation was all that kept her from being claimed by any blue blood as his blood whore for the night.</p><p>Somehow she forced a laugh. It was her only defense. \u201cAu contraire, Your Grace.\u201d A swift gesture at the gardens around them. \u201cI have nothing but air, it seems.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered with dark enjoyment. The hairs along her spine rose, but somehow she managed an insouciant shrug. Colchester would scent the rising spike of fear, acrid on her skin. A delicate sauce, he\u2019d once told her, to flavor the meal...</p><p>\u201cThank you for catching me, Your Grace. But I\u2019m afraid I must find my friend, Adele. She was feeling poorly. I was supposed to fetch her some water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d he soothed, his hand dropping to hers. He stroked her fingers through the silk of her gloves. \u201cI was hoping you would save a dance for me. The assah, if you will.\u201d</p><p>A dance designed to tempt, to best display a potential thrall\u2019s assets to a blue blood. The smoky eroticism of it was something she\u2019d never surrendered to in public, but to witness it... Oh, to witness it was something else. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking.\u201d</p><p>Lena tugged at her hand, but his iron fingers curled around her wrist, a hint of shadow darkening his pale eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, my dear. I\u2019m trying to be courteous, but I\u2019m afraid your beauty quite drives me...out of my mind.\u201d A smile, then he brushed the back of one hand against her cheek.</p> <p>Laughter surged through the crowd, making her jump. They were so close and yet they might as well be in the Orient for all the good they would do her.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought any more on my offer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been terribly occupied\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a month.\u201d</p><p>Not long enough. She would never be his thrall. Lena tipped her chin up and stared him directly in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s been a busy month, Your Grace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColchester. I told you to call me Colchester. After all,\u201d a smirk, \u201cwe are rather well-acquainted, are we not?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to smash the glass bulb from her champagne flute and stab him in the eye with the stem. The thought of Colchester with his mouth on her body made her stomach twist.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>\u201cMust I wait another month for an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Your Grace. This is unseemly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLena!\u201d Adele\u2019s cry came out of nowhere. \u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>A burst of perfume washed over them, then Adele was there, the feathers in her hair tickling Colchester\u2019s nose. He flinched away, his face tightening with fury. Adele clapped a hand to her mouth and giggled, seemingly overcome by champagne. \u201cOh, Your Grace! I didn\u2019t see you there. My apologies.\u201d</p><p>The crowd pressed upon them. He had no choice but to let her go.</p><p>Lena tugged her hand close to her body, as if he\u2019d done her some injury. Fingers brushed against hers and then Adele squeezed her other hand.</p><p>Colchester gave her a curt nod. \u201cUntil next time. I will demand an answer.\u201d Then he turned and strode through the crowd.</p><p>All of a sudden Lena couldn\u2019t breathe. Adele took one look at her face and hustled her away, into the edges of the garden.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Adele said, snatching a glass of champagne off a service drone\u2019s platter. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t...\u201d The only thing holding her upright was Adele\u2019s hand.</p> <p>A small folly appeared, shadowed from the rest of the garden party. Adele spun her around, forcing her to put her hands on the railing and lean forward. Tearing apart Lena\u2019s buttons, she loosened the strings on her corset.</p><p>Lena collapsed forward, sucking in a lungful of air. Her body was trembling from top to toe. She didn\u2019t know what had happened. Only that she hadn\u2019t been able to draw breath. Still couldn\u2019t, really.</p><p>Warmth splashed down her cheeks and she dashed at them with her gloved hands. Adele rubbed small circles on her back.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She\u2019d never have expected Adele, of all people, to come to her rescue.</p><p>Adele\u2019s hand paused. \u201cI just wish there\u2019d been someone there...for me.\u201d</p><p>Lena looked up and met her gaze, her breath shuddering through her. \u201cI thought you went willingly with Lord Fenwick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the rumor he put about. They all know, of course.\u201d Adele\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cIt\u2019s become sport amongst the younger circles. They think taking a woman as thrall is old-fashioned. Why support her for life when you can take what you want from her then cast her aside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...that\u2019s appalling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne step removed from a blood slave.\u201d Adele shrugged a slim shoulder. \u201cThe reason I was chasing Lord Macy is because he\u2019s a traditionalist. He believes in protecting his thralls. If I were you, Lena, I would look to someone older. And don\u2019t settle for anything less than a thrall contract. It\u2019s the only protection you or I have these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anybody say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would dare?\u201d Adele laughed, but there was no humor in it. Her expression hardened. \u201cAnd why should any of the Echelon stir a finger to help us? We\u2019re food, Lena. The only interest they have in keeping us alive or taking us as thralls is because it\u2019s easier for them. We\u2019re like penned livestock.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared. \u201cThey\u2019re not all like that. My guardian, Leo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnows what\u2019s going on as surely as we do. And has he said a single word about it?\u201d</p><p>Lena opened her mouth. And said nothing. Everything she saw on Adele\u2019s face was but an echo of how she herself felt. Trapped. Prey.</p><p>No. Not prey. She took a deep shuddering breath. Prey didn\u2019t fight back; they didn\u2019t find a way in which they could make a difference, and that\u2019s what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cTake my advice,\u201d Adele continued. \u201cI saw the look on Colchester\u2019s face. You need protection. Your guardian isn\u2019t enough\u2014he\u2019s not even here, is he? If I were you, I would find some old decrepit lord with enough power to stand up to Colchester and beguile him into taking you as his thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be the only option I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, for girls like you and me, there isn\u2019t any choice. The sooner you open your eyes to the world you truly live in, the better. Otherwise you\u2019re nothing but a fool\u2014and fools don\u2019t survive very long here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you this morning?\u201d</p><p>Lena opened her eyes, her head resting against the carriage\u2019s window. Her companion, Mrs. Wade, peered at her over the top of her crochet. There was no sign of the attack of the megrims that had plagued her last night, keeping her from Lord Macy\u2019s ball.</p><p>Rubbing at her aching eyes, Lena sat up. \u201cNothing. I didn\u2019t sleep very well last night, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should return to Waverly Place.\u201d Concern rounded Mrs. Wade\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou could do with some more rest.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYour motivations are utterly transparent.\u201d Leaning forward, she peered through the velvet curtains of the steam carriage\u2019s window, her fingers tapping on the box in her hand. She hadn\u2019t dared let it out of her sight.</p><p>Mrs. Wade had the good grace to blush. She had her own feelings on what constituted as appropriate recreational pursuits for ladies. Designing clockwork toys was not one of them. \u201cI\u2019m simply concerned about your reputation. If anyone saw us at that shop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would see us here? And if they did, I\u2019m only purchasing a new clock.\u201d</p><p>The steam carriage rattled to a halt outside Mandeville\u2019s Clockwork Emporium. Her eye skipped over the dirty ragamuffins playing tumbler in the alleys and the coal lasses slipping through the crowd with their pails balanced on their shoulders. She\u2019d seen all too much of it during her sojourn in the rookeries of Whitechapel, after her father\u2019s death. Indeed, that had once been her, before Mr. Mandeville took her on as his apprentice.</p><p>Sympathy choked her. No matter the dangers of her own life at court, they were nothing to what the coal lasses risked, walking the streets unprotected. At least in society she would never be left to die bleeding in the gutters, her life worthless to the blue bloods. Her position saw to that. She was potential prey\u2014but she was also protected prey.</p><p>The door opened and a footman appeared. \u201cMiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Henry.\u201d Lena accepted his hand and stepped down onto the cobbles. Mr. Mandeville saw her coming and opened the door for her. With the curled ends of his waxed moustache, the pair of magnifying glassicals perched upon his windswept gray hair, and a distinct patchwork quality to his waistcoat, he would never be received within the great houses. Yet he was one of the finest clockmakers she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And so much more.</p><p>He\u2019d also been her savior, dragging her out of the gutters\u2014when she\u2019d been that bleeding, discarded coal lass\u2014and tending her in his shop. Offering her respectable work. Then later, giving her some sense of hope when she had first begun to realize that her life at court wasn\u2019t the safe world she\u2019d been searching for.</p><p>She could remember only too well the day she\u2019d returned for her cloak and overheard him discussing secrets that could get a man hanged. The shock had nearly floored her. Mr. Mandeville, a humanist? She\u2019d kept the secret to herself for days, tossing and turning at night as questions started to gnaw at her. Excitement. Finally she\u2019d confronted him and demanded to join the cause.</p><p>\u201cMiss Todd,\u201d Mr. Mandeville greeted, though he\u2019d once called her \u201cLena\u201d and threatened to rap her knuckles if she knocked over any of his clocks.</p><p>\u201cMr. Mandeville,\u201d she replied, proffering the box. \u201cYou\u2019re looking well. The summer air must be agreeing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this it?\u201d His eyes lit up as he saw the box.</p><p>A warm spark of something sinfully proud reared itself in her chest. There were very few things she\u2019d ever been good at. \u201cIt is,\u201d she breathed. \u201cOh, you should see it. It works exactly as I\u2019d planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>At her nod, he ushered her toward the counter. The walls seemed to encroach the farther one went into the shop due to dozens of hanging, ticking clocks that loomed off the plaster. As his apprentice, Lena had grown used to the sight of them. Mrs. Wade, however, hovered near the windows, glaring at the swinging pendulums from the safe depths of her bonnet.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville placed the box on the counter and slid a glance toward Mrs. Wade. \u201cOld Dragon-Breath is still in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I\u2019ve come to see if you\u2019ve any orders for me.\u201d The work was steady enough to keep her occupied, though she had to do so under her brother\u2019s name. A Charlie Todd original clockwork toy went for a rather generous price. They weren\u2019t always for children either, though Lena took the most pleasure from those commissions.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Mandeville opened the box and slid his long fingers under the foot-high clockwork. He lifted it reverently and set it on the counter. \u201cOh, my. Oh, Lena, this is your finest work. He\u2019s utterly magnificent. Wherever did you come by the inspiration for such a thing? I assume it walks?\u201d</p><p>Steel overlapping plates drew the eye, burnished to a polished gleam. The clockwork sculpture was a man, a burly figure carved from iron sheeting and seething with an interior of springs and coils. It stood on a metal plate, with a windup key at the back. Heat crept into her cheeks. The last thing she could admit was her inspiration. She\u2019d never before dared take this image from the sheets of paper she sketched upon to work in iron sheeting. \u201cIt does more than that. Here, let me show you.\u201d</p><p>The key grew tighter and tighter to turn. The figure trembled, his rough-hewn face jerking almost with violence. How apt, she thought, then let the key go.</p><p>For a moment nothing happened. The virile iron man quivered, and then slowly the gears started turning. The plates slid back upon each other, revealing a swift glimpse of the cogs within. Then a creature began to form, just as wild and fierce as the iron man had been.</p><p>Mandeville sucked in a breath. Lena watched his face as he tugged his magnifying glassicals up and peered closer. \u201cMy goodness, Lena! It\u2019s incredible. Look at it transform! One moment a man, the next a wolf.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Breathlessly they both watched as the wolf slid back into the man, the clockwork gears grinding slower and slower, until finally it stopped, caught in transition, the man\u2019s face scowling out over a hint of the wolf\u2019s jaws.</p><p>\u201cWell? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Mandeville let out his breath and cleaned his glassicals. \u201cYou truly have a gift, my dear. This is beyond compare. Beyond!\u201d Her heart swelled, until she saw him shake his head. \u201cHowever, you\u2019ll never sell it. What on earth possessed you to create such a thing? The Echelon will have you thrown in the dungeons of the Ivory Tower!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a year ago,\u201d she replied, glancing over her shoulder at Mrs. Wade. Her voice dropped. \u201cTimes are changing, Mr. Mandeville. There\u2019s talk of the Scandinavian Empire sending an embassy to London.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Mandeville stilled. \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a loose grate...in the ceiling of my guardian\u2019s study,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI often do some of my work in the solar above.\u201d</p><p>A conspiratorial smile. As though her ingenuity had surprised him.</p><p>\u201cLeo was entertaining the dukes of Malloryn and Goethe yesterday morning. It\u2019s not common knowledge yet, but the Council is concerned.\u201d</p><p>Mandeville leaned closer, peering at the clockwork transformational through his glassicals. His attention, however, was all upon her. \u201cI still don\u2019t see how this changes matters. The Echelon exterminated the Scottish verwulfen clans at Culloden. This...this piece stirs dangerous sentiments toward an ancient enemy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He picked the clockwork back up and began to nestle it safely in its box, where it might never again see the light of day.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Malloryn said that the Echelon were considering a peace treaty with the Scandinavian clans,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville froze. Both his eyebrows slowly vanished into his hairline. \u201cThat\u2019s unheard of. The Scandinavian verwulfen have been at odds with Britain since Culloden. There\u2019s no chance they would agree to a treaty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I know. Mrs. Wade discovered me and I was forced to go look at bonnets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Mandeville whispered. \u201cI shall have to pass this information on. At once.\u201d</p><p>Lena glanced at Mrs. Wade, who was tapping her reticule impatiently. \u201cDo you think I should meet with Mercury? To tell him what I know? Firsthand?\u201d</p><p>For months Mercury had been only a dashing figment of her imagination. As the mysterious head of the secret humanist movement working right here in London, he was little more than cloaks and shadows. Rumor had it that the Council of Dukes had posted an extravagant reward with the infamous Nighthawks for his capture.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019ll pass the information on. It wouldn\u2019t do at all to have you involved any further. The fewer people who know of Mercury\u2019s identity the safer he is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would never tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lena, you\u2019re so terribly innocent still.\u201d He gave her a sad smile. \u201cThere are ways for a blue blood to make a young woman tell them everything they want to know. Especially those rotten bastards in the Ivory Tower.\u201d He patted her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll pass the message on. Hopefully we can use this information. If this alliance between the Echelon and verwulfen clans goes ahead, there\u2019ll be little chance for the humanists to defeat the Echelon. They\u2019ll be too powerful.\u201d</p><p>He slid a folded envelope toward her, beneath a sheaf of orders. \u201cThe usual spot, if you will?\u201d</p><p>Lena palmed it, pretending to rifle through the orders. Her voice rose. \u201cOf course. Thank you for the commissions. I shall select which ones I deem appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you hear more.\u201d A frown crossed his face. \u201cI am most curious about why they\u2019re talking of peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>Lena picked up the box with the snubbed clockwork inside and turned her back on him. Pasting a smile on her face, she ignored the curiosity that lit Mrs. Wade\u2019s face and gestured toward the carriage. She was about to make her companion\u2019s day much worse.</p><p>\u201cOh look, we\u2019ve time to visit my brother and sister,\u201d she said lightly, though in fact she\u2019d planned on it.</p><p>Mrs. Wade paled. \u201cNot the rookeries, Lena. If anyone sees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be discreet. And they\u2019re my family, after all\u2014even if they are considered persona non grata to the Echelon.\u201d She stepped through the shop door into the warm sunshine. \u201cI\u2019ve a mind to gift Charlie with this toy. Mr. Mandeville doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d And she couldn\u2019t bear to let it go to waste. It was the finest thing she\u2019d ever created, even if it bore striking familiarity to a certain hulking brute that she knew.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d be seeing him this time of day. She\u2019d lived at the warren long enough to know the times that Will came and went. Midday usually found him asleep after his nightly sojourn guarding the rookery.</p><p>Which suited her perfectly.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t care if she never saw him again.</p><p>If Honoria was surprised to see him so early, she gave little sign of it. Will growled a greeting and strode past. Sunlight spilled through the attic window, dust motes swirling through its beams. The stink of chemical took his breath, with the faint, underlying tang of blood and chamomile tea.</p> <p>\u201cBlade\u2019s still in bed,\u201d Honoria said, brushing a lock of dark hair behind her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s recovering well, though not as quickly as I\u2019d like\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nor as quickly as he once had. Will nodded brusquely. \u201cI seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>It was the first place he would have gone.</p><p>Tugging off her magnifying glassicals, she began to remove her apron. The attic had been sectioned into two rooms, one for Honoria\u2019s laboratory and the other for Blade\u2019s boxing saloon. Will\u2019d never been in here before. It was solely Honoria\u2019s domain, and while he\u2019d expected sterile benches and equipment, he was surprised by the pair of cozy, overstuffed armchairs by the hearth and the mounds of paperwork. Honoria struck him as someone who was obsessively organized.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d No doubt she was almost as surprised to see him here as he was.</p><p>Will dragged the letter from his pocket. He couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it, but Honoria\u2019s inquisitive little mind took to codes like a duck to water. \u201cCan you decipher this?\u201d</p><p>She took it, scratching her thumbnail through the waxy substance that coated it. \u201cHmm. I can try. It might take a while. Is it important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look.</p><p>\u201cFound it on the men as stabbed Blade.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from her face and she glared down at the letter. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best then. When did you retrieve this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d he muttered. \u201cTracked \u2019em into the sewers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they still breathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Surprise widened her eyes\u2014then they narrowed with an expression that was quite bloodthirsty. \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nighthawks were on me heels. They\u2019ve got \u2019em in custody, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not like you, leaving an enemy behind.\u201d Crossing to the bench, she tapped the letter against her lips.</p><p>His cue to leave.</p><p>As if sensing it, she glanced over her shoulder, eyelashes shuttering her luminous eyes. It felt like a punch to the gut, the gesture so reminiscent of Lena that he swallowed hard. Definitely time to get out of here.</p><p>But as he turned, he heard a set of footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask a favor of you, Will?\u201d</p><p>His hand hovered over the doorknob, nostrils flaring. The scent of leather and blud-wein assaulted his nose. Blade. Which meant Honoria had him neatly trapped. He couldn\u2019t be rude and make his escape. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade suggested I should take a sample of your blood.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. She\u2019d spent the last three years sticking holes in her husband. No doubt Blade thought it high time she turned that obsessive little mind toward someone else. A chill ran down his spine. Needles. Frigging needles.</p><p>Seeing the look on his face, she hurried on. \u201cTo see if there\u2019s any chance of finding a cure. Or vaccination.\u201d With a sigh, she added, \u201cMy work here has stalled. Charlie\u2019s not responding to the vaccinated blood the same way as Blade did. And Blade\u2019s results have reached a plateau for the moment. His CV levels are sitting as low as forty-eight and have been for six months, thank goodness.\u201d</p><p>The door opened. Honoria\u2019s gaze shot straight past Will. For once, he was grateful not to be the recipient of that diamond stare. \u201cWhat the devil do you think you\u2019re doing out of bed?\u201d</p><p>Blade kicked the door shut with his heel. White as parchment and moving stiffer than an eighty-year-old man, he struggled to catch his breath. \u201cGood to see you too, luv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave strict instructions that you were to remain bedridden for the next three days. Then we would renegotiate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means she\u2019ll decide if I can or can\u2019t get up.\u201d Blade winked at Will. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to be without you another moment, luv. Me \u2019eart were breakin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Honoria pointed. \u201cChair. Now.\u201d</p><p>Handing Will his bottle of blud-wein, he settled into one of the armchairs by the fireplace whilst Honoria clucked and scolded him. Blade bore it with goodwill, but his eyes sparkled whenever her back was turned.</p><p>Will shifted on his feet, but Honoria saw the movement and looked up from where she was tucking a footstool under her husband\u2019s feet. One delicate eyebrow arched in question.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, luv?\u201d Blade asked, catching the look.</p><p>\u201cI asked Will if he\u2019d consent to having some of his blood examined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2019ave to,\u201d Blade hastened to assure him.</p><p>That was the thing he hated the most now. The hesitant way they spoke around him, as if fearing he\u2019d walk out the door and never come back.</p><p>Folding his arms over his chest, he glared at Blade. As if he\u2019d ever abandon him. Without Blade he\u2019d probably still be trapped in a cage, reduced to little more than an animal.</p><p>A hot little coal flared to life inside him. If only he hadn\u2019t bloody been there that night. If only he hadn\u2019t heard Honoria ask if he was dangerous, if he could be trusted around Lena...</p><p>And then the hesitation.</p><p>He\u2019d never doubted himself before. Never doubted his control. Years in the cage had taught him to leash the anger, the beast within. He choked it down, trapped it in solid iron bars\u2014a manifestation of the cage he\u2019d spent ten years in. Nobody could reach in there.</p><p>Until Lena came along.</p><p>She\u2019d driven him near insane. It was nothing but a game to her, a flirtation, a tease. A way to test her burgeoning womanhood on someone she thought was safe. But he wasn\u2019t safe. And he didn\u2019t play games. After two years of living with it, the edges of the cage had started to grow ragged. If Blade had noticed the restless prowl of the beast within him, if Honoria had... Then how close had he been to losing control?</p><p>How long had they watched him? Not trusted him?</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d Honoria asked.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he snapped, somewhat harsher than he\u2019d intended. \u201cBut hurry up. I\u2019ve got things to do today.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cBe brave, Will,\u201d Blade called. \u201cAin\u2019t naught to it. Just a little prick, much like your own. You don\u2019t \u2019ear the lasses down on Petticoat Lane complainin\u2019, do you?\u201d</p><p>Will swore at him and stared ferociously at the wall as Honoria slid the needle in. The silver began burning immediately. Cold iron healed in seconds, but silver kept the wound open long enough for her to take her sample. Sweat dripped into his eyes, and a chill ran down his face. Bile churned in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThere we go. Nearly done,\u201d Honoria crooned, patting his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice red sample, Will. I\u2019d grown used to Blade\u2019s blue blood.\u201d</p><p>The sound of light footsteps in the hall caught his ear. His head swam as he turned his face that way, cold spiraling through him. A warm, floral scent curled through his nose. Honeysuckle. Oh no. Not her. Not now... Somewhere in the distance he thought he heard Blade asking if he was all right. As the room buzzed, he glanced toward the needle and the vial thick with his blood.</p><p>A mistake.</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was lying flat on his back on the floor and shoving at the vile smelling salts someone waved under his nose. His fingers grazed a lady\u2019s breast, and his eyes shot open as Lena tumbled backward, the smelling salts spilling everywhere.</p><p>Months since he\u2019d seen her. Months where the image of her had faded until the memory was almost a blur. Now here she was, as vibrant and beautiful as ever, her dashing red skirts spilled across the floor like a pool of blood. The hunger in him, the raging warmth, bubbled up, flooding through his vision until he knew his eyes were wolf-gold. Vision sharpened, picking out every single strand of hair that tumbled over her shoulders, the dew on her lips, the light reflecting off the bleached tips of her lashes.</p><p>Mine, something inside him snarled. For a moment the world blurred and when he wrenched back his control, his hand was half lifted toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d he snapped, still disorientated. Cold sweat ringed his neckline.</p><p>Blade caught his hand. \u201cEasy there.\u201d The words were light, but Will knew them for the warning they were.</p><p>Control it. Rein it in.</p><p>The effort left him breathless. As his vision faded back to normal, he realized they were all staring at him in various states of wariness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Blade knelt back on his heels. \u201cGood. Don\u2019t think I could take you on just yet.\u201d</p><p>Lena sat up, her face pale. The coffee-dark color of her hair was the same precise shade of her sister\u2019s, but her brown eyes were warmer, more almond shaped. Smiling eyes, meant to tempt and tease.</p><p>They weren\u2019t smiling now.</p><p>Lena\u2019s lips curved, but it didn\u2019t light up her face the way it could. \u201cGoodness,\u201d she said in a falsely bright tone. \u201cHow much blood did you take, Honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you had a fear of needles,\u201d Honoria said, glancing at the tiny vial.</p><p>\u201cThought I could handle it.\u201d It had been a long time since he\u2019d fainted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe exhibition?\u201d Blade asked.</p><p>Where he\u2019d found Will as a boy. Chained up on stage in London\u2019s East End and forced to exhibit his monstrous strength and healing capabilities to the gasping crowd. The showman, Tom Sturrett, cut him with iron blades. Despite the presence of the loupe virus, the poor conditions and lack of food meant he didn\u2019t always heal as quickly as they wanted. Then Mrs. Sturrett would stitch him up with her coarse needle.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before just the sight of it was enough to make the blood rush out of his head.</p> <p>Lena clasped her gloved hands in her lap, tendrils of soft brown hair escaping from her chignon. She must have been in a rush, for her hat was still cocked jauntily across her brow, a scarlet feather trailing over one cheek. His gaze lingered on the feather.</p><p>\u201cThe exhibition? What exhibition?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Blade met his gaze. \u201cWhen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>They all looked at him again and Will cursed his bluntness. Nothing would fire Lena\u2019s imagination more than a brusque denial. He could already see the curiosity forming in her eyes. She\u2019d be after his secrets now like a ferret.</p> <p>Maybe it was best to give them the condensed version. \u201cUsed to be displayed in the penny gaff shops as a curio. Or up on stage in Covent Garden.\u201d Pitching his voice louder, he mimicked Sturrett\u2019s showman cry. \u201cCome and see the ferocious Beast! Witness London\u2019s last remaining verwulfen in chains!\u201d He could almost smell the cheap shag tobacco the audience smoked and the reek of stale, unwashed bodies. \u201cAfter the singin\u2019 and flash dancin\u2019 I were the main event. They\u2019d drag me out in a cage and the audience\u2019d throw rotten food at me. Or sometimes they\u2019d dress me in wolf furs and have some of the actors play at blue bloods. It\u2019d usually end when they attacked me with swords.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s eyes went round. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really stab you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith iron.\u201d His voice was hard. \u201cHeals right quick. Unless it\u2019s silver-alloy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA similarity you share with Blade,\u201d Honoria mused.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Honoria. How can you think about the disease after hearing something so dreadful!\u201d Lena snapped at her sister. Then looked back at him. \u201cI thought you were fifteen when Blade brought you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI were. Or nearabouts. Didn\u2019t keep much track o\u2019 time, in the cage.\u201d</p> <p>Lena\u2019s eyes softened with distress.</p><p>Will hadn\u2019t expected her to defend him or sympathize. Most of the crowd had been costermongers and the like, but sometimes one of the Echelon paid Sturrett to display him in their grand homes in Mayfair. The ladies wore fine silks and toyed with the extravagant diamonds and pearls around their necks\u2014fancy women dressed like Lena\u2014but at least they didn\u2019t throw nothing at him. Instead they\u2019d eye him with their hot little eyes, whispering and smirking behind their fans.</p><p>The gentlemen hadn\u2019t liked that at all. Will hadn\u2019t the heart to tell them he shared their sentiments. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. Nobody listened to him when he was in the cage. He\u2019d become little more than an animal to them. In the end, he\u2019d stopped speaking, growling and snapping at them when they came near him. That was the worst of the degradation. If Blade hadn\u2019t been in the audience one night and forced Sturrett to free him, he shuddered to think what he might have ended up like.</p><p>\u201cBoth diseases dislike the presence of silver,\u201d Honoria mused. \u201cWhich suggests a common...ancestor, so to speak? The more we know, the more likely I could find a cure. I\u2019ll examine the sample under the microscope and begin tests. Perhaps it were best if you weren\u2019t here, Will?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the sight of blood as did him in, so much as the needles. But he had to get out of here. His skin was itching.</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot home,\u201d Honoria said. \u201cYou\u2019re not fit to leave just yet. I want to check on you before you go. Lena?\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s head lifted like a startled doe. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked warily.</p> <p>Honoria took a shallow breath, as though considering her words. \u201cCan you see Will to the kitchen and sit with him awhile? Make sure he gets something into his stomach. You know how he gets after some excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t necessary,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lena exchanged glances with him. \u201cI was hoping to speak to you, Honoria.\u201d</p><p>Even Blade stared at her, a silent question in his gaze. Honoria\u2019s eyes met his and somehow the question was answered. Blade growled under his breath and nodded. \u201cBest to get somethin\u2019 into you, Will. We\u2019ll be down shortly.\u201d</p><p>No help for it. He was stuck with her and the room was suddenly far too small. Will opened the door and stalked through. Lena hurried behind him in a swish of skirts with a muttered curse about gentlemen allowing ladies to go first.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t no gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone knows that,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThey don\u2019t call you the Beast for nothing.\u201d</p><p>The words shouldn\u2019t have stung. He\u2019d been called worse for years. Indeed, he\u2019d taken the name on, molding himself into it. Using it to keep curious humans at bay and predators on their toes.</p><p>But for some reason, hearing it from her lips felt like a knife to the chest.</p><p>Following his nose to the kitchen, he found it empty. Lady Luck wasn\u2019t with him today. Though a bubbling pot of soup on the stove bore evidence of Blade\u2019s housekeeper, Esme, there was no sign of the actual woman.</p><p>A light touch fumbled at his wrist. The smooth silk of her elbow-length gloves. \u201cHere,\u201d Lena said, tugging his hand toward one of the low stools by the hearth. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll fetch you some soup.\u201d</p><p>She let him go, but the feel of her touch remained, like phantom fingerprints. Will sank slowly onto the stool, watching as she bustled about the kitchen.</p><p>Lena looked out of place. The hearth dominated the room and emitted a constant blanket of heat. Soot stained the ceiling, and the workbenches were heavy and scarred from frequent use. Strings of onions and herbs dangled over the main bench, along with a row of copper pots strung from metal hooks. It was homey and inviting. Precisely everything that Lena was not.</p><p>Her red velvet skirts were hooked up just enough to reveal a flirtatious froth of underskirt, and her corset narrowed an already slender waist to a size he could span with his hands. Black bands of lace decorated her bodice and the panels of her skirts. As she reached up to try and fetch a bowl, the creamy mounds of her breasts threatened to tumble from her bodice. A hint of black lace edged against her creamy skin.</p><p>Will\u2019s fingers itched.</p><p>He could remember the first time he\u2019d ever seen her, bustling along Petticoat Lane with her gray Serge skirts swishing around her ankles and her battered bonnet barely protecting her from the rain. Clutching a sodden newspaper over her head, she\u2019d slipped on the edge of the gutter and the newspaper had torn in two, disintegrating in Lena\u2019s hands. With a helpless laugh at a pair of street urchins, she\u2019d given a shrug, then tossed the newspaper aside. The sound of her laughter went straight through him; it was the type of sound that always made Will feel like an outsider looking in. Joy radiated off her, like warmth from the fire on a cold winter\u2019s night, and Will felt an almost envious stirring, as if he wanted to stretch his hands out and catch some of her effervescent happiness. Dragging her bonnet off her head, she\u2019d tilted her face up to the rain as it wet her lips, her eyelashes fluttering against her pale cheeks, and Will had almost fallen off the roof as he strained to look.</p><p>Women made him uncomfortable at the best of times. His own mother had sold him once it became clear he was verwulfen, and the only other woman in his life had been Esme. After a year or so of her presence at the warren, he\u2019d started to relax around her, but everything about Lena set his hackles on edge. A curious, uncomfortable feeling that he didn\u2019t understand. With a vampire stalking the rookeries, he\u2019d been in charge of keeping an eye on the younger Todd siblings and protecting the house at night. Every day he\u2019d followed Lena to work and then home again, without her even knowing. He complained about it to everyone he knew, but the truth of it was that he began to relish the moments when she\u2019d appear at the door of the clockmaker\u2019s, giving a cheery little wave back into the shop. In the grim reality of Will\u2019s life, Lena became the one bright spark, a yearning for something he\u2019d never had or felt before.</p><p>It was safe for him to feel that way. She was a stranger still, no threat to him, nor he to her. It wasn\u2019t until he came face to face with her that he\u2019d realized how different reality might be. Stepping out onto the roof one night in her nightgown, of all things, Lena had stared at him as if he were some hulking brute, darting a swift glance at the window she\u2019d come through.</p><p>With his palms sweating and his throat tight, Will had been unable to speak. Then suddenly the words had come, blunt and awkward. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t make it in time,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cAnd if you couldn\u2019t avoid me, then you couldn\u2019t avoid it either. Are you stupid, girl, to come out here with the creature on the loose? Or just wantin\u2019 to die?\u201d</p><p>The worst thing he could have said, for her eyes had narrowed and she\u2019d drawn herself up as if she were a queen and he the lowest of street scum.</p><p>She made him feel like the small, helpless boy that nobody had wanted\u2014nobody but Sturrett, who\u2019d seen a way to make coin off him. Will had sworn he\u2019d never feel that helpless again, but seeing her always threw him into a maelstrom of emotion, and even now the hungry, angry part of him was restless. His beast, prowling like a caged wolf inside his chest.</p><p>Can\u2019t let it out.</p><p>Can\u2019t ever let it out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this,\u201d he said bluntly, as she bustled around the kitchen. \u201cI can manage by meself.\u201d</p><p>Lena unpinned her hat and tossed it carelessly on the bench, followed by her gloves. The hint of smooth skin and manicured nails drew his eye. She\u2019d touched him once with those hands and he\u2019d never forget it.</p><p>\u201cYou always need food after one of your episodes.\u201d Humming under her breath, she began to ladle soup into a bowl.</p><p>\u201cIt weren\u2019t an episode.\u201d His tone was far sharper than he\u2019d intended and she stilled. Cursing himself, he continued, \u201cI only get shaky when I\u2019ve exerted meself, or lost too much blood. It\u2019s just the virus, healin\u2019 me. This is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonoria told me to feed you.\u201d Despite her studied nonchalance, she was nervous. Of him. He could smell it. \u201cYou can argue with her if you want. I\u2019m not going to waste my breath.\u201d</p><p>When he said nothing, she went back to ladling the soup.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you knew your way around a kitchen,\u201d he said, simply to chase the uneasy silence from the room. \u201cThey teach that in them fancy drawin\u2019 rooms?\u201d</p><p>Dark eyes looked up over the bowl. She seemed genuinely surprised he\u2019d asked a question. After spending the last three years trying to ignore her, there was little doubt why.</p><p>\u201cI used to prepare most of the meals after Father died and we first came to Whitechapel,\u201d she replied, her lashes lowering again as she concentrated on the bowl. \u201cHonoria was always home from work later than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cooked?\u201d He took the bowl from her and reached for the spoon. Her hand was tiny next to his, and very pale. Different worlds, the pair of them.</p><p>\u201cBadly.\u201d She shot him a sudden smile that lit her whole face.</p><p>Bloody hell. He stared at the soup. Six months since he\u2019d seen her last\u2014a deliberate act on his behalf\u2014and he\u2019d almost forgotten the way she could heat his blood with a smile, a look.</p><p>A careless kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you go to balls.\u201d He put the sneer in his voice, but the effort felt hollow. Taking refuge in the soup, he almost burned the roof of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI like dancing.\u201d Her eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cAnd balls. The men there behave like gentlemen. It\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t got a thrall contract yet.\u201d He\u2019d been waiting to hear word of it. Imagining one of those blue blood bastards with his mouth and hands all over her as he drank her sweet blood.</p><p>Color flooded her cheeks. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t made my mind up. And there\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rush? Ain\u2019t you gettin\u2019 perilously close to bein\u2019 on the shelf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m barely twenty,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI see. You\u2019d prefer to keep \u2019em danglin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like the sort of games you\u2019d play.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous look in those eyes. Lena swished on her heel, snatching at her gloves. \u201cI hope you choke on your soup, you big, hairy lummox. You don\u2019t know anything about me. Anything!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A piece of paper tumbled from her sleeve as she turned, fluttering to the floor like a dying moth.</p><p>\u201cAh, we\u2019re back to that, are we?\u201d he asked, putting the soup aside to cool. Stooping, he plucked up the piece of paper. \u201cYou dropped something.\u201d</p><p>Lena froze in the doorway. Her hand went immediately to her sleeve, and then she spun around, her eyes widening. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d</p> <p>Will stood, breaking the seal and unrolling the small furl of paper. He caught just a glimpse of thick black letters before Lena tried to tug it out of his grip.</p><p>\u201cA love letter, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d He turned around and pretended to read it.</p><p>A whoosh of scent enveloped him, her skirts swishing against his legs. She clutched at his shoulder, trying to drag his arm lower, her breasts crushed against the broad expanse of his back. Any attempt at reading went straight out of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know of love letters?\u201d She climbed on the stool and reached for the piece of paper. The step put her on eye level with him. Dangerously intimate. \u201cThe type of woman as would have you isn\u2019t the type to be writing poems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d he shot back. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at the type of poems they whisper in me ear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUrgh. You\u2019re despicable.\u201d</p><p>The stool teetered and their gazes clashed. Lena shrieked and clutched at him as she fell. Will found himself with an armful of soft velvet and warm flesh, and the sound of two racing hearts.</p><p>The world slowed down. Became nothing more than the feel of her in his arms. Will stared into her eyes, then his gaze dropped, unbidden, to her lips.</p><p>Lena\u2019s eyes widened and she made a choking noise. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>He could barely breathe. The hunger inside him was suddenly choking him, desperate to get out and rule his body. He knew the burning amber of his gaze was intensifying; he could almost feel the molten heat of it run through his irises as the color changed.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYour eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Her breath was warm on his lips. She\u2019d been chewing something with apple and cinnamon in it. He could scent it on her breath and suddenly he wanted to taste it.</p><p>Don\u2019t.</p><p>Shoving her away, he turned, the paper crumpling in his fist. He had to get out of here. Away from the scent of her. Away from the temptation to do something she\u2019d never forgive him for.</p><p>Maybe Blade and Honoria were right. Maybe he couldn\u2019t be trusted?</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his hands. The tremble started there, swept all the way through him. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cMaybe I did exert meself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019d best go?\u201d</p><p>It seemed some sense of self-preservation had come over her.</p> <p>He nodded, struggling to hold onto himself. What the hell was wrong with him? What did it matter if she\u2019d found...someone? Instantly the anger was back, thick and choking, a red haze threatening his vision.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come. This ain\u2019t your world now.\u201d The words were harsh and he\u2019d meant them to be.</p><p>Silence. \u201cI know. I thought you wouldn\u2019t be here. You\u2019re never here at midday.\u201d</p><p>Which was why she only visited at those times.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy letter?\u201d</p><p>Soft footsteps shuffled behind him. Her skirts brushed against his legs and then her hand slid down his arm, closing over the letter in his grip. A letter she was so desperate to regain.</p><p>There was only one reason she wouldn\u2019t want him to see it.</p><p>Suddenly he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He had to know, even if the answer was one he wouldn\u2019t particularly like. Lena cried out, fighting him for it.</p><p>It tore in half and both of them staggered apart, left with a piece each. Will unrolled it, his gaze darting over the piece of paper. Not letters. Not writing. His gaze sharpened. He\u2019d seen this before. The same bloody cipher he\u2019d found on the men who\u2019d fired the draining factories.</p><p>His stomach dropped. \u201cWhat the hell are you doin\u2019 with this?\u201d he whispered, his voice filled with a cold, inexplicable dread.</p><p>Lena gave a strangled cry and darted for the door. Will grabbed her skirts almost as an aside, shock running its icy fingers down his spine. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re goin\u2019 anywhere. Not until you tell me where the bloody hell you found this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked it up,\u201d she lied, the bitter smell of it all over her.</p><p>Will grabbed her by the shoulder and spun her toward the stool she\u2019d almost toppled. \u201cSit,\u201d he growled, shoving her into the seat. \u201cAnd explain. And if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t dare tell me another lie.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Will towered over her with a glower. All nearly seven feet of him.</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His eyes glowed that eerie amber color that showed he wasn\u2019t quite human. Lena fell back, holding onto the bench to keep herself upright. She didn\u2019t dare move, even as the stool teetered beneath her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t dare tell him.</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d she asked, tipping her chin up and meeting his furious gaze. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Yet her gaze dropped to the quiver in his hands. Maybe it was exertion. Maybe not. She\u2019d never seen him like this before.</p><p>His nostrils flared and he turned and slammed both hands on the bench. Head bowed, he sucked in a deep breath. Then another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak.\u201d A gravely rasp. \u201cGive me a moment.\u201d</p><p>Lena swallowed. What was wrong with him? She eased herself upright, setting all four legs of the stool on the ground. The clock on the wall ticked out the seconds. Each tick seemed to stretch out, time slowing as the tension settled in the room. She could hardly stand it.</p><p>As suddenly as he\u2019d turned, Will lifted his head and pushed away from the bench. His golden-brown hair was long enough now to touch his collar, and he raked it out of his eyes with a sharp gesture.</p><p>\u201cNo lies,\u201d he warned, pointing a finger at her. The piece of letter was still crushed in his other fist. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>Will put both hands on the bench behind her and leaned closer. Trapping her. \u201cDon\u2019t make me tell Blade.\u201d</p><p>If Will talked to Blade, he would talk to Honoria and then Honoria...well, she would probably scream at Lena about how stupid she\u2019d been, getting involved in such a thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d run along and tattle on me?\u201d She ignored the angry flare of molten-gold in his eyes. Will would never understand what she was trying to do, and she was very well aware of the dangers of involving other people.</p><p>Will caught her chin in his fingers. His lip curled back off his teeth. \u201cThis ain\u2019t a game. I\u2019d tell Blade because it\u2019s clear you\u2019re in over your \u2019ead. I seen somewhat like this before. On a man who burned the drainin\u2019 factories down. Lena, they\u2019re government owned! The Echelon will destroy whoever did this.\u201d He waved the letter at her. \u201cIf it kept you from gettin\u2019 your head cut off, then I\u2019ll take a bloody full page out in the Times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat almost sounds as if you gave a damn.\u201d</p><p>Thought flickered through his hooded gaze. Indecipherable. She found she was holding her breath, which was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you hurt,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd your sister\u2019d skin me alive if anythin\u2019 happened to you and I\u2019d known about it.\u201d</p><p>Foolish, to think that he might have cared, even a little. Her shoulders slumped. \u201cI promised a friend I\u2019d deliver it for him. I had no idea what was inside it. I still don\u2019t. That could be a laundry list, for all you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pretend I can\u2019t smell it every time you lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the truth!\u201d This was the hardest part of her cause\u2014lying to her friends and family. But if she involved them now, who knew what might happen? Will was right. The Echelon would kill anyone they even suspected of being involved in this. She glanced uneasily at the letter. Mandeville had told her she was only dropping off meeting points and times to one of the other spies who worked within the Echelon.</p><p>She sent the letters by crow to some mysterious conspirator and received them for Mr. Mandeville. What if one of those letters had been instructions to burn the factories? She desperately needed to be alone, to think.</p><p>Suddenly, the world had become a far more dangerous place.</p><p>\u201cLena.\u201d The growl that came out of his throat was almost primordial. The kind of sound you expected to hear in a snowy forest, late at night, alone. The kind of growl that sent shivers down her spine because she knew it meant she was the prey.</p><p>Run, a little voice whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>No longer content to play games, he gripped her chin and stared at her, his amber eyes burning right through her. Lena stopped breathing. She had nothing to fear\u2014this was Will\u2014but something in her, some unconscious part of her body, recognized danger when she saw it. The little hairs along her arms rose, her stomach turning to lead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laughter sounded on the stairs. Lena looked toward the door in relief as Blade\u2019s housekeeper Esme and her husband Rip came through it.</p><p>Instantly Will straightened, his fingers slipping from her chin. He glanced away in order to hide his eyes from the newcomers and give himself a chance to leash the beast inside him. It rode close to the surface of his skin today, a predator beneath all those sleek muscles and powerful brawn.</p><p>\u201cLena!\u201d Esme greeted, her black hair knotted back into a simple chignon. She took Lena\u2019s hands and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were visiting today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a momentary decision,\u201d Lena replied quickly. \u201cYou look well. Married life suits you.\u201d</p><p>Esme smiled over her shoulder at Rip. The menacing giant had frightened Lena in the beginning, with his heavy mechanical arm and dark expression. In the first few months she\u2019d lived at the warren with her sister and Blade, Rip had been suffering through the initial stirrings of the craving virus. She could remember his screams and the way he tore through his room in a rage. Not even Blade had been able to manage him and only Esme could calm him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Will,\u201d Esme said, with a faint note of scold in her voice. \u201cI see you\u2019ve been at my soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonoria\u2019s suggestion, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Lena replied. She smiled sweetly as Will turned around. \u201cHe had an episode involving a fit of the vapors.\u201d</p><p>If looks could kill...</p><p>But she was safe now, with witnesses in the room. When he got her alone\u2014and he would, she knew\u2014he might do anything to her.</p><p>Rip barked a laugh. \u201cYou fainted, boy-o?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to use my smelling salts,\u201d she replied, sneaking her hat and gloves off the bench. Will\u2019s eyes watched the movement, though his body and face never moved.</p><p>\u201cLena,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019ll take a walk with me?\u201d</p><p>Not a chance. She shot him a charming smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to go. I have an appointment at the milliners. It was nice to visit, though. I\u2019ll have to come more often.\u201d Another blatant lie. She wouldn\u2019t be coming back here unless absolutely certain Will wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>He took a step toward her, but Esme was in the way. Will pulled up short, frustration flickering across his face. But he didn\u2019t dare push past. Not with Rip standing guard over his wife and still overly protective.</p><p>\u201cUntil next time,\u201d she said, staring him baldly in the face.</p><p>He was a long time replying. And when he did, she almost stepped back at the menace in his tone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be sooner than you think.\u201d</p><p>Will slammed the door, his gaze raking the small apartment. It was where he lived, but it wasn\u2019t home. It lacked the warmth and laughter of the warren. He tossed his coat aside and lit a candle, his breath steaming in the evening air. Despite a full afternoon dealing with Blade\u2019s business in the rookery, the scent of honeysuckle still clung to his clothes.</p><p>He scowled and found a piece of leftover pie in the icebox. He didn\u2019t want to be thinking of that. Lena thought she\u2019d gotten away from him today, but she had forgotten one thing.</p><p>Will always got his prey. In the end.</p><p>What the hell was the fool girl up to? Carrying around such a potentially devastating document? If anyone in the Echelon found her with that on her person, there\u2019d be questions. If they knew what it meant, then she\u2019d be executed.</p><p>Cold punched through him at the thought. Her laughter and teasing, forever cut short. Though her presence made him uneasy, he never wanted to see her harmed. In fact, the very thought made his hackles rise and the berserker rage threaten to spill out over him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d never felt this way before. One glimpse of her and every primitive need rushed to claim him, threatening to overwhelm his careful defenses.</p><p>The mere thought of her in danger...</p><p>He stopped. Put his fork down. The vein in his temple throbbed as he sucked in a deep breath. Then another. Don\u2019t think about it. Not until he had himself under control.</p> <p>Whenever that might be. With a gruff laugh, he picked up the fork again and stabbed it into the pie. As he bit into the flavorsome meat, a sound caught his attention from the stairs outside.</p><p>Someone sneaking up to his door.</p><p>Someone preternaturally quiet.</p><p>Sliding the fork into a stronger grip, he held it low against his thigh and crossed silently to the door. Leather flavored the air, but no personal scent. A blue blood then. They lost their distinctive smell when they became infected with the craving.</p><p>Will ripped the door open and stepped forward, grabbing the intruder by the throat and slamming him up against the wall.</p> <p>A hand caught his wrist, the thumb digging into the tendons just hard enough to ease his grip. \u201cTruce,\u201d Blade said hoarsely. \u201cIf I wanted you dead you wouldn\u2019t a \u2019eard me comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Will let him go with a scowl of disgust. \u201cBloody hell. You should be in bed.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cDoes Honoria know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Can\u2019t you \u2019ear the argument ringin\u2019 still?\u201d Blade loosened his collar. \u201cI\u2019m not a feeble ole man. And I can\u2019t afford to be trapped in bed for the next half week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re puffin\u2019 like a bellows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch me breath.\u201d Blade peered past him. \u201cYou\u2019re a mite skittish there, Will. Got somethin\u2019 on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He gestured Blade inside, then closed the door behind them. This whole thing with Lena had him on edge, expecting blue bloods in every shadow. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? You\u2019re not one for social visits.\u201d</p> <p>Blade cocked his hip on the table and crossed his arms. \u201cAin\u2019t I welcome?\u201d The words were quiet, but the glint in Blade\u2019s eyes spoke of a whole lot of other things.</p><p>Will slammed into his chair and picked at the pie. He\u2019d lost his appetite. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome.\u201d</p><p>A steady gaze, watching him. Then Blade sighed. \u201cWhat do you make o\u2019 this?\u201d He withdrew a scroll from his pocket and tossed it toward Will.</p><p>Who snatched it out of the air. Unrolling it, he held the parchment up to the light. The letters were slanted and looping. And written in gold.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Council of Dukes requests your presence at Lord Harker\u2019s ball tomorrow night at eight,\u2019\u201d he read slowly, fumbling with the words. \u201c\u2018The house will be considered neu-neutral territory for the evenin\u2019. Bring the Beast. He shall receive safe passage for the night.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lowering it, he met Blade\u2019s gaze. \u201cA trap?\u201d</p><p>Blade scratched at his jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t think so. But it\u2019s a game play of some sort. Damned if I can work it out.\u201d Their eyes met. \u201cOr why they\u2019re involving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Will crushed the parchment in his fist. \u201cI don\u2019t owe \u2019em nothin\u2019. And neither do you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. But what do they want?\u201d Blade scowled. \u201cI \u2019ate these bloody games. Dare I ignore it? It could be anythin\u2019.\u201d With a sigh, he eased away from the table. \u201cI ain\u2019t expectin\u2019 you to come. It\u2019s dangerous for you, that world\u2014\u201d</p><p>A thought struck him. Lena was certain to be in attendance. This was precisely her sort of thing. And the last place she\u2019d be expecting to see him.</p><p>Thought you could run, did you?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for both of us,\u201d Will corrected slowly. \u201cYou go, I go.\u201d He was Blade\u2019s bodyguard in all matters. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve other business to see to there. Might as well take up their kindly offer of safe passage and see what the bastards want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t \u2019appen to be business of the petticoat variety?\u201d</p><p>Will shot him a dark look.</p><p>\u201cYou need a woman,\u201d Blade added bluntly.</p><p>The words conjured an image: dark hair, dark eyes, a wicked little smile. His cock clenched. \u201cThe last thing I need\u2019s a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need somethin\u2019 then.\u201d Blade\u2019s gaze roamed his meager surroundings. \u201cYou ought to come \u2019ome, Will. It\u2019s a cold, lonely place. You don\u2019t belong \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t belong anywhere. Not really. He looked away, his shoulders stiffening. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion. The answer\u2019s no.\u201d</p><p>A long, drawn out sigh met his ears. \u201cAye. I\u2019ll leave you to it then. Just you and the mice. Be ready then, tomorrow at six. Oh, and Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t \u2019urt to \u2019ave a shave.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cI need some air,\u201d Lena said, fanning her flushed face. The peacock feathers brushed against her lips, but she ignored them, her gaze following the handsome young Duke of Malloryn as he escorted the Duchess of Casavian out of the ballroom.</p><p>Both were heads of their Houses and members of the ruling Council of Dukes. And since the Duke of Goethe had retired barely five minutes ago, she could only presume that they were meeting to discuss something important.</p><p>Hopefully the Scandinavian matter.</p><p>Adele downed a glass of iced lemonade. \u201cIs that wise?\u201d</p><p>Green eyes met hers, the hard look in them turning wary for a moment. Lena squeezed her hand. \u201cHe\u2019s not here. I checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blind yourself, Lena. Colchester\u2019s not the only danger.\u201d</p><p>Lena nodded. The room swept around her in a riot of color as the crowd danced. Around the walls loomed a dozen blue bloods, sipping at their blud-wein and watching the dance floor with predatory eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not the only ones hunting.\u201d Adele smiled, but it didn\u2019t touch her eyes. \u201cI told you I need a patron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d Lena squeezed her gloved hand. The duke and duchess had disappeared. Giving Adele one last smile, she hurried after them.</p><p>The duchess had been wearing a deep aubergine gown that set off the color of her coppery hair. Lena exited the ballroom. Peering over the balustrade of the second floor, she raked her gaze across the white tiled entry below. An enormous staircase took up most of the foyer. Over a dozen men and women lined the stairs and the entry, gowned in a variety of brilliant colors. From the warmth of their skin and the dark, raven locks on a pair of them, they were most likely human, none of them high enough in rank to receive the gift of infected blood. Only those of good bloodlines and standing went through the blood rites at the age of fifteen. It was a sign of status, of prestige.</p><p>It took more than being a blue blood to be considered part of the Echelon. Any other unfortunate who was accidentally infected was considered little more than a rogue. Such blue bloods were either drafted into the Nighthawks, offered a place in the Coldrush Guards that protected the Ivory Tower and the Council, or were killed.</p><p>Humans could navigate the shadowy edges of the Echelon\u2014like her\u2014but they were never truly a part of it. They had their place, either as thralls or potential consorts, if their bloodlines were good.</p><p>Avoiding the soaring marble statue of an angel, she peered down the hallway. Two dozen of Lord Harker\u2019s distinguished relatives glared down at her from the walls. Lena swept across the top of the stairs, her peacock green skirts rustling. There was another hallway on the other side.</p><p>She was just passing the enormous grandfather clock that held pride of place at the top of the stairs when a hush fell over the foyer.</p><p>Two footmen held each of the main doors open, their faces impassive. Blade strolled in, swinging an ebony-tipped cane. He tossed his top hat to a waiting footman and saluted the gaping group on the stairs. Another footman swept past with a tray of blud-wein, and Blade stole one, examining the foyer with interest.</p><p>Will stalked in at his heels, his shoulders straining the black coat he\u2019d obviously borrowed. He wore a gray waistcoat, carefully brushed, and his boots had been scrubbed. Candlelight gleamed off the coppery highlights in his hair, and he towered over the hovering servants. Despite their training, two of them bolted out of his path like frightened rabbits. Will\u2019s hungry gaze followed them as if he were considering giving chase.</p><p>Lena\u2019s breath caught, the heat draining from her face. \u201cWill,\u201d she whispered. What the devil was he doing here?</p><p>Will stopped in his tracks, his head lifting like a lion scenting gazelle, the brilliant, burning amber of his gaze locking on hers. His lips curled in a threatening smile, and Lena took a step back.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>She tore her gaze away, her heart pounding madly in her chest. For a moment she\u2019d thought he was here for her, but that was foolishness. Not with the price on his head. What was he doing in the heart of Echelon territory? They considered his kind fit only to be caged or chained. If he\u2019d gotten himself in trouble...</p><p>\u201cSir...Blade,\u201d the butler recovered himself well. \u201cMaster Will. This way, if you care. Lord Barrons is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Leo. Her half brother had something to do with this. Lena\u2019s hands unclenched from her skirts. Why would Leo invite them here, when he could just as easily have visited Whitechapel? He was one of the few members of the Echelon Blade trusted enough to grant passage to Whitechapel.</p><p>The butler led them across the foyer and into one of the lower hallways. Just before he disappeared, Will looked up, shooting her one more blazing look. It scorched all the way through her, igniting a mixture of fear and nervous anticipation that she couldn\u2019t quite name.</p><p>Heavens. She let out the breath she\u2019d been holding and backed toward the second hallway. She had to get out of here before he found her.</p><p>But first, she had a little reconnaissance to finish. Find out what was going on between the Council members, if she could.</p><p>Then she was going to plead an attack of the vapors, which, considering how rapidly her heart was beating, shouldn\u2019t be that difficult at all.</p><p>\u201cBe ready for anythin\u2019,\u201d Blade murmured as they strode through the halls of Lord Harker\u2019s mansion.</p><p>Will rolled his shoulders, his eyes darting through the shadows. Blade had no need to warn him. He\u2019d been on edge ever since they got out of the cursed carriage. Coming here, into the very heart of society, was dangerous. He had to be ready for anything; no more surprises.</p><p>He\u2019d already had his first surprise for the evening. Lena. Though he\u2019d been expecting her, even relishing the opportunity, the sight of her temporarily struck him dumb. She\u2019d always been well-dressed but wreathed in shadows, the gaslight picking out the soft curves and mysterious depths of her body... She\u2019d been breath-catching.</p><p>Her hair tumbled over her shoulder in an elaborate cascade of curls, an elegant comb holding it up. Emeralds dripped into the deep vee of her green dress, drawing his gaze lower. He couldn\u2019t wait to get her alone. Anticipation thrummed through his veins, alerting all of his senses.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t know yet whether he wanted to throttle her\u2014or kiss her.</p><p>A door opened and a swathe of golden light cut through the shadows. Will reined in his thoughts swiftly. No time for distraction. Best way to get his throat slit.</p><p>A man appeared, wearing crisp black from head to toe. He moved with the dangerous grace of a swordsman, his body lean and hard and his dark eyes cautious as he surveyed the darkened hallway. A diamond stud winked in his ear, and though he wore no weapons, an aura of dark violence hung over him.</p><p>Leo Barrons. Lena\u2019s guardian and possibly the only blue blood Will could tolerate besides Blade.</p><p>\u201cBlade.\u201d Barrons offered his hand. His gaze examined the scene swiftly but Will knew he\u2019d noted everything around them, from the pattern in the red carpets, to the fall of their coats. \u201cExcellent timing. The prince consort should be arriving any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe consort?\u201d Blade arched a brow. \u201cMy, my, they must want somethin\u2019 from me badly, if they\u2019re bringin\u2019 out \u2019is Royal Pastiness.\u201d</p><p>Barrons\u2019s lips quirked slyly, but he shook his head in warning. \u201cThe others are inside.\u201d A cue for Blade to shut his mouth. Barrons stepped forward with a hand offered. \u201cWill. You look like a mountain, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear eats me out of \u2019earth and \u2019ome,\u201d Blade muttered.</p><p>Will eyed him coolly. \u201cGot me own set of rooms now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and yet you\u2019re still in me bloody kitchens every time I turn \u2019round.\u201d A wary smile; Blade was playing it up for Barrons\u2019s sake\u2014and the others inside\u2014but he hadn\u2019t forgotten where they were. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Barrons said, gesturing to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll send for some blud-wein. Will, do you want anything? Ale? Wine?\u201d</p><p>Will gave him a long look. No chance in hell he\u2019d be eating or drinking anything as come from this house. \u201cPrefer to keep me wits about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the stoic bodyguard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomebody\u2019s gotta watch Blade\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Both Barrons and Blade exchanged a look. Blade strode toward the door. \u201cThey won\u2019t knife me \u2019ere. Ain\u2019t the done thing. It\u2019d be in an alley one night, when I\u2019d least expect it. This is just games. Come on, Will. Let\u2019s see what the Council wants.\u201d</p><p>When Blade\u2019d least expect it...like in the drawing room of a manor whilst a party was in full swing. Will stalked behind the pair of them, prepared to leap forward at a second\u2019s notice. They\u2019d taken his weapons at the door, but that was no matter. His body was a weapon.</p><p>Firelight spilled through the room, the shadows flickering. Will glanced up, his eyes drawn by the carved panels that lined the walls and the ornate ceilings. He\u2019d never seen so much gilt in all his life.</p><p>And silk curtains. What a bloody joke. Half the people of London could barely pay the Echelon\u2019s exorbitant taxes and yet here sat one of their lords, in a house that could probably feed Whitechapel for a year. Or five.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t here to gawk at the furnishings. Will lowered his gaze, even as Blade turned on his heel, staring up. \u201cGor, will you look at that,\u201d Blade said. \u201cAin\u2019t the ceilin\u2019 a sight to see? All them cherubs and clouds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d a cool voice said. \u201cThe manor\u2019s been in my family for eight generations.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s gaze narrowed on the speaker. Lord Harker, he presumed. Standing by the fire, with his hands clasped behind him.</p><p>The others sat in a half circle around him. He knew who the woman must be. There was only one female blue blood in England, the Lady Aramina, Duchess of Casavian. Met her once, didn\u2019t much trust the look in her eyes. Yet when the Council had held Blade\u2019s life in its hands, she\u2019d been the final vote, her choice sealing his fate. For whatever reason\u2014whim or politics\u2014she\u2019d chosen to let him live.</p><p>One of the other men was tall, with a hawkish nose and neatly trimmed beard. Touches of gray flecked his hair, signs of a distinguished air, rather than age and feebleness. Manderlay, the Duke of Goethe. Another who had cast his vote in Blade\u2019s favor.</p><p>Which left the last little lordling, who sat back in his Louis XIII chair, examining the play of light in his blud-wein. Rings glittered on his fingers and his collar had been left rakishly open. A half-empty bottle rested beside his booted feet. Will didn\u2019t recognize him, but the griffin signet on his finger said that this was Auvry Cavill, the young Duke of Malloryn. The least likely threat, Will thought, turning his gaze back to Goethe. He knew who the most dangerous man in the room was.</p> <p>All of them had voted in Blade\u2019s favor. Will smelled politics in the air, stale as a moth-eaten coat. The prince consort must want something badly.</p><p>\u201cHow is your wife?\u201d the Duke of Goethe asked.</p><p>\u201cCurious. Stubborn. Same as ever.\u201d A genuine smile softened Blade\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAnd how goes her experiments?\u201d the duchess asked.</p><p>The only way she could have known of them was if she were having the warren watched. Will\u2019s eyes narrowed. None of the three had shown any sign of surprise. Which meant the Council likely knew everything that went in and out of the warren.</p><p>Something Will\u2019d have to see to when they got out of here.</p><p>\u201cShe likes to tinker,\u201d Blade replied with a shrug. He played this game far better than Will ever could. \u201cThinks she\u2019ll cure me one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she will?\u201d The duchess sipped at her blud-wein. The firelight turned her coppery hair into a flaming corona around her head, but despite the brandy brown eyes and hint of color in her cheeks, her manner was as cool as winter. A little clockwork spider crawled across her shoulder, tethered by a fine steel chain to a pin at her breast. The glass dome of its body showed the exquisite brass cogs of its clockwork interior. He\u2019d seen the type before. Flip them over and the belly was a watch.</p> <p>\u201cKeeps \u2019er amused and outta me \u2019air.\u201d Blade\u2019s smile held a knife-edge. \u201cEverybody knows there ain\u2019t no cure for the cravin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but her father was Sir Artemus Todd. Wasn\u2019t he the genius who discovered all those weapons for Vickers, before you killed the duke? I hear Todd was close to discovering a cure even then. Perhaps your wife knew something of his work?\u201d</p><p>Blade could be quite reasonable at times. But not when Honoria was concerned. He bared his teeth\u2014some people might have called it a smile\u2014but Will knew it was just the expression he wore before he cut someone\u2019s throat. \u201cMaybe she does. Like poisons that actually work on a blue blood, or a gun with bullets as explode on impact. But nothin\u2019 of cures, princess.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, the lady never even flinched. Instead, she picked up the clockwork spider, letting it crawl over and under her fingers. \u201cI see your knighthood has taken none of the savagery from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you expect it ought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty years ago you were dangerous, Blade. Times change. Our resources have changed. If we wanted to get rid of you, we\u2019d simply send the Spitfires in and burn the rookery to the ground.\u201d The duchess poured more blud-wein into her glass and stirred it like tea. As if she weren\u2019t speaking of war. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re...an inconvenience. Out of sight and out of mind. Like someone\u2019s embarrassing, black sheep cousin who keeps showing up to balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tryin\u2019 to grease me up for this favor you want o\u2019 me, you ain\u2019t doin\u2019 much of a bang-up job, princess.\u201d</p><p>The duchess stopped stirring, tapped the spoon against her goblet three times, then set it aside. Her almond-shaped eyes lifted, thick dark lashes fluttering against her smooth, pale cheeks. \u201cWho said the favor we wished was from you?\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned toward Will.</p><p>Leo grimaced. \u201cI thought to warn you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The hair on the back of Will\u2019s neck rose. He crossed his arms over his chest and glared back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard what it is yet,\u201d the young Duke of Malloryn murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you no more \u2019n Blade does. And I don\u2019t trust you as far as I could throw you.\u201d He eyed the handsome young peacock and bared his teeth. \u201cA struttin\u2019 tom like you? Why, I figure I could throw you a fair way too.\u201d</p><p>Malloryn raised lazy eyes toward him. A quick flick of his wrist and a knife appeared, balancing on point on his finger. \u201cYou\u2019d have to get close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuvry, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Barrons murmured. Their eyes met and Barrons straightened, his posture screaming out the silent challenge in the air between them.</p><p>Malloryn shrugged\u2014and the knife disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun anymore, Barrons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s at least remain civilized long enough to give some credence to our claim of being gentlemen.\u201d Barrons eased gracefully into a chair by the fire, hooking his ankle up on his knee. Despite the appearance of relaxing, his lazy-lidded eyes examined the room.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the ones as want somewhat,\u201d Blade replied, sinking into one of the other chairs. He tested it, impressed with the padding. \u201cNever treat with a man as \u2019olds a blade to your throat. That\u2019s what I always says.\u201d</p><p>Will stayed on guard. A sound in the hallway alerted him. Three separate footfalls, all moving with purpose toward the room.</p><p>The door opened and a pair of the elite Coldrush Guards entered first. As part of the prince consort\u2019s retinue and custodians of the Ivory Tower, they were taken from their families when it became clear they\u2019d been infected, put into the strict tower camps, and trained to kill. Will sized the pair of them up. One of them returned his stare with a wary surveillance. Not fear. But marking him as a potential adversary.</p><p>The man who followed them towered over the guards. With thick brown hair and glassy, almost-colorless eyes, he strode into the room as if he owned it. His long red coat swirled around his hips, and a gleaming metal breastplate protected his chest.</p><p>Will had always thought the prince consort was an older man. He was surprised to find that he was perhaps younger than Blade. Ascending to the Regency nearly thirty years ago, he\u2019d steered the young human princess through the treacherous waters of the Echelon after her father had been overthrown. To consolidate his power, he\u2019d then married her when she came of age, ten years ago.</p><p>The fact that he\u2019d been the one who\u2019d overthrown the human king wasn\u2019t something that was generally mentioned in polite company.</p><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d The men stood and bowed.</p><p>The prince consort strode to the fire, holding out his hands to warm them. He looked up, his icy blue eyes examining Will. \u201cSo this is the Beast of Whitechapel?\u201d</p><p>A growl sounded low in Will\u2019s throat. Both the Coldrush Guards straightened, hands resting on their pistols.</p><p>The prince consort\u2019s lips crooked up, just slightly, and Will forced himself to relax. Bloody games. Testing him to see what manner of man\u2014or monster\u2014he was.</p><p>The prince consort examined the room. \u201cHave they told you why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want somewhat from me,\u201d Will replied. No wonder they\u2019d wanted him and Blade to come here. A meeting could have been set up anywhere in the city for them if it had involved only the Council. But the prince consort was another matter.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition. An...opportunity for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very kind of you,\u201d Will drawled. \u201cLookin\u2019 out for me interests like that.\u201d</p><p>Another oily smile. \u201cWell, yes, also an opportunity for us. But I\u2019ll state it plainly. I don\u2019t intend to use you without your knowledge. And you will be ably compensated.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d ever given a damn about money.</p><p>The duchess spoke up. \u201cThere\u2019s talk that the French are in discussions with the Illuminist fanatics from New Catalan. It\u2019s an uneasy concept, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>Verwulfen were a blue blood\u2019s natural enemy, the only creature dangerous enough to kill a blue blood and do it easily. But in the eyes of the Illumination, any supernatural creature was an abomination that needed to be eliminated. The tales of New Catalan\u2019s Inquisition was enough to make even the bravest shudder.</p><p>\u201cAnd how am I to help?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the only country with an interest in the proceedings across the Channel,\u201d Barrons replied. \u201cIf the Illumination gains a foothold in France, they\u2019ll have access to the northern waters, plus all France\u2019s airships. We\u2019re considering an alliance with the Scandinavians to prevent that. We have ships\u2014the dreadnoughts\u2014and the Scandinavians have their dragon-ships and air fleet.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. A husky bark of laughter erupted from his throat. \u201cYou think the Scandinavian clans would ally with you? The Butchers of Culloden? Let\u2019s not forget what\u2019s been done since. All them verwulfen trapped in cages and bought and sold like fuckin\u2019 slaves.\u201d</p><p>Blade caught his arm as he took a half step forward. A caution. Will shook it off, trying to focus through the red-hot flare of rage. The beat of it thundered in his blood, echoing dully in his ears.</p><p>\u201cCulloden was a long time ago,\u201d the prince consort replied coolly. His guards had stepped forward as if fearing an attack, but he settled into a chair and flicked a piece of lint from his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cIt weren\u2019t that long ago to some of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCulloden was a mistake.\u201d The words came from behind, from Barrons. All heads turned in his direction and he shrugged, as if admitting a truth they were too embarrassed to claim. \u201cYou cannot slaughter an entire race without consequences. Wiping out the Scottish verwulfen clans was only ever going to incite anger. But it was done by our forefathers and there is nothing we can do about it, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Manchester Pits? Where they throw us in with wild dogs and bears to bait? Or pit us against each other for blood sport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are private enterprises,\u201d the prince consort replied, his fingers slowly drumming on the armrest. \u201cMost of them owned by humans, actually.\u201d</p><p>Which meant he didn\u2019t give a damn. Will knew what it was like to be trapped behind bars, or cut open for the pleasure of a crowd. And yet there was nothing to be done... Verwulfen were outlawed in Britain and capturing them and using them as slaves was not only legal, but encouraged.</p><p>Staring at the prince consort with his pale bloodless face, Will could barely control the surge of anger that boiled in his gut. \u201cWhat do the Scandinavian clans think o\u2019 your policies?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The prince consort\u2019s fingers stopped tapping. \u201cDo you know what they do to blue bloods in Scandinavia?\u201d A tight little smile eased over his mouth. \u201cAs I am willing to overlook certain things for the greater good, so are they. This threat from the Continent is of far greater concern than a few individuals.\u201d</p><p>Will shot a look of pure hatred toward the man. \u201cThen I ain\u2019t inclined to be obligin\u2019. You\u2019ll have to use someone else.\u201d</p><p>Turning on his heel, the heat of fury burning in his cheeks, he jerked his head toward Blade. As far as he was concerned, this audience was over.</p> <p>\u201cNot even for ten thousand pounds?\u201d The prince consort barely raised his voice, but Will heard it.</p><p>He laughed darkly. The Echelon. Thinking they could buy a man for his weight in gold.</p><p>He had one hand on the door handle when Barrons spoke up. \u201cWhat if the terms were ones that interested you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t buy me. Not even you, Barrons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the price was a change in the law?\u201d</p> <p>Will froze, hand on the doorknob.</p><p>As if encouraged, Barrons stepped closer, his boots sinking into the plush carpets. \u201cIf you help us sign this treaty with Scandinavia, then we would be willing to make certain changes to the law. No more cages or headhunters, Will. We would outlaw pit-fighting if you wished it.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught in his chest, and he turned on his heel. The five blue bloods stared at him without expression. The sight gave him the impression that this had been the trap all along. \u201cWhy do you need me so much? Sounds like you\u2019ve almost got it signed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are opposing factions in each camp,\u201d Barrons replied with a grimace. \u201cThe Norwegian clans are furiously adamant that they don\u2019t need us, and there are one or two Council members of our own who oppose this.\u201d</p><p>Will took another look around. Not only councilors who\u2019d voted for Blade to live then, but the ones who wanted this treaty to succeed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m to woo the Norwegian clans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re old-fashioned,\u201d the prince consort replied. \u201cAnd crude. But they\u2019re also a loud voice in the Riksdag. We would like to show that our two species can live amicably.\u201d His smile widened. \u201cAnd you are a perfect representative. You would appeal to them immensely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think \u2019e just called you crude,\u201d Blade muttered.</p><p>Will ignored him. \u201cIf I can win the Norwegian clans over and see the treaty signed, then you\u2019ll revoke the law that outlaws verwulfen?\u201d</p><p>The prince consort nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want that in writin\u2019,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnd witnessed.\u201d</p><p>A slight narrowing of the prince consort\u2019s eyes. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t all. I want the pits outlawed. All verwulfen that are caged or slaved are to be set free and given equal rights as humans...or blue bloods.\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd the price on me head is lifted, you understand? I come and go as I please.\u201d No more skulking about the city, running the rooftops at night. Free to go where he wanted. Free to walk the city streets without people trying to kill him\u2014or cage him.</p> <p>The prince consort waved a negligent hand. \u201cWould you like that in writing too?\u201d</p><p>Will bared his teeth. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat were well done,\u201d Blade said, hauling himself up into the steam carriage with a grunt.</p><p>Will nodded past him to Rip, who wore a coachman\u2019s livery and heavy cloak. Beneath that cloak lurked an armory of weapons, as well as the heavy, mech arm that would damn him in this company. At the back of the carriage hovered Tin Man, another of Blade\u2019s men. Light gleamed off the metal cap that was meshed to his scalp. He couldn\u2019t speak, but he was damn good with a blade.</p><p>\u201cTake \u2019im home,\u201d Will said, clapping Tin Man on the shoulder. \u201cMake sure he gets there.\u201d</p><p>Blade poked his head through the window. \u201cWhere\u2019re you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakin\u2019 care of a promise I made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got safe passage,\u201d he retorted. \u201cMight as well use it for the night.\u201d</p><p>A long pause. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He turned on his heel and strode back toward the ball. Despite the overwhelming presence of blue bloods, a small smile played about his lips.</p><p>This time Lena was his.</p><p>Six</p><p>No sign of the duke or duchess anywhere.</p><p>Lena growled under her breath and retreated down the hallway. It wouldn\u2019t do to be caught here alone. As much as she wanted to discover more about the Scandinavian treaty, she wasn\u2019t foolish enough to start searching rooms by herself at a ball full of predators.</p><p>Noise washed over her as she returned to the entry. Keeping an eye open for a certain verwulfen she wished to avoid, she ducked into the ballroom.</p><p>Time to leave. She just had to find Adele and her mother\u2014who was chaperoning her tonight\u2014and plead a case of nerves. Pasting a wan smile on her face, she slipped around the edges of the ballroom, searching for them.</p><p>A full circuit took her back to the main doors. Adele was wearing white, as befitted a woman actively searching for a protector, but none of the white-gowned debutantes were her. A little tick of fear started in Lena\u2019s chest. She wouldn\u2019t have left the ballroom, would she? Adele knew the consequences of that as well as she did. Here, they both had an illusion of safety.</p><p>Unless...she\u2019d left with someone on purpose. Perhaps she\u2019d found someone willing to take her as thrall?</p><p>Lena scurried along the windows, peering out into the shadowed gardens. Adele\u2014cunning, smart Adele\u2014would never place such a risk to her reputation again. Not without an ironclad thrall contract in hand.</p><p>Smiling at Adele\u2019s mother, who stood gossiping with another matron, Lena pushed through the crowd and staggered into the entry. The grandfather clock ticked slowly in the middle of the staircase, but the room was empty.</p><p>The powder room. Maybe she was there?</p><p>Pushing open the small room, she ran into the Duchess of Casavian.</p><p>The woman caught her with strong, pale hands. Years ago, her father had infected her with the craving so that when he died, his House would not fade into obscurity. Aramina should have been considered a rogue, but her House was one of the Great Houses. After numerous assassination attempts she\u2019d somehow survived, some said she\u2019d blackmailed her way to power, forcing the Echelon to accept her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lena said. \u201cI was looking for my friend.\u201d</p><p>Aramina\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re Barrons\u2019s ward, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>And too late, Lena remembered the blood feud between her half brother and this woman. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl like you shouldn\u2019t be out here alone. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I couldn\u2019t find my friend... And I won\u2019t go back without her.\u201d</p><p>Consideration lit those brandy-brown eyes. Then the duchess\u2019s ruby-tinted lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019ll look for her. What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdele Hamilton,\u201d Lena said, collapsing against the wall in relief. \u201cShe\u2019s wearing white.\u201d</p><p>The duchess paused with her hand on the door handle. \u201cThe name is not unknown to me. Wasn\u2019t she the girl caught with Lord Fenwick last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by choice,\u201d Lena admitted, wondering whether the duchess would care.</p><p>They all knew about it, after all.</p><p>After a long stare, the duchess slipped through the door. \u201cI\u2019ll find her. Stay here; it should be safe.\u201d</p><p>Lena fanned herself furiously. Of all the things to happen, she would never have imagined that the Duchess of Casavian would help her. She was notorious for her cool demeanor and frigid temper.</p><p>And her hatred of all things of the House of Caine, Leo included.</p><p>Why help the ward of her enemy?</p><p>Unless she wasn\u2019t really going to search for Adele... Lena\u2019s black lace fan slowed. The duchess had told her to stay here, not return to the ball, where she might be safe. It was highly unlikely a blue blood lord would stumble into the powder room, but it was also the perfect place for an ambush. Dark, secluded... Far enough away that nobody would hear her screaming over the music.</p><p>All the duchess had to do was find one of the more dangerous young bucks and whisper in his ear. Then Lena would be ruined\u2014just another pawn lost in the game between the duchess and Leo.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stay here.</p><p>Bolting for the door, she slipped out into the darkened corridor. Was it her imagination, or had the gaslights been turned down? Heart thumping in her chest, she hurried toward the ballroom.</p><p>Too late, she saw shadows shifting in the corner of her eye. Someone moved from behind the statue of an angel and a large bronzed hand clapped over her mouth. No! Lena\u2019s eyes shot wide as she was dragged back into a man\u2019s solid chest. Then, feet kicking uselessly, he dragged her into the darkness of one of the many rooms.</p><p>Lena screamed against the flesh of his hand, her slippered feet kicking at his shins. Will\u2019s predatory smile slipped. He\u2019d meant to startle her, but the terror emanating off her roused all his dangerous instincts.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered against her ear and she shivered. \u201cLena, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Will.\u201d</p><p>The tension drained out of her so absolutely he had to catch her up against him. With a sob, she turned toward him, tucking her face against his chest. Each small gasp strained her corset, and her fingers fisted in his shirt, dangerously close to the area over his heart. Will froze, his hand hovering over her hair.</p><p>What had frightened her so badly? Somehow he didn\u2019t think it was his own actions; from the way she\u2019d relaxed into his grip, she\u2019d been expecting someone else. The thought raced through his mind, bringing with it a wave of red. The hair along the back of his neck rose, a growl consuming his vocal cords.</p><p>\u201cLena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she snapped. Balling her other fist, she punched him in the arm. \u201cWere you trying to frighten ten years off my life?\u201d</p><p>He barely felt the blow. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so scared? Who\u2019s huntin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>Lena froze. Her other fist unclenched from his shirt and she took a step back, her skirts rustling loudly. \u201cNobody\u2019s hunting me.\u201d</p><p>Lie.</p><p>\u201cNobody except you.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Are you insane? They\u2019ll tear you apart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve safe passage for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A look of concern crossed her face and she took his arm, her gloved fingers resting on his sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t trust them. Don\u2019t let them mix you up in their schemes. If there\u2019s a way around whatever they\u2019ve promised, they\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>Curious words from a woman who had dreamed of living amongst the Echelon for years.</p><p>He looked at the small hand resting on his arm. And realized that they were alone, in a darkened room together.</p><p>Will\u2019s gaze slid to the low scoop of her neckline and the full curve of her breasts. Moonlight glimmered through the curtains, casting a silvery sheen across her flesh. She was beautiful. A goddess of the night, limned by silvery light. Each curve of shadow beckoned him mysteriously, dared him to put his hands on her, to trace the dips and curves that filled out her gown. Christ. His cock hardened, straining against the fabric of his breeches. He could almost taste the warm perfume of her skin.</p><p>Taking a step back, he shook her hand off. \u201cYou owe me some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time. Not at the moment.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, stroked his thumb across the sensitive skin. \u201cThen make it.\u201d</p><p>She staggered into him, her other hand resting lightly against his chest. Something must have shown on his face, for she sucked in a deep breath. \u201cPlease, Will. Not now. There\u2019s something I must take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I have to find my friend. I think she might be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Her scent changed. Something bitter and sharp. Fear. Will let her go, staring down into that heart-shaped face. \u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a...a game the blue blood\u2019s play. If they get a girl alone.\u201d She rubbed at her wrist unconsciously.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdele would never have left willingly. She knows the consequences. Please, I have to find her. Before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not goin\u2019 alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone sees me with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d be ruined. He was half tempted for a moment. She\u2019d never be able to return to this world with the stigma of being caught alone with a verwulfen.</p><p>But she\u2019d made her choices. This was the world she wanted. There was nothing for her in Whitechapel; she\u2019d said so herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned closer, let his voice whisper over her ear. \u201cThen they won\u2019t see me. But I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>It might have been his imagination, but he thought, for a moment, that she shivered.</p><p>The strains of a waltz floated from the ballroom as Barrons climbed the stairs. He\u2019d hoped to catch a chance to talk to Will before he left, but the man had vanished.</p> <p>Glancing down one of the hallways as he crossed it, he saw the sweep of aubergine skirts and the beguiling hint of coppery hair vanishing into a room.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>The waltz beckoned. Laughter loomed. But somehow his feet turned down the corridor.</p><p>Slipping silently through the door, Leo found himself in a shadowed parlor. Moonlight streamed through the windows, highlighting the Duchess of Casavian\u2019s gleaming hair. She peered through a connecting doorway, her head cocked as if listening.</p> <p>\u201cLooking for something?\u201d</p><p>The words tore a gasp from her lips. She spun, eyes glittering coldly.</p><p>\u201cOr is it someone?\u201d He leaned against the closed door and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, Barrons.\u201d She glided sinuously toward him, the creamy flesh of her d\u00e9colletage displayed invitingly. A ploy, of course, meant to draw men\u2019s eyes, make them forget to watch her hands.</p><p>He\u2019d never been that foolish. The woman was dangerous and Leo knew it. She\u2019d like nothing better than to see him and the Duke of Caine dead, their House nothing but a memory. Still...the view was tempting.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d she commanded. Another step brought her closer, her full skirts sweeping against his ankles. As if she thought he\u2019d obey.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Leo took a step closer. Her skirts brushed his thighs, and her chin tilted up. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night and you\u2019re a beautiful woman.\u201d He held a hand out, gesturing to the room with a mocking smile. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all alone.\u201d</p><p>A quick movement. He caught her wrist, moonlight flashing off the bejeweled hilt of a dagger. Their eyes met. There was no sign of her discomposure. Nothing but the quirk of her brow.</p><p>An ice princess.</p><p>Suddenly he wanted to melt her cool mask.</p><p>Spinning her back against the door, he forced her wrist\u2014and the dagger\u2014high. Her other hand moved in a chopping motion but he caught that too. Slammed it back against the hard wood.</p><p>Pinned.</p><p>Aramina\u2019s breath caught. \u201cDon\u2019t think this makes me any less dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d he murmured. The scent of her perfume curled through his nose. Spicy cinnamon. Alluring. Almost enough to make his grip soften, his body lean into hers.</p> <p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cA knee to the balls?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. There was no warmth in it. \u201cA knife would be preferable.\u201d</p><p>Leo winced. \u201cYou\u2019re merciless, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be.\u201d Aramina\u2019s gaze lowered. Examined his mouth.</p><p>Leo froze. The softening of her expression drew him in, a moth to the flame. The woman was his enemy, her House and his at blood feud with each other. And yet he couldn\u2019t deny that she fascinated him.</p><p>\u201cI can be merciless too,\u201d he whispered, his face lowering to hers. \u201cBut you\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. Turned her face away. Leo\u2019s breath stirred the curls at her ear. His heart pounded as his lips brushed against her jaw. The sweet kick of her carotid proved she wasn\u2019t as immune to him as she pretended. He slid his lips over it, felt the pulse through her veins. Heat flared, his cock grinding against her. Somehow his hands were on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou should look to your House,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He traced the curve of her throat with his tongue, teeth grazing the vein. God, how he wanted her blood. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh. Aramina\u2019s face turned to his, her lips brushing his cheek as she whispered in his ear. \u201cWhere\u2019s your ward, Barrons?\u201d</p><p>Something sharp dug into his groin. The knife.</p><p>He hissed. \u201cWhat have you done with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Nothing.\u201d Aramina lifted on her toes, her breasts brushing against his chest. \u201cThat,\u201d she said, \u201cwas almost too easy.\u201d</p><p>The blade forced him away from her. Aramina opened the door, glancing casually over her shoulder. The dagger had vanished. \u201cI was actually trying to do the girl a good deed. I like her.\u201d A swift smile. \u201cAnd she has her uses.\u201d Slipping through the door, she threw over her shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019ll find her in the powder room.\u201d</p><p>Lena strode down the hallway, checking room after room. The skin on her arms and neck prickled, knowing that Will watched. She couldn\u2019t see him anywhere, yet his presence gave her the kind of confidence she\u2019d not felt in a long time.</p><p>Easing the door to Lord Harker\u2019s study closed, she froze. What was that? A soft cry in the dark? Taking a quiet step toward the library, she kept her head cocked.</p><p>There it came again. \u201cNo. Please.\u201d</p><p>Adele. In the library.</p><p>Anger burned through her, white-hot. She slammed open the door. A single candle flickered, highlighting the daybed by the cold fireplace. Adele was wilted over it like a fading flower, blood dripping down the smooth column of her throat. Her bodice was soaked, the bright scarlet vivid against the white silk.</p><p>A man looked up, his lips painted red and the black of his eyes reflecting the candlelight. Benjamin Cavendish, the eldest son of Baron Rackham, and one of the younger pack.</p><p>He wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve, an insolent smile on his face. \u201cAh, the main course arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was done anyway.\u201d His gaze slid over her sinuously. \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Todd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Adele whimpered, her hands on her throat. Her frightened eyes met Lena\u2019s. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s fists clenched. The bastard thought he had her cornered. Will\u2019s silent presence gave her strength she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d had. She snatched a poker from the fire set and faced him. \u201cYou get away from her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feisty one. It\u2019s much more fun when they put up a struggle.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Lena hefted the poker as he took a stealthy step toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re a coward. Stalking young ladies at balls... It\u2019s all you\u2019re good for. You\u2019re not a man; you\u2019re just a little bully who\u2019s grown up.\u201d</p><p>Cavendish\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are going to regret those words.\u201d</p><p>He made a snatch at her skirts. Lena brought the poker down with relish. Take that, you slimy little cretin. \u201cGet your hands off me!\u201d</p><p>The next few seconds happened too quickly for her to keep track of. One moment Cavendish was hissing at her, clutching his injured hand. The next he was slammed up against the fireplace, Will\u2019s hand wrapped around his throat.</p><p>\u201cWill! You\u2019re not supposed to show yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put his hands on you.\u201d</p><p>The depth of his voice sent shivers through her. Dangerous. Brutal. A voice that had no give in it, no means of reckoning with it. She had to stop him before he killed someone.</p><p>\u201cHe barely touched me. Will! Let him go.\u201d She dropped the poker and grabbed his arm. It was useless. Her slight weight didn\u2019t so much as shift him. \u201cWill! If you hurt him, they\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Cavendish gasped, his eyes full of malevolence. They shifted to her. \u201cLittle verwulfen slut. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d been about to say was choked off as Will\u2019s fingers tightened.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, the predator within him riding just under the surface. Cavendish was helpless to disobey. \u201cYou ever come near her again I\u2019ll kill you. And it won\u2019t be quick.\u201d He smiled and Lena shivered. There was a wealth of viciousness in that smile. \u201cDon\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere you can hide. I can get to you, no matter how many guards you think you have. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Cavendish\u2019s fingers tore at Will\u2019s hand. His face was rapidly turning purple, but somehow he managed to nod.</p><p>Will let him go and Cavendish staggered back, slumping against the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s even a whisper about tonight\u2014about Lena\u2014I\u2019ll come for you,\u201d Will promised. \u201cNow get the hell outta here before I change me mind.\u201d</p><p>Cavendish scrambled for the door.</p><p>The ease with which Will did it... Lena felt a brief stab of jealousy. Oh, to be a man, to be strong, to be feared...</p><p>A strangled cough came from the daybed and she turned, her skirts swirling around her ankles as she ran to Adele.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lena knelt, turning her friend\u2019s face to the side to look at the damage. He\u2019d cut her deep, using one of the elegant little blades the Echelon preferred. Some of the crueler blue bloods filed their teeth into points, but the majority used blades.</p><p>At least he\u2019d had the presence of mind to lick the wound afterward. Whatever was in a blue blood\u2019s saliva, it promoted swift healing.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she murmured, tearing a strip off her petticoat. Rolling it into a pad, she tore another strip and bandaged the pad to the wound.</p><p>\u201cCame looking for you,\u201d Adele whispered.</p><p>\u201cI was only going to the powder room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColchester...arrived.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s hands stilled. Then she continued cleaning away the blood. \u201cYou still shouldn\u2019t have come alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw Colchester talking to Cavendish.\u201d Adele swallowed. \u201cHe left the room and I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey set you up.\u201d Damn Colchester. He\u2019d deliberately sent one of his cronies out to ambush Adele. Her actions the other night must have drawn his ire.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Colchester?\u201d</p><p>Lena froze. She\u2019d forgotten all about Will. Her skirts rustled as she turned to look at him, her mind racing. She\u2019d seen the look on his face when he\u2019d choked Cavendish. If she told him about the duke, then there was a chance he\u2019d go after him.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Lannister,\u201d she replied carefully. \u201cHe has some grievance against Leo.\u201d</p><p>Adele shifted and Lena squeezed her hand in warning. Don\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Will stared at her, his face expressionless.</p><p>Beside her, Adele cleared her throat. \u201cWho...is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Blade\u2019s man,\u201d she replied, turning her attention back to her wounded friend. The bandage slowed the bleeding. There was no saving the dress, however. They\u2019d have to get her out of here without anyone seeing.</p><p>\u201cCavendish said he was...\u201d Adele trailed off.</p><p>Lena had never seen her look frightened before. World-weary and cynical, yes, but not truly frightened. She looked up and then paused, realizing how it would seem to Adele. Will hovered in the shadows, but everything about him was intimidating to someone who didn\u2019t know him. And even then...</p><p>Adele would have heard stories\u2014blue blood stories\u2014about verwulfen and their violent, unrestrained passions. To the Echelon, Will was dangerous and nothing more than a monster.</p><p>\u201cVerwulfen? Yes,\u201d she replied, helping her to sit up. She smiled at Adele and leaned closer to whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened by the scowl. He thinks it\u2019s impressive. But he\u2019s a soft-heart beneath the grim exterior.\u201d Lena couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cSome boys were drowning a bag of kittens once and he rescued them. For months they followed him around the warren. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s quite ruined his carefully cultivated reputation in my eyes. All I can see is Mother Hen and his little charges.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cThe only monsters here are Colchester and his little friends.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes were sleepy looking. A dangerous sign. It meant he was thinking and she didn\u2019t want that. Meeting his gaze, she tipped her chin up. \u201cWe have to get her out of here without anyone seeing. If they do, she\u2019s ruined.\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged out of his coat and offered it. Adele flinched but took a slow breath and let Lena drape it around her shoulders. It was deliciously warm and she breathed in, filling her nose with his scent.</p><p>Will rolled the sleeves of his shirt up and candlelight gleamed on his bronzed forearms. Not for the first time, she wondered if his skin was that same molten gold all over.</p><p>Dangerous thoughts. She looked away quickly.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, trying in his own way to be polite. \u201cI can carry you.\u201d</p><p>Adele\u2019s eyes widened, but she nodded and let him slip his arms around her. Will straightened, lifting Adele easily. His gaze sought Lena\u2019s. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>With Will at her side, negotiating the dark hallways was easy. His superior senses saved them from discovery several times over. Slipping out through the servant\u2019s entrance and the garden, they hastened toward the Hamilton\u2019s steam carriage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Weak from the loss of blood, Adele settled into the carriage sleepily. Lena tucked the lap rug over her and checked her makeshift bandage, then turned to murmur to one of the waiting footmen. \u201cWill you fetch Mrs. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>There was one last matter to attend to. Stepping up onto the carriage\u2019s step, she turned to face Will reluctantly. \u201cThank you. For helping me with Adele.\u201d</p><p>He stood with his back to the gaslight, his face cast in shadows. A thin gleam of amber indicated his mood. \u201cYou and I need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d She turned, intending to settle inside the carriage, but he caught a fistful of her skirts.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t goin\u2019 away, Lena.\u201d</p><p>A glimpse over her shoulder revealed the aggressive truth of that on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you let it be? It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even as though he cared. He was only doing this for Blade\u2019s sake.</p><p>Turning around on the step brought her face to face with him. Though she\u2019d always felt at a disadvantage with her lack of height, it was suddenly far too intimate. The heat of his large body protected her from the cool evening breeze, and her skirts pressed against his thighs. She searched his gaze for something, anything, to tell her that she was wrong. That he was here for her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickered away, thoughtful. \u201cFound the same code on a man as stabbed Blade inna heart. Something\u2019s stirrin\u2019, Lena. I\u2019m not about to let him\u2014or the rookery\u2014get caught up in it.\u201d His smoldering gaze caught hers. \u201cAnd I think you know more\u2019n you\u2019re sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. Of course. Blade. And the rookery. \u201cDo you really think I would be involved in anything that might hurt Blade\u2014and through him, my sister and brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>In that moment she hated him. No matter her many flaws, she would never risk Honoria or Charlie\u2019s life. Reaching for the carriage door, she shot him one last glare. \u201cGo home, Will. You don\u2019t belong here, nor are you wanted. Just go home and patrol your little part of London. I won\u2019t visit and I won\u2019t expect to see you in the city.\u201d</p><p>She gave his hand an icy look and he slowly released her, tension riding through his shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you love your brother and sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the few things you seem to know about me.\u201d Sweeping her skirts inside the carriage, she went to shut the door.</p><p>Will caught it, leaning closer. The sleeves of his shirt strained over his arms. \u201cLena, damn it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say... Is this chap bothering you?\u201d</p><p>With Will so close, she hadn\u2019t realized anyone else was there. Neither had he, by the shock that shuddered through him.</p><p>Giving him one last spearing look, she glanced over his shoulder at the slightly inebriated young lord and smiled. Saved by a blue blood. How ironic. \u201cHe was just leaving. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d The young buck shot her a wink and a salute. She\u2019d seen him before, though his name momentarily escaped her.</p><p>Will lowered his hand from the door. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you be. This time.\u201d</p> <p>Lena shut the door and smiled through the glass at him. With a growl, he turned and shot the young lord a look that made his face pale. Then, hands in his pockets, he stalked into the shadows, fog swirling around his ankles.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Adele murmured, resting her head against the carriage seat. She was still snuggled in the black coat. \u201cTell me about this Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Lena looked up from where she\u2019d been smoothing her skirts. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>Adele\u2019s eyes narrowed. A hint of her old spark was starting to warm her cheeks. \u201cHe looks like he wants to eat you up, Lena. And not in a scary manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill? He does nothing of the sort! He\u2019s made it quite\u2014\u201d And then she stopped, aware of what she was about to reveal.</p><p>\u201cQuite...?\u201d Adele prompted. When Lena said nothing, a weary smile stretched over her face. \u201cYou do realize I\u2019m not going to leave it there, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Staring out the window, Lena watched the lights glittering in the windows of Lord Harker\u2019s mansion. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the footman would bring Adele\u2019s mother. Then she would be safe from prying questions.</p><p>Yet...a sudden urge welled up. The need to confide in someone, even Adele. She\u2019d been holding so much inside her for months that she felt almost fit to bursting.</p><p>\u201cI kissed him,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. It was always just a game I played with him. A flirtation. I never meant anything by it.\u201d Hadn\u2019t she? Lena frowned. She couldn\u2019t, in truth, answer that question. \u201cIt was awful. He didn\u2019t even kiss me back. And when I stopped...\u201d Her cheeks were burning now. \u201cHe told me that he would tolerate my childish little games for Blade\u2019s sake, but that he would prefer it if I didn\u2019t throw myself at him. Especially since we were living beneath one roof.\u201d The very memory of it turned her stomach. He\u2019d been so angry with her he was shaking. Then he\u2019d turned and walked away without another word.</p><p>Somehow she managed a lighthearted shrug for Adele\u2019s sake. \u201cThe next day he moved out of the warren. And I decided it was time to return to society. There was nothing left for me in Whitechapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never kissed you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even slightly.\u201d</p><p>Adele\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cHow unusual. For I would have suspected quite the opposite, my dear. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you. And when Cavendish tried to grab you, I thought he was going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis loyalty is to Blade. If he allowed me to come to any harm he\u2019d have to explain it to him. And Honoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Adele settled back on the seat, snuggling in wearily. \u201cI\u2019ll stake a hundred pounds that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do we prove that?\u201d she asked tartly. \u201cI\u2019m not about to ask him.\u201d</p><p>Adele\u2019s eyes closed. A little smile played around her lips. \u201cBecause next time, I\u2019m certain that he\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>The door to Lord Harker\u2019s private study slammed open.</p><p>Colchester looked up over the rim of his glass. His gaze raked Cavendish, from the rumpled collar of his coat to the seething fury in his eyes. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was a large bruise forming against the other man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil happened? Surely she didn\u2019t put up that much of a fight?\u201d</p><p>Cavendish shot him a filthy look and crossed to the liquor decanter. \u201cYou forgot to mention she had protection.\u201d He splashed a liberal dash of blud-wein into a glass and drained it.</p><p>\u201cProtection?\u201d Colchester asked silkily. His eyes lifted again to that bruise. \u201cWhat manner of protection?\u201d</p><p>Cavendish lowered the glass and muttered, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Colchester eased to his feet, tossing aside the newspaper he\u2019d been reading. Below, the ball was still in full swing by the sound of it, yet he had little intention of joining the swirling throng. No, he had other plans.</p><p>Plans that Cavendish just might have ruined.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a blue blood, Cavendish. Not a puling human. I asked you to ruin the girl and you couldn\u2019t even handle that.\u201d He sneered, circling the other man. \u201cDid she beat you with her reticule? Or was there more than one of them? A whole flock of debutantes to frighten you\u2014\u201d</p><p>An angry gleam turned Cavendish\u2019s eyes to shadows. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you take on the Beast. Seems your little bitch has gone and got herself a filthy verwulfen to watch her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>Cavendish sneered. \u201cProbably plundering the girl right now, as we speak. Seems you\u2019re not going to get your hands on that one after all.\u201d</p><p>Colchester had him by the throat before he realized it. \u201cWhitechapel\u2019s Beast?\u201d</p><p>Cavendish struggled to nod.</p><p>Shock sliced through him. The little bitch. Thought she could find a protector, did she? As Cavendish made a strangled sound, Colchester dropped him and stepped away, raking the glasses off the tray. Glass smashed across the floor, littering the carpets. Lena was his. But if she\u2019d polluted herself with one of those filthy creatures then she was no longer fit to be his thrall. By God he\u2019d make her regret this act.</p><p>Cavendish slumped against the table, watching him warily. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he asked, and Colchester realized he\u2019d spoken out loud.</p><p>Bad enough that the rest of the Council sought to ally themselves with these creatures. Now one of them moved to steal his thrall right out from underneath his nose. That, if nothing else, made him want her even more.</p><p>He smiled. Darkly. \u201cLet me deal with it. I\u2019ll make her regret it.\u201d Flicking glass off his sleeve, he turned toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll make them both regret it.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Will shot a look down the hall, his booted heels muffled on the Turkish runner. He could sense Lena in the house somewhere, but not nearby. Which suited him perfectly for the moment.</p><p>Slipping inside the study, he closed the door behind him. Morning light spilled through the windows. An ungodly hour of the morning, in fact. He\u2019d barely slept, his mind replaying every scene from the night before. As soon as he grew close to the edge of sleep, the memory of Lena\u2019s fear scent would sweep through him and his eyes would jerk open again. He needed to know more. Especially about the one name that frightened her.</p><p>Barrons looked up from his desk, his dark eyes widening slightly. \u201cWill.\u201d He leaned back in his chair, his progress marked by the shifting of well-oiled leather. Dressed in a black velvet coat, the only sign of color was the spill of white lace at his wrists and throat. A little ruby pin winked against the lace. \u201cYou do realize the price on your head isn\u2019t lifted until you sign the prince consort\u2019s document?\u201d He lifted a sheaf of papers, frowning. \u201cWhich is right here, I believe.\u201d</p><p>Will crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat d\u2019you know about a man named Colchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColchester?\u201d Barrons\u2019s hands stilled on the paper. \u201cHe used to be a friend, until I orchestrated the duel between his cousin Vickers and Blade. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Lena be afraid of him?\u201d</p><p>Barrons straightened, a dangerous look coming into his obsidian eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad business with her last night. When I found her she were terrified. O\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>Barrons leaned back in his chair. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Will relayed the story, omitting any mention of the code or the letter. \u201cDon\u2019t know \u2019im. Ain\u2019t never heard much about him.\u201d He scratched at the stubble on his jaw. \u201cIs he dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll blue bloods are dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Will met his stare. \u201cCan he get to her?\u201d</p><p>For once, Barrons\u2019s cool composure vanished. Uncertainty shadowed his brow. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She has a companion and she only ever attends events with a chaperone or myself. But there are ways to get around that for a man like Colchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only presume,\u201d Barrons replied. \u201cVengeance against me. Or perhaps some interest in Lena herself. Rumor has it he\u2019s hunting for another thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let that happen?\u201d</p><p>Barrons leveled an intense look upon him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade protects his own,\u201d he replied promptly. \u201cAnd I protect him. He wouldn\u2019t survive goin\u2019 up against another duke. I want this stopped before it gets to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Barrons gestured toward the chair facing him. \u201cHow do you propose to stop it?\u201d</p><p>Will sank into the chair. \u201cThought of a way to protect Lena and help with the prince consort\u2019s task. Killin\u2019 two birds with one stone, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>Barrons gestured for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cThis ruse of the prince consort\u2019s\u2014me, dressed up like a court jester and bobbin\u2019 to his tune\u2014it ain\u2019t gonna work. I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 of court ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho better to teach me than Lena? Keep me from makin\u2019 too big a fool of meself, or steppin\u2019 on the wrong toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they happen to be Colchester\u2019s...upon whom you wish to step quite firmly, if I may guess where this is going?\u201d Barrons leaned forward. \u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous man, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Barrons examined him for a long moment. Then nodded. \u201cA verwulfen bodyguard. It would certainly give most sane men pause. Done. I\u2019ll inform her that she\u2019s to help present you to the court and squire you about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf she\u2019s with me, then he can\u2019t make a move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything untoward,\u201d Barrons warned. \u201cRemember your cause\u2014if you kill Colchester, you can wave good-bye to any assistance or goodwill from the prince consort. Including this reform of the laws that you are so anxious to establish.\u201d</p><p>Will bared his teeth in an anticipatory smile. \u201cWould you like to let Lena know about her new duties, or can I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHike in blood taxes!\u201d the headlines screamed.</p><p>Lena dipped her spoon into the crater of her boiled egg, her gaze darting over the article. \u201cMrs. Wade, have you seen this?\u201d she asked, gesturing with the spoon. Runny yolk dripped over the paper and she hastily put it down. \u201cThey\u2019re raising the blood taxes! From two pints a year to three. Anyone who hasn\u2019t donated in the last month must attend a mandatory bloodletting in the next two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA young lady doesn\u2019t speak of such things. Especially over the breakfast table.\u201d Meticulously carving her sausage, Mrs. Wade\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cHave you read the society pages? What did you think of the description of Miss Hambley\u2019s gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA withered daffodil? Rather accurate, if I do say so,\u201d she replied distantly. \u201cIt must be in response to the draining factories burning down. The Echelon must be dangerously short of blood supplies.\u201d</p><p>Though they kept thralls for fresh blood, they also needed a supply of chilled blood on hand. It was dangerous to take too much from a thrall, and draining one to death was in utter poor taste. The only lords who could afford to keep and maintain enough thralls to survive off of were the great dukes who ruled the city. The rest of the Echelon were forced to buy blood from the government-owned draining factories or keep blood slaves.</p> <p>\u201cThe working class won\u2019t be very happy about this.\u201d There\u2019d already been three riots this year, twice about automaton factory workers taking jobs and then again when a young woman was found drained to death in an alley.</p><p>Mrs. Wade made a disapproving sound and stabbed a piece of sausage.</p><p>A knock sounded and Leo appeared in the doorway of the dining room, dressed in his usual strict black. \u201cLadies,\u201d he greeted.</p><p>Mrs. Wade snatched her napkin to her lips. \u201cGood morning, my lord. You are joining us for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d He glanced toward her and Lena stilled. From the look in his eyes, Leo was up to something.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, her heart starting to pound. Had he heard of what happened to Adele? Or Cavendish?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve a favor to ask,\u201d he said, resting his hip against the edge of the dining table.</p><p>\u201cOf course. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Movement shifted at the edge of her vision. Will. Stepping into the room, his hands shoved into his pockets and satisfaction burning in his eyes.</p><p>Lena stared. His collar was open, revealing a healthy slice of tanned flesh, and he hadn\u2019t bothered to shave. With his burning amber eyes and the stubble on his jaw, he looked eminently dangerous. A silver claw hung from the leather thong at his throat.</p><p>His mouth curved with a rusty smile, sending her pulse into a frenetic tempo. Oh Lord! She\u2019d rarely seen him smile. And certainly not at her. The result was rather devastating.</p><p>Leo cleared his throat and Lena tore her gaze away. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the proposition yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarver\u2019s received a commission from the Crown,\u201d Leo continued.</p><p>The words jerked her attention away from Will. \u201cA commission?\u201d What could the prince consort possibly want of him? For that was where the commission had to have come from. The queen might sit on the throne, but she was the prince consort\u2019s puppet-on-a-string. She barely dared speak without his permission.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a delegation arriving from Scandinavia in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cJust some political business for the Council and the prince consort,\u201d Leo said. \u201cNothing interesting, I\u2019m afraid. But you know how feelings run between our two countries. It was felt that Will\u2019s presence might be some sort of soothing factor.\u201d</p><p>Lena nodded slowly, her mind scalded with shock. Will was involved in this?</p><p>\u201cHe needs tidying up,\u201d Leo continued. \u201cBoth in manners and appearance. And he also needs someone to guide him through the dangerous waters at court. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the time...\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She saw where this was going.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to escort him.\u201d Her eyes narrowed on Will. \u201cI wonder whose idea that was?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have the grace to appear guilty. Leaning against the door, he smiled his cat-got-the-cream smile.</p><p>The one that did so much damage to her insides.</p><p>\u201cYour skill in navigating the Echelon would serve your country in good stead,\u201d Leo replied.</p><p>\u201cMy, it\u2019s so terribly well thought out.\u201d Inside she was boiling. How dare he? And yet this was precisely what Mr. Mandeville had warned her about when she first agreed to spy for the humanists. She couldn\u2019t allow her feelings to disrupt such an opportunity.</p><p>Finding out about the Scandinavian treaty was more important than braining Will Carver with the soup tureen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll help us then?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>\u201cI could hardly refuse such a gracious offer. We\u2019ll start tomorrow.\u201d She ran her gaze over Will\u2019s unkempt hair, the glorious honey-brown strands that tangled about his shoulders. \u201cThough heaven knows where I\u2019m going to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to be perfect,\u201d Leo said. \u201cJust polished. And taught what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr rather, what not to.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to look like a gentleman at least. A haircut, a shave...possibly delousing.\u201d A smile blossomed. \u201cA complete new wardrobe. Dancing lessons.\u201d</p><p>Will arched a brow. \u201cI ain\u2019t dancin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll dance if I tell you to dance. You\u2019ll bow when I tell you, and you\u2019ll keep a civil tongue.\u201d A part of her almost couldn\u2019t wait. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll wash my hands of this whole affair and you don\u2019t want that, do you?\u201d</p><p>Oh no, he wanted to be nice and close. To keep an eye on her.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, the message in them perfectly clear. This would be war. But he had no choice but to accept her terms.</p><p>Leo looked between them. \u201cIs there anything that I should be aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d both she and Will retorted.</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d she added, glaring at him to make sure he didn\u2019t mention anything to Leo.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you think this is amusing,\u201d Lena said, pulling on her gloves with a sharp jerk.</p><p>Will leaned against the wall, lazily watching her. Her cheeks were pale but her eyes spat fire. He wanted to kiss her, wanted to press her back against the Chinese wallpaper and lick his way down her throat.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>He could control this urge, this desire. He had to.</p><p>Flexing his fingers, he glanced down the hallway. The chaperone was hovering like a service drone, her eyes flaring wide every time she saw him looking, as though she half suspected he\u2019d pounce on her. Will was tempted to snarl at her. See if she had an attack of the vapors.</p><p>\u201cWould it bother you if I admitted I were enjoyin\u2019 every minute of this?\u201d</p><p>Lena paused, her top hat resting rakishly on her head. Her fingers tangled in the purple ribbons and their eyes met in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d he whispered, leaning closer so that his image came into the polished glass too. With his dark coat, he looked like an enormous shadow behind her slender purple figure. The big, bad wolf, ready to devour her.</p><p>Her scent enveloped him, tempting him to do just that. He wanted to press his face into her neck and breathe her in, let his hands run down over the corseted curve of her hips...</p><p>Lena looked up at him helplessly. Some hint of his hunger must have shown on his face for her lips parted with a soft exhalation.</p><p>\u201cI will find out what you\u2019re up to,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She broke the spell, tugging sharply at her ribbons as she tied them. \u201cEnjoy the moment, Will. It shall be the last time you get the better of me.\u201d With a sweet little smile, she added, \u201cAnd consider this my warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d</p><p>She turned in a froth of skirts. \u201cThis is my world now and you\u2019ve got no idea what the rules are. You\u2019re not going to learn a thing and I...I am going to take great pleasure in this.\u201d</p><p>She tried to step past him and he refused to back away and give her room. Lena\u2019s breathing hastened, but there was no sign of it on her face as she squeezed past, her hips brushing against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. At noon,\u201d she said, fetching her parasol, some lacy bit of fabric that would do naught to stave off the weather. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do to have you come here too often. People might start to wonder. So I\u2019ll come to you. At the warren. I can claim to be visiting my sister or helping her with some project.\u201d She ran one last glance over him. \u201cDo try to be clean and appropriately dressed. Tidying you up for society is going to be a rather monumental task as it is.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Will paced the edge of the roof, staring out over the wall that encircled Whitechapel. Chanting and shouts echoed from the north, near the exit of Bishopsgate. It sounded like the low rumble of thunder, and every hour built the intensity of the storm until even Charlie and Lark could hear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Charlie asked, sitting on a chimney and kicking his heels against the brickwork.</p><p>At his feet, Lark sat cross-legged at the base of the chimney, chewing on a strand of her long brown hair. Ever since Honoria had moved into the warren with Lena and their younger brother Charlie, the pair had been inseparable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a riot. Or the starts of one,\u201d Will replied.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s eyes rounded and he grinned. At seventeen, he was still young enough not to understand what was about to happen. \u201cA riot? How smashing! Can we go see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a nodcock,\u201d Lark snapped. Raised in the rookeries, she understood the connotations far better than Charlie ever would. \u201cNothin\u2019 but blood\u2019ll come of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better.\u201d Charlie grinned, a hint of dark shadows swimming through his gaze.</p><p>Lark punched him in the thigh and he winced. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen a riot dealt with before, you fool. It won\u2019t be a sight to see. Nothin\u2019 but crushed bodies and broken bones. Men, women, and children.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe Echelon won\u2019t stand for it long. They\u2019ll unleash the Trojan cavalry to mow \u2019em down and then there\u2019ll be blood in the streets.\u201d She shivered. \u201cNot \u2019ere though. Not near us.\u201d</p><p>Will stared over the rooftops, his nostrils flaring. \u201cNear Langbourn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Charlie\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cI was only foolin\u2019. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think,\u201d Lark corrected. Charlie might be a blue blood and three times as strong as her, but the balance of power between them was still weighted in her direction. She had street smarts and a quick cunning\u2014and several older adopted \u201cuncles\u201d to back her up if anyone gave her any lip.</p><p>Will ignored their bickering, pacing along the edge of the roof. A quick glance showed him the sun in the sky, battling valiantly behind several fluffy gray clouds. \u201cCharlie, what time is it?\u201d</p><p>Charlie tugged out his pocket watch. \u201cQuarter to twelve, sir.\u201d</p><p>Midday.</p><p>A restless edge ran through him. She\u2019d said she\u2019d come here for the lesson. His mind ran through a mental map of the city. If Lena came through Aldgate, she\u2019d most likely avoid the trouble. But if she came out through Bishopsgate, then...</p><p>A growl rumbled in his throat.</p><p>\u201cAh... Is everything all right?\u201d Charlie asked. Even he knew to tread carefully around Will\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cMebbe.\u201d He turned and speared them both with a gaze. \u201cStay here. Keep watch. And don\u2019t, under any circumstances, leave the rookery. If trouble spills, then you get back to the warren and cry hue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Charlie snapped to attention. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Will strode toward the edge of the wall. \u201cTo fetch your fool sister. She said she were comin\u2019 here today. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she gets caught up in that.\u201d</p><p>The letter from Mr. Mandeville arrived early that morning.</p><p>Lena looked up from her workbench, a variety of cogs and strips of sheet iron strewn across the tabletop. Pushing her magnifying glassicals up on top of her head, she retrieved the letter and slid a screwdriver underneath the envelope to slit it open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A slow, steady beat began in her chest.</p><p>Dear Miss Todd,</p><p>I hope this letter finds you well. I have received a most impressive commission for you, regarding the original clockwork you showed me the other day. I would be delighted to discuss this with you in person, at your convenience.</p> <p>Yours,</p><p>Arthur Mandeville.</p><p>Clapping a hand to her chest, she slowly rose. The transforming clockwork! Someone wanted a copy of it!</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wade!\u201d she called, hurrying out of the room to her companion\u2019s bedchambers. \u201cMrs. Wade!\u201d</p><p>Within a half hour, she\u2019d hustled her companion into the steam carriage and set out for Mandeville\u2019s Clockwork Emporium.</p> <p>The streets were full and progress was slow. Lena twitched aside the curtains, glancing at the crowds and the omnibus ahead. Passing under Bishopsgate, one of the massive gates that guarded the city proper, she toyed impatiently with her reticule. \u201cWhatever is the crush?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Wade leaned out the window and conferred with the driver. When she sat back down, she was breathless. \u201cA protest. In Langbourn and Lime Street. Those mechanists are at it again.\u201d</p><p>Lena peered out curiously. She\u2019d heard all about the mechanists\u2014those who bartered years of service to the Echelon in exchange for bio-mech limbs or clockwork organs. Quartered in their steamy enclaves in the city, they were treated as little better than animals. One couldn\u2019t trust a man who was half metal. Indeed, many in the Echelon argued that by taking on the metal limbs, they were making themselves less human and therefore did not have the rights of a whole man.</p><p>\u201cThey should herd them back to their enclaves and lock them in,\u201d Mrs. Wade sniffed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what the difference is. Just because someone has a metal arm, it doesn\u2019t make him any less a man,\u201d Lena replied. Two of Blade\u2019s men, Tin Man and Rip, had mech limbs. By rights, both of them should have been imprisoned in the enclaves, but no one dared mention it to Blade.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t trust them,\u201d Mrs. Wade replied.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? The metal does not affect the mind. They are still the same as they were before they received the enhancements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unnatural, is what it is.\u201d</p><p>There was no point arguing with someone who had no rational rebuttals. Lena bit her tongue and tried to catch a closer look at the rally.</p><p>\u201cHopefully they\u2019ll send the metaljackets in and clear them out,\u201d Mrs. Wade added. \u201cGet this traffic moving again.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t very far to the emporium. She\u2019d walked ten times this distance when she lived in the rookery. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk?\u201d</p><p>The suggestion was met with a look of great horror. \u201cWith all those mechs running around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take one of the footmen. The carriage can meet us there once this congested traffic starts moving again.\u201d Lena reached for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait! Your parasol!\u201d Mrs. Wade huffed after her, bringing her hat, parasol, and the basket of crochet she always carried as Lena hopped down from the carriage. Her eyes darted as if expecting a mech to leap out and attack at any moment.</p> <p>The crowd thinned the closer they got to Mandeville\u2019s. Most people were poor, waving placards and fists, as though the Echelon would even notice. Still, Lena could understand the need to do something.</p><p>Several streets over, the sound was rather more intense. Lena steered them in the other direction, even though it took them streets out of their way. She had no intentions of getting caught in the mob.</p><p>A burly man with a metal plate curving across his skull staggered into her, reeking of spirits. His hand was mech too, fitted roughly to the flesh of his wrist. From the scarred edges of skin, the work had been done in a hurry, and poorly too. He caught sight of her red skirts and looked up, his gaze raking over the pearls at her throat and the feathers in her bonnet. They were the only adornments she wore and in most circumstances she wouldn\u2019t have felt uneasy walking the streets like this.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Ere now,\u201d he sneered, grabbing her wrist. \u201cA little blue blood whore, all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would let me go if I were you,\u201d she suggested in her firmest tone. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t assume that I was alone.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Wade leveled her parasol at him as though it were a weapon. \u201cUnhand her, you mech brute!\u201d</p><p>Lena shot her a glare and shook her head. Precisely the wrong tone and words for the situation. She held up a placating hand. \u201cWe have no interest in your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrute?\u201d he snarled. \u201cA mech brute like me? What, you think you\u2019re better \u2019an us?\u201d</p><p>Around them, people were starting to take an interest.</p><p>\u201cLet her go or you\u2019ll feel the wrath of the Duke of Caine!\u201d Mrs. Wade snapped back, as though that name would hold any weight here.</p><p>Lena hastened to diffuse the situation. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re any better, or different or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Ere now, lads!\u201d he roared. \u201cThis bit o\u2019 fluff\u2019s turnin\u2019 her nose up at us!\u201d</p><p>Mutters and grumbling sprang up. Lena looked around desperately. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t! I never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in the city, you turn your noses up at us. Well, just you wait. Your time\u2019s comin\u2019.\u201d He leered at her. \u201cWe got ways of dealin\u2019 with your sort now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnhand her!\u201d the footman insisted, taking the man by the arm. \u201cMiss Lena, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Whistles suddenly screamed through the air and as one the crowd turned with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Trojan cavalry!\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>Frightened cries tore through the crowd and they erupted into a panicked mob, streaming for the safety of the square ahead. Lena was swept up in the edges of it, her wrist torn from the man\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Someone grabbed her around the waist, lifting her off her feet. \u201cBeg pardon, miss,\u201d Henry, the footman, said. A strapping lad of nearly six feet, even he had to fight to keep his feet against the horde as he pushed through to the side of the crowd.</p><p>Mrs. Wade leaned in a doorway, fanning herself with her hand. \u201cOh, Lena! Oh, thank goodness!\u201d She dragged her into the safety of the alcove and Henry used his body to shield them from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Lena peered under his outstretched arm.</p><p>\u201cThe Echelon must have released the cavalry, ma\u2019am,\u201d Henry replied, his face pale. \u201cPlease don\u2019t move. They\u2019ll cut down anything in their wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not everybody is causing trouble,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>A beat began to ring on the cobbles. Like the sound of a hundred horses marching in perfect unison. A chill ran down her spine. The Trojan cavalry were used to clear most mobs and riots\u2014since the firebombing Spitfires could cause too much damage. There was little that could stand up against the heavily armored metal horses, and she\u2019d heard rumors that they simply rode a man down. Nothing was destroyed that way. Only the man.</p><p>Lena looked toward the far end of the street. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Henry said grimly.</p><p>The narrow doorway was barely wide enough to fit the three of them. Most of Henry was sticking out into the street. Even now the terrified crowd bumped and knocked him as they streamed past.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d Mr. Mandeville\u2019s wasn\u2019t far away. They could make it if they hurried. And she knew these streets like the back of her hand.</p><p>Mrs. Wade coughed, her face as white as a sheet. Lena\u2019s heart sank. Her elderly companion would never make it so far in such a hurry. From the sound of her gasps, she was verging on a hysterical fit.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Ducking under Henry\u2019s arm, Lena looked up at the gutter overhang. \u201cHenry, when they send the cavalry out, do they send any of the Spitfires or metaljackets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for it. There isn\u2019t much left once the cavalry rides through.\u201d</p><p>Most of the crowd had vanished. At the end of the street, sunlight reflected off the burnished armor of a row of metal horses.</p><p>\u201cCome, Mrs. Wade,\u201d she said gently, taking her companion by the arm. \u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Wade shook her head. \u201cNo, no, I can\u2019t! They\u2019ll ride us down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, do you think it at all possible to lift her?\u201d</p><p>He gave the question some thought, a dubious expression on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t say as how far I could carry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far at all.\u201d She looked up. \u201cWe\u2019re going across the rooftops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d never lived in the rookery, where Blade and Will\u2014and most of his men\u2014used the rooftops as their own highway.</p><p>Coaxing Mrs. Wade out, she helped Henry lift her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to grab for the gutter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI c-can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will,\u201d Lena snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of these hysterics. If you don\u2019t hurry up, then Henry and I shan\u2019t have time to follow and then you will have to explain to my guardian how you managed to get me trampled!\u201d</p><p>That caused a great scurry of activity. Mrs. Wade kicked and puffed, scrabbling for the roof. Henry struggled to lift her above his shoulders, his eyes squeezed tight whilst the voluminous folds of Mrs. Wade\u2019s skirts revealed a great deal of her unmentionables to the world.</p><p>Steel shod hooves echoed off the cobbles. Lena glanced nervously up the street.</p><p>\u201cYou next, miss,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Lena stepped up onto his bent knee and then shoulder, catching hold of the gutter. She had to hurry. Mrs. Wade had cost them a great deal of time. Biting her lip, Lena hauled herself up onto the roof, then turned and lay down, peering at Henry.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>The cavalry was almost upon them. The horses were eight feet high at the withers, with broad, heavily-plated chests and enormous, soup-bowl hooves. Designed like a destrier, steam puffed and snorted from their nostrils. The sight was enough to curdle her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHenry!\u201d She extended her arm. His wide blue eyes looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only pull you down,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>Lena snatched the parasol off Mrs. Wade and dropped it into his hands. \u201cHook it into the gutter and use it to help ease your weight! Mrs. Wade!\u201d She looked behind her to where her companion sprawled on the tiles. \u201cHold my ankles and whatever you do, don\u2019t let him pull me off!\u201d</p><p>A pair of meaty hands wrapped around her ankles, with the considerable weight of Mrs. Wade to anchor her.</p><p>The metal cavalry broke from a trot into a canter and then stretched out into a gallop. A man ran ahead of them and went down beneath the crushing steel hooves. In their midst rode the handlers, each steering a herd of ten with their small, spiked little boxes and the radio signal that controlled them.</p><p>\u201cHenry!\u201d Lena screamed, reaching out to clasp his arm as he struggled valiantly to haul himself up.</p><p>Behind her, Mrs. Wade cried out and slid a few inches down the roof. Lena shot forward on her stomach, her face and shoulders dangling over the gutters. She wrenched at Henry\u2019s arm, but he\u2019d lost the tentative grip he had on the gutter and was dangling by her parasol.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare let me go!\u201d Lena yelled.</p><p>Henry tucked his feet up desperately, trying not to get hit as the first line of the metal horses thundered by. Choking dust rose from the street. The inch of sleeve she held slipped even farther through her fingers until\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Mrs. Wade cried out and let go. Lena\u2019s eyes shot open and she fell forward, her skirts sliding over the tiles. She caught a glimpse of Henry\u2019s wide, horrified eyes as she fell toward the street and then\u2014</p><p>Something grabbed her by the skirts.</p><p>With a wrench she landed flat on her back on the tiles next to Mrs. Wade, blinking up at Will. His broad shoulders were outlined against the inclement clouds, the muscles in his bare arms bunched as his fists curled. \u201cOught have known you\u2019d be in bloody trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry!\u201d she gasped, pointing to the edge of the roof.</p><p>Will knelt, the leather of his trousers straining over his heavily muscled thighs. He reached down and caught the parasol then straightened as if it were barely any effort at all.</p><p>Henry rose in the air, kicking feebly at the end of the parasol. Will snatched his hand and yanked him onto the roof where he collapsed in violent shudders.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh, Miss Lena! I thought you were going! You should never have risked yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t about to leave you to fall.\u201d Kneeling beside him, she checked him over for injuries. Her own hands were starting to shake. So close. Too close, actually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shadow fell over her. Lena\u2019s stomach dropped.</p><p>When she looked up, Will wore a murderous scowl. \u201cWhat the bloody hell were you thinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t!\u201d His arms exploded into the air. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been! What idiot gets out of a carriage in the middle of a friggin\u2019 mob? Did you not once think about how dangerous it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to avoid it. Mr. Mandeville\u2019s is two streets over. If we\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two streets too far! Do you have any idea what went through my head when I found the bloody carriage? Turned on its side and abandoned? With your bloody footmen sittin\u2019 on a roof, smokin\u2019 cheroots!\u201d</p><p>Lena stood up, shaking out her skirts. \u201cI didn\u2019t think a riot would erupt so quickly. And obviously the carriage was no safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think? Didn\u2019t think?\u201d The last came out as a roar that made both Mrs. Wade and Henry flinch.</p> <p>Heat burned her cheeks. \u201cI made a mistake. But I\u2019ve been in these kinds of situations before. I wasn\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, been in these situations before?\u201d</p><p>Lena took a steady breath. By the look on his face, she was one step away from being shaken like a rag doll. \u201cWhen I was working at Mr. Mandeville\u2019s. There wasn\u2019t money enough to catch the tram home, so I had to walk. I got caught in the edges of a riot twice.\u201d As his expression darkened, she hastened to assure him. \u201cI climbed up on the roof the first time and hid in a man\u2019s home the second. He was terribly nice about it.\u201d</p><p>Will took a deep breath. Then another. His shoulders were still tense, his eyes wild. \u201cIf you ever go out into these streets unprotected again, I\u2019ll throttle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent six months walking home through these streets when I was sixteen,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd I had Mrs. Wade and Henry with me this time. That\u2019s a lot safer than when we were poor and in hiding from Vickers.\u201d</p><p>A strangled noise came from his throat. Lena shut her mouth. Not the time to mention all of the horrid things that had happened to her during that awful time after her father\u2019s death.</p> <p>He turned and raked Henry with a gaze that made the lad swallow. \u201cNever again, do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>The lad nodded sharply.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Will snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll get you back to the warren. Then we\u2019ll see about gettin\u2019 you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see Mr. Mandeville first.\u201d</p><p>He spun on his heel and Lena took a step back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s expecting me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t arrive, I shouldn\u2019t want him to come out into the streets looking for me.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. As he turned back around, she thought he murmured something but she couldn\u2019t quite make it out.</p><p>She could, however, see the blood rush out of Mrs. Wade\u2019s face.</p> <p>Nine</p><p>\u201cThank goodness you\u2019re all right!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Mandeville swept her up into his arms and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Lena gave him a swift hug. \u201cDid you see any of the trouble here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time. I could hear them shouting though, streets over.\u201d His gaze flickered over her shoulder. Then froze.</p><p>\u201cYou know Mrs. Wade and Henry.\u201d She gestured at the weary pair. Will turned from where he\u2019d been staring out into the streets. The light from the window lit his burning amber irises. \u201cAnd this is William Carver. A friend of my sister\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>The stiffness in Mr. Mandeville\u2019s shoulders spoke volumes. He knew exactly what those eyes meant. \u201cA pleasure to meet you,\u201d he said, with a sharp jerk of his head.</p><p>Lena pasted a smile on her face to cover his rudeness. \u201cWill helped us with some unpleasantness in the riot. He\u2019s here to escort me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Mr. Mandeville\u2019s gaze shot between her and Will. \u201cDid you get my message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I wanted to discuss the commission further, if you will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe back rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be a moment.\u201d Seeing Will\u2019s glower, she hastened to add. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Taking Mr. Mandeville\u2019s arm, she steered him toward the back room. As soon as the door closed, he turned on her, but she held up a warning hand and tapped her ear.</p><p>\u201cSo someone wished to purchase the transformational clockwork?\u201d she asked, picking up one of his spring pens and writing on a piece of paper. Say nothing you don\u2019t want overheard.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville stroked the end of his moustache. \u201cI relayed word of it to a certain friend of mine.\u201d Mercury, he wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in presenting it as a gift to the Scandinavian Ambassador once the treaty is signed. He was most impressed with the detail.\u201d</p><p>For what purpose? The incident with the draining factories was still fresh in her mind, though she could think of no foul use for her transformational clockwork.</p><p>He wants to make his own agreements with the Scandinavians. Out loud Mr. Mandeville added, \u201cHe\u2019s never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>Then, taking a deep breath\u2014and asking how much the commission was likely to pay\u2014she hesitantly wrote. Do you know anything about the content of these letters? Or about the draining factories burning down?</p><p>Mr. Mandeville stroked his moustache. \u201cI should imagine you could charge a handsome fee. He wants it complete within two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d she squealed.</p><p>\u201cThe Scandinavians arrive next week. I assume there shall be the usual rounds of talks and social entertainments.\u201d Taking the pen he wrote, We\u2019re not the only ones working against the Echelon. There is another small faction with rather more drastic notions of how to bring them down. The letters, as far as I know, contain dates and times for meetings.</p><p>He\u2019d barely put the pen down before she snatched it up. But you don\u2019t know that for certain?</p><p>A hesitation. No. I don\u2019t. But I wouldn\u2019t condone such outright acts of terror.</p><p>Good. She met his gaze pointedly. Because I want no part of that either.</p><p>I have another message that needs to be delivered. Will you do it?</p><p>Lena stared at the sheet of paper. Doubt was a small, restless tickle. An itch she couldn\u2019t scratch. I want to meet Mercury.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville\u2019s head shot up. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>With an angry shake of the head, she picked up the pen. Then I want nothing more to do with this. I won\u2019t be privy to acts that might be killing innocent people. There were guards at those factories. Human guards. I want to talk to someone who knows what is in those letters.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville stared at her, his lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019ll pass word along regarding the commission. It shall be up to his discretion to meet with you.\u201d Pursing his lips, he held the letter up. \u201cWill you take it?\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>Lena stared at it. So innocuous. Just a single piece of parchment. Slowly she reached out and accepted it, tucking it in her bodice. Nobody would find it there. This once, she wrote. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll begin work on the transformational.\u201d Leaning down, she wrote, I want to meet with Mercury.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville nodded shortly. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can arrange.\u201d He let her get almost to the door before he added, \u201cIt was good to meet the source of your inspiration, Lena. But I would urge caution. The blue bloods aren\u2019t the only danger to a young woman these days.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, thank you, Mr. Mandeville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I suppose you think you do.\u201d</p><p>Will strode into the warren with his hands shoved into his pockets. If he had them free he thought he just might throttle her. Two seconds more and she would have fallen, crushed beneath the iron hooves of the Trojan cavalry. Cold caught in his chest. A horrible breathless feeling he didn\u2019t recognize. Best not to think of it.</p><p>Behind him the footman helped the fat old lady as she huffed and complained up the stairs. Lena suggested quietly that Henry take Mrs. Wade to the kitchen for a good, stiffening drink. From the sounds of the gibberish she\u2019d been uttering for the last half hour, Will suspected she might need most of the bottle.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lena sighed, standing beside him at the top of the stairs and watching her companion being led away. \u201cAt least she waited until after the mayhem to succumb to hysteria.\u201d</p><p>The delicious scent of her soap rose off her warm skin. If only she\u2019d use something else for once. He\u2019d come to associate that smell with Lena and even a hint of it in the air made his cock rouse.</p><p>Her skirts brushed his shins as she peered down the hallway. \u201cWhere would you like to begin the lesson? Blade\u2019s parlor?\u201d</p><p>The ground floor of the warren was a mess of dust and cobwebs, with creaking floorboards and peeling wallpaper. There was nothing to see down here. Nothing of any value. A deterrent to thieves and anyone who might be reporting back to the Echelon. Upstairs, however, was an entirely different abode. Luxurious carpets and fine paintings, the scent of beeswax in the air and most of the rooms warmed with ornate fireplaces. Very few people were trusted enough to see the upstairs section.</p><p>Will nodded gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch some tea and cakes.\u201d She gave him a look. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>He was always hungry. The anger and fear in him only burned through more of his body\u2019s fuel. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring something of more substance then.\u201d</p><p>As she sashayed toward the kitchen, he opened the parlor door. Cool air brushed against his face. The fires hadn\u2019t been lit for some time. Blade preferred to sit in Honoria\u2019s laboratory upstairs these days.</p><p>The cold barely affected him, but Lena liked to sit in front of a good, toasty fire. In various ways she was rather catlike. He\u2019d watched her curl up on the rug many a time, tinkering with the pieces of a broken clock. The inner workings of such gadgets were beyond him, but Lena managed to fit them together as if they were naught more than a child\u2019s puzzle.</p><p>By the time he had a healthy blaze crackling in the hearth she\u2019d returned. He heard the swish of skirts from down the hall, and the scent of hot roast beef filled the air. Saliva flooded his mouth and he intercepted her at the door, his gaze intent on the heavy tray in her hands.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he muttered, taking it from her.</p><p>Lena\u2019s gaze strayed to the fire. She crossed to it, holding out her pale hands. \u201cMrs. Wade is recovering. She claims she\u2019ll be along in a moment.\u201d A wry twist of the lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think she trusts you alone with my maidenly sensibilities.\u201d</p><p>Warmth crinkled the edges of her eyes. Will slowly put the tray on a small reading table. A smarter woman than he\u2019d given her credit for, Mrs. Wade.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked. The scent of beef drew him to the tray. Will lifted the lid and examined the plate. Esme\u2019s roasted beef with gallons of gravy and thick bread and drippings.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>He balanced the plate on his lap and ate with relish. Far better fare than he was used to these days.</p><p>Lena took her seat opposite him, sweeping her skirts to the side. She poured them both tea then fetched a plate of spice cake for herself. Though her soft hum mingled with the comforting chink of silverware, a hint of tension rode the air, heavy as silence. Lena\u2019s lashes fluttered against her cheeks as she stole a glance at him, then looked swiftly away.</p><p>It had been like this for a year. Ever since that day she\u2019d crawled onto his lap, fluttered her lashes at him, and then pressed her lips against his.</p><p>Right there, on that bloody sofa beside them.</p><p>He glared at the embroidered cushions. His first kiss and it had been a bloody fiasco from start to finish. Once the shock of it had pierced his brain, he hadn\u2019t been able to get away fast enough. Her lips, like silk against his, wet and lush. Then the dart of her tongue as she licked at him, daring him to kiss her back. Somehow his fist had clenched in her skirts. The other hand was half-lifted, about to capture the back of her neck and tug her closer before he even realized what was happening.</p><p>Then he was on his feet, Lena tumbling back onto the cushions, her eyes wide and startled and her green skirts spilling around her. A glimpse of her ankles, the stockinged calves tempting him to explore further. Little hammer-strikes of vision flashing at him. Moments of movement where he wasn\u2019t even aware of having done it.</p><p>Dangerous. He\u2019d only ever lost control\u2014lost time\u2014once. That she could do it to him so easily frightened him more than an entire army of metaljackets.</p><p>If he lost control, if he hurt her, if he infected her...he\u2019d never forgive himself.</p><p>\u201cFirst lesson,\u201d she said, her soft voice intruding into his thoughts, \u201cis that a gentleman doesn\u2019t stare at a lady quite so...so boldly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heat spilled through her cheeks as his vision came into focus. He had been staring at her. Like a desperate fool. Remembering that kiss. Remembering the taste of her mouth.</p><p>Looking down, he stabbed a piece of beef with his fork. \u201cHow\u2019s your friend?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe blond girl.\u201d</p><p>Lena broke off a tiny piece of cake with her fork. \u201cAdele? I called on her this morning. Her parents have put about word that\u2019s she\u2019s taken ill\u2014at least until the mark fades.\u201d</p> <p>A blue blood\u2019s saliva hastened the healing process, but he\u2019d seen enough scars in his time to know they didn\u2019t always vanish completely. Indeed, if he weren\u2019t verwulfen, his own throat would look like a train track.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think it will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took her some salve. Something Leo uses for his thralls.\u201d Fidgeting with her fork, she asked, \u201cDo you think Cavendish will keep his mouth shut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will if he wants to keep breathin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t simply go around threatening blue bloods, Will. It might work here in the rookery, but you\u2019ll be in their world and you must learn to play by their rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d He put his empty plate aside and leaned back in his chair, sinking into the soft upholstery.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point. Of course I enjoyed seeing him get his just deserts. The man\u2019s a bully and a toady. He ambushes young women in secluded corners and forces himself on them. There\u2019s no ruin to him or his reputation.\u201d Her face darkened. \u201cOnly to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s cheeks paled. \u201cA poor choice of words. I meant the young women of the Echelon. He\u2019s never made any overt threat against me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he does, you\u2019ll tell me?\u201d</p><p>Lena looked him directly in the eye. And lied. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLena,\u201d he warned, finding his feet.</p><p>She fetched her teacup and nervously put it between them. \u201cI\u2019m not the one he\u2019ll retaliate against. You made a fool of him last night, Will. He won\u2019t forget that. Promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, he rested his hands on the armrest on either side of her. Lena\u2019s lips firmed and she rested her teacup in her lap.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to distract me,\u201d he said, reaching out and capturing her chin between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>A mistake. Lena\u2019s skin was silky soft, and the slight parting of her lips as she looked up nearly undid him. Her eyes softened, the breath catching in her lungs. For all her devil-may-care attitude, in that moment her expression was oddly guileless. Hesitant. Uncertain of herself.</p><p>The hint of vulnerability nearly undid him.</p><p>Will jerked his hand back as if scalded and turned away, the breath in him coming hard. \u201cIf he threatens you, you\u2019ll tell me?\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s gaze dropped to her lap. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>What the devil was wrong with her now? \u201cYou ain\u2019t afraid of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle men like Cavendish.\u201d Putting the teacup aside, she muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s certain other ones that give me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A frown drew her eyebrows together. \u201cWhy would you mention him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe scares you,\u201d Will admitted, his voice lowering. \u201cDo you want me to kill him for you?\u201d</p><p>She surged to her feet. \u201cAre you insane? He\u2019s a duke! Even if you could get to him, the Echelon would destroy you.\u201d Those wide brown eyes met his and then she grabbed his wrist. \u201cWill, promise you won\u2019t do anything of the sort! Promise you won\u2019t go after Colchester.\u201d</p><p>The scent of fear was back. But this time she wasn\u2019t afraid for herself.</p><p>Will rubbed at the back of his neck, eyeing her hand warily. Nobody had ever given a damn about him before. Apart from Blade. \u201cI don\u2019t let nobody touch what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle Colchester,\u201d she stressed.</p><p>The tiny hint of doubt in her voice made his hackles rise. \u201cHow? By smilin\u2019? By flirtin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy playing the game! By hiding in plain sight and not letting him get me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and what\u2019ll you do if he does get you alone?\u201d</p><p>She had nothing to say to that.</p><p>Will drew her up against him. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are...ways.\u201d Her hands rested against his abdomen, trying to restrain him. \u201cLet me go, Will. This is unseemly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind o\u2019 \u2018ways\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Lena glared at him. \u201cI submit. All he wants is blood. It costs me nothing. He can\u2019t afford to take too much and have me die. I\u2019m not...not just some poor, unprotected coal lass.\u201d</p><p>The words pierced him like a knife. White-hot fury seared his brain, the world narrowing in around him until all he saw was Lena\u2019s frightened face. \u201cLike hell you will.\u201d</p><p>Lena flinched as his hands tightened unconsciously. \u201cStop it, Will. Let me go!\u201d</p><p>A gasp from the doorway caught his attention. Mrs. Wade stood there, her black skirts enveloping her like the sail from a ship. \u201cI leave you alone for five minutes and this is what happens! Sir, you will remove your hands at once.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even heard her coming.</p><p>Whatever expression was on his face, Lena whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned mulish, completely unafraid of him. It was that that earned Mrs. Wade a reprieve. Few people ever saw a man when they looked at him. Only a monster. He couldn\u2019t sully his image in Lena\u2019s eyes. Couldn\u2019t act like the beast the world thought him.</p><p>Eyes shuttering, he opened his hands and she stepped back with a sharp little intake of breath, rubbing at her arms.</p><p>Will caught her skirt, leaned close. He wasn\u2019t finished by half. \u201cIf he makes so much as a single move in your direction I\u2019ll kill him, Lena. I\u2019ll bury \u2019im so deep, won\u2019t nobody ever find \u2019im. So either you find a way to stop him. Or I will.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Five days later, Lena popped a cherry in her mouth and nibbled on it, watching as Will paced the room. He\u2019d spent the morning being fitted for a new wardrobe with Leo. Though she was in charge of introducing him to the Echelon, there were some events she wasn\u2019t allowed to oversee.</p><p>A pity, she thought, running her gaze across his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBack straight,\u201d she called, as she lounged on the daybed in Leo\u2019s sitting room. \u201cDo try and walk as if you\u2019re out for a stroll, rather than stalking some footpad through the alleys.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny his grace of movement was appealing, but there was something dangerous about the way he moved. Even when he was still, he looked ready to pounce.</p><p>Will shot her a dark look. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna mince around like one of them puff-shirted vultures. No matter how many times you make me do this.\u201d</p><p>Lena sat up. This was the fourth lesson they\u2019d had and he was fighting her at every turn. The problem wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t do this; the problem was that he didn\u2019t give a damn about the rules of etiquette. \u201cOnce more,\u201d she said, daring him to disobey.</p><p>Will crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never do. The point is that I told you to do it. And you agreed to obey me. I know this world. You don\u2019t. And right now, you look like some rookery bruiser prepared to smash someone\u2019s head in.\u201d</p><p>Visibly grinding his teeth together, he turned and stalked back toward the window.</p><p>Lena clapped a hand to her eyes, restraining herself from a sigh. This was going to be a long afternoon. \u201cTell me, how many sources of power are there in the Echelon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council o\u2019 Dukes make all the decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who sits on the Council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe seven heads o\u2019 the great Houses and the prince consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can overrule their vote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnic\u2019ly the queen, through Right of Regency,\u201d he retorted, turning on his heel with a flourish that almost reminded her of Blade. \u201cThough she speaks with the prince consort\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><p>The words could have been her own. Despite his lack of education, Will could parrot things back at her verbatim.</p><p>\u201cHow do you remember all of this?\u201d So far he hadn\u2019t missed a single question, though when she lectured him on the power plays of the Echelon she\u2019d been certain he was paying her no mind.</p><p>\u201cBlade taught me. We don\u2019t write things down in the warren. So we gotta remember it all. Who owes us some tin, how much, who\u2019s paid, street addresses, names, who\u2019s been beatin\u2019 his moll up...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAin\u2019t hard.\u201d</p><p>Will sauntered back toward her. He\u2019d stripped his coat off, as he often did when he was indoors. A gray tweed waistcoat sculpted the broad planes of his chest and he\u2019d rolled his sleeves up again. On the inside of his wrist was a tattoo of a pair of crossed daggers. Blade\u2019s mark. A tattoo all of his Reaver\u2019s gang wore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to stop doing that,\u201d she noted. \u201cSleeves remain down.\u201d And coat remains on. But she was enjoying the view enough not to mention it. Taking another cherry, she twirled the stem off it and slid it between her lips.</p><p>His gaze lingered on her mouth. \u201cWhat next? We\u2019ve covered bowin\u2019 and scrapin\u2019, mincin\u2019 about, who I need to be wary of, who holds the power, who doesn\u2019t, what I oughta wear...\u201d</p><p>Lena bit through the plump, juicy flesh and swallowed. \u201cDancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot more dancin\u2019.\u201d He knelt on the edge of the daybed and reached for one of the cherries. \u201cWe\u2019ve already done that.\u201d</p><p>With Mrs. Wade watching on like a disapproving mama. Now that they were alone... \u201cDefinitely more dancing.\u201d</p><p>Tugging out a pair of cherries, he leaned forward, dangling them over her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re doin\u2019 this to torture me.\u201d</p><p>Lena bit into one of them and tugged it free with her teeth. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Lifting the other to his own mouth, he chewed in a considering manner. \u201cLater,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this prancin\u2019 about\u2019s borin\u2019 me and I ain\u2019t been to sleep yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry my company\u2019s wearying you.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back on his hand, he slid her feet up so he could sit properly. He did look tired, the scrape of his stubble shadowing his jaw and his eyes darker than usual. \u201cIt ain\u2019t your company. Last night someone decided to torch a shop Blade\u2019s offered his protection to. Had to find \u2019em. Some drunk fool who nearly shat himself when he saw us. So gin-soaked he hadn\u2019t even seen the pair of crossed daggers carved into the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, sitting up. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll save the dancing for later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more lecturin\u2019 either.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s lips firmed. \u201cNo dancing. No instruction. Perhaps you\u2019d find a demonstration better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>With a little smile, she shifted to her knees. The door remained open and every so often Mrs. Wade popped her head in, but for the moment they were alone. And she felt like teaching him a lesson about finding her company wearying.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHow does a woman demonstrate her availability as a potential thrall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t the foggiest.\u201d</p><p>Dragging her skirts behind her, Lena stood and crossed to the cherry bowl, adding an extra little swish to her stride. Picking up the gilded bowl, she settled beside him, her emerald skirts brushing his thighs. It was finer than what she usually wore for day dress, but he would never know that.</p><p>Will tensed. She\u2019d never before realized how much coiled power his muscular frame held, but it was almost vibrating off him.</p><p>\u201cShe wears white, to begin with,\u201d Lena said, tugging another cherry out of the bowl. \u201cBut only during the evening, for it\u2019s considered pass\u00e9 during the day. Cherry?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as she lifted it to his lips. For a moment she wasn\u2019t sure he would take it from her, but then he reached out and bit into the sweet fruit, vibrant red juice coloring his lips.</p><p>\u201cWould you do this?\u201d he asked thickly. \u201cFor a blue blood?\u201d</p><p>Lena glanced up from beneath her lashes. Then licked the spilled juice from her fingers. \u201cThey\u2019d consider me fast. That\u2019s a dangerous reputation for a debutante.\u201d</p><p>His lashes lowered, shuttering those beautiful eyes. \u201cSo this is a game you\u2019re playin\u2019? With me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all games,\u201d she replied, giving a little shrug. Watching the color of his eyes change, she lifted another cherry toward his lips. \u201cI\u2019m not putting you to sleep, am I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will caught her wrist. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Taking the cherry from her trapped hand, she bit into it. \u201cGood.\u201d Leaning closer, she gestured to her throat, trailing her fingers lightly across the skin there. \u201cThere are certain points on a woman\u2019s body that she reveals if she\u2019s shopping for a patron. Covering them means she\u2019s not interested.</p><p>\u201cThe throat, for example.\u201d Arching her neck, she presented the smooth skin to him with languid grace. \u201cNo debutante wears a necklace or choker unless she\u2019s in the process of signing a contract.\u201d</p> <p>Will\u2019s pupils flared, his gaze dropping over her throat and lower, to her collarbone and the upthrust of her breasts. The gown was daring, even for her. The type of thing she\u2019d only wear for him.</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d The words were soft, but they buffeted her skin, raised a shiver.</p><p>His eyes were a dare.</p><p>Leaning closer, she presented the interior of her wrist to him. The soft creamy skin, veins pulsing blue beneath it. \u201cHere.\u201d Their eyes met. \u201cDo you remember how you greet a woman?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand by reflex, but she kept her wrist presented up, toward him. Will stilled, uncertainty tightening the hard planes of his face.</p> <p>\u201cYou press your lips to the back of her hand,\u201d she whispered, lifting her wrist toward him. \u201cFor a woman to signify her interest, she presents her wrist instead.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered, his lips brushing against the delicate inner skin of her wrist. A cool caress. Barely a ghost of sensation. The prickle of his stubble rasped through her, her nipples pressing hard against the stiff black lace of her corset. Lena pressed her tongue against her teeth to stifle a gasp.</p><p>\u201cIf a blue blood is interested, he lingers,\u201d she murmured. \u201cPerhaps a trace of his tongue.\u201d</p><p>Will lowered his head again, his eyes watching her. Lena\u2019s lips parted as his mouth covered her wrist, suckling the soft flesh. The wet rasp of his tongue seemed to touch her deep inside and she pressed her thighs together, feeling it there, feeling the chafe of her drawers.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she whispered, \u201cis rather provocative for a blue blood.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s mouth broke from her skin, his warm breath cooling the wetness. Lena\u2019s heart thundered behind the constriction of her corset. What was he doing to her? How had he turned the tables so deftly? She couldn\u2019t bear it.</p> <p>His hand was warm on hers, a blaze of welcoming heat. A considering look entered his eyes. \u201cHow often do you present your wrist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She shifted.</p><p>The amber in his irises flared. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>The possessive quality of his voice thrilled her. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d His grasp on her hand tightened.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI was young and Lord Ramsay was handsome. I learned my lesson, however. I\u2019ve not offered it since. Not until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you interested in?\u201d Lena leaned forward, knowing that her bodice gaped and her curls tumbled around her face.</p> <p>A long breathless moment. Will leaned toward her unconsciously, as if some invisible force drew him. Reaching out, he brushed the backs of his fingers against her bodice, lightly stroking the silk as if memorizing the texture. The touch sparked through her and she leaned against it, forcing his hand against her aching nipples. That was where she wanted to be touched. There.</p><p>Every little hair on her body stiffened. A sudden yearning sprang to life, a desperate need to have his hands on her. Lena leaned forward, her hand sliding over his thigh, feeling the corded power in the bunched muscles, her face tilting toward his...</p><p>Opening his mouth, Will tried to say something, but the words died in a harsh growl. \u201cDamn it, Lena.\u201d His gaze skittered away. He pushed her firmly away and sat back, arms spread over the back of the daybed. \u201cLearnin\u2019 how to do what I\u2019m here for. That\u2019s what interests me.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she\u2019d lost him. Confusion and frustration yawned like a gaping pit within her. Unfulfilled need. She\u2019d never had any trouble wrapping men around her fingers, but Will constantly defied her.</p><p>She could barely breathe. Gave it one last attempt. \u201cOf course, as with the throat, a covered wrist has different meanings also.\u201d Gesturing to her gloves on the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice I wear full-length for evening or gloves that cover my wrists quite decently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She shot him a glance, but his expression was flat, unreadable. He leaned his elbows on his knees and glared stonily at her.</p><p>\u201cA lady wearing half gloves is another matter. It bares the wrist to a blue blood\u2019s lips. A sure sign that she\u2019s available, perhaps even a little fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bare wrists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Only a patron sees a woman with bare wrists. It\u2019s considered highly personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said yourself you\u2019re not interested in my blood.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened. Lena leaned against the back of the daybed, her fingers toying with his sleeve. \u201cYou might be more interested in the distinction between blood rights and rights of the flesh,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>The muscles in his arm coiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman offers her blood rights to her patron when she becomes his thrall in exchange for protection and provision. Her flesh rights are another matter. That\u2019s one of the mistakes the middle class makes. They assume a patron may take his thrall to bed as well as drink from her body.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s gaze shot to hers.</p><p>\u201cNot unless she agrees,\u201d she added softly, knowing she was treading dangerous ground. \u201cHer flesh rights are hers to give freely. Perhaps this is more to your area of interest?\u201d Leaning closer, she licked her lips, watched his gaze drop to them. \u201cDo you crave flesh, Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you offerin\u2019 it?\u201d His voice was harsh. \u201cCause we\u2019ve a word for that, where I come from.\u201d Jerking away from her, he found his feet as if hunted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re confusing the two,\u201d she replied. \u201cFlesh rights are given freely. For nothing more than the cost of pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Hot color burnished Will\u2019s cheeks. He shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cAnd how does a patron know if they\u2019re bein\u2019 offered?\u201d</p><p>Lena arched a brow. Stroked her finger across the smooth arch of her collarbone. \u201cHe finds her naked in his bed.\u201d</p><p>The bold statement drew a hiss from him. For a moment she was wondering if he pictured it. The way she was. The thought sent a thrill through her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not generally spoken of,\u201d Lena continued, \u201cbut as well as lessons in etiquette and sewing and music, a young woman is often...given hints...in how to please a man, should she decide to offer him her flesh rights.\u201d</p><p>Not that she\u2019d learned much before her father was murdered and she was dragged to Whitechapel. But he didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure you shouldn\u2019t be speakin\u2019 o\u2019 this with a man who ain\u2019t your patron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Another shrug, displaying the smooth creamy skin of her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore games,\u201d he said in disgust. Hands clasped behind him, he paced the small rug in front of her. \u201cPerhaps you need a lesson in what a man\u2019d do in my world, were a women so bold with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d It was a statement, not a challenge. She knew how far she could push him. Knew he\u2019d back away the moment she turned the game sexual.</p><p>Will turned around. Met her gaze. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, resting his knuckles on either side of her hips. One knee pressed between her legs, parting her thighs and pinning her skirts. Lena froze as he reached out and captured a lock of the dark hair that tumbled over her shoulder. \u201cAll these games you play... I wonder what you\u2019d do if I played \u2019em back?\u201d</p><p>Excitement raced through her veins. He\u2019d never flirted back before. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m getting under your skin?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOn me nerves, more like it.\u201d His fingers gently rubbed her hair. Then sank into the pile of curls prettily knotted at the base of her nape. It drew a gasp from her lips as he tilted her face toward his. Their breath mingled. Uncomfortably close.</p><p>And Lena was aware that she was pinned, trapped neatly beneath him. Catching a handful of his shirt, she stared up at him. His gaze was hard, almost cruel. Suddenly she didn\u2019t like this game anymore.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Ain\u2019t this what you want? Me hands on your body? Ain\u2019t that what you been playin\u2019 at this last hour? Or have I pushed the boundaries? Either say what you mean, Lena. Or I\u2019ll take this little game of yours where you don\u2019t mean to take it.\u201d</p><p>One word. Yes. One word and he\u2019d do it. But as she met the steely look in those extraordinary eyes, she realized he wasn\u2019t playing. When had this become more than a game? More than a light flirtation?</p><p>I\u2019ll stake a hundred pounds that you\u2019re wrong, Adele\u2019s voice whispered in her head. That he\u2019ll kiss you next time.</p><p>Yes? Or no? Lena\u2019s heart hammered in her chest. She\u2019d kissed him once. A game, nothing more. But his message now was very clear. Will wouldn\u2019t stand for any more games. And a part of her was afraid to play for real.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t that brave. Because if it meant nothing to him, if he used her and then discarded her without a care, she suddenly realized that it would matter. To her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Will\u2019s gaze shuttered. \u201cNo more of this then. I\u2019ve had enough games. Enough of these lessons for the day. Most of it\u2019s useless anyway.\u201d He let her go and straightened.</p><p>That drew her ire. She still felt shaky, surreal. As if the world had turned on its axis and she couldn\u2019t quite keep up. \u201cIt\u2019s not useless. I\u2019m trying to help you, yet you don\u2019t give a damn about anything I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Echelon ain\u2019t gonna accept me anyway. They want a beast, and I\u2019ll give \u2019em one.\u201d A derisive look as he unrolled his sleeves.</p><p>Lena struggled to sit up. Her skirts were awry. So too her emotions. Will had taken their little game and turned it on its head. He\u2019d never dared respond before. Years of pricking at him, needling him whilst he ignored her... She\u2019d thought that was the worst he could do\u2014to pretend she didn\u2019t exist\u2014but it wasn\u2019t. The worst thing he could do was play back, to utterly destroy her defenses and then stand here unrolling his sleeves as though the moment hadn\u2019t bothered him half as much as her.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no point to these lessons,\u201d she found herself saying. Amazing how her voice barely trembled.</p><p>Will froze, halfway through one sleeve.</p><p>\u201cNo point,\u201d she whispered, \u201cand therefore no reason for you to continue coming here. Or escorting me in society.\u201d</p><p>She could see the thought churning in his eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll continue with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I waste my time?\u201d She managed to gather herself to her feet, resettling her skirts and smoothing her bodice. A swift glance in the mirror showed her hair tumbling free of its pins. She fixed them ruthlessly, feeling his eyes on her.</p><p>Her skin pricked. Damn him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t listen to anything I say, you deride all of the rules of society and mock my efforts,\u201d she continued, trying to ignore the feeling. Her skin still felt too small, itchy. \u201cDo you know the worst thing, Will? The worst thing is that they see you as a beast and you let them.\u201d She turned then, met his gaze. \u201cYou do everything in your power to live up to the image, the reputation, and then you scorn them for sneering down at you.\u201d</p><p>Heat flared in his gaze. He took a step toward her. \u201cThat reputation might be all as keeps us safe,\u201d he snarled. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m verwulfen. They ain\u2019t ever gonna see me as anythin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither will you!\u201d</p><p>The outburst shocked both of them. Lena let out her breath, staring at him defiantly. \u201cYou call yourself a beast, Will, because you believe it. A part of you thinks you\u2019re nothing better than what they claim.\u201d Taking a shuddery breath, she continued. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting me at every step of these lessons because you hate the Echelon, but I\u2019m not only trying to help you learn to fit in, I\u2019m trying to show you another way to live.\u201d</p><p>Silence quivered in the air between them. Will stared at her in shock, instead of anger. Encouraged, Lena took a step toward him.</p><p>\u201cTake my lessons,\u201d she whispered. \u201cUse them to be who you want to be. Force the Echelon to look you in the eye. Dare them to treat you as a man. A dangerous man, if need be, but not...not an animal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked away, as if the truth of her words had struck him a blow. Then his eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd what of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you treat me?\u201d</p> <p>Lena shook her head, her mouth working silently. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened. \u201cYou know what they\u2019ll say. What they\u2019ll think when they see you with me. Will you play along? Will you laugh behind your hand with \u2019em, to assure your own place in their world ain\u2019t at risk? Or will you risk their censure? Risk everythin\u2019 to prove the worth of your words? For there\u2019ll be a cost to this, you mark me words. And you\u2019ll be the one as pays it.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, the nearness of his body unnerving her. Not once had she thought of the cost to herself of squiring him about. To be seen with him, with a verwulfen, was tantamount to social suicide.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThought so.\u201d Reaching out he cupped her cheek, turning her face up toward his. \u201cYou can play games with me, Lena, because here, no one can see. Well, I\u2019m tired of bein\u2019 your little toy. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe I am lettin\u2019 others dictate how I see meself. But for all your brave words, so do you.\u201d</p><p>The words were a blow. For all her hatred of the Echelon, she\u2019d conformed to their rules as surely as he had. She\u2019d let them define who she was. What she thought. What she dared to do.</p> <p>Her very own cage.</p><p>Will let her face go then stepped back. \u201cYou never thought of it, did you?\u201d His lips curled in a bitter smile and he grabbed his coat off the table, slinging it over his shoulder. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you at the official presentation.\u201d With a short nod in her direction, he started for the door. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see if your words are worth anythin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Two days later, Will leaned against a brick wall, examining the enormous white tower that speared halfway to the heavens. The alabaster marble gleamed even in the dismal afternoon rain, an ever-present reminder of the power of the Echelon. Tomorrow night they\u2019d host the official presentation ball there, once the Scandinavian delegate arrived. He\u2019d be required to put on his best manners and charm, try to entice the Scandinavians into signing the treaty. A Herculean task that made his palms wet.</p><p>What if he failed?</p><p>He\u2019d never realized how much a part of him longed for the respectability of being a free man. No price on his head, able to come and go as he pleased without watching over his shoulder. Able to do anything he wanted...be anything he wanted...without resigning himself to the fact that he was just hired muscle.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to think of it much, but Lena\u2019s words the other day were chasing around and around inside his head. He owed Blade the world, but a part of him chafed at the constrictiveness of his life. Something hungry and yearning lurked inside his heart and he didn\u2019t know what it was or how to fix it.</p> <p>His eyes narrowed as a gilded steam carriage pulled up in front of the tower gates, thick coal smoke shooting from its exhaust. He\u2019d tracked it from Mayfair, where he\u2019d been keeping watch over Barrons\u2019s mansion all morning. The rain helped hide him and the footmen never looked around. Fools all. It just served to prove how easily Colchester could get at her if he wanted.</p><p>A footman opened the door and a slender hand appeared, resting on the footman\u2019s. Skirts the color of crushed rose petals swept into view, then Lena alighted, peering up at the tower nervously.</p><p>The sight of her never failed to take his breath. Suddenly the unknown need, the hunger within him, had a name and face.</p><p>And that troubled him more than the entire Echelon combined.</p><p>You can\u2019t have her.</p><p>She was human and he verwulfen. He could never be in her bed without risking her life, risking infecting her with the loupe. Something he shouldn\u2019t have to remind himself of.</p><p>With a scowl Will crossed his arms over his chest and settled in to wait. He couldn\u2019t guard her within the Ivory Tower and that made the skin on the back of his neck rise. He would just have to trust that Lena would be safe.</p><p>The alternative was unthinkable.</p> <p>Lena glanced over her shoulder as she stroked the raven\u2019s glossy feather. The rookery at the top of Crowe Tower was full of squawking cages the Echelon had once used to send messages. Now, with the invention of pneumatic tubes and radio frequency, there was no need for them, but the ravens were tradition. To not see them circling the very tip of the tower would seem strange indeed.</p><p>And people still used them occasionally. It had become fashionable for blue bloods and young debutantes to send each other secret messages. To get a raven meant considerably more than flowers these days.</p><p>Finding the ugly old bird she knew and recognized, she slipped open its cage and coaxed it onto her wrist. Not always as accurate as a homing pigeon, if a crow was trained properly it could find the house it had been bred in. Then a servant would return it to the tower for its next message.</p><p>There was no coat of arms bound to this crow\u2019s cage; she had no way of knowing who it belonged to.</p><p>A steel thong bound its left leg, so she slipped the small leather-bound tube out of her cleavage and secured it tightly. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to send the message Mr. Mandeville had given her yet. Too many visits to the rookery might just arouse suspicion and it had taken days of deliberation before she\u2019d decided to send it at all.</p><p>This was the last one until she could speak to Mercury.</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, she carried it to the open clock that dominated the room. The heavy bronze clock face at the top of the tower drew all eyes, cold wind streaming in through its open facets. The steady tick of the second hand slid past her face as she lifted the raven and bid it into the air.</p><p>The Ivory Tower soared in front of her. Crowe Tower was one of four smaller towers that surrounded the massive keep. Her raven spiraled up, circling the gleaming white tower before vanishing over a nearby abandoned cathedral.</p><p>Her duty done, Lena turned for the stairs, gliding between the wooden cages. She\u2019d tried to track the raven once with a spyglass but knew only that it headed west a little distance before spiraling down.</p><p>Mayfair or Kensington, she suspected.</p><p>Which meant her contact was highly entrenched in the Echelon. A servant perhaps? Even a highly placed thrall? Someone with access to the Echelon\u2019s secrets. From the information they passed on, they almost had to be close to the Council of Dukes itself.</p><p>In the next day or two an answering raven would scratch at her window with a note to deliver to Mandeville. Leo presumed she had a beau.</p><p>Closing the heavy timber door to the rookery, she latched it, then turned. A flash of black silk swept across her vision and someone yanked her back against their body, the sharp edge of a knife pressing lightly against her carotid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d came the hoarse whisper.</p><p>Lena froze, her heart leaping into her throat. Had someone followed her? Did they know what she\u2019d just sent?</p><p>\u201cWhat face does death wear?\u201d It could have been male or female, she couldn\u2019t tell. But she recognized the words. A sign of another humanist.</p><p>\u201cA pale one,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The knife edge eased. But didn\u2019t vanish.</p><p>\u201cThe Scandinavian delegation arrives tomorrow,\u201d the voice said. \u201cI want you to destroy any chance that they\u2019ll sign the treaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m done with this. I\u2019ve spoken to Mandeville.\u201d</p><p>The knife edge tightened and Lena arched back, swallowing hard. Whoever held her was taller than her, but not overwhelmingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done with this when Mercury says you are.\u201d Cold voice, cruel hands.</p><p>Lena sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cAre you Mercury?\u201d</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. \u201cI pass along Mercury\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I stop the treaty? I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Beast,\u201d the voice whispered. \u201cUse him.\u201d</p><p>Lena ground her teeth together. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The sharp retort echoed in the stone corridor. The hand around her waist slid away. \u201cPerhaps this will change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Something metal and angular was shoved into her hand. Lena lifted it just enough to see, her heart stuttering when she realized what it was.</p><p>One of Charlie\u2019s clockwork soldiers. She\u2019d made it herself. The last time she\u2019d seen it, it had been on his shelf.</p><p>In his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cDestroy the treaty.\u201d The whisper was harsh. \u201cOr else I\u2019ll take more than his toys.\u201d</p><p>Then the pressure vanished from her throat and she staggered forward as liquid footsteps darted away down the corridor.</p><p>The only glimpse she caught of the humanist was of a black, swirling cape. But one thing caught her attention; no human could move that quickly.</p><p>It had been a blue blood.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>The air along the southern docks was redolent with perfume. It couldn\u2019t quite disguise the earthy flavor of the Thames, slightly riper now that it was summer. Here and there, ladies bought scented pomander bags to their noses and some had even stitched them into their fans.</p><p>Metaljackets lined the platform that had been erected along the docks, each standing at strict attention, the blue illumination in their eye slits dulled to a neutral glow. Gaslight flickered over their burnished gold breastplates; the Imperial squadron was comprised of only two hundred automatons, but they were impressive. Used mainly for ceremonial purposes, circular throwing blades attached to their arms made them highly dangerous as well.</p><p>Nervousness raced along Lena\u2019s skin. The enthusiasm of the crowd was contagious, but Lena couldn\u2019t quite summon a smile. Most of the Echelon was in attendance, dressed in glittering jewels and bright silks. Any one of them could have been the blue blood in the tower.</p><p>A hand pressed against her spine, a cool whisper brushing across her ear. \u201cRelax. He\u2019s not going to attempt anything here. Not if he wants to keep breathing, anyway.\u201d Leo stepped up beside her, his hand warm on the curve of her back.</p><p>Colchester. She\u2019d almost forgotten about him.</p><p>\u201cI know. Not here. Not in public view, anyway.\u201d She glanced to the side. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard nothing of...of Will?\u201d</p><p>It had been three days. Leo had had Will\u2019s wardrobe delivered, but he\u2019d only sent her a note saying that he was busy with something. Their words the other day had touched a nerve. For both of them. Lena had busied herself with the transformational clockwork, trying not to think of him.</p><p>Easier said than done. It didn\u2019t matter that she was only dealing with the internal cogs and gears at this stage; sooner or later she would begin to solder the iron sheeting of the exterior into place, forming the roughened physique of her clockwork warrior. Even in clockwork\u2014the one place she\u2019d always been able to switch off her busy mind and simply put together the puzzle pieces\u2014she couldn\u2019t escape him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here.\u201d A statement, not a question. Leo\u2019s dark gaze raked the crowd of gaudily dressed blue bloods. \u201cI\u2019ll have to join the Council when the Scandinavians arrive. But I won\u2019t leave you unattended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Leo searched her gaze. Then nodded. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll keep an eye on you from the platform.\u201d</p><p>Above the river, the sky suddenly exploded. Gasps flavored the air and people cheered.</p><p>A pinwheel of whirling pinks and blues tore through the velvety sky, punctuated by the scream of rockets. An orange fireball bloomed, destroying Lena\u2019s night vision.</p><p>\u201cHere they come,\u201d Leo murmured. \u201cI\u2019d best be off.\u201d</p><p>As Lena blinked, a hint of a dark outline showed on the river. It glided across the oily waters, as sleek and sure as a serpent. The laughter and cheering died to a hushed whisper as the dragon-ship appeared. The only sound was the whine of the fireworks launching.</p><p>Almost two hundred feet long, it faintly resembled the longboats of its ancestors. A sinuous serpent head served as a figurehead, and enormous canvas wings were tucked in tight against its sides. The metal hull gleamed with gold paint, and jeweled shields lined the sides, each gem sparkling in the gaslight.</p><p>Two others flanked it, their helium envelopes deflated and stowed away. They could be used both in the air and on water, and were dangerous on each. Tall warriors lined the decks, clad in dark blue regimentals with gold military frogging down the chest, and helmets with tall black feathers. The gaslight on the docks glittered off the amber shine of their eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at them,\u201d a woman whispered nearby. \u201cHow barbaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am looking,\u201d another woman murmured behind her fan and they both laughed.</p><p>Fireworks exploded with frenetic enthusiasm. The sky was washed with gold and blue and pink. Lena couldn\u2019t help herself. She looked up, her gaze torn from the silent ships on the river. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt his gaze long before she saw him.</p><p>A tingle on her skin.</p><p>The faint, earthy anticipation of her body recognizing danger\u2014even as it thrilled at it.</p> <p>Will.</p><p>Breath catching, her fingers tightening on the fan, she looked down. Blind spots danced in her vision but she hunted for him. The crowd didn\u2019t matter. Nor the approaching ships. Not even Colchester.</p><p>She\u2019d been in a state of agitation all day, unable to settle. Unable to do more than toy with her food or read a paragraph of the Times. His words kept playing through her mind. Then we\u2019ll see if your words are worth anythin\u2019.</p><p>Lena shivered. She could feel him watching her.</p><p>Murmurs started behind her. The crowd shifting. A prickle at the back of her neck. As she turned, fanning at herself in agitation, the crowd parted, skirts swishing out of the way like the Red Sea. For a moment she couldn\u2019t see him. Only a man dressed in crisp black, who stepped into the wake of the crowd with arrogant disdain, striding as if he belonged there.</p> <p>She glanced past the elegant cut of his coat, buttoned strictly up the left side of his breast. And then her gaze shot back to him, her eyes widening.</p><p>Oh, my God...</p><p>Lena actually stopped breathing.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him in anything other than a loose shirt and coat. The sight of him dressed for the evening was utterly devastating. The stark black of his coat drew attention to the dusky gold of his skin, and his hair\u2014the beautiful amber locks that her fingers always itched to touch\u2014was gone.</p><p>The fan stopped moving, the ghostly tips of its feathers dancing over her breasts. Will stepped out of the shadows, gaslight highlighting the stark bones of his cheeks and brow, the burnished bronze of his eyes locked on her with an intensity no bystander could mistake for anything other than interest. Pure, predatory interest.</p><p>He had to stop looking at her like that.</p> <p>Lena turned away with a jerk, frantically sucking in a breath. If they saw the intensity of his gaze, her reputation would be ruined.</p><p>Which was exactly how he predicted she\u2019d react.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. He\u2019d practically dared her to deny her association with him. And though mockery had laced his tone, there\u2019d been a hint of hurt in his eyes.</p><p>As if he knew he\u2019d never be good enough.</p><p>Head bowed, she turned toward him, aware of the malicious eyes watching them. If only he wasn\u2019t standing there silently, waiting for her to make the decision either to cut him or to forever forsake any chance of joining this glittering world.</p><p>But how could the Echelon ever accept him if she didn\u2019t?</p><p>Will offered her his arm, as smoothly as if they\u2019d practiced it a thousand times and not mere dozens. There was a devilish gleam in his eyes. A dare. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Despite her gloves, she could feel the unnatural heat of his body through his sleeve as she accepted. Murmurs started as they strolled toward the platform and the smile on Lena\u2019s lips died.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be up there,\u201d she whispered. Above her, fireworks blazed to life, the shrill scream of the rockets stealing her words.</p><p>Will leaned closer. Now that he was in profile, she could see that his hair had been gathered back into a tight queue, the velvet strands of the ribbon brushing against his nape.</p><p>\u201cI thought you cut your hair,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cYou sound relieved. Thought me hair were unfashionable.\u201d</p><p>Not even a hint that he was as stricken as she. Lena ground her teeth together. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll cut it.\u201d</p><p>At her shocked look, a smile curled at his lips. Her gaze locked onto it. Dangerous. The little tick of her heartbeat fluttered in warning.</p><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d He smoothed a hand over his scalp. \u201cAnnoys me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you want,\u201d she lied, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>The smile he gave her was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d he said, staring up at the platform. There was no sign of the prince consort or the queen, but all seven of the Council waited.</p><p>Will took a deep breath and for the first time, Lena realized he was nervous. She squeezed his arm. \u201cHave you never met others of your kind before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His gaze swept over the river, lingering on the naval officers that lined the deck of the dragon-ship. \u201cSpent most of me life in that cage, then trapped in Whitechapel by the price on me head.\u201d</p><p>Something tightened in her chest. Lena slid her hand into his, hiding it against her skirts. All eyes were on the river. She squeezed his fingers and he looked down, considering it for a moment before he squeezed back.</p><p>\u201cTruce,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruce,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>A breeze stirred her hair as they climbed the stairs, bringing with it the rich, cinnamon scent of Lady Aramina\u2019s perfume. Lena stepped into place beside the duchess and tugged her hand from Will\u2019s.</p><p>Beneath the noise of the fireworks and the murmur of the crowd grew a strange, throbbing hum. A froth of water churned a hundred yards behind the last dragon-ship, and the sleek dark head of something surfaced.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA kraken submergible,\u201d the duchess replied, her brandy-colored eyes intently watching the wave. \u201cThe stealthy killer of the Scandinavian naval forces. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s ever brought down one of our Dreadnoughts.\u201d</p><p>Surprised that the woman had answered, Lena dared ask more, \u201cI thought the Dreadnoughts were invincible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot fight what you cannot see,\u201d the duchess replied. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only in the last minute that you can feel the throb of their propellers coming. Caught alone, even a Dreadnought can be sunk by their steel tentacles.\u201d</p><p>The throb echoed through the air, almost humming against Lena\u2019s skin. She could only imagine the force needed to create such a disturbance.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t usually venture so far from their waters, however,\u201d Aramina mused. \u201cThey must be trying to impress us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d Lena replied, looking at the awed faces in the crowd as the domed metal and glass head of the submergible surged through the water to present itself.</p><p>The first dragon-ship docked. Two of the ship\u2019s crews wore the blue regimentals of the Swedish military, with gold tasseled epaulets. Every one of them was as tall as Will. They moved with a militant efficiency and stood sharply to attention as a trio of officers appeared on the foredeck.</p><p>The final ship trailed with disdainful ease into the docks, edging just a little away from the Swedish vessels. Scarred and grizzled sailors manned the rails, glaring at the crowd. Thick wolf pelts trailed over their shoulders and most of them were heavily bearded.</p><p>The Norwegian clans.</p><p>Behind her the sound of metal boots rang on the cobbles. A carriage wheeled into the square, gleaming with mother-of-pearl inlay, coming to a halt directly before the platform. The Imperial metaljackets created a path, ceremonial rifles slung over their armor-plated shoulders.</p><p>The prince consort leaped out in all his elegant glory and the crowd cheered.</p><p>Lena didn\u2019t know where to look. The world was a conflagration of color as the fireworks went mad. The prince consort opened the carriage door and handed the petite human queen out onto the quay. Behind them the Scandinavians were lining up, an enormous man in a scarlet coat leading them. He stood inches above Will even, and the chiseled contours of his cheeks were softened only by a full mouth.</p><p>Will flinched beside her at each explosion above, his nostrils flaring. Of course. This was all so new to him.</p><p>She tugged at his sleeve. \u201cI assume that man is the leader of the Swedish delegation. Count Stefan Hallestr\u00f8m of Sk\u00e5ld. They call him the War Hammer. Even the Norwegian clans step lightly around him and they\u2019re not afraid of anything.\u201d</p><p>Lazy amber eyes considered her. He was relaxing, which was precisely what she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cThe Norwegians are...tricky,\u201d she replied. \u201cOfficially, the Storting was disbanded and they bend knee to the Swedish Court now. In the capital, most have adapted to the new ways; however, in the old country they\u2019re rather more traditional.\u201d She eyed the band of Norwegians scowling on the docks. \u201cThe man in front is Magnus Ragnarsson, the Fenrir of the Raven Clan. He might wear an eye patch and be older than you and me combined, but he\u2019s considered crafty and his men are murderously loyal. To his right is his son, Eric.\u201d Her eyes widened slightly. She\u2019d heard reports he was handsome, but as the blond warrior smiled, half the ladies in attendance stopped breathing. Fans fluttered like an entire swarm of butterflies. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by his charm. You don\u2019t rise through clan ranks without killing someone along the way. The higher they stand, the more blood they\u2019ve shed. And he\u2019s slated to take over his father\u2019s role one day.\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted this statement. She looked up and found Will watching her through dangerously narrowed eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I need be concerned \u2019bout his charm.\u201d</p><p>Heat rose through her throat and cheeks. She fanned herself rapidly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sighed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems you have a dangerous weakness for verwulfen men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you I do not.\u201d Still, she couldn\u2019t stop her curious gaze from sliding back to the golden figure on the docks, with his silver-leaf chain mail and the heavy ax at his belt. She\u2019d once accused Will of being a barbarian, but here was one in the flesh.</p><p>A Norse god at the least.</p><p>A fanfare sounded and the ranks of Norwegians parted to allow someone through. The verwulfen had won the battle; everyone was craning their necks to see who deserved such a fanfare.</p><p>A young woman stepped through the clans.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lena murmured.</p><p>A hush fell over the crowd. It was well-deserved. Not only was the woman tall and shapely, with a well-formed bosom, but she had the kind of face that could stun a ballroom to silence. A cascade of loose blond waves fell to her waist and a gold circlet sat upon her brow. She wore nothing more than a simple white dress, with a rakish wolf skin thrown over one shoulder, yet she had no need of more. Gold and gems would only have gone unnoticed in the wake of her pillowy lips and glorious bone structure.</p><p>\u201cJaysus.\u201d Will arched a brow.</p><p>A hot little spark burned inside her gut. Lena stepped on his foot and put all her miniscule weight into it. \u201cShut your mouth before you choke on something,\u201d she snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s not that pretty.\u201d</p><p>Aware that he was still watching her, she looked around. The heat of his gaze lingered on her skin and she found herself fanning rather more rapidly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous? I thought this were only a game?\u201d</p><p>The fan slowed. She looked up into the burning intensity of his gaze. The words were lightly said, but the look on his face was anything but. \u201cI\u2019m not. Look at her all you want. I don\u2019t care. But my intention is to make you appear somewhat more than a gaping rookery-bred bumpkin, is it not? You want to impress them?\u201d</p><p>Whilst she wanted to alienate them.</p><p>Her grip on the fan tightened as the bite of guilt filled her. \u201cDon\u2019t stare at me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still the most beautiful woman I ever clapped eyes on.\u201d</p><p>A pitter-patter in her chest. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. As if it meant nothing to him.</p><p>Whilst it meant the world to her.</p><p>A thousand meaningless compliments had tumbled from blue blood lips over her time at court. Words meant to charm and seduce. But Will never said anything he didn\u2019t mean. Something in her chest warmed.</p><p>Then she deflated. If he knew she intended to destroy the treaty, he\u2019d be furious. There would be no more smiles her way, no more compliments. Will would hate her. Lena\u2019s fingers curled around the fan, a rash of heat springing into her eyes. She looked away swiftly, swallowing hard. He could never know. Winning the Scandinavian\u2019s support was not as important as Charlie\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cYou know a great deal about \u2019em,\u201d Will said, as the prince consort stepped forward and nodded at the Swedish ambassador. The formal words of greeting were exchanged, along with rather a lot of edged smiles and shaken hands.</p><p>The ambassador bowed before the queen, the curve of his back deeper than what he\u2019d offered the prince consort. He had to know who truly ruled Britain; this was an insult, one of the first of many, no doubt.</p><p>Perhaps her task would not be so difficult after all?</p><p>\u201cI was curious.\u201d And she\u2019d needed to know who her targets would be. Again an uneasy churn of guilt turned her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThis Magnus,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of the Norwegians?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t deny him the information she\u2019d spent hours gossiping to achieve. \u201cThere are only five remaining clans left in Norway. Magnus rules one, but for this delegation he speaks with their voices. The true source of power in Norway is Valdemar Einarsson, the jarl of all the clans.\u201d Another stolen glance at the young woman bowing to the queen. \u201cShe must be his daughter, the Lady Astrid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happens once they all finish bowin\u2019 and scrapin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe retire to the Ivory Tower and the welcoming ball begins.\u201d</p><p>A slight hint of unease in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Will. Dancing,\u201d she said, relishing the moment. \u201cNow we see if you\u2019ve retained any of my lessons.\u201d</p><p>Light glittered. The official state ballroom walls bore mirror after mirror, the edges scrolled with gilt and interspersed with elegant paintings. Will paused at the top of the red carpeted stairs as his name and Lena\u2019s were announced.</p><p>Hundreds of faces turned his way. Blue bloods, verwulfen, and human alike. A brief scan of the crowd revealed the Norwegians gathered in the corner, expressions wary and considering. The Fenrir locked gazes with him, his black eye patch distinctly out of odds here in this gleaming paradise. Fur bristled on his shoulders and his iron-gray beard spoke of the weight of years. Will felt as if he\u2019d been weighed and measured by that single eye.</p><p>Not a man he\u2019d like to cross.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lena whispered, tugging at his sleeve.</p> <p>Why the devil had he agreed to this? Feeling hunted, he stalked down the stairs beside her.</p><p>The next hour was a whirl of teeth-grinding social niceties and false smiles as Lena introduced him to members of the Echelon. Hard looks slapped his back and he saw more than a few blue bloods exchange glances. The looks were easy enough to interpret. What the hell was he doing here? What game was the Council up to?</p><p>Lights. Music. Laughter. So bright and glittering, dozens of gaslit chandeliers casting heat across the room. Nostrils flaring, he intercepted a glass of champagne from a drone\u2019s tray and handed it to Lena. She served as his only anchor in this world he didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>It suited her. She laughed and tapped her friends on the shoulders with her folded fan, constantly keeping him involved in the conversation when he\u2019d prefer to have just stood at her shoulder and scowled. This entire evening was effortless for her. Even the blue bloods danced to her tune, kept in place with a coquettish smile and a drawled witticism.</p><p>He wanted to smash them in the face for each smile they earned.</p><p>\u201cI need air,\u201d he growled in her ear.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She took one look at his face and nodded thoughtfully. \u201cCome. Dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Only for her would he endure such torture.</p><p>Taking her by the hand, he led her onto the dance floor and dragged her into his arms. Lena\u2019s eyes widened as his hand slid over the small of her back, his thighs brushing against her skirts. But she didn\u2019t dare chastise him out loud for holding her too closely.</p><p>The music swept them up and Will twirled her in his arms, concentrating hard on counting the steps. It should have looked ridiculous\u2014he was enormous against her delicate stature\u2014but Lena had a grace about her that made it somehow work. It was like holding a spinning top in his hands. She floated, each movement lithe and elegant, with a slight hint of the coquette. If he faltered, she encouraged him with a lowered-lash smile that made all of the steps rush out of his mind.</p><p>All of his thoughts, in fact.</p><p>\u201cStop counting,\u201d she murmured, a small smile playing about her lips.</p><p>He glared at her, twirling her in a pirouette. From this angle, he could see straight down her dress at the soft swell of creamy flesh she displayed with far too much complacency. Pearls dripped into the deep vee of her gown, drawing his gaze lower. \u201cI thought it were fashion for women searchin\u2019 for a protector to leave their throats and neck bare?\u201d</p><p>Lena glanced up, over her shoulder, as he guided her through a pirouette. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot what?\u201d</p><p>There was a slight hesitation. \u201cSearching for a protector.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened in hers. It shouldn\u2019t matter. She could never be his anyway. But the thought still flooded him with a fierce sense of satisfaction. Of possession.</p><p>His body curved around hers, drawing her back against his chest as he held her hands up. The movement thrust her chest forward and arched her neck. Each step of the assah had been designed to tempt, to show a blue blood a woman\u2019s best features. Will had no desire for her blood, but the smooth slope of her neck and shoulder drew his gaze. He wanted to run his lips over her skin, to feel her tremble, to taste her as her skin pebbled and she gasped softly.</p><p>His cock roused. Dangerous thoughts. Especially here, in the middle of a ballroom. The swish of her bustle against his groin was a devastating itch, inciting him to harder lengths.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding me too close,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The smile on her face was careless, as if she were not aware of the fact. A charade for anyone watching.</p><p>Her breath, however, told another story.</p><p>What was he doing? Will dragged in a thick breath and looked away. He spun her in a light circle and she came back into his arms, facing him this time. The look in her eyes devastated him.</p><p>Perhaps it had been the other afternoon? Daring her to accept him in public. Challenging her at her own games.</p><p>There was no point to this. She wasn\u2019t his and never could be. But...it was so tempting to hold her, to torture himself with her nearness when he knew he could never have her.</p><p>Just this once.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her go. Couldn\u2019t put the proper distance between them. The music swept through him, a string-and-flute quartet with a slight Middle Eastern hum as exotic counterpoint. Each step came easily now. He wasn\u2019t thinking so much. Just following her body through the steps of the sinuous dance. Predator to prey. But this time the prey held all the power, luring him in, drawing him closer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak. And neither did she. Everything that needed to be said was spoken by the entwining of their bodies. Lena surrendered to the inevitable, her cheeks flushed with a becoming pink as she wilted into his touch.</p><p>And he claimed her as his; his fingers shackling her wrists as she turned, then sliding down her corseted hips, one hand firm across the small of her back as he drew her back into his embrace. He\u2019d forgotten the steps by now. Created his own. Predator to prey, each movement a prophetic one.</p><p>The music trailed to a smoky halt. Clapping erupted and Will stilled, his arms tight around her hips. Lena looked up, her dazed expression fading away as she realized where they were. The pink of her cheeks deepened, her eyes darting past his shoulder.</p><p>Far too many interested eyes looked their way. Lena tugged at his grip. He held it for a moment, forcing her gaze to his, then let her go.</p><p>With a polite smile, she curtsied. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, knowing every word she now spoke would be heard. \u201cFor a wonderful dance.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head, a sign of respect he\u2019d give to no other woman here. \u201cI enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>A surprise in itself. But her presence had made an excruciating moment a delightful one. He found he wanted to keep going.</p><p>Any excuse to keep her in his arms...</p><p>Will looked away. He couldn\u2019t afford to have thoughts like that. His gaze drifted over the Norwegians in the corner. The reason he was here. Something he shouldn\u2019t forget.</p><p>\u201cEvery woman here wants to dance with you now,\u201d Lena murmured.</p><p>\u201cI only dance once.\u201d</p><p>A slight smile. \u201cI think if I asked you, you\u2019d change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you askin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>Lena looked up from beneath her lashes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should. If I dance with you again, we\u2019re going to attract attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have.\u201d</p><p>Lena considered the room. \u201cI need to dance with someone else,\u201d she replied. The light strains of music were starting up again, this time a more traditional dance. A waltz, he suspected.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cNot the assah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That dance was his.</p><p>Her smile bloomed, causing the breath to catch in his chest. \u201cNot the assah then. Go. Find your Norwegians. I\u2019ll stall the gossip you\u2019re no doubt causing.\u201d She gave a rueful twist of her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to drive me to bedlam, you know that?\u201d</p><p>It was no more than she was doing to him. Thank God he wasn\u2019t the only one afflicted by this madness between them.</p><p>With one last smoky look over her shoulder, she sauntered into the crowd, crooking a finger at some young lordling in a yellow coat. He swallowed hard and darted to her side, offering a polite hand as he led her into the waltz.</p><p>Will turned and strode through the crowd, muttering his apologies as he pushed past. Too many people. The air was too stuffy. And a part of him didn\u2019t want to watch her on someone else\u2019s arm.</p><p>Finding a room with refreshments laid out, he tugged at the collar of his coat. Cool air stirred across his face, and the few people picking at the refreshment table realized who he was and darted back to the main ballroom. Which suited him perfectly.</p><p>Taking a plate, he piled it with sweetmeats and pastries and those little cakes Lena seemed to like. Soft footsteps shuffled the carpet behind him and he stilled, catching a hint of a pale shadow reflected in the cut crystal bowl in front of him.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t taken them long.</p><p>Wondering who they\u2019d sent, he turned, eyeing the stranger without surprise.</p><p>With a nervous smile for him, the Lady Astrid crossed the room to the refreshment table. Her white gown was cut to move with each step, creating a graceful, sinuous effect that no human woman could ever hope to emulate.</p><p>\u201cYou are William Carver,\u201d she murmured, trailing her fingers over the tablecloth as she stalked toward him. A swift smile. Not so nervous now. If she ever had been. There\u2019d been no hint of it in her scent. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to find one of our own here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect to be here meself,\u201d he replied. There was no point in trying to play word games. He was who he was. No amount of polish could change his nature or make him comfortable with the games the blue bloods enjoyed.</p><p>Astrid gave him a sidelong look. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t my world.\u201d</p><p>She examined him as if he\u2019d done something unexpected. \u201cYou\u2019re Scottish, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally. Were born on a crofter\u2019s farm outside o\u2019 Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>Easing closer, she let her arm brush against his. \u201cHow old were you when you received the gift?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over her shoulder toward the ball. Through the arch he could just see the glittering skirts of Lena\u2019s pink ball gown. Talking to some young pup who hung on her every word. Safe for the moment.</p><p>He turned his attention back to the woman in front of him. \u201cI were five. And it weren\u2019t no gift.\u201d</p><p>He could barely recall the stranger who\u2019d ridden in on the back of a cart one day, feverish and sweating, his arms raked with bloody scratches. They\u2019d called for the physician, but the man had gone berserk, throwing men aside as if they weighed nothing. Will had been the only one left standing, staring at the stranger in virulent fear. He couldn\u2019t remember what happened next. But they said it took five men to pull the stranger away from his throat.</p><p>Nobody expected him to live. The man had torn him apart like a nice, fat rabbit. But somehow his body reknit itself. By the time they realized why, it was too late. He was well into the first transition of the loupe.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her eyes softened in sympathy, but her scent was still hard. A lesson in that for him. Trust his nose and not his eyes. \u201cHow did you learn to control yourself? Were there others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe mam sold me to a travelin\u2019 showman.\u201d An old wound, healed and crusted over, but still scarred. \u201cI were locked in a cage for ten years. If I tried to escape they whipped me until I went down.\u201d He took a mouthful of champagne, the bitterness of it bubbling on his tongue. \u201cI learned the hard way not to lose me temper.\u201d</p><p>Astrid\u2019s fingers went to the amulet around her neck and she toyed with it, a troubled look on her face. \u201cHow can you stand to be here? Around them? Knowing that their laws locked you away for years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply doin\u2019 a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn attempt to soften our favor? They do not know us well, do they?\u201d Another brush against his sleeve. Her hand slid over his, gloves rustling. \u201cSo how much does this little task of yours cost them?\u201d She took a deep breath, her breasts swelling. \u201cWhat does it involve?\u201d</p><p>He let her stroke his hand. She was beautiful, but she was no Lena. \u201cI get you to sign the treaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth more than your weight in gold,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cFor all the verwulfen in the Isles,\u201d he added. \u201cNo more cages, no more pit-fightin\u2019 or prices on our heads. Free men. And women.\u201d</p><p>Unease prickled her scent. Despite the smile on her face, he\u2019d pricked her conscience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA worthy cause.\u201d Her finger stroked his knuckle, but her mind was miles away. She frowned. \u201cYou should come and meet my uncle. He may be interested in what you speak of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagnus.\u201d</p> <p>Will considered it. Then nodded. He gestured to the plate. \u201cLet me just take this to my companion, Lena.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>It had taken him all of ten minutes to ingratiate himself with the Norwegians.</p><p>Lena bit into a lemon tart, smiling at the young lord in front of her as she surreptitiously glanced over his shoulder. Will clasped hands with the grizzled Fenrir and greeted his son, Eric.</p><p>Movement shifted. A hand, sliding over the small of his back. Lena nearly choked on her tart. Her eyes narrowed. That Norwegian witch. She\u2019d known him barely a quarter of an hour and she was already trying to stake a claim.</p> <p>Stammering a vague reply to something Lord Folsom asked her, she maneuvered herself for a better look. The blond goddess smiled up at him, her hand possessively stroking the smooth tailoring of his coat. Will looked down at her with an amused expression crinkling his eyes.</p><p>And Lena\u2019s heart twisted in her chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, my dear?\u201d Lord Folsom asked. He was only human, his family not deemed important enough to receive the gift of the blood rites.</p><p>\u201cQuite fine,\u201d she managed to say, passing him her plate. \u201cJust a slight hint of nausea. I believe I might need to escape the crush.\u201d</p><p>She should have been working against Will instead, but she found she didn\u2019t have the heart for it. She needed to clear her head. Gather herself. Before she did something foolish like ask Eric to dance the assah with her.</p><p>She knew precisely how Will would take that.</p> <p>Pushing through the crowd, she found herself at the edge of the ballroom. The room was located on the second highest floor of the Ivory Tower, with breathtaking views over the entirety of London. A colonnade circled the outside, a chance for a young lady to stroll within watchful distance of the ballroom.</p><p>She pushed through the French doors, the wind whipping her hair out of her face as she leaned against the rail. Hundreds of feet below, the grass beckoned. More than one blue blood had been thrown to his death here. But never when a ball was in progress. Such things weren\u2019t done.</p><p>Tugging her gloves off, she risked another glance back into the ballroom. With the ballroom lit up so well, everything within was fully visible whilst she would remain hidden in the shadows. She found Will easily enough. His nerves appeared to have settled, for he shared a rare smile with the Norwegian clans as they wooed him.</p><p>His own people.</p><p>Dress him in furs and let him stop shaving for a day or so and he might have been mistaken for one of them.</p><p>Turning around, she balled her gloves in her fist and leaned on the rail. Foolishness. You knew he was never for you. Yet the last week had lulled her into a sense of false hope. A smile here, the brush of his body against hers, their teasing...</p><p>If he knew what she was about, he\u2019d never speak to her again.</p><p>Lost in her own misery, she barely heard the door open. The wind chilled her skin, but the hairs that rose on the back of her neck had nothing to do with the breeze.</p> <p>Spinning around, she froze against the rail. Colchester smiled at her, easing the door shut with a soft click. Behind him dancers swept past, their images distorted by the windows. So close and yet so far away.</p><p>Lena took a step to the side and Colchester echoed her. A chill ran down her spine.</p><p>Tipping her chin up, she tugged her gloves back on. If anyone caught them, there was no need to promote rumors that she\u2019d encouraged him. A bare wrist was tantamount to exposing her breast.</p><p>Colchester watched the silk slither over her arms. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to help, you realize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only observing the proprieties.\u201d</p><p>He strolled closer, using his body to trap her against the rail. Reaching out with both hands, he caged each side of her waist.</p><p>She risked a look toward the ballroom. A man\u2019s broad back blocked the doors she\u2019d come through. Cavendish, by the look of it. Preventing anyone from exiting. \u201cI told you I haven\u2019t decided,\u201d she said, her breath catching as he leaned closer.</p><p>His gaze ran smokily down her throat. \u201cPerhaps the offer\u2019s been rescinded anyway. Why would I want soiled goods?\u201d</p><p>Fingertips brushed against the curve of her clavicle. She pressed against the rail, but there was nowhere to go. Only empty air and wind behind her. \u201cSoiled goods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother blue blood I could have forgiven you for. But not one of those filthy beasts.\u201d His hand closed over her throat lightly.</p><p>Lena couldn\u2019t breathe. She looked in those insane eyes and knew he\u2019d do it. \u201cDon\u2019t. Not here. People are watching.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened. \u201cDo you think I give a damn?\u201d A bark of laughter. \u201cI\u2019m a duke, Helena. And you...you are nothing.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his wrist, trying to ease his choking hold. Her head was swimming. \u201cP-please...\u201d</p><p>His grip eased. \u201cI\u2019m sorry? Are you begging for your pathetic little life? You\u2019re not doing a very good job, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Think, damn it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. Whatever you think has been happening, you\u2019re wrong. Leo asked me to teach Will to move through the Echelon. This is...strictly business, nothing else.\u201d</p><p>A considering look entered his eyes. He stroked her throat. \u201cBusiness? After that dance? The beast seems awfully possessive of you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cA crude habit I\u2019m trying to break him of. Really...\u201d She gave a brittle laugh. \u201cAccusing me of such a thing. You know I prefer the finer things in life. Something...sophisticated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely certain you\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp move, he grabbed her and spun her toward the rail, pressing her hard against it. Her slippers teetered against the ground, and she clutched at the rail with a scream. The cobbles below seemed miles away.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four people have gone over this rail,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cWith you sipping champagne all night, it would be terribly easy to convince everyone you\u2019d slipped.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her by the bustle, he shoved her inexorably forward. He\u2019d let go of the back of her head for the moment and with an instinct she didn\u2019t know she possessed, she slammed her head back.</p><p>A deafening crack sounded in her ear and Colchester screamed. The pressure at her back was gone and she tumbled against the rail. So close. Too close... Colchester cupped his face, blood pouring between his fingers. He caught a glimpse of her and murder gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>Lena darted for the door. A slashing pain caught her across the upper arm and blood spattered across the glass. He\u2019d drawn his blade, the little one he used for bloodletting. Avoiding his grasping hand, she yanked the door open and shoved into the room.</p><p>Cavendish staggered out of her way, surprise widening his eyes. Heads turned and Lena pasted a smile on her lips, her teeth clenched together. The room swam in her panic, gems and faces and dresses leeching into one another. Clapping a hand to her arm, she pushed through the whispering crowd.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t dare attack her here. Not with a broken nose. No blue blood would live down the indignity of being outmaneuvered by a simple human girl.</p><p>The heartbeat that threatened to choke her began to slow. All she had to do was find Leo or Will. Safe. She was safe now.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t feel it. Blood dripped between her gloved fingers as she made her way through the crowd of blue bloods. They eyed her with far too much interest for her comfort. The music grated harshly on her nerves.</p><p>A gap opened up and suddenly she was staring at Will. His gaze flickered over her, then narrowed on her bleeding arm. The room might as well have gone quiet. No change to his expression, nothing to indicate his mood, but suddenly she realized just how dangerous he was.</p><p>Bright copper glowed in his eyes. The woman at his side asked him a question, gently stroking his sleeve. He pushed away from the table he\u2019d been leaning against, ignoring her completely. Lena couldn\u2019t make her feet move. All she could do was stare at him and silently will him not to make a scene.</p><p>Behind her she heard Cavendish\u2019s voice, growing nearer as he looked for her. Will heard it too, his head shooting in that direction with a murderous gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But it was too late. He turned toward Cavendish, his fists tightening. Striding carelessly into the path of a pair of dancers, he stopped the entire waltz.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t do something he\u2019d kill Cavendish. Then they\u2019d have no choice but to execute him. Suddenly she could move again. Cutting him off halfway, she grabbed his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>No man looked out at her through those burning coppery eyes. She\u2019d been so certain he\u2019d never, ever hurt her, yet for a moment even she froze at the fury that looked back at her. The wild within.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d There was only one way to stop him in this mood, only one thing that could distract him. \u201cWill, I\u2019m bleeding. I need to go home, to have my arm seen to. I don\u2019t feel very well.\u201d She made her knees soften, her weight leaning into him.</p><p>He caught her, as she knew he would. Blade had once said that Will was the most dangerous man he\u2019d ever met, but his protective instincts overrode his violent ones. A wolf to the core.</p><p>As he swept her up in his arms, Lena buried her face against his shoulder. This was it. The end of any chance she had with the Echelon. She might be able to walk its verge, but she would never be a part of it again. Whispers followed them as Will strode from the room.</p><p>One last glance over his shoulder as they passed through the doors. The gowns, the jewels, the fancy ladies in all their finery. Gone. Her chance at this was gone the instant she curled into his arms. And strangely enough a weight lifted from her shoulders.</p><p>Lena turned her face into his neck, breathing in the masculine scent of his skin. She didn\u2019t know what she would do. There was nothing for her in the rookery, nothing for her in the Echelon. Her fingers curled against his collar. Only one thing that she had always wanted and he had not wanted her back.</p><p>But did you fight hard enough?</p><p>She buried her face in his coat, too afraid to look at the answer to that question. She hadn\u2019t fought, hadn\u2019t told him how she felt. Too afraid to have her heart dashed to pieces, and so she\u2019d never dared display it.</p><p>He would never know how much her games with him were all she would risk.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced at the enormous circular staircase that spiraled through the heart of the Ivory Tower. A thousand steps, some said, though she\u2019d never bothered to count them.</p><p>\u201cThe elevation chamber. I want some privacy.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the pair of ladies who\u2019d followed them from the ballroom and sent them fleeing with a glare. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue. You can\u2019t carry me the entire way down those stairs. We\u2019re on the ninth floor.\u201d</p><p>His face turned to hers, hints of amber burning around his pupil. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She had to get him out of here before he erupted again. \u201cThe elevation chamber.\u201d</p><p>The liveried footman nodded to them as if he saw ladies being carried out of the ballroom every night. The polished brass doors to the elevation chamber slowly opened, revealing the smooth brass panels of the walls.</p><p>Will carried her inside and the doors slid shut.</p><p>She gestured for him to put her down. A frown drew his eyebrows together, but he complied.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d The chamber lurched into movement and he grabbed at the wall, his eyes wild.</p><p>\u201cI went for some air on the balcony.\u201d There was no getting around the truth. \u201cColchester came out after me.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s gaze dropped to her bloodied glove. His nostrils flared. \u201cHe cut you.\u201d</p><p>The words were a promised threat. She had to diffuse the situation. \u201cI broke his nose. It\u2019s an even trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely even a scratch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were terrified,\u201d he snapped. Turning, he swung a fist at the wall and the brass panel caved beneath his fist.</p><p>She flinched. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Reining himself in with a visible clenching of his will, he slid a hand down the wall. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt you. You know that. I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She realized she was pressed back against the far wall, her nerves strung too tightly to relax with his temper riding the chamber like a cyclone.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was scared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m safe now. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you? What did he say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He threatened to kill me. She paled and shook her head.</p><p>The steady jolt as the steam engines deep in the Ivory Tower\u2019s cellars winched them down became almost hypnotic. Will didn\u2019t find them so. He prowled the small room, his hands clasped behind his back and his eyes bright with anger.</p><p>\u201cI hate small spaces,\u201d he said, too much white showing in his eyes.</p> <p>And she suddenly realized his temper wasn\u2019t only strung so tightly because of Colchester. \u201cDoes it\u2014does it remind you of the cage?\u201d She had to clear her throat to get the words out.</p><p>His gaze cut to hers and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, slipping her hand into his. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Nodding at her, he looked away. But his fingers slid through hers, squeezing hard. \u201cThe cage weren\u2019t so bad. I could see through the bars.\u201d His expression darkened. As if he saw something else, something beyond the smooth walls of the elevation chamber. \u201cWhen I disobeyed they used to beat me unconscious. But as I grew older the threat of that didn\u2019t scare me as it used to.\u201d Licking his lips. \u201cThere were a cellar. Deep underground. They used to lock me in there. For days. Or weeks. No way o\u2019 knowin\u2019, it were so dark. Not even a rat down there.\u201d</p><p>A little boy, lost in the dark. Her heart ached for him. \u201cYou\u2019re free now.\u201d</p> <p>Will\u2019s gaze met hers. \u201cI ain\u2019t free, Lena. Not yet. It\u2019s just, the cage\u2019s bigger now. All o\u2019 Whitechapel to roam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>An angry twist of his expression. \u201c\u2019Til the treaty\u2019s signed. I have to make sure the Norwegians sign it, else I\u2019m back in the \u2019Chapel and the others, those like me, are still in their chains.\u201d</p><p>His words took her breath.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they promised you?\u201d A disaster. An absolute disaster. \u201cThey promised you freedom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and every verwulfen in the Empire.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned back against the wall, hand to her chest. Will was more involved in this than she\u2019d expected. By moving against him, working against him, she was threatening to destroy his chances of freedom.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>But what about Charlie? Her hand dropped to her side. What was she going to do? Heat ached behind her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLena?\u201d</p><p>Will waited for a reply. She couldn\u2019t think quickly enough. \u201cThe jarl\u2019s daughter seemed to take a liking to you,\u201d she said automatically, as if her heart didn\u2019t feel the blow. \u201cIf you charmed her\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t say anymore. The words shriveled in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 \u2019bout charm.\u201d</p><p>Lena laughed, a miserable little sound. She had to get out of here. The walls felt like they were closing in on her. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>The elevation chamber came to a shuddering halt and she spun around. The bell rang and the doors started to open. Lena stepped through them as soon as they were wide enough to accommodate her.</p> <p>One more flight of stairs to the ground entrance. She gathered her pink skirts and started dashing down them, but Will leaped in front of her, a frown on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She tried to push past, but he blocked her way. Standing two steps below her put his face on a level with hers. \u201cWill, I\u2019m tired. I want to go home. This is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour scent changed.\u201d He took a step up, his thighs pressing against her skirts. \u201cAs soon as I told you what they\u2019d promised.\u201d</p><p>Did guilt have its own scent? She pressed her fingertips against his chest. Whether to hold him at bay or draw him closer, she didn\u2019t know. The superfine of his coat was soft beneath her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt changed again,\u201d he admitted, little sparks of molten copper flaring in his irises. \u201cWhen you mentioned Lady Astrid.\u201d His head lowered, gaze dropping to her mouth. \u201cJust as it\u2019s changed now.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s heart started beating faster. Every emotion, every hope, dream, and despair she thought she\u2019d kept hidden from him was betrayed by her scent. She met his eyes and couldn\u2019t read the look in them. Hot amber. Eyes that she could drown in if he let her. The color of them softened, melted, as he leaned closer.</p><p>His intentions stole her breath. He meant to kiss her. In the foyer of the Ivory Tower, in front of anyone who walked down the stairs. Exhilaration leaped through every nerve in her body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He paused, his mouth an inch from hers. \u201cI never understand you.\u201d His eyes darkened with heat. \u201cYes or no, Lena?\u201d</p><p>Warm breath against her lips. Her hand softened on his chest. She knew the answer before her traitorous mouth could say the words. And so did he.</p><p>Will captured the yes on her lips, his hands cupping her face and tilting it up to him. The first taste of him was intoxicating. Lena clutched his lapels and rose on her toes.</p><p>The world around them faded. All she could feel was the heat of his hard body, pressed firmly against hers, and the taste of his mouth, of champagne and lemon tarts. Darting her tongue against his, she swallowed his soft moan. As if sensing permission, his own tongue met hers and he devoured her, all hot, male possession.</p><p>Will\u2019s hand splayed over her bottom and he wrenched her against him. Every burning inch. She could feel the layers of fabric bunching between them, and the hint of his shaft, pressed hard against her hips. Wanting more, needing more, she slid her hands into his hair, abandoning herself to the taste of his mouth. There was no skill involved, no finesse, none of the careful kisses she\u2019d flirted with in the Echelon. Nothing but hunger and the barely contained raw fury she could sense beneath his skin.</p><p>Taking him to bed would never be tame. Never safe. And she wanted it more than she\u2019d ever wanted anything in her life.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d she whispered, before she dared think about it. \u201cYour home.\u201d</p><p>Will lifted his head, an iron stillness running through his body. Hot little sparks of copper burned in his gaze and she knew instantly she\u2019d said the wrong thing.</p><p>She kissed him again, biting at his bottom lip, but he didn\u2019t rise to meet her. Cupping her face in both hands, Will drew back, breathing hard, his forehead pressed to hers.</p><p>\u201cLena.\u201d A word full of hunger and denied need. \u201cI can\u2019t. We can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hands down his chest, hovering over his abdomen. \u201cYes, we can. Nobody would know.\u201d A shiver ran through her. \u201cI want you, Will. I need you. Need this. It\u2019s not a game to me.\u201d The last few words were a whisper.</p><p>He shuddered, eyes closed, fighting something she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d He tore away from her, red heat flushing his cheeks. The look he shot her was dark, dangerous. Hungry. Slowly he shook his head. \u201cEven this should never have happened.\u201d</p><p>He might as well have stabbed her in the heart.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want and what I should do ain\u2019t the same.\u201d He ran his hands over his head, disheveling the neat queue. Strands of thick honey-gold cascaded around his face, caressing the stark cheekbones.</p><p>The denial rocked her. As if in mockery, her pulse raced through her veins, something hot and heavy throbbing between her thighs. Her body had not realized what the rest of her had.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m verwulfen, Lena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. You know I don\u2019t care\u2014\u201d</p><p>Will caught her wrists. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Everything she\u2019d ever feared. Heat flushed behind her eyes and she turned her face away. This had turned into one of the most horrendous nights she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Moments ticked by. Then he let her go and stepped away. Finally some space to breathe. Swallowing hard, she forced her tears back and clutched at her ruined gloves. \u201cYou may as well return to the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a job to do. I\u2019ll find my way to the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you went back. I want to go home.\u201d Wherever that might be. \u201cTo Waverly Place.\u201d</p><p>Unable to bear his presence anymore, she pushed past in a flurry of skirts and made her escape.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>The shop bell chimed.</p><p>The man behind the counter looked up, his smile paling somewhat when he saw who stood there. A mercenary gaze raked over Will\u2019s workman\u2019s shirt and leather trousers. \u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d</p><p>The display cases gleamed in the weak sunlight. Row upon row of pistols filled the cases. In the corner was another case with less common forms of weaponry; a gilded crossbow, meant for a lady; a handheld mace; even a pair of leather fingerless gloves, with razors cut into the back of them. One punch and you\u2019d kill a man with them. Will looked at them lingeringly, then pushed toward the pistols. He wasn\u2019t here for himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m after a pistol,\u201d he said. \u201cSomethin\u2019 dainty.\u201d</p><p>The shop owner\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cSomething like that won\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>Without looking at him, Will tossed him a purse. It bounced on the counter, heavy coins clinking together. \u201cWeren\u2019t expectin\u2019 it to.\u201d</p><p>He leaned on the counter, splaying his hands wide as he examined the contents. A heavy derringer, a German-made M1879 Reichsrevolver, a steam-firing pistol... And there, something small enough to fit Lena\u2019s hand.</p><p>The inlay was mother-of-pearl, the fittings gilded. A brass eyesight was mounted on the barrel and delicate little etchings lined the handle. \u201cThat one,\u201d he said, stabbing his finger at the glass.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful piece, sir. May I ask its purpose? It was designed for target shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtection.\u201d</p><p>The shop owner unlocked the case and lifted out the mahogany box the pistol rested in. \u201cIt\u2019s a seventeen caliber. Won\u2019t stop much more than a pigeon, or small animal, I\u2019m afraid. Unless you\u2019re a damned good shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will when I\u2019m done with it.\u201d He fingered the smooth barrel. A few alterations and Lena would be able to take down a bear\u2014or a blue blood. Her own father had designed a type of bullet that would explode on impact. All he had to do was replicate the chemical mix and refine the bullets to something that would fit the compact pistol.</p><p>The shopkeeper fussed about him until his teeth were on edge, now that Will had proven to have good coin.</p><p>\u201cAnd these,\u201d he said instinctively, pointing toward the half-gloves before it was too late.</p><p>Outside, sunlight danced over the street. Passersby glanced at him in curiosity, but none said a word. A young woman in embroidered yellow cotton grabbed her son\u2019s hand and dragged the staring child out of the way. Will was tempted to smile at her with bared teeth, but something about what Lena had said to him rang true. He wasn\u2019t a beast. Not truly. No matter what the woman saw when she looked at him. Forcing out a curt nod, he strode past her as if he belonged here.</p><p>The night had been long and sleep hard to find. Colchester played on his mind, the adversary he didn\u2019t know enough about.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>If Lena thought her best defense against a blue blood was to lie down and submit, then she had another thing coming. Last night scared him. Even at a gathering of nearly four hundred people, Colchester managed to get near her.</p><p>He found his way to a jeweler\u2019s and strode in out of the wind. A pair of blue bloods were examining the wares at the counter, clad in velvets and lace. One wore a perfumed, fragrant wig, much in the style of Georgian times, and leaned heavily on a cane. Beneath the perfume lingered a faint rotting smell that made Will\u2019s hackles rise.</p><p>On the verge of the Fade. The blue blood wouldn\u2019t have much time left before someone decided to put him out of his misery\u2014and spare the city another vampire massacre.</p><p>The middle-aged man grabbed his arm as the elder turned, leaning heavily on the cane. \u201cHere, Grandfather. Take a seat.\u201d He guided him to a chair and gestured at the shopkeeper. \u201cBlud-wein. Now.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them had smelt him yet. Will prowled the cabinets, fighting the urge to turn and keep them in sight at all times. The scent made his blood chill. He\u2019d only ever faced one vampire. And one was enough, as the scars across his abdomen would attest. They were the only wounds his virus hadn\u2019t been able to heal completely.</p><p>In Georgian times, a spate of vampires almost drowned the city in blood. It cost ten thousand lives before the Echelon managed to destroy them all. Now, when the virus finally overtook them and the Fade threatened, a blue blood was closely watched. As soon as his body started paling\u2014his eyes filming over and his teeth sharpening\u2014an ax was sent for.</p><p>The shop bell tinkled and a pair of heavy boots strode in. Will caught a glimpse of the newcomer\u2019s reflection in the glass of the cabinet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A long black great cloak wrapped around the man\u2019s shoulders, with a spill of lace at his throat. His waistcoat was red velvet, a golden pocket watch gleaming against it. White gloves curled around a golden-handled cane and he glanced at the pair in the corner, his lip curling beneath a battered nose.</p><p>\u201cDevil take it, Arsen,\u201d the man snapped, tugging out a scented handkerchief. \u201cHaven\u2019t you buried that old relic yet?\u201d</p><p>Both of the men froze. Whilst the younger stammered, the elder lifted his pale, powdered face, a hint of malice in those dark eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet, Colchester. Maybe I\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d</p> <p>Colchester.</p><p>\u201cI should like to see you try, Monkton,\u201d Colchester sneered. \u201cPerhaps I can do the job Arsen\u2019s evidently been neglecting.\u201d</p><p>Colchester was younger than he\u2019d imagined, with the kind of smooth cheeks and rakishly tossed hair that might turn a lady\u2019s head. A big, broad-shouldered fellow, he moved with the smooth-limbed grace of a swordsman.</p><p>His blue eyes glanced at Will\u2019s attire and dismissed him. That was his first mistake. Any true predator would have looked past the clothes to the man within. Obviously years of rank and position had inured him to the dangers of the world. In the Echelon, if a blue blood had grievance with another, they dueled. Will, however, was used to streets where men took what they wanted with a quick knife to the back.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Your Grace,\u201d Arsen stammered. \u201cGrandfather doesn\u2019t mean anything by it. We\u2019ve been watching him closely. We just thought some fresh air would do him good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn ax would be better.\u201d</p><p>Monkton\u2019s lip curled up. \u201cAye. Like the one you forgot to take to the late, unlamented Vickers \u2019til it was too late?\u201d He laughed, a wheezing sound. \u201cHeard it was a glorious duel with the duke\u2019s wig torn off in front of the court and the truth of his condition betrayed. They say it took a week to get the stink of his rot out of the atrium.\u201d</p><p>Colchester\u2019s fist tightened unconsciously. \u201cDon\u2019t make a dangerous enemy, Monkton. You\u2019re nothing but a minor offshoot of the House of Malloryn. And Auvry\u2019s a dear friend of mine. Perhaps I\u2019ll whisper in his ear and see the matter dealt with appropriately?\u201d</p><p>Both of the men paled. The younger grabbed his grandfather by his velvet-clad arm and hustled him out of the jewelry shop with a steady stream of apologies. Colchester watched them go with a bored expression on his face. He eased a snuff tin from his pocket and inhaled a pinch of it, wincing through his bruised nose.</p><p>Their eyes met in the jeweled mirror on the far wall.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you out of your league here?\u201d Colchester asked, tucking his snuff tin back in his pocket.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Will replied. His hands twitched. One moment of violence and Lena would never have to look over her shoulder again... He took a step toward the duke.</p><p>The shopkeeper reappeared with a pair of glasses balanced on a tray. He blinked to find the room empty. Colchester snatched a glass of blud-wein as he sauntered past.</p><p>\u201cReally, Griffith. The people you allow in here,\u201d he muttered, peering at an antique cameo. \u201cI might have to take my business elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-Your Grace\u2014\u201d the shopkeeper stammered.</p><p>Anger bubbled in Will\u2019s chest. The chance was lost.</p><p>Colchester looked up. \u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve business \u2019ere,\u201d he replied, stepping out of the shadows. Heat swam behind his eyes and every muscle in his body tightened. This bastard had done something to Lena. He didn\u2019t know what, but it was enough to terrify her.</p><p>Killing him would be only too sweet. And yet, with it would go any chance he had of freeing himself and his fellows from the cages and arenas.</p> <p>Instinct demanded he kill the duke. But cold intellect argued against it. He could almost hear Blade and Lena\u2019s voices in his ear, trying to explain to him that it would be wrong. Sweat rimed his forehead. This was a world he didn\u2019t understand and never completely would. But he trusted them, knew that they would not be pleased if he did this thing.</p><p>Colchester would never know how close to death he came as he straightened. \u201cDo you have any idea who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I know exactly who you are.\u201d</p><p>Colchester\u2019s gaze sharpened with interest. Will could feel the heat of his anger burning through him. For once he let it surface just enough to show, the molten gold of it transforming his eyes in the mirror\u2019s reflection.</p><p>Colchester sucked in a breath and slapped a hand to his belt, as if reaching for a blade.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t if I were you.\u201d Will sucked in a breath and looked away. Little gems fractured the sunlight back at him, a thousand different shades and colors. Rings, necklaces, bracelets. An entire corner filled with pearl chokers that were worth more than his life. He focused on them furiously, trying to ignore the duke\u2019s perfume.</p><p>Colchester\u2019s image wavered in the glass, his eyes narrowing at Will\u2019s back. \u201cYou\u2019re the one they call the Beast, aren\u2019t you? The one with the price on your head if you step inside the city?\u201d</p><p>Will glanced over his shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t they tell you?\u201d</p><p>Colchester\u2019s eyes became slits. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince consort himself give me pardon.\u201d</p><p>Colchester crossed toward the window, his hands clasped behind his back. His movements were neat and precise; he was on edge, prepared to fight at a second\u2019s notice. Will prowled in the other direction, running his fingertips lightly along the glass counter.</p><p>A dangerous dance. The shopkeeper had retreated to the door of the storeroom, uncertain what was going on but aware of the undercurrents in the room.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Colchester sneered. \u201cThis joke of an alliance they\u2019re spouting. I wasn\u2019t aware of how fully they\u2019d involved you until last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you ain\u2019t as important as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>If looks could kill. \u201cI washed my hands of it weeks ago. It took years to put you savages in your proper places. Why invite you back into our lives with an expression of cordiality?\u201d His gaze ran over Will. \u201cThe entire concept is an insult.\u201d</p><p>The barb went wide of its mark. He didn\u2019t give a damn what Colchester thought of him.</p><p>As if realizing it, Colchester stepped closer. \u201cI must admit, I\u2019m disappointed. After what Cavendish told me, I was expecting a raving lunatic. They\u2019ve leashed you well, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a time. And a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Colchester leaned over, examining a pretty butterfly brooch. When wound, the wings would flutter. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, drawing little circles on the glass with his finger, \u201chas she told you about me yet?\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelena,\u201d Colchester said, placing intimate emphasis on the name. He looked up. The smile on his lips was as nothing to the one in his eyes when he realized his words had finally drawn blood. \u201cMy dear, sweet Helena Todd.\u201d</p><p>Will held onto himself with the thinnest of leashes. \u201cWhy would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s going to be my next thrall\u2014\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Will had him by the throat before he realized it. His fingers dug into the pallid flesh as Colchester laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou leave her alone,\u201d Will snarled, his voice cold and harsh. \u201cYou catch so much as a sniff of her and you turn and walk the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sniff?\u201d Colchester managed to gurgle. \u201cI\u2019ve had more than that, you filth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t...tell you?\u201d Delight turned Colchester\u2019s pale blue eyes warm. Then they bulged as Will\u2019s grip tightened.</p><p>He could barely see through the red haze choking him. One twist and he could tear the bastard\u2019s head from his shoulders. But movement caught his eye. The shopkeeper, trembling in the doorway as he watched in horror.</p><p>Not here. Not now.</p><p>But one day, he promised himself.</p><p>Forcing his hand open, he shoved Colchester back. The duke staggered into the glass cases, spraying glass across the floor. He was still laughing and the sound of it rode Will\u2019s nerves like a saw. He saw red again and turned away, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cShe has the sweetest blood, you know?\u201d Colchester called. \u201cPurrs like a little kitten under the touch\u2014\u201d</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was slamming Colchester face-first into another case. The shopkeeper cringed, but the laughter finally died. Will dragged the duke out of the mess of glass and jewelry and smashed a fist into his midsection. Colchester bent over like a sack of spilled suet, blood and glass encrusting his face.</p><p>A boot hooked behind his and they both went down. Something hot bit into his back but he paid it no mind, riding the edge of the storm within him. Locking his arm around the duke\u2019s neck he twisted and slammed him down onto the hard floor, scrambling on top of him with his fist raised\u2014</p><p>It never descended.</p><p>A hand caught his, iron fingers wrapping around his fist like a manacle. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d someone barked.</p><p>Will looked up, his teeth bared.</p><p>\u201cControl yourself,\u201d snapped a vaguely familiar voice. The stranger was almost as tall as Will himself, but built lean and hard. His eyes were the same chilling blue as a glacier and he wore black leather from head to toe, the hard carapace of a breastplate covering his chest.</p><p>Will blinked, finally noticing the pair of guards behind the stranger. He looked down to find his other hand twisted in Colchester\u2019s waistcoat. Blood ran down the duke\u2019s pale face, with chips of glass embedded in his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGet him off me,\u201d Colchester snapped, spitting blood. \u201cI demand this creature be arrested.\u201d</p><p>And that was when Will realized who the stranger was.</p><p>Sir Jasper Lynch, master of the Nighthawks guild of thief-catchers. They\u2019d worked together three years ago to bring down the vampire. Lynch was a hard man, but efficient. Unfortunately he was also a blue blood.</p><p>Yanking Will to his feet, Lynch stared down his hawkish nose at the duke. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said in a voice completely lacking inflection. \u201cOn what charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssault.\u201d Colchester rolled to his feet, brushing glass off his coat. He looked around. \u201cProperty damage.\u201d A smirk appeared. \u201cAttempted theft.\u201d</p><p>Will growled and strained forward, but Lynch yanked his arm up behind his back and shoved him face-first into the wall. Even in the grip of the fury, he recognized a man who knew the right pressure points to press to hold him there, despite his superior strength.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Lynch whispered deadly soft. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he wants.\u201d Then he gave one last wrench on Will\u2019s arm and let him go.</p><p>Will shoved free, glaring at Colchester.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to have you make a formal complaint at the guild headquarters,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to find a magistrate who\u2019ll charge him. And the witness of course,\u201d he added, with a nod to the shopkeeper.</p><p>Colchester paused in the act of brushing himself off. \u201cWhat the bloody hell do we need him for? You saw him. He attacked me with no provocation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I intervened in an untimely manner,\u201d Lynch replied. \u201cI only saw two men fighting.\u201d</p><p>The pair of them eyed each other. Colchester\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake, Lynch. I\u2019ll have you replaced before sundown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely, Your Grace,\u201d Lynch replied. \u201cThe Council commands law enforcement in the city. Not you.\u201d</p><p>A moment of heavy silence descended before Colchester looked away. \u201cSo be it.\u201d Colchester\u2019s fists clenched at his sides, and he looked past Lynch at Will. His teeth were bloody as he smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll be the first. The little slut\u2019s got a taste for it.\u201d</p><p>It took the three Nighthawks to hold him back this time. Will fought to push past, straining for Colchester. The duke straightened his lapel, brushed the glass shards out of his cheek, and then sauntered out the door.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Lynch snarled. \u201cYou\u2019ll only get yourself killed and he\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Will looked up. They\u2019d pinned him against the wall and he was distantly aware of something warm and wet trickling down his back. Lynch stared at him for a moment then nodded curtly and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cLet him go, boys.\u201d</p><p>They stepped aside, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d Lynch\u2019s nostrils flared.</p><p>Will winced. The rage washed out of him, a half-dozen cuts and bruises suddenly springing to attention. The throb in his back intensified as the heat washed out of his head and his vision returned to normal. He glanced over his shoulder, then swore as it pulled through the muscles in his back. There was something sharp there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch reached out and yanked a glass sliver out of his muscle.</p><p>Son of a bitch. Will hissed. \u201cSome warnin\u2019 would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll heal.\u201d Lynch said. \u201cPerhaps it will teach you to keep a cool head.\u201d He glanced at one of his comrades. \u201cTake a witness statement, Garrett. And an estimation of the damage.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time Will looked around. Glass littered the room, precious jewels tumbling from their cases onto the timber floors. Blood dripped from a nasty sliver of glass casing and he had the pleasure of the memory of smashing Colchester\u2019s face into it, again and again.</p><p>The shopkeeper stared at the damage soundlessly. His eyes were wide and unblinking. \u201cHow am I going to tell Martha?\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe duke\u2019ll blacken my name. He\u2019ll destroy me.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s fingers curled in shame. He should have held his temper. \u201cI\u2019ll pay the damage bill.\u201d</p><p>Lynch grabbed his arm and gestured toward the front door. The grim crawl of evening darkened the sky outside, thick clouds boiling on the horizon. \u201cI\u2019d suggest it\u2019s time for you to leave. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Colchester returns\u2014with a few friends. He\u2019s not likely to take this lying down. And I\u2019ve done as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. Christ. What had he been thinking? He hadn\u2019t obviously. One mention of Lena and the rage had overtaken him completely. Then his eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy help me?\u201d He could count the number of people who\u2019d ever volunteered to help him on one hand; in his experience, there was always a price.</p><p>Lynch paused in the doorway, eyeing the curious crowd that was beginning to form. Tiny lines feathered out from the corners of his eyes, and his dark brows drew together in a frown. \u201cThree years ago Blade saved my life down in the sewers. I owe him. Consider this repayment.\u201d</p><p>Will eyed the other man\u2019s tense shoulders. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Lynch stroked his smooth jaw. \u201cThere is...a certain amount of pressure coming from the Council. I need to locate a revolutionary by the name of Mercury. He leads the humanist movement here in London and he\u2019s directly responsible for the firing of the draining factories. I\u2019m not a fool, Carver. Blade has ears in places I could never reach.\u201d A direct look into Will\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd so do you. I could smell your scent in the tunnels when we arrested the pair responsible for the draining factories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had naught to do with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. The pair told us everything. They thought they\u2019d killed Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly stuck him a bit.\u201d No need to spread word that Blade was fallible. His legend had kept the Echelon at bay for fifty years. \u201cYou want word o\u2019 Mercury then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you know.\u201d</p><p>A chill feathered down his spine. Lynch was desperate. He could smell the edge on him. No doubt the Council was tightening the noose around his throat. Everybody knew that the Nighthawks were comprised of rogue blue bloods\u2014those created illegally or accidentally. Most rogues were killed when they first became infected with the craving. Those that could control themselves were offered another choice: a grim, solitary life as a Nighthawk, kept on the leash of the Council. They were useful to the Echelon, but they would never be a part of them.</p><p>Expendable.</p><p>Especially if they didn\u2019t perform.</p><p>The image of that coded letter he\u2019d found on Lena sprang to mind. If there was any way she could be connected to the humanists, to this Mercury... The fear grew, gnawing at his gut. What had she gotten herself involved in? First Colchester and now this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep me eyes open,\u201d he said, aware that Lynch was watching him intently. \u201cAnythin\u2019 I hear I\u2019ll pass along.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch searched his gaze. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t cross me on this, Carver. If there\u2019s anything you know\u2014anything at all\u2014you\u2019d best tell me.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. The Nighthawk had picked up on the tension in his body no doubt. \u201cAye. I\u2019ll send word if I hear anythin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>First he had to figure out exactly what was going on.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>A cool breeze whispered over her skin. Lena looked up from the mess of cogs and gears that covered her small writing desk. Slipping the magnifying glassicals up on top of her head, she put aside her fine pliers and stood. Her nightrobe tumbled around her bare feet, the rose-colored silk caressing her shins.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she called, tugging her robe tight and retying the sash. It was almost midnight. Mrs. Wade had retired hours ago, but she hadn\u2019t been able to sleep. Too many things whirling through her mind. She\u2019d decided she might as well use the time to work on the life-size transformational Mercury wanted her to create. Clockworks were easy and they always fit together... Unlike her life. Besides, she had only a week until the treaty\u2019s official signing. She\u2019d started the clockwork interior of the piece, but a week was barely time enough to finish it. She\u2019d have to use Mandeville\u2019s help for the outer casing.</p><p>The door between the sitting room and her bedchamber wheezed, stirring in a breeze that shouldn\u2019t have been there. Lena snatched up the poker.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest as she crept toward the door. Nobody would dare attack her here, would they? The place was well-guarded, even at night, as it wasn\u2019t unknown for assassinations to occur in the Echelon. The Duke of Caine was frequently indisposed, and Leo ruled as acting head of the House. No doubt a half-dozen minor offshoots of the House were starting to grow ambitious.</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance.</p><p>The soft glow of a turned-down gas lamp barely lit the shadowed bedroom beyond the door. For a moment Lena was half tempted to wake the household. But if the latch had merely blown open, she\u2019d have woken them for naught.</p><p>Her eyes darted around the room as she slipped through the door. Soft gauzy curtains floated in the wind, rain spattering the polished floors. One of the French doors to her balcony had become unlatched, but there was no sign of anyone in the room.</p><p>\u201cDamned wind.\u201d</p><p>Pressing the door shut, she latched it tightly. Lightning flashed and suddenly the floor creaked behind her.</p><p>A scream tore from her throat, captured by a man\u2019s large hand. He yanked her back against his hard chest and water from his clothes saturated the back of her. Her lips pressed wetly into his hand and his warm breath brushed against her ear.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d</p><p>Will. She could smell his scent now, of musk and rain and fresh air. The poker fell from her nerveless fingers. He caught it with his boot before it hit the floor, then eased it onto the rug.</p><p>Lena\u2019s heart hammered along at a clipping pace. Her feet ceased drumming against his ankles and she slumped in his grip, her breasts pressing against his forearm. In the corner, movement caught her eye. A freestanding cheval mirror, showing the pair of them locked together in an illicit embrace. Lena\u2019s eyes widened as they met his. He was huge and wet and brooding, the amber spark of his eyes flaring in warning. Spoiling for a fight by the look of him.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. He wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted an argument. This was going to be the last time he frightened her.</p><p>She bit the fleshy pad of his palm.</p><p>\u201cIf I let you go are you goin\u2019 to behave?\u201d</p><p>Lena wriggled furiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll assume that means \u2018no.\u2019\u201d Hauling her toward the bed, he tossed her on it. Before she could even bounce, he\u2019d whipped a silk scarf off the floor and gagged her with it.</p><p>Lena\u2019s eyes widened further and she kicked at him, making a strangled sound behind the scarf. Will pinned her, his hands driving her wrists into the bed and his legs straddling hers. The nightgown rucked up around her thighs in the struggle and she stilled as his gaze dropped. There was a world of heat in that look.</p><p>\u201cTruce?\u201d</p><p>Lena nodded warily. As he sat back, kneeling over her, she reached up and tugged the scarf out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cIf Barrons finds me here, we\u2019ll be contracted for marriage before we know it.\u201d Their eyes met. \u201cNeither of us wants that, do we?\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded uncertainly. Then she gave her head a vehement shake. She\u2019d seen her sister\u2019s happiness and good fortune. The only thing worse than a marriage made of duty would be one of unrequited feelings.</p><p>Will stared at her for a long moment, his expression hardening. His hand dropped from her mouth, trailing over her cheek before falling to his lap.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t force a contract on us anyway,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLeo would probably pretend he\u2019d never seen you here\u2014after escorting you to the door and removing the trellis outside my window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t stop me.\u201d His fingers toyed with the sash of her robe. Then Will realized what he\u2019d said. \u201cIf I wanted to get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Her hand clapped over his. His palm flattened against her abdomen, devilishly warm. \u201cYou\u2019re taking entirely too many liberties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time it\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Something about his expression warned her. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>A long silence. \u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She had the feeling he wasn\u2019t talking about the kiss they\u2019d shared. Lena shoved his hand away. \u201cWhat do you want? What are you doing here anyway?\u201d</p><p>Water slicked his hair against his head, dripping down the open collar of his throat. His gaze was hard and flat. He held up a piece of paper and with a start she realized it was the other piece of the letter he\u2019d torn from her.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen it she\u2019d stuffed it up the chimney, behind a loose brick where she could take the time to try and decipher it.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 for the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I ain\u2019t likely to get it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine.\u201d Lena snatched at it but his grip was firm. They glared at each other. His shirt clung to his shoulders indecently; the sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and his leather waistcoat sculpted every muscle of his chest. A bead of water hovered in the dip of his lip, another sliding down his roughened cheek. God, she wanted to run her hands over his shoulders, to trace that droplet of water with her tongue.</p><p>To sink her hands into the wet mess of his hair and drag his mouth down. To hers.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lena shivered with unrequited longing. \u201cWhat are you going to do with it? Decode it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Lena licked her lips. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s for the best.\u201d She wanted to know what it said just as much as he did. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t breathe a word to anyone else about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid Honoria will yell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid she\u2019ll lock me in a convent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you ought to be.\u201d The gold color of his eyes was molten.</p><p>Lena froze. He\u2019d made it quite clear kissing her had been a mistake. And yet... Her nipples tightened under his burning gaze. The way he was looking at her was almost edible. This mood of his was unpredictable.</p><p>She had to get him out of here before she did something foolish.</p><p>\u201cIs that everything you came for?\u201d She let go of her end of the piece of paper. \u201cYou scared me half to death.\u201d</p><p>Rain battered the windows as he knelt back onto his knees. He didn\u2019t seem in any hurry to leave.</p><p>\u201cWill? Whatever this is, you could have waited \u2019til tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s expression remained hooded. \u201cYou and I need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. If anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he growled, and another low peal of thunder rumbled through the room. \u201cI give you enough chances. Tonight I\u2019ve had enough. I want answers and you\u2019re damned well goin\u2019 to give \u2019em to me. All you\u2019re goin\u2019 to do is answer yes or no, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Lena nodded slowly. Will always kept his temper even and controlled. He didn\u2019t dare let it loose. Tonight there was a wildness there that urged for caution.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who Mercury is?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI don\u2019t... I\u2019m not sure what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Will pressed a finger to her lips. \u201cYes. Or no. Do you know who Mercury is?\u201d</p><p>Where had he heard that name? And why would he suspect her of a connection to it? She had to play this right, or who knew how he\u2019d react? Lena nodded hesitantly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that, she realized. A frown drew his eyebrows together. \u201cDamn it, Lena. What the devil have you gotten yourself involved in?\u201d</p><p>There was no way to answer that with a simple yes or no.</p><p>As if realizing her intentions, his eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you have any involvement with the humanists? With Mercury?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. And no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena, the Nighthawks are huntin\u2019 Mercury! It won\u2019t be long before they find him and anyone connected to him. Today I had to promise Sir Jasper Lynch that I\u2019d keep an eye out for any signs of him. Even as I said the words I knew I were lyin\u2019, for I knew you were involved.\u201d With a disgusted look, he raked his hands through his hair. \u201cWhat am I goin\u2019 to do with you?\u201d</p><p>The question brought to mind a number of answers. But she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d approve of any of them.</p> <p>\u201cWell? Are you goin\u2019 to tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>The answer to that was simple enough. Panic flashed through her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the wrong answer, luv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only one you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make you tell me.\u201d He leaned closer, looming over her.</p> <p>Lena scooted back up the bed until her back hit the headboard. \u201cI hardly think you\u2019d dare. Since you don\u2019t want to be found in my chambers any more than I want you found. I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face made her breath shudder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll try,\u201d he said. One large hand latched around her ankle, the obscene heat of his skin branding her. His eyes had gone completely wolfish as he drew her toward him.</p><p>Her nightgown slid over the silken sheets, sliding up around her hips. The robe was tumbling from her shoulders. There was a moment where she could have saved it. A moment where sanity intruded. A moment where she remembered the look in his eyes... Was it real? Or had she just imagined it? Did he want her?</p><p>Heaven help me, she prayed silently. Then she gave a little shrug and the robe slipped from her shoulders, pooling around her waist.</p><p>She had to know.</p> <p>Will\u2019s gaze sharpened. Heat. Hunger. An intensity that scalded her from within. She\u2019d been right. It was not disinterest that tightened his expression and tensed the muscles in his forearms.</p><p>The realization was heady. She could barely breathe as he reached out and captured her chin in one hand. Yes, oh God, yes.</p><p>He turned her face to the side, his hot gaze running down her throat. Then to the other side. Lena frowned, capturing his wrist. What was he doing?</p><p>Ignoring the delicate scalloped lace neckline of her gown, he caught her wrist and turned it up.</p><p>No. Her breath caught and she wrenched her arm to her chest in shock. She knew exactly what he was looking for now.</p><p>\u201cLena.\u201d His hand fisted in the bottom of her nightgown.</p><p>The amber gleam frightened her. There was no lucidity to it, no sign of Will. Only the predator, his face tight with anger. Clutching his hand, she slid it higher, over the inside of her thigh and the raised scar there.</p><p>The ugly reminder of what Colchester had taken from her that day in the alley.</p> <p>\u201cIs this what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d She pushed him away and scrambled for the side of the bed. The hurt was a sharp, stabbing pain in her chest. For a moment, just a moment, she\u2019d thought he was going to kiss her again.</p><p>Sliding her robe up over her shoulders, Lena yanked the sash tight and tied it. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>Lena turned and found him kneeling in the middle of her bed, his head bowed and his hands clenched in her sheets. A tremble ran through his shoulders and his hand jerked. Slowly his head lifted. A shiver ran down her spine as their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cColchester told me.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cTold me he\u2019d had you.\u201d</p><p>A line of heat sprang across her cheeks. Damn it, not now. Tilting her head discreetly to the side, she wiped her eyes with her sleeve. \u201cYou saw him? Where? I told you not to do anything rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI were at the jewelers. He walked in.\u201d A shifting of sheets and then his booted feet came into view. Will knelt in front of her. This close, she could make out the split in his lip and the faint bruise on his cheekbone. Someone had hit him. Colchester, she was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cLena?\u201d The back of his fingers stroked her damp cheek. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>His gentleness nearly undid her. She pushed past in a flurry of silk, panic catching her breath in her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Three steps before he caught her. She whirled around to push him away and found herself in the circle of his arms. His chest was firm against her cheek, his heat enveloping her. God help her, but she couldn\u2019t stop her fingers from curling in his shirt. She felt so safe here in his arms. The fight drained out of her. If only he could hold her like this forever.</p><p>If only he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, what did he do to you?\u201d Will\u2019s voice was strangled. \u201cDid he\u2014did he rape you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted. \u201cBut not for lack of trying.\u201d The memory stained her. Colchester, a handsome young dandy in the streets, stopping to smile and charm her. She\u2019d not thought it odd at all, for she\u2019d been used to such flirtation before her father died. She even recognized him as the Duke of Lannister\u2019s heir, though she\u2019d been a fool to think for one second that he saw her as anything other than a coal lass. Easy prey.</p><p>\u201cHe took my blood.\u201d Forced her back into the alley. Shoved her hard against the wall. Her pails had spilled everywhere, coal tumbling across the dirty cobbles. She\u2019d tried to say no, unable even then to comprehend what was happening. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it. I didn\u2019t. But he kept saying I did, that I\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>Warmth burned on her cheeks. As soon as she realized she was crying, a sob overtook her. Colchester had been right. She had liked it, in the end. The chemicals in his saliva had set off some sort of reaction in her body.</p><p>Will\u2019s hands came up and gently pressed against her back. \u201cEasy now, mo cridhe.\u201d He rubbed soothing circles against her back. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t safe. The tears came harder. Safe was a world without the Echelon and their grasping blood-suckers in it. Without humanists threatening her family, or Colchester stalking her. Safe was a world where she was loved and happy. Safe was here. In Will\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cAnd the humanists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI d-didn\u2019t mean to get caught up in all of this.\u201d But the words were a lie. She\u2019d wanted to find something, anything, to give her a sense of purpose in life.</p><p>\u201cCaught up in what?\u201d His voice was lower, huskier. \u201cLena?\u201d he whispered, stroking the hair off her sticky face. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She pushed out of the comfort of his arms and turned away, shamelessly wiping her face against the shoulder of her nightgown. She knew what he wanted, but she had to explain to him first, to show him that her reasons for all of this hadn\u2019t just been some frivolous whim. Maybe then he wouldn\u2019t hate her so much if he found out what she was supposed to do. \u201cThere was nothing for me in Whitechapel. Honoria had Blade. And Charlie was settling in. We were always so close, but he didn\u2019t want to be around me once he became a blue blood. And then\u2014\u201d Her voice broke slightly and she hurried on. \u201cYou were gone. And nobody wanted me there.</p><p>\u201cI thought that if I returned to society things would change. It was what I\u2019d been raised for. Honoria always had Father and her work, but growing up there was nothing for me but lessons on etiquette and the things a young lady ought to know. When Father died and we were forced to hide in Whitechapel, I was on the cusp of making my debut. It was the happiest time of my life.\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cI just wanted to go back to it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone had praised her beauty and charm then, and the glimpse she\u2019d had of the Echelon had only fuelled her excitement to join it. But she had looked at it through innocent eyes. Whitechapel had changed everything about her. She was no longer that naive young girl with stars in her eyes. There was no going back, and it had taken a long time to realize that.</p><p>\u201cThe rot\u2019s not apparent at first,\u201d she said. \u201cLeo sponsored my debut and everyone was so charming and elegant. Of course they were. They wanted something from me. I was offered three thrall contracts in the first week. It was terribly exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never accepted \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t turn around and look at him. Crossing her arms over her chest, she shook her head. \u201cOne of them\u2014Lord Ramsay\u2014invited me to stroll in the garden with him. I knew what he intended. It\u2019s not uncommon for a woman to offer blood before a contract is signed.\u201d Her voice dropped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. The more I thought about it, the more it upset me. I couldn\u2019t breathe. All I could think about w-was Colchester. In that alley. I was so overwrought that Lord Ramsay slapped me and then Leo was there and he took me home and I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warm arms slid around her waist. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Lena. Damn it.\u201d</p><p>Of course he wouldn\u2019t want her crying all over him. She tried to dry her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the one who ought to be sorry.\u201d Dire words. A hint of threat underlying them. His hand stroked her hip, her waist. \u201cI hate seein\u2019 you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she whispered. His hand stroked smooth circles over her hip. So lightly it was almost hypnotic. Somehow she found herself relaxing back into the circle of his arms.</p><p>The world upended as he swept her up into his arms. With a gasp she clapped her arms around his shoulders. \u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>He was carrying her to the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re shiverin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>And she was, she realized, her lips quivering with the chill of the room\u2014and her memories. Tucking her face against his neck, she closed her eyes and breathed in the wet musky scent of him. He eased her under the sheets and then tucked her blankets around her. Then he straightened.</p><p>Don\u2019t go. She caught his fingertips in mute appeal.</p><p>Will hesitated. \u201cIt ain\u2019t seemly. And I\u2019m wet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so cold,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so warm. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe shirt\u2019s drenched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take it off.\u201d</p><p>Something dark and merciless flashed through his gaze. He sucked in a deep breath. Golden eyes burned in the dark of the night. The hunter? Or the hunted?</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust for a moment. Just to warm my sheets.\u201d If she shivered a little more than was strictly necessary... Well, he would never need to know that.</p><p>The moment of indecision stretched out, playing over his face. \u201cTell me more,\u201d he finally said, tugging at his waistcoat. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re involved in.\u201d</p><p>Lena rolled onto her side, watching him. The light from the gas lamp backlit his broad shoulders. His face was little more than shadow and the burning gleam of those eyes.</p><p>Heat coiled through her, warming her from within. Her nipples tightened, the silk of her nightgown abrading them lightly as he reached over his head and dragged his shirt off. She felt like a mess, her face and nose all wet and splotched, but she could no sooner turn her eyes away than submit to a blue blood.</p><p>Light gleamed over the wet slickness of his skin, highlighting the play of muscle in his chest and the ripple of his abdomen. He shucked his boots and looked up, his damp hair falling almost to his shoulders.</p><p>Far too long and unruly to be fashionable. But, sweet Lord, how she wanted to run her fingers through it. To touch him.</p><p>Nervous anticipation ran over her skin. She\u2019d never seen a man half-naked. Gooseflesh sprang up over her body, and she squirmed against the unfamiliar wet heat between her thighs. The bed dipped beneath his weight.</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet them?\u201d She looked up, wondering for a moment who he was talking about. \u201cThe humanists?\u201d</p><p>Will lay on his back, his head pillowed on his arms as he turned to look at her. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Lena slid closer. The first hint of his body heat on the sheets sent a delicious shiver down her spine. She hadn\u2019t realized how cold she was. \u201cI already knew one, although I never realized what he was involved in until later. Until I needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that.\u201d She snuggled closer, reaching out with a hesitant hand to stroke his chest.</p><p>Will stiffened. But he didn\u2019t pull away. Taking it as permission, she tucked herself against his side, laying her head gently on his shoulder. The heat was delicious.</p><p>\u201cLena, I can\u2019t protect you unless you tell me everythin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice rumbled through his chest. \u201cHe saved my life, Will. He was the one who scared Colchester off. Then he brought me in out of the alley and let me sob all over his shoulder.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t betray him. I owe him more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>Will rolled, turning to face her. Her head slipped into the crook of his arm and the position put distance between them. His breath curled over her face. \u201cMandeville.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t want to see him hurt. He gave me a job, Will. He kept me off the streets and looked after me like I was his own.\u201d</p> <p>Something in his eyes darkened. \u201cAnd where was your bloody sister in all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told her.\u201d As he shifted in protest, she put a finger to his lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it was like. I couldn\u2019t. We were both working our fingers to the bone merely to provide food and shelter, and Charlie was sick with the first signs of the craving. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden.\u201d Fresh tears sprang forth in her eyes. \u201cAnd we\u2019d been arguing so much that I didn\u2019t feel as if I could tell her.\u201d</p><p>Tears scalded her cheeks. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d had any left, but then this was an old grief, one much covered over and patched. Honoria had made peace with her about the constant arguments they\u2019d had, but she\u2019d never known what had caused the burning resentment. Lena had been so alone, so angry and scared.</p><p>Will dragged her close, crushing her against his body. Lena clung to him, burying her face against his neck. \u201cI\u2019m such a mess,\u201d she tried to say, but the tears wouldn\u2019t stop and the words were distorted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t you as should be sorry.\u201d His voice was dark. \u201cYour bloody sister needs her neck wrung. And as for Colchester\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She looked up in alarm. \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t go near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I knew what he done.\u201d A nasty little smile curved over his lips. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, he ain\u2019t as pretty as he were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Will, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragged him face-first through a few glass cases.\u201d</p><p>The thought sent a vindictive thrill through her. Then she shook her head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have. He\u2019ll never forget it. He\u2019ll come after you.\u201d</p><p>There was a light touch against her cheek. \u201cHope he does.\u201d The sound of it was close to her ear.</p> <p>Realization came slowly. His lips, brushing against her brow. Lena stilled. Her heart started to race. \u201cWill?\u201d She lifted her head.</p><p>His expression was dark, considering. He stroked her face with his hand, cupping her chin. His mouth was dangerously close to hers. \u201cGod help me.\u201d</p><p>Then he leaned forward and kissed her.</p><p>His lips were warm and hesitant. Lena sucked in a sharp breath, her heart pounding in her ears. The skin on her cheeks was tight and dry from her tears, but she didn\u2019t care. She lay still and quiescent, not daring to breathe for fear that this dream would all go away.</p><p>As if sensing her hesitation, he drew back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered and grabbed a handful of his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>Fear of losing him broke the barriers of the dam. Her lips found his in the shadows. She pressed herself wantonly against his body, sinking her fingers into his hair.</p><p>He gasped as her tongue darted out and caressed his. His hands cupped her bottom, his body coming over hers and grinding her against him. Every hard inch of him was pressed intimately against her. Heat spilled through her, enveloped her. She rolled her hips instinctively, drawing another gasp from him.</p> <p>Sweet heavens, this is bliss. She wanted more. She wanted him to capture her mouth, take her, right there and then. But his hesitancy lingered in the gentle nips he took at her lips.</p><p>If he drew away again...it would kill her. Lena slid her arms around his damp shoulders, her tongue sliding into his mouth. His back arched, enough to press his hips against hers and still kiss her, with the disparity in height. Lena gasped, drinking at his mouth greedily, her hands hungry across the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>Will caught her wrists and pressed her flat, tearing his mouth from hers. \u201cNo,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>Lena strained against his grip. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing that. Damn it, Will, you know I don\u2019t care you\u2019re verwulfen. I proved that!\u201d</p><p>He shoved away, rearing up on his knees. \u201cThat ain\u2019t the only problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d She ran her hands over her breasts, feeling the turgid peaks of her nipples through the thin lawn nightgown. \u201cWe both know that\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s face darkened and he rolled toward the edge of the bed. Realizing his intention, she wrapped her legs around his hips and rolled with him. Somehow she ended up straddling his hips. When Will looked at her in surprise, she seized the advantage and pushed him flat onto his back.</p><p>No force on earth could make him stay if he didn\u2019t want to with his strength. She pinned his wrists in a desperate maneuver and then realized that he made no attempt to leave. His gaze was fixed on her chest. Or the missing button that had somehow come off in the struggle, she presumed.</p><p>Sliding her hands down over the sculpted muscle of his arms, she sat up, resting them on his chest. His belt buckle dug into the tender flesh of her thigh and she shifted, riding over the hard bulge of his breeches. She knew enough to understand what that meant.</p><p>Both of them stilled.</p><p>\u201cI could hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, she brushed her mouth against his. Just lightly. Teasingly. \u201cI don\u2019t think you would,\u201d she breathed. Licking his lip and then suckling it into her mouth, something coppery burning on her tongue. Blood. His blood. The split in his lip.</p><p>His fingers sank into the soft flesh of her thighs and he sucked in a sharp breath. The strain of his erection brushed against her and she stilled, a flare of heat pulsing through her. How delicious a sensation. With a little shiver, she rolled her hips again, rubbing against him.</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes glazed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d He sucked in a sharp breath, the hiss of it rasping between his teeth. \u201cCan\u2019t think. When you do that. Damn it.\u201d His hand urged her against him. \u201cStop it, Lena.\u201d</p><p>Lena threw her head back, riding over him again. \u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d She gasped herself, wetness smothering her drawers. It felt so good. So right. And it was driving him wild.</p><p>He bared his teeth at her. The whites of his eyes were showing. \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you. I can\u2019t.\u201d His hands, however, told another story. They fisted in the hem of her nightgown, strain tautening the knuckles. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>Lena ground against him again. She was wet through, the sensation tearing another gasp from her lips.</p><p>The sound of ripping silk opened her eyes. The chill of the room penetrated and she looked down as he tore her nightgown up the center.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d</p><p>He leaned up, biting at her lips, tugging at her arms. This time there was no hesitation as he claimed her mouth roughly, jerking her hips against him. The nightgown hung from her shoulders, trapping her arms against her side. She wanted to touch him, to run her hands over the smooth skin of his biceps, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her breasts were bare, the hair on his chest rubbing against the sensitive tips. Sensation exploded through her and she lost time and any sense of propriety. Her careful, practiced kisses gave way to mindless hunger, driving her tongue against his, her body pressed hard to his own. Groaning, she shrugged the nightgown off her arms and then slid them around his neck.</p><p>His cock was huge and firm against her. Will bit her lip, then her chin, sliding his mouth down her throat. Lena threw her head back and moaned as he bit his way down her sensitive flesh.</p><p>\u201cGod, you taste so fuckin\u2019 good,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Arching her back, she dug her hands into his silky hair. His mouth rasped over her nipple, teeth grazing the sensitive bud. Lena\u2019s eyes went wide, her hips jerking involuntarily. It felt so good. Heat speared through her, sinking its claws into her stomach, and lower... She couldn\u2019t stop herself. Her body seemed owned by someone else. A creature of need. Of frenzied hungers. Thrusting her breast into his mouth, she raked her nails across his shoulders, through his hair, clenching wet fistfuls of it as his mouth wreaked havoc on her body.</p><p>Wild, amber eyes met hers and Will dragged her head back, suckling the tender skin of her throat, his teeth sinking into the smooth curve of her shoulder. The hair on his chest rasped against her breasts and Lena cried out, grabbing one of his hands, sliding it lower, over her thigh and under her nightgown. She needed him to touch her. Needed...something.</p><p>She writhed in a torment of embarrassment and desire as his palm ground between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she whispered, running her hands through his hair. She was so close... To what, she didn\u2019t know, but if he stopped right now, she\u2019d kill him.</p><p>An enormous clatter of sound broke through her concentration. Will stiffened, his fingers stilling.</p><p>Lena dragged his face back to hers, shaking her head. \u201cJust a drone,\u201d she whispered, licking at his mouth and tasting blood again. \u201cJust the servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena.\u201d He caught her wrists, withdrawing his mouth from hers. \u201cLena!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked up at her, his voice hoarse with desire, eyes wild with need. \u201cThis were a mistake.\u201d</p><p>The nervous anticipation faded. Lena caught his wrist as he pushed away from her and sat up. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mistake,\u201d he repeated harshly, forcing her grasping hands away.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have struck her a firmer blow. She yanked the ruins of her nightgown to her breasts and stared at him, despair aching in her chest. He couldn\u2019t do this to her again.</p><p>Taking a step back from the bed, he fumbled for his shirt. \u201cI have to go.\u201d That insane gleam was still in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she whispered, clinging to her torn nightgown. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Nobody would hear us. Nobody would ever know\u2014\u201d</p><p>The look he gave her was raw, ragged. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone, the wind and the rain tumbling into the room, lightning flashing against the casing.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>\u201cAnythin\u2019 on your mind?\u201d Blade asked.</p><p>Will smashed another fist into the punching bag, earning a grunt from Blade. He followed it up with a left-right-left combination, his knuckles burning. \u201cNot a thing,\u201d he grunted, unleashing an uppercut that drove the bag\u2014and Blade\u2014back a foot.</p><p>\u201cHold.\u201d Blade held up a hand, breathing hard. \u201cNeed a moment. You bin at this an \u2019our. Not all of us \u2019as the stamina these days.\u201d</p><p>Will raked a hand through his hair. He was barely winded. And still on edge. The memory of Lena\u2019s lithe little body was imprinted on his skin. He\u2019d spent half the night with a cock-stand, unable to keep his mind on his job. Rip had been prowling the rooftops of the rookery with him, keeping an eye on things. Finally, the other man had told him to buy a whore and get his mind back on duty before stalking off in disgust.</p><p>No woman. Not for him. He should never have gone to her last night. Never given in to the temptation.</p><p>He needed to ease the pressure the only way he knew how. A safe way.</p><p>\u201cYou want a bout in the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Blade looked up from where he was bent over, his hands on his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t know what\u2019s set you off this mornin\u2019, but I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere near those fists today.\u201d</p><p>Will turned, snatching at his towel. He loosened his collar and dragged the towel over the back of his neck. The urge to ask Blade for advice was nearly overwhelming. But Blade had his own worries, his own concerns. The last thing he needed was Will telling him he\u2019d nearly lost his mind last night and fucked his wife\u2019s sister. Or about the curious letter he\u2019d found on Lena and the threat of Colchester.</p><p>Neither of them could afford to have Blade drawn into a confrontation with the Echelon.</p><p>Blade raked his light brown hair out of his eyes. It seemed to be darkening with every passing day, courtesy of Honoria\u2019s vaccinated blood. Will scowled. He\u2019d been the one Blade had turned to when he feared he was close to becoming a vampire; the one who was supposed to kill him before that happened. He could thank Honoria for taking away the burden of that heavy task, but now another problem loomed.</p><p>Straightening up, Blade sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me with those bloody eyes. Fine. Mebbe a quick bout. Just remember, I ain\u2019t whoever\u2019s been givin\u2019 you grief.\u201d</p><p>Will kicked off his boots and stepped onto the soft carpeting, tossing his shirt over a nearby chair. Blade stripped down too, rubbing at his knuckles. Though shorter than Will by nearly a foot, he was lean and well-muscled\u2014and dangerously quick. There wasn\u2019t a trick he didn\u2019t know, and no sign of the knife wound he\u2019d taken. The craving virus had healed it completely.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t seen much of you this week,\u201d Blade said, drawing his fists up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeen busy.\u201d</p><p>Blade stepped forward with a right hook that Will bobbed out of the way to avoid. \u201cWho is she? You\u2019ve never \u2019ad a woman as I can recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot got one now.\u201d He ducked a tricky combination and slammed his fist forward, under Blade\u2019s guard.</p><p>Blade staggered back, grinding his teeth together. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s just pretend you\u2019re strung up tighter \u2019an a lute for no reason. Only thing as leads to that is woman trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Will ducked another right hook and stepped straight into Blade\u2019s left fist. The punch snapped his head back, but it lacked the force it once had. Years ago, Blade\u2019d been able to take him down to the mats at nearly every session. Now he was lucky if he could do it once a month.</p><p>Will shook his head and dodged a foot that Blade snapped toward his face. He barreled forward, his shoulder driving into Blade\u2019s midriff and his arms wrapping around him. Both of them went down hard.</p><p>Blade locked his legs around his waist and flipped him. Will took another punch to the face and tasted blood. Kicking Blade off, he rolled to his feet and wiped his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gettin\u2019 slower.\u201d</p><p>Blade\u2019s eyes narrowed and he drove a fist into Will\u2019s side. The breath expelled from Will\u2019s chest and he grunted, avoiding the next blow by an inch.</p> <p>\u201cSlow enough?\u201d Blade snarled.</p><p>Will looked up, his blood boiling around his ears. \u201cYou have to stop drinkin\u2019 her blood.\u201d</p><p>The words fell into the suddenly silent room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the \u2019ell do you mean by that?\u201d Blade asked, his hands lowering.</p><p>Cursing the reckless urge that had made him blurt it out, he shook his head. \u201cNaught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you do. You know exactly what you mean.\u201d Blade stared at the back of his hands, stretching out his fingers. \u201cMe skin\u2019s gettin\u2019 darker. Me hair too. And I\u2019m gettin\u2019 weaker. Weak and slow.\u201d Barking a laugh, he ran his hands through his hair. \u201cThree years ago I\u2019d \u2019ave killed to be more human. They says you ought be careful what you wish for.\u201d Sucking in a deep breath, he admitted, \u201cI\u2019ve only bin takin\u2019 enough of her blood for her not to be suspicious. The rest I drink cold, out o\u2019 the icebox. Honoria thinks me CV levels have reached a plateau.\u201d He looked down. \u201cIf the Echelon finds out, we\u2019re dead.\u201d</p> <p>Will nodded. The Devil of Whitechapel\u2019s reputation was the only thing keeping them out of the rookery. If they thought he had a weakness, they\u2019d be on him like a pack of dogs.</p><p>\u201cHow long \u2019ave you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year. Once I started beatin\u2019 you regular-like, I began to wonder,\u201d Will replied.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Blade turned around and stalked off the mats. \u201cI bin thinkin\u2019, maybe I oughta go back to drinkin\u2019 normal blood for a bit, get me CV levels up. But \u2019ow do I tell \u2019er that? She\u2019s obsessed with curin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>Will followed him, his muscles still distended. He wanted more work in the ring before Lena arrived for their lesson\u2014if she arrived\u2014but it was clear Blade was done with it. \u201cThe last thing I can offer is advice on women.\u201d</p><p>Blade barked a laugh. \u201cGod\u2019s truth.\u201d He snatched his shirt up and tugged it over his head. Unlike Will, his skin was dry. A blue blood didn\u2019t sweat.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to worry \u2019bout the Echelon. You ain\u2019t the only blue blood we got now. There\u2019s Rip and Charlie. And me.\u201d Will picked up his towel.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019ll the Echelon see? A rogue blue blood with a mech arm, a boy strugglin\u2019 to control his blood urges, and a beast that ought to be caged.\u201d</p> <p>It was the truth, but it still rankled. Will slung the towel over his shoulders and hung onto both ends. \u201cMight be true. But remember you ain\u2019t alone. They come for you and they\u2019ve got to go through me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be here forever.\u201d</p><p>Will stiffened. \u201cDidn\u2019t know I were leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Blade gave him a knowing look. \u201cYou need more than this, Will. I think you\u2019re just startin\u2019 to figure that out yourself.\u201d</p><p>Will opened his mouth to retort, but Blade\u2019s head cocked. Will heard the sound the second after. Skirts. Swishing on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHonoria.\u201d Blade looked around guiltily. \u201cShe can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t no fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Blade snarled and moved to open the door. \u201cNot \u2019til I work somethin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>Will turned, dragging the towel over his chest. Behind him, the door opened and Honoria\u2019s scent bled into the room. With a slight aftertaste of honeysuckle. His gut clenched. Lena. Directly on Honoria\u2019s heels. She\u2019d come for the lesson.</p><p>A part of him hadn\u2019t expected her to show up. Not after last night. With guilt and desire burning a ragged hole in his insides, he wiped the scowl from his face and reached for his shirt.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Honoria murmured to Blade. \u201cIs that blood on your knuckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Will forgot to duck.\u201d</p><p>His gaze went straight past the pair of them. Lena hovered in the doorway, looking every inch the society lady in lemon yellow. Her hair was artfully curled over one shoulder, hiding the bite mark on her neck, and a jaunty little bonnet set off the gleaming highlights in her dark hair.</p><p>Lena\u2019s gaze dropped, darting over the shirt in his hands and his bare chest before she looked away. A frozen little smile was etched on her full mouth. Her defense, he realized. The way she hid from the world, from her own family even. From him.</p><p>Her confession the night before made his chest ache. He\u2019d wanted to go after Colchester with an ax, but the sound of her pain tore something deep inside him. He\u2019d crushed her close, trying to hold the hurt away, but it was bone deep.</p><p>Alone. She\u2019d been alone through all of it. Unable to tell her family\u2014to burden her sister. Keeping that pretty little smile fixed in place as if nothing had ever happened when deep inside the wound festered and grew.</p><p>He tore his shirt over his head as Honoria lifted on her toes and pressed her lips affectionately against Blade\u2019s. It was too tempting right now to grab her by the shoulders and ask her where she\u2019d been when Lena was lying bleeding in an alley. He knew it wasn\u2019t her fault; circumstances had been what they were then, but the fury in him didn\u2019t recognize that. Instinct fought logic and he\u2019d been too long a wolf at heart not to go with his gut. He had to get out of here.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Will?\u201d Honoria asked, catching his movement out of the corner of her eye. The smile she wore was almost the same as Lena\u2019s, but far more genuine.</p><p>\u201cGot a lesson with Lena.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s head jerked up and crimson infused her cheeks. She looked him in the eye, her chin tilted with icy disdain. Cool. Untouchable. Carefree.</p><p>With the razor edge of hurt souring her scent.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know about that letter you brought me?\u201d Honoria asked. \u201cI\u2019ve made some progress with the code.\u201d</p><p>The brief flash of color drained out of Lena\u2019s face and her eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter me lesson.\u201d</p><p>Honoria murmured something to Blade as he strode to the door. Lena leaped out of his way as if afraid he\u2019d actually touch her. Too late for that, sweetheart. He\u2019d had his hands, his lips, his teeth all over her.</p><p>And it couldn\u2019t happen again.</p><p>Her presence drove him right to the edge and threatened to shove him off. She was too dangerous, too rousing. Even last night he\u2019d come back from the fury of passion to see the bite marks and bruises all over her pale skin. Verwulfen had walked through fire and lost arms and legs in such a state without even realizing. The fury, the wild, drove him to actions he couldn\u2019t remember, let alone control.</p><p>There would be nothing worse than seeing her blood on his skin. Or fear in her eyes. As much as he wanted her\u2014as much as he always had\u2014he could never trust himself.</p><p>And then there was the threat of the loupe itself.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he offered her his arm. \u201cComin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>This was all he would ever have of her. Stolen touches, stolen glances. And the desperate, longing ache in his chest and cock.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Resting her gloved fingertips lightly on his arm, she followed him out the door.</p><p>They\u2019d taken barely three steps before Lena wrenched her hand off his and spun to face him. \u201cYou told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2019ere.\u201d Not with Blade\u2019s hearing.</p><p>Anger stiffened her shoulders. Seizing a fistful of her skirts, she swept ahead of him. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>Considering her question, he placed a hand on the small of her back and directed her toward the kitchen. \u201cThe yard. Wait for me there. I\u2019ve somewhat for you.\u201d</p><p>Dark eyes glared back over her shoulder in suspicion. \u201cWhat is it? This is wasting valuable time, Will. You did well the other night, but there are a few things I need to go over with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>After a searching gaze, she threw up her hands and sighed. \u201cWhy not? Go and fetch it then. The sooner we\u2019re done, the sooner I can return home. I\u2019ve got to get ready for the dinner Leo\u2019s hosting.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hurt her last night. And done it deliberately. For a moment he wanted to step forward, catch her wrist, and tell her he\u2019d been wrong, that he was sorry. To lift her face to his and kiss her until she was gasping for breath again, her body turning molten under his touch.</p><p>But perhaps it were better if she were angry with him.</p><p>For the both of them.</p><p>Waiting until she\u2019d turned and departed for the yard, he thundered up the stairs and fetched the small bag he\u2019d left in Blade\u2019s sitting room. By the time he arrived in the yard, Lena was pacing, her arms crossed under her breasts and a sad, pensive little look on her face.</p><p>When she saw him, the expression melted as if it had never been there. With a disdainful lift of one eyebrow, she glanced at the bag. \u201cI can\u2019t accept any personal items. They\u2019re not the sort of things a man gives a woman he\u2019s not courting.\u201d Her tone turned frosty. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want any more mistakes of intention, now would we?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps giving her a pistol in this mood was tantamount to suicide.</p><p>He bit his tongue and dragged a small Hessian sack out of the leather bag. \u201cBought this for you. I ain\u2019t finished tinkerin\u2019 with it, but the sooner you learn to use it the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He opened the sack. The pistol gleamed against the rough cloth, the mother-of-pearl inlay fracturing the weak sunlight into a half-dozen rainbows.</p><p>\u201cA pistol?\u201d she said stupidly. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me a pistol?\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and eased the handgrip into it, closing his fingers around hers. \u201cSmall enough to fit in your reticule. You ever fired one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d Her dark eyes widened. \u201cWhen on earth would I have ever used a pistol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonoria knew how to use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather taught her. He had no time for me.\u201d</p><p>Will stroked his thumb over her gloved knuckles. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never clever enough to understand his work or half of what he said. He was a famous inventor. We had little in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clever. All that tinkerin\u2019 with clocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA useless hobby.\u201d She lowered the pistol. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been impressed. He would have been able to do it himself in half the time I could. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d The quietness of his words made her look up. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it. I used to watch you playin\u2019 on the rug with all them scattered pieces, puttin\u2019 them back like they was a puzzle. Baffled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you have other talents,\u201d she replied. Somehow he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d realized that he was still stroking her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re strong and not afraid of anything. You could kill a man with your bare hands.\u201d Something dark came into her eyes. Shadows that made his hackles rise. \u201cYou could kill a blue blood. I envy you, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this you can be strong. You can be fearless.\u201d</p><p>Her rancor faded. She looked at the pistol, seeing it with new eyes. \u201cDo you think I could kill a blue blood with this?\u201d</p><p>He tried to ignore the way her words stirred his temper. \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished with it. I\u2019ll modify it like your father done with Honoria\u2019s pistol. She taught me how to make them firebolt rounds. I\u2019ve seen \u2019em take a blue blood\u2019s head off before. Explodes like rotten melon.\u201d</p><p>Lena shivered. \u201cThat sounds dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have to use it once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A strange light came into her eyes. She was picturing it. Picturing Colchester\u2019s head exploding as the smoke from the pistol cleared. \u201cTeach me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Will faced the yard. It was brick, the walls that enclosed it almost eight feet high. Puss, the enormous mangy cat that considered Blade his servant, strolled along the wall, keeping an ugly green eye on them.</p><p>Ivy clung to two of the walls and a scrolled iron gate cut into the brick. Little pots of herbs and flowers gave it a sense of warmth, signs of Esme trying to turn the warren into some semblance of a home.</p> <p>He rolled a wine barrel up against the far wall, then fetched one of the old milk bottles that Esme had set out for collecting. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, setting it on top of the barrel. \u201cWe\u2019ll practice with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t people worry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the rookery?\u201d He cocked a brow. \u201cPeople hear gunshot at the warren and they\u2019ll turn and walk the other way. Fast. Just in case they get caught up in whatever mess they think\u2019s spillin\u2019 over.\u201d</p><p>Lena aimed the pistol wildly in the direction of the barrel. \u201cHow do we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith bullets,\u201d he said, unable to take his gaze off her. He\u2019d put that smile on her face. Chased the shadows from her eyes. Reaching into his pocket, he produced a handful. \u201cAnd by learnin\u2019 each part of the pistol\u2019s mechanisms.\u201d</p> <p>The wild light in her eyes was intoxicating. He fumbled with the bullets and placed one in her outstretched palm. She was oblivious to his breathlessness, peering at the pistol as though wondering what to do with it. He\u2019d never seen her like this outside of the bedroom last night. So alive. So passionate. Almost exuberant with delight.</p><p>Fearless.</p><p>He wanted to keep that look in her eyes forever. Colchester had threatened to snuff it out, but he wouldn\u2019t let the man. He\u2019d kill him first.</p><p>Lena felt his stare and looked up. The glow faded a little. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Not yet forgiven. Perhaps he never would be. Will sucked in a breath and gestured at the pistol. \u201cYou\u2019re holding it wrong. Here. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d protect her. Or teach her to protect herself.</p> <p>From Colchester.</p><p>From the world.</p><p>From himself.</p><p>Honoria swept her skirts to the side and nestled in her husband\u2019s lap. Blade leaned back in the armchair, watching her with a knowing look in his eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat \u2019ave you got planned?\u201d he muttered, a smile curling his lips.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she replied, toying with his collar. Running a finger down his shirt, she tried to look innocent as the texture changed from silk to the rougher velvet of his waistcoat. He\u2019d never outgrown his love of gaudy materials, despite her guiding influence. And she found she quite liked it. Where once the embroidered red waistcoat would have made her lift an eyebrow in sheer bewilderment that someone could truly wear such a thing, now it was as familiar to her as the sight of his face.</p><p>And the texture of it, the feel of the velvet and the roughened threads of embroidery against her skin... That was something she\u2019d grown far too fond of.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he drawled, snagging her wrist. \u201cI know when that devious little mind\u2019s tickin\u2019. I can practic\u2019ly hear the cogs\u2014\u201d</p> <p>An explosion of sound shattered the silence.</p><p>Honoria tumbled into the armchair as Blade leaped for the window, her foot striking the tea service and sending a cup tumbling. It smashed, porcelain shattering across the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she cried, her slippers crunching on the pieces as she sat up. \u201cAre we under attack?\u201d</p><p>Blade yanked aside the curtain of her laboratory\u2019s window, his face grim and his hand straying to one of the razors he carried at his belt. Then he leaned closer to the glass, a frown dawning. \u201cBloody \u2019ell.\u201d</p><p>Another gunshot sounded. Honoria jerked to her feet and hurried to his side. His stance relaxed, calming the erratic beat of her heart. If Blade wasn\u2019t concerned, then neither was she. She trusted his instincts implicitly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She lifted on her toes, trying to see. The window ledge hindered her, pressing into her waist. One too many crumpets of late, she suspected. After the months she\u2019d spent starving herself to feed Lena and Charlie, Blade had taken it upon himself to fatten her up, to good effect. He hated the thought that she\u2019d once been one step removed from selling her blood to the Drainers on the street out of sheer desperation.</p><p>With an amused smile, he directed her gaze to the yard below. \u201cYour sister\u2019s tryin\u2019 to murder a milk bottle. I suspect it\u2019ll survive some\u2019ow.\u201d</p><p>Honoria peered closer, pressing her face against the window. She could barely see for Will\u2019s broad shoulders. His body was curved around Lena\u2019s, his hands on her hips as he showed her the proper stance. Taking her sister by the wrist, he lifted the pistol, staring down the length of Lena\u2019s arm. Lena was not watching the target at all, her feelings written all over her face as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Blade swung her up into his arms with a laugh. \u201cNow where were we?\u201d He swept her back to the armchair and settled her in his lap.</p><p>Honoria straddled him in an entirely unladylike manner, her gaze straying to the window. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He caught her chin and turned her face to his. For once he looked entirely serious. \u201cIt were your decision to let them at this for once. She\u2019s older now. Old enough to deal with \u2019er own consequences. And you said you trusted \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked bluntly. He knew Will far better than she ever would.</p><p>Blade stroked the back of his fingers against her throat. \u201c\u2019E won\u2019t ever mean to \u2019urt \u2019er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he does?\u201d She\u2019d never forgive herself.</p><p>\u201cWe been o\u2019er this.\u201d His green eyes met hers. \u201cWe tried to separate \u2019em once and it were disastrous.\u201d He paused for a deep breath. \u201cI know she\u2019s your sister, luv. But I can\u2019t lose \u2019im. Not again. I\u2019m nearly there. \u2019E\u2019s thawin\u2019 to me. Spent more time under this roof in the last week than \u2019e\u2019s done in a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her lessons,\u201d she replied quietly.</p><p>\u201cFor her.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry so much, luv. Will\u2019s verwulfen. He\u2019d die before \u2019e ever \u2019urt someone \u2019e considered \u2019is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you so wary about them at the start? Why did you warn him away from her?\u201d</p><p>Another light kiss against her lips. She knew him well enough to know when he was trying to distract her. \u201cBlade,\u201d she warned, shoving at his chest.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 much. Just an ole story I once \u2019eard.\u201d</p><p>Honoria gave him her direst look and he held his hands up in defeat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Scandinavian law. They says no verwulfen can ever mate with a \u2019uman. On pain of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you know?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat a strange custom,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder why they\u2019d make a law like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask \u2019em if you want.\u201d</p><p>She considered that thought. \u201cI believe I will.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>The heat of his body imprinted itself on her skin. Lena swallowed hard, lifting the pistol and staring blindly at the target. How on earth did he think she could focus with him pressed against her like this? Her bustle was poor defense; even the corset did little to still the hard feel of his body. Especially when the memory of that body pressed against hers last night kept playing over and over in her mind.</p><p>His mouth on her breasts, teeth tugging at her nipples. Callused hands sliding between her legs and pressing the heel of his palm to the wetness there.</p><p>\u201c...through the sight like this... Here... Ease your finger over the trigger...\u201d His breath warmed her ear.</p><p>Lena pulled the trigger with a soft groan. Dust showered off the brick wall.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Will muttered. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to hurl the bloody thing at the milk bottle. Maybe she\u2019d have better chance of hitting it.</p><p>With a growl of disgust\u2014and frustration\u2014she turned and shoved it at him. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. We\u2019ve been at this for nearly an hour and my aim\u2019s growing worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it\u2014\u201d</p><p>The excitement of the pistol had long since worn off with his nearness. It only served to remind her of last night, and the mistake, as he called it. Her body was flushed with heat and her head had begun to pound. \u201cI think I\u2019m coming down with a chill. And you still haven\u2019t explained why you told Honoria about my letter. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten about that.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s gaze shuttered. \u201cI\u2019ve no head for codes meself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you involved my sister?\u201d she demanded. \u201cMy insatiably curious sister who can\u2019t help sticking her nose into other people\u2019s business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d A hint of anger flared in his eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me what you were involved in from the beginnin\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t have had to resort to drastic measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is my fault?\u201d</p><p>A strangled sound came from his throat. \u201cI ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 it\u2019s your fault. I just wish you\u2019d told me. Damn it, Lena. I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to help you. Do you know what it were like, seein\u2019 that message and knowin\u2019 you\u2019d got yourself in trouble? That you wouldn\u2019t tell me how to deal with it? How to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked for your help. I can handle this.\u201d Somehow. She crossed her arms over her chest, not quite able to meet his eyes. She\u2019d told him what she could.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you want my bloody help or not, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 it.\u201d He clutched her by the arms, grimly determined. \u201cNo matter where you go, I\u2019ll be watchin\u2019. I ain\u2019t lettin\u2019 no one near you. Not Colchester. Not the humanists. Not the Nighthawks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so determined to teach me how to use a pistol?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered to the amber-bronze of the wolf and back. \u201cThe only reason I won\u2019t be there is if I\u2019m dead,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re the last line of defense. I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to leave you without a weapon or the means to use it.\u201d</p><p>The words were chilling. \u201cNo.\u201d The thought of him lying at her feet, the warmth drained from his body, was almost enough to undo her. This was exactly what she hadn\u2019t wanted. The reason she\u2019d tried to keep him from discovering her secrets. She gripped his shirtsleeves in distress. Damn her resolve to keep a distant attitude today. This was his death he was speaking about. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never told you.\u201d</p><p>She should have kept lying to him, kept him in the dark. But she\u2019d been vulnerable last night, made so by revealing the secrets of Colchester\u2019s attack. The feel of his arms around her had undone her. She\u2019d never been able to share the attack with anyone, or grieve for the hurt it had caused. She\u2019d locked it up deep inside and pretended nothing was amiss.</p><p>\u201cToo late now.\u201d</p><p>Too late... Perhaps. Lena shook her head. She had to find some way to contain this disaster. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to involve yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no \u2018if\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf,\u201d she repeated, \u201cI let you involve yourself...then you will do so at my command. I mean it, Will. We work together\u2014under my direction\u2014or I\u2019ll cut all ties and stop this lunacy in its tracks. That means you don\u2019t breathe a word of this to Honoria or Blade. I don\u2019t want anyone else involved. It\u2019s bad enough that you are. I don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s blood on my hands.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed at the roughened stubble on his chin. No matter how often he shaved, he always seemed to have the shadow of growth along his jaw. \u201cWhat do you mean by workin\u2019 under your direction?\u201d</p><p>Lena let out a ragged breath. She hadn\u2019t been certain he\u2019d agree. \u201cI make the decisions. You don\u2019t go off on your own\u201d\u2014a sure way to get himself killed\u2014\u201cunless I say so. I need to work out what the humanists intend. I didn\u2019t fully understand the consequences of what I chose to do. Damn it, Will, I was so angry. I didn\u2019t ask enough questions. I don\u2019t think I wanted to know. And now I\u2019m involved and I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019m involved in.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI need to work that out before I do anything else. I know what they stand for\u2014the abolition of the blood taxes, equal rights for man, and a voice to vote with. I just don\u2019t know how they intend to go about that anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A swift arch of his eyebrows. \u201cSettin\u2019 fire to the drainin\u2019 factories ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to achieve that.\u201d</p><p>Nor would destroying this treaty. \u201cYes, well, Mr. Mandeville seemed certain it was some sort of guerrilla group within the whole.\u201d A slight pause. Just who had threatened her? The legitimate humanists or one of the rebellious ones? \u201cDo you agree to my terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019ll do your biddin\u2019,\u201d he finally said. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat type of condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you control of this. But if the situation turns nasty or looks dangerous, then you\u2019ll shut your pretty little mouth and listen to me.\u201d Lena opened her mouth to protest, but he pressed his forefinger against her lips, halting the stream of words. \u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cIt ain\u2019t up for negotiation. Any sign of danger and I\u2019m in charge, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her breath parted around his finger. Will\u2019s gaze dropped as though he felt it in other places and suddenly she did too. The heat of it made her squirm, her insides tying themselves into knots. The thought of tying herself to him, letting him dog her footsteps, was suddenly an unbearable agony.</p><p>And a necessary one.</p><p>Taking a step back, Lena put herself beyond reach of his hands\u2014those treacherous, tempting hands\u2014and smoothed her skirts. The simple action washed the emotion from her thoughts, and most likely her face. She had no choice in this matter. If she didn\u2019t agree he would only find another way to hobble her. At least this way she would be in control. Most of the time. \u201cYou\u2019re as stubborn as a bull,\u201d she muttered. \u201cFine. I agree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you break your word you\u2019ll regret it,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Mutiny flared. \u201cI already do.\u201d</p><p>Three exhausting hours later Will handed her up into the steam carriage she\u2019d arrived in. Lena settled against the plush velvet seats, barely noticing the steady jostle of the engine.</p><p>Hovering outside the carriage, he cast a swift glance around at the darkening streets. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, tugging a small paper-wrapped package from his waistcoat. \u201cI didn\u2019t just buy you the pistol.\u201d</p><p>Lena stared at the box in her gloved hands. Will wiped his hands on his trousers and shoved them deep into his pockets. The action only strained the material over his thighs, something she tried not to notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, rattling the box.</p> <p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>Tugging at the brown string that tied the package, she couldn\u2019t ignore his sudden tension. He leaned against the carriage, one hand on the open door as he watched her play with the strings. She had some mind to draw the moment out, to watch his unease grow, but there was no point. Those were the type of games she\u2019d played with him as a foolish young girl.</p><p>Tearing apart the paper, she unearthed a small red velvet box. A gold crown was embossed in the material. She knew exactly where it had come from. Most young ladies did. \u201cWill?\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI told you I couldn\u2019t accept personal items.\u201d</p><p>His warm hands slid over hers, forcing the box apart. \u201cConsider it practical then.\u201d</p><p>One last dying ray of sunlight gleamed through a blood red ruby. She almost snapped the box closed. Almost. \u201cI never asked you what you were doing in a jeweler\u2019s.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too beautiful. Too expensive.\u201d</p><p>Will fetched it out, the simple gold band tumbling into his hand. Engraved filigreed thorns wrapped around the ruby, holding it in place. \u201cSee here?\u201d He flicked one of the thorns and it sprang out, surprisingly sharp.</p><p>She reached out to test it with her finger and he snatched her hand away. \u201cIt\u2019s a poison ring, Lena. Took me ages to find a jeweler who had one.\u201d Leaning close, he glanced at the driver and whispered in her ear. \u201cFull of a hemlock concoction that\u2019ll incapacitate a blue blood for a few minutes. How long depends on how old he is, how much the cravin\u2019 virus has overtaken him.\u201d</p><p>He was giving her so much more than a ring. Another weapon. Another means to defend herself. Lena swallowed hard, staring at his face as he demonstrated how the ring would work.</p> <p>\u201cThis must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t spend much. Never \u2019ave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He eased the thorn back into its slot, then closed her fingers over it. That stubborn look she was starting to know so well crept over his face. \u201cIt ain\u2019t open to discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you think you\u2019re going to stop me from arguing from now on?\u201d</p><p>A rare smile softened his lips.</p><p>Lena sighed. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Slipping her glove off, she slid the beautiful ring over her finger. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaves me from worryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Lena stared into the ruby\u2019s facets. He wouldn\u2019t worry if he didn\u2019t care, would he? Her blood heated at the thought. Don\u2019t. She clenched her fist, hiding the ring from sight. Don\u2019t think this is any more than it is.</p><p>Raking a hand through his hair, he looked around. \u201cAbout last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>The warmth drained out of her face. \u201cNo,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou made it quite clear what last night was about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena, I need to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d She turned away, shoulders stiff and face frozen as she smoothed her skirts. \u201cI understand that I made a fool of myself. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gentleman would keep his mouth shut now,\u201d she reminded him, falling back on her lecture tone. Anything to hold herself together.</p><p>Will stared at her, his gaze an intimate touch she refused to meet. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI should be going. It\u2019s growing late. And there\u2019s that dinner I must attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly. Then I\u2019ll get back to work on Mr. Mandeville\u2019s commission. I need to finish the interior clockwork of the transformational. I\u2019m so very close. There\u2019s no need for you to check on me tonight. I promise I won\u2019t get into any trouble.\u201d</p><p>He considered her words for a long moment. Then reached inside his pocket again. \u201cI want you to keep this on you at all times,\u201d he said, pulling out a whistle. It hung on a fine gold chain and he slipped it over her head, then tucked it into the bodice of her dress as though he barely noticed the shuddering intake of her breath \u201cIt makes a sound you won\u2019t \u2019ear, but it\u2019ll alert any blue bloods\u2014or me\u2014in the vicinity if you need help.\u201d Stepping back, he shut the carriage door and nodded at the driver. \u201cI\u2019ll call on you tomorrow before the...the...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balloon launch,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cIn Hyde Park. With the Scandinavians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Will grimaced. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go up in one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of heights too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to ignore that.\u201d He let go of the carriage and stepped back, shooting her a direct look\u2014and a reminder. \u201cNo trouble tonight, Lena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I get into trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloody magnet for it.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>A ruby. He\u2019d bought her a ruby.</p><p>Lena held her bare hand out. She couldn\u2019t stop looking at it, watching the play of light through the polished gem. It was the size of her littlest fingernail. She\u2019d seen bigger. A dozen times over in the Echelon, where they liked to drape their thralls in jewels to indicate the status of their masters. But for Will to have bought her something like this made it more precious than the largest diamond in the world.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she leaned her head back against the seat. What was she going to do? How could she keep her heart safely locked away when he did things like this for her? For it was becoming dangerously apparent that her feelings for him were growing.</p><p>Dabbing at the perspiration across her brow, she sighed. From the pounding in her head, she was in for a good cup of willow bark tea when she got home.</p><p>A sudden jolt threw her across the seat.</p><p>Lena snatched at the carriage strap and glanced out the window. They\u2019d stopped. The driver was one of Leo\u2019s men, well skilled in the use of the horseless steam-driven carriages. Though they\u2019d barely left Whitechapel behind, the roads weren\u2019t bad and nobody would dare attack her this close to Blade\u2019s turf. Every man and woman in the rookery knew who the gilded hawk on the carriage belonged to. Blade had declared Leo safe passage to his realm. The cost of crossing his word was death.</p><p>\u201cCoachman?\u201d she called as the carriage careened to a halt. \u201cHenry?\u201d There was no sign of the footman riding on back as she glanced out the window. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted her. Considering it was early evening, the streets were frightfully deserted.</p><p>From the shadows of a nearby alley, a lambent blue eye suddenly lit up. Lena shrank back into the carriage as a shadow detached itself from the rest. It rose to a height of nearly six feet, then suddenly unfolded itself further until it stood almost eight or nine feet. The eerie gaslit blue of its eye was reminiscent of a metaljacket.</p><p>But no metaljacket had ever stood so tall.</p><p>Locking the carriage door, she looked around for something\u2014anything\u2014with which to defend herself. Only a few forlorn cushions greeted her gaze. Will had taken the pistol back, determined to improve it for her.</p><p>The metal creature stepped out of the alley, moving in large, jerking strides. It was a metaljacket, the overlapping plates of its chest and abdomen gleaming with cold steel. The head was square, crowned with a demonic steel helm. A thin slit of glass in its throat was the only sign of any weakness, and behind the glass were a pair of eyes. Human eyes.</p><p>Lifting its massive fist, it swung a blow toward her. Lena shrieked and dove across the seat as glass from the window sprayed throughout the carriage. She tore the other door open and fell onto the cobbles, collapsing in a puddle of yellow skirts.</p><p>Something tugged in her hair. Reaching up, she found the fine gold chain and followed it to the whistle Will had hung around her neck. Hydraulic hoses hissed behind her and the carriage shuddered. Lena stuck the whistle in her mouth and blew.</p><p>There was no sound. Nothing but steel screeching as the carriage slowly tipped on its edge, the monstrous creature trying to turn it over.</p><p>Grabbing her skirts, she bolted out of the way. The carriage smashed onto the cobbles, exactly where she\u2019d just been kneeling. Gasping for breath, she darted forward blindly and crashed into something solid and warm.</p><p>Hands caught her by the arms. Lena jerked back instinctively and tore free from a man\u2019s grip. A leering face came into view. He towered over her, wearing little more than a rough worker\u2019s jerkin and tight leather pants. A seeming arsenal of metal hung at his belt. She didn\u2019t take the time to look. Instead she turned and bolted back the way she\u2019d come.</p><p>Men were everywhere. Ducking under snatching hands, she ran through a gauntlet of ragged, mismatched bandits.</p><p>Sound whirred behind her. \u201cI\u2019ve got \u2019er.\u201d</p><p>Lena screamed as something wrapped around her ankles. Pitching forward onto her face, she hit the cobbles hard. Pain tore through her lip and her lungs shrank to a quarter of their size. For a moment she couldn\u2019t breathe. There was a great, gaping vacuum in her chest and she sucked and sucked for air but none came. Then suddenly her lungs expanded and she dragged in a huge, rasping breath.</p><p>It hurt all the way through her.</p><p>The slow step of a pair of boots sounded on the cobbles behind her as someone made their way toward her.</p><p>\u201cWe oughta hurry, Mendici.\u201d A young boy, by the sound of him. \u201cCan\u2019t keep the streets clear forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nobody gonna cry hue, Jeremy.\u201d The giant laughed. \u201cNot in these parts.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s gaze fell on the whistle, lying on the ground in front of her. She snatched for it but a boot came out of nowhere and ground it beneath his heel.</p><p>The giant smiled at her. \u201cWell, ain\u2019t you a pretty little puss?\u201d</p><p>She tried to scramble to her hands and knees. Her skirts were wrapped firmly around her ankles by a weighted rope and she got nowhere for her efforts. Behind her a heavy metal boot stepped forward, hydraulics hissing.</p><p>\u201cRollins,\u201d the giant gestured. \u201cPick her up and let\u2019s get movin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she mean with that whistle?\u201d A young lad with dirty cheeks came into view, his eyes darting nervously. \u201cWeren\u2019t no noise from it.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cWhat\u2019d you mean with that whistle?\u201d</p><p>Licking the blood from her split lip, she summoned a smile. She could barely see for the throbbing of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The metal automaton leaned down with a steely hiss, its enormous hand closing around her waist. \u201cGot her,\u201d called an echoing voice from within. Then it straightened and she caught a glimpse of the man encased in the metal.</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Mendici looked up at her as she dangled precariously. \u201cFrom whom? The Devil himself?\u201d</p><p>Several men laughed.</p> <p>\u201cWe know how to deal with the bleeders,\u201d one called.</p><p>\u201cStick \u2019em with a shiv coated in hemlock,\u201d another called, making a stabbing motion.</p><p>\u201cOr a screamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet Rollins and Percy on \u2019em,\u201d another called.</p><p>The laughter swelled.</p> <p>A shiver of unease ran through her. Far from being the threat it was, these men looked as though they\u2019d relish the idea, and they sounded remarkably well prepared to handle it. If Will had heard the whistle, he\u2019d be walking directly into an ambush. How she wished she\u2019d never blown it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boys.\u201d Mendici gave her a wink. \u201cLet\u2019s take her to see the master.\u201d</p><p>Will sat at the kitchen counter, watching Esme stir her stew. The smell of it made his mouth water. This was the one place that felt like home to him. He\u2019d spent hours here over the years, dozing lightly in the corner whilst Esme went about her jobs.</p><p>When she\u2019d first became Blade\u2019s thrall he\u2019d found her presence disconcerting. Until that moment, the warren had been strictly all-male and he\u2019d had little to do with women since his mother sold him to Tom Sturrett.</p><p>Esme had been grieving the loss of her husband, desperate straits forcing her to accept Blade\u2019s protection. It had been her that taught him to read and fed him good food when his body tried to outgrow him. Her that bandaged his cuts when his first forays into the rookery ended in fights\u2014fights that he\u2019d gone seeking.</p><p>He had little recollection of his own mother. Esme was as close as he was ever going to get.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d she murmured, tapping the wooden spoon against the pot and turning to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Lena?\u201d</p><p>The question shouldn\u2019t have shocked him. There were no secrets in the warren, with four of them owning preternatural hearing. But he couldn\u2019t recall ever saying anything that might have given them fodder for rumor. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d</p><p>Esme gave him a look. \u201cWilliam Carver, let\u2019s not pretend that I\u2019m in any way stupid. Or blind. You wouldn\u2019t want to insult me, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 goin\u2019 on between her and I. And that\u2019s the way I intend to keep it.\u201d</p><p>With a speculative look on her face, she wiped her hands on her apron and crossed to sit beside him. \u201cWhy?\u201d She slid a warm hand over his. \u201cIt\u2019s clear you have feelings for her, Will.\u201d</p><p>He scowled down at the scarred kitchen bench. \u201cI can\u2019t, Esme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn felt the same, you know,\u201d she whispered with a sympathetic look in her green eyes. \u201cHe was afraid to hurt me. Afraid he couldn\u2019t control himself around me. We took our time, but it\u2019s worked for us.\u201d</p><p>Will rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cEsme, it ain\u2019t that simple.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRip\u2019s got the cravin\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSpread through blood to blood contact. The loupe\u2019s different. Spread by blood, by a man\u2019s seed...\u201d</p><p>A knowing light came into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever be with her,\u201d he growled the words out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t subject her to a life like this. And that\u2019s if she survived the initial infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Will\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door smashed open.</p><p>Will shoved Esme behind him. Rip glowered in the doorway, his gaze following the hand that had pressed her into the corner. A dark light came into his menacing eyes and Will jerked his hands away, holding them up in the air. If it came down to it, he could take Rip and they both knew it. But right now the man wasn\u2019t thinking. Ruled by his own personal demons, all he saw was another man touching his wife.</p><p>\u201cJust protectin\u2019 her, Rip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, John?\u201d Esme asked.</p><p>\u201cHeard a whistle.\u201d His gaze darted over the pair of them. \u201cWhere\u2019s Blade? Anyone missin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Cold touched the back of Will\u2019s neck. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear it? How long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside the wall. Near Old Castle Street. \u2019Bout ten minutes ago mebbe.\u201d</p><p>On the way to Aldgate.</p><p>Lena. Heat roared through him, blanking his mind. He was moving before he thought about it, snatching the bladed half gloves off the bench and his hunting knife.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Rip asked, his voice sounding as though it were distorted through glass.</p><p>Esme grabbed Will\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s Lena, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was hauling himself up onto the gutters of the warren. The rookery stretched out in front of him, a maze of decrepit buildings and lean-tos. Taking a running leap, he headed for the wall that encircled Whitechapel.</p><p>Built fifty years ago, during the time of trouble when Blade had first come to the rookery, it stood nearly twenty feet high. More a symbol than a solid edifice, it had been constructed with whatever lay at hand, in order to keep the Echelon out.</p><p>Vaulting over the top of it, he dropped down onto a roof far below. Another jump and he was in the street.</p><p>People took one look at him and scattered. As he made his way to Old Castle Street, he saw a crowd hovered around something in the street. A glint of gilt caught his eye and his heart leaped into his throat. Shoving through the crowd, ignoring the cries, he staggered to a halt in front of the Caine carriage. It was tipped on its side, glass sprayed across the cobbles. Some enterprising sorts had already started trying to work the gilt free and the curtains were long gone.</p><p>Turning, he raked his gaze across the crowd, looking for someone he recognized. Bill the Tanner met his eyes and flinched. Will grabbed him by the collar.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Bill muttered, his breath stinking of gin and his mismatched eyes darting independently. \u201cWeren\u2019t \u2019ere, guv. Didn\u2019t see nuthin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Will drew him up until they were face to face, letting the heat\u2014the Beast\u2014wash through his eyes. \u201cDid you know I can smell it when a man lies? Think carefully, Bill, about whether you saw anythin\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Bill sobbed. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill me. Said they\u2019d do it if I breathed a word.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s fist tightened until Bill could barely breathe. \u201cWhat makes you think I won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Clawing at his collar, Bill\u2019s eyes boggled. \u201cThey got...a monster with \u2019em... A fire-breathin\u2019 monster! I can\u2019t. He\u2019ll roast me...like a leg o\u2019 lamb! Better you than them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took a young woman with them, didn\u2019t they? She\u2019s mine, Bill. My woman. And they took her.\u201d He forced his fist to open and dropped the man onto the cobbles before he killed him.</p><p>The urge to do so was almost overwhelming. The vein in his temple throbbed, his vision blanking at moments. Time and space became odd vignettes of sound and movement. Bill scrambled back across the cobbles and then the world blurred again.</p><p>Someone caught his wrist. He barely felt it. Looking down with a snarl, he stopped when he saw the young lad staring up at him with a face as white as a ghost.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt me da,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cThey went that way.\u201d Then he pointed toward the nearest alley, one that ended in a brick wall and a boarded tunnel into the old, abandoned ELU line.</p><p>The world came back, narrowing in with crystal precision on the boarded up tunnel. Of course.</p><p>\u201cUndertown.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Lena demanded, as someone tore the blindfold from her eyes.</p><p>Blinking against the phosphorescent glare of the smuggler\u2019s lanterns they carried, she looked around. Despite the chill to the air, perspiration dampened her hair. Her head felt like it was packed full of cotton stuffing, especially her sinuses.</p><p>The tunnels stank of mold and stale air. The men were quiet and moved with confidence; they\u2019d come this way often, she imagined.</p><p>A little quiver of fear ticked in her chest. The old abandoned tunnels of the Eastern Line were said to contain the ghosts of all those workers who had died when the tunnels collapsed. Some men had been crushed to death and others trapped in the darkness to slowly suffocate or starve. The ELU had given up on the scheme after it drove them into dun territory and nobody had ever bothered to see it finished. Slowly, year after year, the tunnels had been taken over by those enterprising enough to carve out a living below ground when the rookeries began spilling over.</p><p>People trying to hide from the Echelon or the Nighthawks for whatever reason, or those who were simply too poor to be able to rent one of the hovels above ground. She could only imagine how terrified they\u2019d been to live here, with the whisper of ghosts and the very real presence of the Slasher gangs\u2014those who strapped a man down on a gurney and drained him of his blood to sell to the draining factories.</p><p>Then three years ago the vampire had taken up residence here, glutting itself on everyone\u2019s blood until the tunnels were quiet again and there were even more ghosts to whisper. The vampire was gone, killed by Blade himself it was said, but the grim tunnels terrified her.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>The man they\u2019d called Mendici waved a hand in her direction. \u201cShut her up.\u201d He struck a flare stick against his leg and the burning phosphorescent glow lit up the pressing darkness. Holding it high, he took a cautious step forward, edging over the rail tracks. The tunnel opened into an enormous cavern, the rail tracks shearing off into nothing. Mendici kicked a rock over the edge and she listened quietly, barely breathing, waiting for it to hit the bottom.</p><p>A distant plop echoed up. Water. There was water down there.</p><p>Then something thrashed far below. Lena felt the blood run out of her face. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d A bead of perspiration raced down her throat into her bodice and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cThe Gatekeeper,\u201d the young boy muttered at her side. \u201cHere, you be quiet now. There\u2019s other things in the darkness. You don\u2019t want to wake \u2019em now, do you?\u201d</p><p>Lena stared at his pale, ghostly face and shook her head.</p><p>A steel cable stretched into the darkness. Mendici handed the flare stick to one of his men and pulled something out of his pocket. It looked like a metal rod with a hook on it. Snapping it open, he revealed a pair of handles, then he hung the hook over the cable and latched it tight.</p><p>Her gaze went straight to that yawning, gaping pit as she realized his intentions. No way. There was no way she was going over whatever hid in the depths of the waters.</p><p>Mendici snapped his fingers at her.</p><p>Lena shook her head but two of his men grabbed her by the arm and dragged her forward. Without ceremony, she was shoved against the burly giant\u2019s side and his arm slid around her hips.</p><p>\u201cRollins,\u201d Mendici called. \u201cYou\u2019d best go back. Can\u2019t bring Percy over this. Take him home and grease him up. Or whatever you do with that bloody thing.\u201d</p><p>The gaslit eye of the automaton flared to life. Then it turned, clanking steps echoing back down the hollow tunnel.</p><p>\u201cReady for the ride of your life, luv?\u201d Mendici grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He snatched a handful of her skirts and shoved her toward the chasm. Lena screamed, grabbing for his wrist. Her slippers danced on the edge of the cliff, pebbles crumbling beneath her feet as her horrified gaze met his.</p><p>\u201cChoice is yours. You can either swim, or you can go over on this.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to the tenuous handgrip. \u201cFine.\u201d She licked dry lips. \u201cI\u2019ll go over.\u201d</p><p>Mendici hauled her back against his side. \u201cYou hold on tight then. Wouldn\u2019t want me to slip.\u201d With a nasty chuckle, he dragged her hard against him. Through her corset, she could feel the hard muscle of the man and reluctantly put her arms around his neck. He took back his flare stick and held it between his teeth, then put both hands on the handles. \u201cRearry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With another laugh, he leaped out into nothingness.</p><p>Lena screamed, burying her face in his shoulder as they hurtled toward the far side of the cavern. Air rushed past her ears, cooling her flushed cheeks, and her skirts whipped around her legs. It felt like forever, but within moments he was curling his feet up underneath him and landing with a jolt on a rocky ledge.</p><p>\u201cRighto, boys. We\u2019re landed,\u201d he called.</p><p>Lena collapsed onto her hands and knees, her body shaking. She felt like she was going to cast up her accounts, the world still whirling around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBuck up, luv. You\u2019re safe. For now.\u201d Mendici unsnapped his hanger and tucked it away again. He hauled her to her feet, then peered closer. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling quite myself.\u201d</p><p>He clutched her chin, then felt her cheeks with the back of his hand. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re burnin\u2019 up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s been pounding all afternoon,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI believe I\u2019m coming down with a chill.\u201d</p> <p>The flare stick lit his face with an eerie green, highlighting the dark gleam of his good eye and the steel eye patch. Thought flickered behind his eye. \u201cAye, well don\u2019t come near me men. None of us need to be sick right now.\u201d</p><p>The young boy, Jeremy, came flying out of the darkness, his face alight with glee. He landed and staggered to a halt, then unsnapped his handle. \u201cI\u2019m done, boys!\u201d</p><p>One after the other they came sailing through the darkness until only two remained on the far ledge. Mendici dragged a pocket watch out and checked the time, pacing restlessly on the edge of the ledge. Lena leaned against the cavern wall, too exhausted to do anything. There was no point in trying to escape. They\u2019d run her down in seconds, and the idea of getting lost in these tunnels terrified her. Who knew what else lurked in the darkness, like the Gatekeeper?</p><p>A massive roar echoed through the tunnels. Mendici spun on his heel and squinted up into the dark.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d the young boy asked. \u201cMendici?\u201d</p> <p>Mendici held up a hand to quiet him. Another roar shattered the stillness of the tunnels. The two men on the ledge above raced to hook their hangers onto the cable, glancing over their shoulders. In the tunnel, flares of orange light flickered and died.</p><p>\u201cRollins,\u201d Mendici grunted. He cast her a dark look. \u201cLooks like them friends of yours decided to come play in our world. Hope you weren\u2019t too fond of \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>Lena drew herself to her feet, leaning hard against the wall. Will. The source of that enraged sound was suddenly apparent. \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d she said, staring up. Please be all right. Please don\u2019t be hurt.</p><p>Silence fell. The two men on the ledge glanced over their shoulders, their movements slowing. A relieved smile flickered over one of their faces.</p><p>Then one of the men stiffened. He shouted something and jumped for the cable. His body arced out into the air erratically. Barely a second later, the second man made his leap, dropping his flare stick on the ledge behind him.</p><p>Lena found herself holding her breath. Could Will truly take on the monstrous Percy and survive? The Greek fire that the Spitfires used could burn through anything, and she\u2019d seen the barrel of the flamethrower attached to Percy\u2019s mechanical arm.</p> <p>A shadow detached itself from the mouth of the tunnel, becoming a man with familiar broad shoulders. Lena let out a shuddering breath. He was alive.</p><p>Will stepped up to the ledge, the phosphorescent gleam highlighting his singed shirt. The light cast a play of shadows over the stark bones of his face. There was something in his hand. He held it up; Percy\u2019s square head.</p><p>Mendici sucked in a breath. \u201cBring me the girl.\u201d</p><p>Someone shoved her toward him. He grabbed a handful of her hair and pushed her forward, her slippers teetering on the edge of the ledge. Lena froze, staring up into the darkness. Will had stepped forward too, fury and frustration playing over his features. Only fifty feet separated them, but it might as well be a mile.</p><p>\u201cYou want \u2019er?\u201d Mendici roared. \u201cThen come and get \u2019er.\u201d</p><p>Lena glanced up at the nasty little smile on his face. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t, Will! I\u2019ll be fine\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hand wrapped around her mouth, cutting off her words.</p><p>Will wrapped a meaty fist around the cable and swung out, a grim look of determination on his face. Lena\u2019s heart leaped into her throat. Damn him. Why wouldn\u2019t he listen to her? Her heart hammered against her ribs. If he was hurt trying to save her, she\u2019d never forgive herself.</p> <p>\u201cReady, Lowerston?\u201d Mendici asked, watching Will swing hand after hand across the cable.</p><p>\u201cGot him,\u201d someone muttered behind her.</p><p>A thin, tubular shape lifted out of the corner of her eye. Lena turned her head, Mendici\u2019s hand sliding from her mouth loosely. Five feet behind her, a man peered through the sight on a rifle.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think. She\u2019d never reach him in time. Instead, watching his finger caress the trigger, she stepped in front of the rifle.</p><p>With a muttered curse he jerked the weapon up, an explosion of sound shooting into the darkened gloom of the cavern\u2019s roof. As soon as the bullet hit, it exploded, sparks cascading above like fireworks. A dozen screeching bats flew out of the shadows and a heavy silence fell, marred only by the sinuous stir of water far below.</p><p>Lena stared at the man with the rifle, her breath freezing in her chest. What the hell had she just done? If that had hit her, she\u2019d be little more than pieces of flesh and viscera, scattered across the ledge.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Mendici roared, ripping her out of the way and shaking her.</p><p>Icy dread slithered through her veins. \u201cNo,\u201d she heard herself say, the words clear and distinct. Her knees gave out and Mendici let her drop to the ground.</p><p>\u201cReload!\u201d he snapped at the rifleman, glancing sharply at Will as if to gauge his distance. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>Lowerston fumbled for bullets, his fingers shaking. Mendici\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to do this meself.\u201d</p><p>Dragging something out of his pocket, he held up a small metal cylinder. As his thumb pressed the button on top, she waited for the explosion.</p><p>Nothing came.</p><p>But Will lost his grip on the cable with one hand, his body jerking almost in pain. He clapped his arm over his ears and face, his body tucking up on itself. The other fist curled around the cable in an iron grip, his knuckles whitening.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you bastard.\u201d Mendici muttered, staring at him with a glittering eye.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hold out for long,\u201d the young lad piped up. \u201cNobody\u2019s held up against a screamer before.\u201d</p><p>Will slowly straightened, the muscles in his body rigid. Teeth ground together, his eyes flaring wild, he reached for the cable with the other hand, each movement slow and precise, as if he had to force his body to work properly.</p><p>Come on, she whispered silently, her hands clenched at his side. Barely twenty feet away now.</p><p>\u201cBloody \u2019ell,\u201d Lowerston said, sounding slightly awed. \u201c\u2019E\u2019s doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Mendici snarled, snatching an ax off one of his men. He strode toward the edge of the ledge, fist curled around the wooden haft. Not that it would do much good against a verwulfen in the full grip of the battle-fury. \u201cTime to meet the Gatekeeper.\u201d</p><p>He swung it\u2014not at the heavy iron cable, as she\u2019d expected\u2014but at the timber pulley that held it rigged to the wall.</p><p>The timber sheared away, hitting the floor then jerking out into the gaping darkness of the chasm.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lena screamed.</p><p>Will flew away into the darkness, his white shirt like a wraith. He hit the far side of the cliff, sliding several feet down the cable. Then he shuddered and plunged into the darkness below.</p><p>Seconds later\u2014what felt like hours\u2014she heard the splash as he hit the water and the hungry thrashing sound of whatever lurked below.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Will crawled out of the water with a snarl, his hands coated with grease and blood and a steel tentacle in his fist. His ears still rang, and the pain in his cheek told him he might have broken something. Fury boiled in his blood, along with the creeping lassitude of the aftermath of a rousing fight. He ignored it.</p><p>Forcing himself to his feet, he stared down at the limp steel tentacle. Whatever the hell that had been, it was vicious. He\u2019d barely found himself in the water before it was on him, steel limbs thrashing and reaching for him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember much of the fight\u2014he never could, really, beyond flashing images of sight and sound\u2014but he could vaguely recall the gaping maw that sucked in water to fuel its steam-driven core, and the razor-sharp threshing blades of its teeth. Smashing his fist straight through the thin steel sheeting of its body. The burning exhale of steam in his face as he tore a tentacle off it, using the weakness of the rivets to his own advantage.</p><p>That was where inventors made their fatal flaw with the metal monsters and automatons they created. For a metaljacket, it was the hinge of their knees and arms; for the steel-squid, it was the segmented join of the tentacles to its body. Tear that apart and all you had was a wounded shell that flopped around like a turtle on its back.</p><p>Destroying it hadn\u2019t been without cost, however.</p><p>Will staggered against a stalactite and pressed a hand to his side. His fingers came away sticky, a result of those iron teeth. Every muscle in his body throbbed with the ache of the fall and the way the smooth surface of the water had felt like he plunged onto heavy cobbles.</p><p>He wanted to stumble to the ground and sleep away the hurt. A fatal weakness for his species. Almost unstoppable once they were in a full fury, barely cognizant of injury or pain, verwulfen dropped like stones after the excitement wore off.</p><p>Will wiped the blood out of his eyes and staggered forward. Couldn\u2019t sleep. Not yet. Lena was out there. He\u2019d heard her scream as he plunged toward the water, heard the soul-shattering loss in her voice as she cried out.</p><p>Whoever had her\u2014and he was starting to get an idea of their identity\u2014they were going to wish they\u2019d never dared touch his woman.</p><p>They traveled along tunnels worn smooth from feet.</p><p>She saw none of it.</p><p>The men spoke and laughed amongst themselves, clapping Mendici on the back as though he were a hero.</p><p>She heard none of it.</p><p>She existed only in a world of dull color and muted sound, seeing Will tumble into the gloomy pit again and again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t survive that. Could he? The thought made her feel ill, a heavy weight sitting on her chest until she was afraid she couldn\u2019t breathe. Oh God, what had she done? She\u2019d blown that bloody whistle, afraid for her life, knowing that he would come for her and make everything safe for her again. But he hadn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t invincible. No matter how quickly he could heal, how strong he was, he was only flesh and bone in the end, the same as she was.</p><p>I\u2019ll always come for you. But this time she was on her own, for Will was...lost. She couldn\u2019t think of the alternative or she\u2019d break, becoming a blind, shivering thing, hovering in her own misery. She had to survive whatever was coming, had to find him, find out if...</p><p>She shook the thought away and looked up, trying to focus. Light bloomed ahead. A heavy iron door hung in the shadows, with a man guarding it. She glimpsed cold steel. His hand, a gauntlet of metal, with heavy, slatted plates to his elbow.</p><p>Mech work.</p><p>Cold etched its way down to her bones, but she felt strangely removed. To endure she\u2019d wrapped away that part that was screaming in grief and forced her mind to work analytically. To examine, understand, find a weakness...</p><p>Mech. The word whispered in her head. A mech. Bound to the enclaves and forced to work out their contracts to pay for the technology that had given them life or limb. Less than human, the Echelon decreed. Kept out of sight and out of mind.</p><p>\u201cWell met, brother,\u201d the guard said, stepping forward and clasping Mendici\u2019s arm. His curious gaze slid over her. \u201cThey\u2019re inside. Waiting. You weren\u2019t followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were,\u201d Mendici replied. \u201cThe Gatekeeper\u2019s probably picking the remains of \u2019im out of \u2019is teeth.\u201d</p><p>Another stab to the heart. Lena sucked in a sharp breath. She couldn\u2019t go there, to that cold, empty place deep inside. Not yet.</p><p>The stranger nodded, running his gaze over the ragged group. \u201cGet yourself something to warm your bellies. I\u2019ll take her through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll come,\u201d Mendici announced, tucking his thumbs behind his belt. \u201cI\u2019m wonderin\u2019 as to what this is all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHimself\u2019s in a curious mood,\u201d the stranger warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve as much a right to be there as \u2019im. I\u2019ve as much a right as any free man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can explain that to him. Come.\u201d The stranger gestured to her.</p><p>Shoving open the iron door revealed a room in the middle of all the tunnels. Crates were stacked floor to ceiling, and candlelight flickered, warming the shadows. Its glow stretched only so far, though. She couldn\u2019t see where the walls began. Only an endless maze of crates.</p><p>The murmur of voices drew them out of the darkness like a beacon. Mendici rapped at another door, his gaze dropping away. Not as confident as he appeared.</p><p>A slit in the door slid open and a single gray eye stared through. Then the slit slammed shut and the clicking of a lock sounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>The voice was soft, melodic. A man used to the well-toned inflection of command. The door opened and light spilled through, blinding her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cHad to take care of a little something,\u201d Mendici replied, stepping through.</p> <p>Lena glared at his back. His dismissive words hurt. Will was more than a little something. Brave and strong and stubborn, he had more worth in his little finger than Mendici had in his entire body.</p><p>\u201cThis her?\u201d</p><p>Lena felt the shove from behind as she stepped through the door. Her eyes slowly adjusted to the light. The room beyond held an enormous table ringed with twelve chairs and the remains of a meal. A pair of women looked up from the table, one sprawled with an arrogant grace in her chair and the other rifling through a sheaf of notes. Her hands were stained with ink, her eyes warm and dark with curiosity. She wore a pair of tight men\u2019s trousers and a white shirt cinched against her lush curves with a gray tweed waistcoat. A pair of magnifying goggles were pushed back on her coppery hair and her right hand was a metal gauntlet, the fingers moving with a delicate grace Lena had rarely seen. A gold pocket watch drew the eye to her breast, but Lena was certain the effect was unconscious.</p><p>Another mech.</p><p>The other woman wore a black leather coat, buttoned up the left breast with brass buttons. Gleaming epaulets crowned her shoulders, and her boots encased muscular calves. She flicked the ash on her cheroot, her catlike hazel eyes raking over Lena. One glance and the cold gaze moved on, lip curling dismissively. \u201cYou wasted all that effort on this?\u201d</p> <p>A man stepped out of the shadows, the same man who\u2019d answered the door. His hand curled over the woman\u2019s shoulder, slightly possessive. \u201cPatience, Ingrid. That\u2019s no way to treat a guest.\u201d The voice shivered across the skin. A man used to hypnotizing people with that alone. A showman.</p><p>A patchwork coat framed his lean body. At first glance the coat looked shabby and mean, but Lena hadn\u2019t spent hours grinding her teeth in boredom over her sewing for nothing. The coat was deceptively fine, the patches quite deliberately placed, she was certain. A stained cravat spilled from the open throat of his shirt, and his black gloves were cut off at the fingers, revealing the tanned skin of his fingers.</p><p>But that was not what drew her eye. A leather strap held a monocular brass eyepiece over one eye, his mouth hidden by a brass and leather half mask. Together they obscured his face so that all she could see was one piercing gray eye. His hair was the same dark copper as the first woman\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cA guest?\u201d Lena demanded, shaking off her dull wits. \u201cYour hospitality is somewhat lacking. Who are you? What do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wished to see Mercury, did you not?\u201d His hands spread wide, palms facing her.</p><p>The words stole the breath from her lungs. \u201cMercury? You\u2019re Mercury?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you, my delightful Miss Todd, are a rather surprising little package.\u201d His fingers absently stroked Ingrid\u2019s thick brown hair. \u201cThis is one of our little pigeons,\u201d he murmured to his comrade. \u201cA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the resourceful Mr. Mandeville. And quite resourceful herself. She\u2019s the mind and hands behind our gift to the Scandinavian embassy.\u201d</p><p>The way he acted, the slight edge of mocking humor that curled over every word... It made her teeth grate. He\u2019d kidnapped her from the streets when she would have gone willingly. If he\u2019d simply asked, Will would be sitting in the warren, dining with the rest of her family.</p><p>Tears sprang into her eyes. The praise was meaningless, the entire cause was meaningless. She could summon nothing but grief. \u201cWhy the charade? Your men could have asked me to come. One mention of your name and I would have been willing.\u201d A dark glare at Mendici. \u201cYou\u2019ve destroyed my guardian\u2019s carriage, knocked my footmen unconscious, and...hurt a man I consider a friend. Now you assume I should have some goodwill toward you remaining.\u201d</p><p>Mercury\u2019s fingers froze, the smile faltering. He glanced at Mendici as if in search of explanation.</p><p>\u201cHer guardian\u2019s a bleeder,\u201d Mendici replied with a sneer. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d smash every one of his pretty little carriages. And your so-called friend, my dear, clearly weren\u2019t human. Not to have taken on Percy in such a way, or to cross that cable so swiftly.\u201d His lip curled. \u201cI don\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you expect me to trust you,\u201d Lena retorted. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want any further part of this. I thought the humanists wished to be equal, but you don\u2019t. You want to reverse the social order instead, to grind the Echelon and the blue bloods beneath your heel. To make of them slaves, or little better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make them dead,\u201d Mendici snapped back.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not all inhuman,\u201d she replied. \u201cI have met some few who I consider trustworthy and heroic. My own brother-in-law is the Devil of Whitechapel and considers his men his family. My guardian is equally kindly and treats his thralls with respect\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d Mendici snarled to Mercury. \u201cShe\u2019s a friggin\u2019 bleeder lover! I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s whorin\u2019 for \u2019em. Daresay if we ever locate that man\u2019s body we\u2019ll find he\u2019s into the first cycle of the craving. Certainly didn\u2019t like the screamer none\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lena turned on him in a rage, her fists clenched. \u201cWill is not a blue blood, you filth. If you had half his courage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Mercury roared. He pushed away from the wall and threw a dark glance at Mendici. \u201cI believe I gave orders that you and your men were to seek a warm belly and bed. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Mendici crossed his arms over his massive chest. \u201cSome of the men are wonderin\u2019 about your latest orders. And the lenience you\u2019ve shown the last batch of blue bloods we caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re questioning me?\u201d The words were silky soft. Deadly.</p><p>\u201cMe and the men, we don\u2019t like it none.\u201d Mendici scowled. He held up his mech hand. \u201cYou promised us revenge, for this. For those hell-spawned enclaves. We didn\u2019t risk our lives, lose our friends, to break out of the enclaves for nothing. I want blood. Blue blood. I want to see all their heads on bleedin\u2019 spikes.\u201d He pointed a finger at her. \u201cWhy\u2019s she so important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she is a set of ears where we have none,\u201d Mercury replied.</p><p>Another sneer. Mendici took a warning step forward, his hand slipping to his side. When it came up, he was holding a pistol. \u201cThere\u2019s some as says you\u2019re growin\u2019 weak. Merciful. We\u2019ve been talkin\u2019, me and the boys\u2014\u201d</p><p>A pistol retorted.</p><p>A small red hole bloomed in the middle of his forehead and, mouth agape, he slowly toppled backward. The clatter of his steel-plated jerkin as he hit the ground jarred her nerves.</p><p>Lena scrambled backward, her spine hitting the wall. The room was still as everyone in it turned tentative gazes toward the woman with the smoking pistol.</p><p>Her ink-stained hands didn\u2019t so much as shake as she lowered the weapon. Lips thinning, she gestured to Ingrid. \u201cGet rid of him. See that the others understand what we do with those who speak of mutiny here.\u201d</p><p>The brunette ground her cheroot out and rolled to her feet. Lena hadn\u2019t realized until that moment how tall the woman was. Nearly a good inch on Mercury, with broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist. Only the lush curve of her breasts and hips saved her from a masculine figure.</p><p>Wrenching Mendici up by his arm, she threw him over her shoulder with the same amount of effort Will might expend. \u201cYou\u2019re certain of this, Rosalind?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe men liked him.\u201d</p><p>The petite redhead nodded sharply. \u201cI cannot risk insubordination. Not now, when we\u2019re so close. Take him away.\u201d She glanced toward the masked figure leaning against the wall. \u201cLeave us,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His gaze flickered toward Lena.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to know if she can trust us,\u201d Rosalind replied to the unspoken question. Their gazes met. Held. \u201cPerhaps a show of trust is what she needs.\u201d</p><p>With a flamboyant shrug of his shoulders, he stepped toward the door. \u201cOn your head, so be it. I\u2019ll go see if I can help Ingrid find out whose tongues have been flapping. And how far it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Two steps and he was through the door, with Ingrid on his heels.</p><p>It shut behind them and Lena turned to face the woman. They were much of a height and perhaps even age. Or perhaps not. Rosalind\u2019s pale skin bore the creaminess of youth and her tip-tilted nose gave her a permanently youthful appearance. Yet the command with which she had spoken was not that of someone untried.</p><p>You wished to see Mercury, did you not?</p><p>It was only now that Lena realized that the man had never directly referred to himself as such.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mercury, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Those plump lips pursed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to harm you.\u201d Rosalind slid the pistol into a holster at her hip with a dexterity and ease that Lena envied.</p><p>\u201cWho was he? The man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother, Jack. He is also Mercury. As is Ingrid at times. Mercury has worn many names and faces over the years, the better to hide from the Echelon.\u201d Rosalind smiled slightly, gesturing toward a chair. \u201cSit. Talk with me. We\u2019ve been very curious about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d Lena dragged out a chair, giving herself plenty of room to move if she needed to. This pretty, pouting young woman seemed friendly enough, but she wouldn\u2019t forget the ease with which she\u2019d killed a man. Nor the cool, emotionless look in her eyes as she\u2019d done it.</p><p>Rosalind eased into her chair, leaning back with her arms slung across the chair backs next to her. Calculation cooled her brown eyes. \u201cThere are very few who know the truth behind Mercury\u2019s secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never reveal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if your sympathies toward the organization are conflicted?\u201d</p><p>Lena paused for a moment. \u201cI would not betray you. If I choose to turn my back on this, then I\u2019ll walk away and try to forget everything I ever saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk away?\u201d Rosalind murmured. \u201cTo where? Your life at court? To beg a blue blood to take mercy on you and take you as thrall? How long do you imagine that will last, with your inability to allow a blue blood to feed?\u201d</p><p>The only person who knew that was Mr. Mandeville. The betrayal raked her with iron claws.</p><p>Rosalind tidied the piles of paper in front of her, then pushed them across the table toward her. \u201cThis is everything that we know about you. Compiled carefully in the last year. Jack and Ingrid might think this a risk, telling you of Mercury\u2019s secret, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d dare.\u201d</p><p>A charcoal sketch rested on top. Lena stared down into her own face. The rendering was exquisite, but the expression was slightly disdainful, one eyebrow arched in dismissal. A pretty, hardened flirt.</p><p>She lifted it carefully, revealing details about her and her life. Charlie\u2019s name. That made her blood boil. Honoria. Even Blade and Will. The detail went further, examining the minutiae of her life. When she came and went from Caine House. A brief question about why Leo had taken her as his ward, that had been circled in red ink, and daily details about her relationship with him that were shockingly intimate.</p><p>No sign of her sharing his bed. Or her blood. I cannot quite fathom the relationship as yet, but I will...</p><p>Another page.</p><p>They joked of her sister, Honoria, this morning as if he knew her well. Does the relationship go deeper?</p><p>And further down.</p><p>I find it curious that the Duke of Caine has forgone visiting the house since the arrival of the girl. I\u2019ve spoken to the servants, the thralls about it. His Grace came regularly each Sunday afternoon to play chess with his son but does so no longer. They have never been close, but one thrall claims that she heard them arguing about Miss Todd. His Grace insisted quite strongly that his son \u201cremove that two-faced snake\u201d from his house but the son refused. Something about this situation strikes me as out of the ordinary. Why would the duke\u2019s heir take such a no-account girl as his ward? The duke was once her father\u2019s patron, but by all accounts that ended badly, though I don\u2019t know why. I will endeavor to find more.</p><p>A traitor in Caine House who\u2019d been watching her every move. Icy fingers ran through her. \u201cMrs. Wade,\u201d she whispered, suddenly afraid for Leo. If anyone realized precisely what their relationship was he\u2019d be ruined. Or worse.</p><p>\u201cHer loyalty was easy to buy. She has some outstanding debts,\u201d Rosalind explained. \u201cYou were a potential liability from the start. One with access to a great deal of resources. We took a vote on whether you were too dangerous to use. Ingrid wanted to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Lena shoved to her feet, the chair squealing on the floor. She couldn\u2019t stop shivering. The sweats from earlier had vanished, her body feeling as though someone had turned a faucet from hot to cold. \u201cWhat do you intend to do with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I wanted you dead, you would be. That was never my intention.\u201d Rosalind gestured to the side. \u201cWould you like some tea? You\u2019ve gone white as a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any of your damned tea, thank you very much. And considering recent events I\u2019m not sure I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMendici? That was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the humanist who held a damned knife to my throat the other day and threatened my brother!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Rosalind stilled. \u201cI know nothing of this.\u201d</p><p>Lena licked her lips, uncertain whether to believe her or not. \u201cYou want me to break the treaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Mr. Mandeville no, that you wanted to meet with us first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen someone wasn\u2019t listening,\u201d Lena replied. \u201cI was delivering Mandeville\u2019s message to my contact in the Echelon.\u201d She tipped her chin up. \u201cSomeone accosted me and held a knife to my throat. They said I had to destroy the treaty or they\u2019d hurt my brother. They had one of his toys, from his room. A place nobody should be able to get to. And,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthey were a blue blood.\u201d</p> <p>The color washed out of Rosalind\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? They didn\u2019t follow you there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knew the humanist codes,\u201d Lena replied. \u201cKnew things only someone close to the Council could know. About Will\u2019s involvement in the treaty. And where I would be delivering the letter to. It had to be my contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat had nothing to do with us,\u201d Rosalind said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in charge?\u201d</p><p>A long, drawn-out moment. \u201cNot everything around here is what it seems,\u201d Rosalind murmured. \u201cWhat if I told you the draining factories were not our doing? That I knew nothing of this threat against you?\u201d</p><p>Lena stared her in the eye, forcing herself to be strong. Have courage. Like Will would. No, don\u2019t think of that. She balled her fists. Choked the pain down. She could fall apart later. \u201cWhat if I told you I didn\u2019t believe you?\u201d</p> <p>Rosalind grimaced and leaned back in her chair. \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you must never leave this room.\u201d At Lena\u2019s nod she continued. \u201cAs I\u2019m certain you\u2019ve realized, there are two factions amongst the humanists. Those that fight for freedom and those that fight for revenge. It wasn\u2019t always so, but a year ago we made a daring attack on one of the enclaves and freed a group of mechs. We needed their skills in working metal. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve not been as cooperative as we\u2019d hoped for. There\u2019s a splinter group within the faction, taking matters into their own hands and using our name and information to wreak havoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not cut your ties with them?\u201d</p><p>Another long look as if wondering whether to trust her. \u201cCome,\u201d Rosalind finally said, pushing to her feet. \u201cI have something to show you.\u201d</p><p>There was no point resisting. And she was starting to grow curious now. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the cellars.\u201d</p><p>Pushing into the dark corridor, Rosalind grabbed a lantern from the wall and led her along the tunnel until they finally came to a small door. The smell of chemical lingered in the air. Hanging the lantern from a nail in the wall, Rosalind tugged a key from her shirt and opened the door ahead of them.</p><p>Dark shadows waited silently, the faint gleam of lantern light shining off cold steel. Rosalind lifted the lantern and stepped through, spilling light into the enormous cavern and chasing away the shadows. Dozens of enormous automatons sat still and silent, the spark of gaslight absent from their eyes. Dozens more of the metal suits that Rollins had been strapped into. Rows of Percys.</p><p>\u201cThese are the Cyclops.\u201d Pride warmed the other woman\u2019s voice and she handed the lantern to Lena. Stepping forward, she ran a hand over the hydraulic hose of the heavy steel arm. The hollow tube of the flamethrower on its arm gleamed.</p> <p>Leaning under the arm, Rosalind hit a button. With a hiss, the chest cavity opened and the head slid back revealing a hollow space wide enough to fit a man. Rosalind stepped up on the Cyclops\u2019s bent knee and hopped into the cavity. Turning around, she eased back and slid a leather harness around her chest and waist. Two handles rested at arm height. She gripped them, pressing a number of levers and twisting a dial. The steel carapace of the chest slid back into place, a thrumming sound coming from deep within.</p><p>\u201cTakes a few minutes to heat the boiler packs,\u201d Rosalind explained, her small, heart-shaped face peering over the top of the chest piece. With an expression of concentration, she toyed with something inside and then the hydraulic hoses hissed, the Cyclops straightening to its full height of ten feet. \u201cThey\u2019re fully mobile, with more flexibility and control than a metaljacket and run on a liter of water a day.\u201d With a sudden smile, she forced the arm to lift. \u201cWe modeled the flamethrowers on the Spitfires. Burns like buggery when you hit something with it.\u201d The fingers on the end of the iron arm gave a wiggle, revealing complete dexterity. \u201cMech work,\u201d Rosalind explained. \u201cThe whole thing is mech work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you need them.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind grimaced and the Cyclops sank back down, its engines fading. She slung the steel chest plate open and hopped down. \u201cAye. The plans were ours.\u201d A brief look in her direction. \u201cBut the work\u2019s theirs.\u201d A rusty laugh. \u201cThe Echelon forced them into the enclaves to work steel for them and earn out the repayment of their mech enhancements. Not once did they suspect we\u2019d turn their own technology\u2014the skills they taught the mechs\u2014against them. It\u2019s the one thing we humans have never been able to counter. We might have been able to overwhelm the blue bloods in France and put them to the guillotine, but our blue bloods are smarter and hide behind automaton armies. Human flesh can\u2019t fight metal. So we must even the odds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fight for freedom,\u201d Lena said, with a slightly sarcastic lilt. \u201cIt sounds remarkably like fighting for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the Echelon are simply going to turn around and give us our rights?\u201d A hint of anger stirred Rosalind\u2019s voice. \u201cPerhaps if we ask nicely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already do. Four hundred and thirty men and women took to the streets to protest against the latest hike in the blood taxes. The Echelon mowed them down with the Trojan cavalry, leaving barely a hundred alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have raised the blood taxes if the draining factories hadn\u2019t exploded. Now there\u2019s a shortage and the Echelon need blood fast. Don\u2019t you see? This becomes a cycle of blood and death!\u201d</p><p>Rosalind jerked the lantern out of Lena\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I thought you would understand. Especially considering where the plans for the Cyclops came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own father. Sir Artemus Todd, with his brilliant, erratic mind. He spent the last year of his life discovering a blue blood\u2019s weaknesses. We use the toxin he created to incapacitate them and his firebolt bullets to kill them. Instead of fleeing from Vickers with you, with his family, he risked his life to place his final plans for the Cyclops in our hands. It cost him everything, but he\u2019ll forever be remembered amongst our ranks.\u201d</p><p>Lena could barely remember the night they\u2019d been forced to flee. Being shaken awake early in the morning and bundled into a carriage. Her father demanding that she look after Charlie, and though she\u2019d seen him speaking with Honoria, pressing a coded diary into her hands, she hadn\u2019t caught any of their words.</p><p>That night had changed her life forever. Torn from her lessons, her world, her hopes of a future amongst the Echelon, she\u2019d been dragged into the dark, grim confines of the rookeries. All she\u2019d known was that her father\u2019s patron Vickers\u2014the duke for whom he performed his brilliant experiments\u2014wanted them dead.</p><p>She\u2019d never known why.</p><p>\u201cFather was a humanist?\u201d she asked, her voice breaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cTo the bone.\u201d</p><p>Another shock on a seemingly never-ending series of them. Lena reached out, trying to find the wall as her knees shook.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted you,\u201d Rosalind continued. \u201cYour sister had betrayed his memory by marrying a blue blood. She could be of no use to us. You, however, showed some skill with clockwork and cogs. You design things that could be useful\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s mind made the leap. \u201cYou think I could learn to create the Cyclops?\u201d Then there would be no more need for the mechs. Would Rosalind\u2014or Mercury rather, for she was starting to see the difference between the two\u2014simply have them killed? The way she\u2019d done to Mendici? A shiver ran down her spine. What would Mercury do if Lena said no?</p><p>There was nowhere to run. To hide. No allies remaining. Not even\u2014</p><p>No, don\u2019t think of him. She squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep, steadying breath, trying to ignore the nausea.</p><p>Think.</p><p>The only way Rosalind could have known of Lena\u2019s skill with clockwork was from Mr. Mandeville. Suddenly the way he\u2019d always watched over her so carefully became something far more sinister.</p><p>\u201cI design toys,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut you could make a Cyclops.\u201d Rosalind took a step closer. \u201cThe transformational clockwork is proof that you have the skill and the ability to design such things.\u201d Her eyes lit up like warmed chocolate. \u201cYou would be a hero.\u201d</p><p>A hero. Three weeks ago, she might have still cared for such things. Recognition, finally, but never from her father. He had died for the same schemes that lit this woman\u2019s face with excitement.</p><p>Everything in her life was a lie. Mrs. Wade spied on her and Mr. Mandeville too, no doubt. Her father, a man who\u2019d virtually ignored her as some kind of little doll, had designed weapons to take the Echelon down.</p><p>And Honoria had likely known.</p><p>Lena leaned her head back against the wall and closed her eyes. Who could she trust? There were so many secrets she felt as if her head was going to explode. But then she\u2019d been keeping her own from her family too, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>The loneliness hit her like a punch to the gut. No one to trust, no one to tell. Nobody who knew her secrets or had shared their own. Nobody except Will and he was\u2014</p><p>Lena lurched to her knees and threw up, her whole body shaking in misery. She\u2019d been trying so hard not to think of him, trying to keep the hurt buried, but it welled up, choking her, forcing her stomach to heave.</p><p>Tears burned in her eyes and she wiped her face with her sleeve. Oh God, what was she going to do? How was she going to tell Blade that Will...that he was gone? The thought was inconceivable. He was so large, so full of life and heat and fire, his eyes snapping amber flames whenever she looked at him. She couldn\u2019t bear the fist of pain deep inside. She needed to see the body, needed to get him back to her. To bury him properly.</p><p>To tell him that if she\u2019d ever suspected he might have kissed her back, then she would never have returned to the Echelon. To this mess.</p><p>But first she had to get out of here. She looked up. At the pair of shiny boots in front of her, and the rows of metal drones.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite the answer I was hoping for,\u201d Rosalind said quietly. The hammer on the pistol drew back. \u201cHow disappointing. Come. Get to your feet. I\u2019ve no further use for you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Lena said, staring at the barrel of the pistol. Her father\u2019s own design. How ironic. \u201cI want nothing more to do with this. All I want is to go home and forget this whole nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind knelt down, the pistol resting on her knee. \u201cDidn\u2019t you realize? This isn\u2019t a game, Miss Todd. You know too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t breathe a word of it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not sure I believe you.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness welled. \u201cYou were never going to let me go, were you? You\u2019re worse than the blue bloods, than the Echelon. You use people, then discard them when they no longer suit your purposes.\u201d</p><p>A distant look came into the other woman\u2019s eyes. Her eyelashes lowered, fluttering against pale cheeks. \u201cIt surprises me how innocent you still are.\u201d A bitter smile. \u201cI am what I have been made. A weapon. A hunting hawk, finally unleashed from its master\u2019s jesses. There can be no mercy, for I expect none.\u201d</p><p>The gun wavered again.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Lena cried desperately. \u201cPlease. Please don\u2019t do this. I have lost everything today. There is nothing left for me.\u201d Tears blurred her vision, made the pistol vanish. She held her breath, her eyes screwed tight, waiting for the retort of the pistol, the pain.</p><p>Silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With tears sliding down her cheeks, she looked up. Rosalind made a disgusted growl and aimed the pistol at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cIt seems there is some small scrap of mercy left in me after all. I know I shall regret this.\u201d</p><p>Lena let out a shuddering breath, her heart rabbiting behind her ribs. \u201cI promise you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her by the arm, Rosalind hauled her to her feet. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll blindfold you and have Jack or Ingrid dump you out near the stews.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot Ingrid.\u201d Lena had a feeling if Ingrid found out about this moment of leniency, she\u2019d take care of the matter quietly.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the position to be making demands. Come\u2014\u201d</p><p>A scream sounded in the distance.</p><p>Both of them froze.</p><p>\u201cThat had better not be friends of yours.\u201d Rosalind\u2019s eyes narrowed. She shoved the lantern into Lena\u2019s hands and pushed her through the door, holding the pistol against her back. \u201cOr all deals are off.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of steel on steel echoed through the tunnels, then a roar of earth-shattering fury.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be... Lena\u2019s heart started ticking, her breath catching in her lungs. She wanted to run toward the sound, but something held her back. Rosalind\u2019s gauntleted hand on her arm.</p><p>Rosalind shoved her against the wall and glanced around a corner. Evidently sighting nothing, she hauled Lena after her. \u201cThat\u2019s coming from the guard room.\u201d</p><p>Lena didn\u2019t dare hope. He couldn\u2019t have survived that fall, could he?</p><p>Another roar filled the air and something that sounded like a chair smashing against the wall.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d a woman called. \u201cLet me handle this.\u201d</p> <p>Rosalind hissed between her teeth. \u201cIngrid.\u201d She started running, which was precisely what Lena wanted too.</p><p>The door ahead of them flew open and a man crashed through it, sliding across the tunnel\u2019s smooth floors. Blood matted his hair and he struggled to roll over. Rosalind swore under her breath and knelt down, cradling his chin as she examined him.</p><p>The open door revealed chaos. Pieces of chair were scattered like matchsticks, and a booted foot lay motionless, the rest of the person lost to sight.</p><p>Will stood in the middle of the mess, breathing hard. His fists were clenched at his sides, his shoulders shaking from barely restrained rage. Blood smeared his wet shirt where it was plastered against his side and his hair hung wetly against his scalp.</p><p>Lena sucked in a sharp breath, coming to a halt. \u201cWill,\u201d she whispered, her heart swelling within her chest. She stumbled, grabbing onto the wall. He was alive! She could barely believe it. Then her eyes narrowed on the blood that stained his side. Alive and hurt.</p><p>Scalding amber eyes looked up. The shock as their gazes met swept right through her. His fist curled tight around the shiv he held. \u201cLena,\u201d he growled, and it was a tone she\u2019d never heard from him before.</p><p>No time to savor the sweetness of the moment. Through her tears she saw Ingrid come out of nowhere, the leg of a chair held in one hand. She swung it hard and Will caught her wrist with a contemptuous snarl.</p><p>It should have been the end of it. But Ingrid moved faster than Lena believed possible and snapped a palm into the joint of his elbow. As Will roared in pain, she followed through with a leg, sweeping his own out from under him.</p> <p>Will hit the ground hard and Ingrid swung the chair leg at his head. He kicked up, snapping the piece of timber out of her hand and then arched back onto his shoulders and kicked himself to his feet. Snarling with rage, he hit Ingrid around the waist and carried her to the floor.</p><p>Lena took a cautious step forward, surveying the room. He\u2019d made a mess of it. Groaning men littered the ground, clutching at broken bones and bruises. Not one of them was dead though.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>The blur as he and Ingrid fought was too fast to follow. Using his brute strength, he forced the other woman flat to the ground, tearing her shoulder up behind her and kneeling on her. Ingrid snarled, her face ground against the floor and her eyes molten with anger.</p><p>Bronze eyes.</p><p>Another verwulfen.</p><p>Will forced her arm higher. Ingrid\u2019s body shook and she winced, her other hand clawing at the ground. His gaze darkened and he set one hand against the joint of her shoulder, his intentions clear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lena cried. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>Leaping forward, she grabbed his arm and tugged ineffectually. Will snarled at her, all wild eyes and teeth and her heart leaped into her throat at the madness she saw there. For a moment she wasn\u2019t sure if he would go for her too. She saw it in his eyes, saw the need, the desire to kill glaring back out at her.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she whispered, sliding her wrist in front of his nose. If he smelt her, recognized her, he would never hurt her.</p><p>He eased back on Ingrid\u2019s arm. Her hands shaking, Lena gently touched his cheek. \u201cWill, look at me. It\u2019s Lena. You know me.\u201d Caressing the line of his jaw, she swallowed hard when he turned and gently bit the fleshy pad of her palm.</p><p>One bite and her blood would flow, mingling with the blood that stained his fractured cheekbone. One bite and she\u2019d be infected. Quivering violently, she gave a breathy little cry as his tongue rasped over the sensitive flesh. Then he let go, his teeth sliding gently over her skin.</p><p>Behind her Rosalind snapped to someone, \u201cAs soon as you get a clear shot, take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s in the way. Want me to shoot her?\u201d</p><p>Lena froze and glanced over her shoulder. Jack stared down an enormous rifle at her, focusing through the glass monocle.</p><p>\u201cIf you shoot me,\u201d she said, surprised by how calm her voice sounded, \u201cyou\u2019ll never stop him.\u201d She slid a steadying hand over Will\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe came for me. Because of the way Mendici took me. I can stop him.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s nostrils flared. Her gaze flickered to Will and back. \u201cHe\u2019s beyond stopping.\u201d</p><p>Sliding her body between them, trying to cover as much of Will as she could, Lena shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind wavered. Lena could see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d she said. \u201cCalm him down. Then we both walk out of here. I\u2019ll keep your secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could kill you both,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Lena\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cTry it and you\u2019ll find out why nobody dares cross a verwulfen. You have to shoot me first and he\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Ingrid snarled.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Jack lowered the rifle slightly, cold gaze considering. His expression softened slightly as he looked at Ingrid and Lena realized there was some sense of compassion, some weakness within him. \u201cOne condition. We want the transformational. Complete the project and deliver it within five days. That\u2019s the cost of our cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Yesterday she might have simply agreed. \u201cWhy? What do you intend to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift. For the Scandinavian ambassador. We\u2019ve already made contact with them. They\u2019re expecting it.\u201d</p><p>The transformational was only a toy, really. Granted, a very life-sized one by the time she was finished. \u201cI\u2019ll never complete it in five days.\u201d</p><p>The rifle twitched. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Hours of work, soldering steel plate to steel. She\u2019d finished most of the clockwork mechanism that drove it, but still...</p><p>Will\u2019s shoulder quivered beneath her touch. Without thinking, she stroked his arm, leaning closer. \u201cAgreed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Mandeville and get him to help. When it\u2019s ready I\u2019ll have it delivered to his shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cautious of us?\u201d Rosalind asked.</p><p>\u201cI only make a mistake once.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Rosalind lowered her pistol and nodded. \u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk him down first.\u201d He never took his gaze off Ingrid.</p><p>Lena swiveled around. Will was shaking, his eyes clenched tight and his teeth bared as if he fought some internal battle she could never understand. She\u2019d seen him do this before though, knew how he controlled himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m safe,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just need you to come back to me, to help me get out of here and go home. Breathe, Will. Deep and slow. That\u2019s it.\u201d Caressing his face, his jaw, she leaned closer, letting him scent her. \u201cAnd another one. That\u2019s the way.\u201d Sliding her hand down his arm, over the rough linen that was rolled up to his elbows, and the sleek bronzed skin of his forearm, she licked her lips. Her hand slid over his, curling between his fingers. \u201cLet her go, Will. Take my hand. I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Sliding her fingers between his, she drew his hand back, knowing that he let her. Ingrid\u2019s shoulders relaxed and her eyes shot toward Lena murderously.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Lena said. \u201cEven wounded he took you down easily. I won\u2019t be able to talk him out of this again.\u201d She slid Will\u2019s hand over her knee and pressed it there, then turned for his other one.</p><p>Will\u2019s fingers quivered over Ingrid\u2019s wrist. Lena leaned closer, nuzzling her face against his jaw. His scent filled her nostrils, dark and musky. She wanted to press her lips against his skin, to confirm that he was really here, that he was alive.</p><p>Damn it. There were no society rules here and she was beyond caring what anyone else thought. Turning her face, she pressed her lips to his cheek, her hand sliding over his other cheek. Alive. Warm. The pulse pounding in his chest. A cry caught in her throat. So close to losing him... Tears burned in her eyes. Never again.</p><p>The rasp of his stubble burned over her too-sensitive lips. Blinking away the tears, she eased his grip away from Ingrid\u2019s wrist, her fingers bloody from his cheek. \u201cCome home with me, Will. Take me home.\u201d</p><p>His hand sprang open. His eyes were still tightly ground together.</p><p>Ingrid\u2019s body collapsed on the floor and she winced as she drew her injured arm up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Lena warned her, sliding her arms around his neck. \u201cStand up, Will.\u201d She breathed the words in his ear. \u201cTake me home. Your home.\u201d</p><p>He looked up then, the madness leeching from his gaze. The beast had not faded completely though. He looked at her with hunger, a madness of its own, and her nipples tightened painfully against the rasp of her linen chemise.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d His voice was hoarse. He looked around, realizing he was still kneeling on Ingrid. Then he looked up and something dark flickered through his gaze.</p><p>\u201cPut the rifle away,\u201d she cried out as Will shoved her behind him.</p><p>There was no chance of stopping him if he decided to go for Jack. Not now. Pleading with her eyes, she tried to slide her arms around Will\u2019s waist. Anything to slow him, to remind him of his humanity.</p><p>Jack slowly lowered the rifle. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you could do it.\u201d He nodded sharply at her. \u201cFive days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive days,\u201d Lena promised, her body relaxing with a sigh of relief.</p><p>Jack glanced warily at Will. Whatever he saw on Will\u2019s face it made him take a half step back. \u201cYou\u2019d best go.\u201d Another glance, toward Ingrid. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t guarantee I can talk her off the edge.\u201d</p><p>The fury that had kept him moving began to fade by the time they reached the surface. His weight was too much for her to bear alone.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Lena said in a cheerful tone. \u201cNot much farther.\u201d She took a desperate look around. The warren was a good half mile. In these streets, with Will unable to defend himself, it was a dangerous half mile.</p><p>Will staggered against a brick wall, the blood on his side drying. He\u2019d never make it all the way to the warren. Lena bit her lip, then glanced toward the small side street where he lived these days. She\u2019d never been inside, but she knew its location.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d she said, wrapping her arms around his waist and trying to guide him toward the stairs that led to his door.</p><p>A pair of boys smoked cheroots on the base of the stairs. A year or two younger than Charlie, she didn\u2019t like the way they looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHey there, lady. Why don\u2019t you ditch the old man and come sit with us?\u201d One of them called.</p><p>No way past them. Will stiffened as if he\u2019d heard the insult, and she stroked the lean muscle of his back. \u201cThey\u2019re only boys,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo danger.\u201d</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>Raising her voice, Lena looked the one who\u2019d spoke dead in the eye. She\u2019d faced down blue bloods and humanists. This was only a boy, trying to impress his friend. \u201cHere now. Care to earn some coin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout I offer you some tin?\u201d Another smirk.</p><p>Lena grabbed Will\u2019s shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Stepping forward, she kept a wary eye on him. He might be dangerously close to collapsing, but if the fury overtook him, it might be enough to rouse him to the killing edge. \u201cI need a message delivered to my sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other lad tipped his chin up. \u201cWho\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Both boys stilled. The one who\u2019d given her grief paled and leaped to his feet. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean naught by it, miss. What do you want us to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell her Lena\u2019s at Will\u2019s house. That she needs to come.\u201d Will chose that moment to slump and she swayed dangerously with him.</p><p>The other lad stepped forward to help.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried as a snarl curdled in Will\u2019s throat. The boy froze. \u201cDon\u2019t touch him. Don\u2019t touch me. He\u2019s not quite himself at the moment. Just run my message.\u201d</p><p>Whatever they\u2019d seen in Will\u2019s face they didn\u2019t even question her about the coin. Blade\u2019s name carried weight here. Within seconds she was alone, facing the hurdle of the stairs.</p><p>Her own body screamed with exhaustion. Lena finally got Will to the top and shoved the door open. He hadn\u2019t bothered to lock it. The pair of carved daggers in the door indicated who this house belonged to and not even the bravest thief would dare cross the threshold.</p> <p>Holding him under the arms, Lena kicked the door shut with her ruined slipper. She\u2019d lost the other in the tunnels and could barely feel that foot for the cold. \u201cHere now,\u201d she murmured, guiding him up against the door. Her vision swam. \u201cStay here whilst I fetch a lantern.\u201d</p><p>Will slumped. \u201cOn the stove.\u201d</p><p>She saw the outline of the stove against the pale shine of the moon through gauzy curtains. It took a minute to light, then a merry glow lit the room.</p><p>Lena looked around. \u201cGoodness, Will. You do realize you can buy furniture?\u201d</p><p>There was nothing but a small cot in the corner, draped with a pair of patchwork quilts, a table, and two chairs and the bare necessities of the kitchen. The apartment was small. Almost as small as the one she\u2019d shared with her brother and sister when they first took to hiding in the \u2019Chapel.</p><p>\u201cSurely Blade pays you,\u201d she muttered in an appalled tone.</p> <p>\u201cHe pays me.\u201d Will took a step toward the bed and swayed dangerously. \u201cDon\u2019t have much need...to spend it...\u201d</p><p>Lena leaped forward, catching him around the waist. His weight hit her hard and she staggered backward, her knees hitting the cot. They both went down, Will a heavy, crushing weight on top of her.</p><p>Her face was buried in his shoulder. Lena wriggled higher so that she could breathe, then collapsed back with a gasp. \u201cWill! You\u2019re crushing me!\u201d</p><p>No sign of movement in his face. He breathed slowly and she realized he was in that almost unconscious state that followed severe exertion. Shoving at his shoulder, she managed to slither out just enough that his weight was no longer crushing.</p><p>Tugging his shirt out of his waistband, she craned her neck to check his wound. A bloody crust covered it. Touching his ribs tenderly, she checked for any signs of injury. By this stage there was little she could do. The virus would congregate in the wound site and do more than she\u2014or even a doctor\u2014ever could.</p><p>Satisfied that he wasn\u2019t mortally injured, she collapsed back against the pillow. The chill that seemed to pervade her bones was still there. And Will was burning with heat.</p><p>Snuggling against his chest, she pressed her cold lips to his neck. The heat from his body made her feel slightly better, though the nausea from earlier had passed, thank goodness. Lena blinked sleepily. She could barely keep her eyes open. The weight of exhaustion hit her hard and she barely had time to wonder if her message would reach Honoria before the blackness took her.</p><p>Twenty-one</p> <p>Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains. Lena blinked, pain stabbing at her too-sensitive eyes. She was so thirsty, her mouth bone dry. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>A shadow moved on the edge of vision. Lena shot to alertness, her heartbeat slowing down when Charlie grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d</p><p>Honoria materialized, her face white and pale with lack of sleep. Her hand slid over Lena\u2019s forehead, deliciously cool. \u201cCharlie,\u201d she murmured. \u201cCould you fetch some more water? And something to eat?\u201d The last question was directed at Lena.</p><p>She nodded sharply. Her stomach growled at the thought, twisting with emptiness.</p><p>Honoria held a glass to her lips. Cool water wet her dry tongue and she gasped greedily at it. The door shut behind Charlie as Honoria settled on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cDrink it slowly,\u201d Honoria said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been asleep for a long time.\u201d</p><p>By the time she\u2019d drained the glass she was feeling marginally better. Looking around, she recognized her old room in the warren.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still asleep.\u201d Honoria stroked a hand over her damp hair. \u201cLena, your temperature\u2019s abnormally high. You\u2019re burning with fever. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She considered her body. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>Concern flashed through Honoria\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cWhat happened? Can you remember? All Rip could tell us was that he heard a whistle of distress and then Will was gone. We found your carriage turned over in the street, but no sign of either of you. Blade and Rip searched the tunnels but lost Will\u2019s scent trail. Someone had sprayed the area with some sort of chemical that obliterated smell.\u201d</p><p>Everything that had happened flashed through her mind. She opened her mouth. Then shut it. She had sworn that she would speak of the humanists to no one. And she didn\u2019t dare get her sister involved.</p><p>Tears sprang into her eyes, her emotions strangely raw. \u201cHonor, if I asked you a question, would you answer it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. \u201cWas Father a humanist?\u201d</p><p>Stillness radiated through her sister\u2019s body. \u201cWhy would you ask such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true then.\u201d Lena\u2019s voice hardened and she struggled to sit up. \u201cWhat else did you think was best kept secret from me? Father\u2019s work for Vickers? The truth of what he was really doing?\u201d</p><p>Honoria stiffened. \u201cWhere did you learn of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Something old filled Honoria\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019re aware of, but it\u2019s true. In the last years of his life Father grew dissatisfied with the way of the world. He started working on a cure for the craving for Vickers, but in his own time he researched a blue blood\u2019s weaknesses. He wanted to discover methods of destroying them.\u201d</p><p>Lena pressed her hands against her face. Everything that Rosalind had told her was correct.</p><p>Honoria eased a tentative hand on her shoulder. \u201cLena? You\u2019re not angry at me? I did as I thought best. The information is dangerous. I was only ever trying to protect you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me.\u201d As soon as she said the words she realized how familiar Honoria\u2019s statement sounded. They were all excuses she herself had used. A similarity she never thought she\u2019d ever have shared with her sister. They were so different at heart, and yet she couldn\u2019t deny that Honoria would risk her own life for her and Charlie without pause. Sliding a hand over her sister\u2019s, she squeezed gently.</p><p>\u201cLena, what happened in the tunnels?\u201d</p><p>A world she could never reveal. \u201cSomeone kidnapped me. I\u2019m not sure who. Will came after them and saved me.\u201d</p><p>The story was far too brief to appease her sister and they both knew it. But whatever guilt currently flayed Honoria, she didn\u2019t dare question the statement.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I could see Will?\u201d Lena asked softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to check on him.\u201d She\u2019d thought him lost. The urge to make sure he was safe and alive was suddenly a crushing need. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Honoria sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll allow it. But only because I understand what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>Honoria eased a hand over her sister\u2019s forehead, smoothing her damp curls out of the way. Though she\u2019d left Lena sitting in a chair beside Will\u2019s bed, when she\u2019d returned with more water, she\u2019d found her curled up on top of the blankets asleep, her fingers entwined with his.</p><p>Blade\u2019s arms slid around her waist from behind and he rested a chin on her shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re troubled,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Pressing a finger against her lips, she led him out of the room and eased the door shut behind her. Though he arched an eyebrow in question, she shook her head and led him upstairs to her workroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, luv?\u201d he asked, frowning as he closed the door behind him.</p><p>Nobody would hear them up here. Honoria crossed to her desk and tugged a heavy book down from the shelf. She opened it to the page mark and pressed her finger to the spidery script. \u201cRead it.\u201d</p><p>Blade squinted at the page, his lips moving slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t understand. This is the first stages of the loupe virus and its effects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was studying it in order to try and find Will\u2019s cure,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe first sign of the loupe is a fever. Headaches, hot and cold flushes, the sweats...\u201d</p><p>He understood immediately.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s burning up,\u201d Honoria whispered. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be that hot, not without severe signs of discomfort, but all she feels is hunger and thirst.\u201d</p><p>Blade\u2019s face paled.</p><p>Honoria bit her lip. \u201cThere\u2019s more. Did you know that the loupe is an extremely virulent disease, and yet there are few verwulfen around?\u201d Heat burned in the back of her eyes and she stroked the page in front of her. She\u2019d come up here to read more as soon as she first suspected what was going on. \u201cBlade, the statistics for surviving the initial fever are extremely poor. Perhaps one in fifteen makes the transition. In Scandinavia and Germany, only the strongest warriors are allowed to be infected. They must prove themselves in a test first, to ensure that they have the strongest chance of surviving.\u201d Her vision blurred. \u201cThis is why no verwulfen is allowed to mate with a human. Oh God, what have I done?\u201d Her words faded to a whisper, an ache burning in her chest. \u201cI should never have allowed her near him. I should have realized. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Strong arms tugged her close, burying her against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve a feelin\u2019 nothin\u2019 we done coulda kept \u2019em apart.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cHush, luv. Ain\u2019t your fault. You couldn\u2019t a known. There\u2019s so little information \u2019bout the loupe goin\u2019 round. And who knows, she might be strong enough.\u201d</p><p>Honoria hiccupped a sob. \u201cThe strongest warriors, Blade. And most of them don\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d he said, tipping her chin up toward him, \u201cwe need to work out what she needs. How to \u2019elp \u2019er.\u201d</p><p>The thought penetrated where no false comfort ever could. This she could do. She grabbed the book and dashed the tears from her eyes. She hadn\u2019t been able to save her brother from the craving virus, but she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d let her sister\u2019s life fade.</p><p>\u201cSit. Read,\u201d he said, pushing her into a chair. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch a pot of tea and somethin\u2019 to eat. Then I\u2019ll check on them.\u201d</p><p>Honoria\u2019s eyes were already racing across the lines on the page. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The world beneath her moved. Lena blinked sleepily. Arching her fingers, she dug them into the soft body beneath hers and yawned. Her pillow threatened to dislodge her and she grabbed onto the sheets.</p><p>Will rolled onto his side, blinking warily at her. Thick slabs of muscle covered his chest and shoulders, and for a moment, the urge to run her hand through the hair on his chest was almost irresistible.</p><p>Grabbing at the sheet to stop it from dropping too far, he stiffened. \u201cWe\u2019re at the warren.\u201d A frown. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You collapsed,\u201d she said, \u201cand Blade had you brought here. You\u2019ve slept the day away. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted past, toward the water jug.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lena said, hopping off the bed in her nightgown and pouring him a glass. She held it out to him, but he grabbed the jug instead and tilted it up. The muscles in his throat worked, rivulets of water pouring down his jaw and into the hollow of his collarbone.</p><p>Heat burned between her thighs and she gripped the cool glass hard. Sheer longing was almost a knife to the chest. She had promised herself that she would speak to him if he survived, tell him how she felt, but suddenly she was nervous and tongue-tied again. The way he always made her feel.</p><p>She, a woman who could twist a man around her finger with a simple smile if she chose.</p><p>A crack appeared in the glass. Then another. Lena looked down in astonishment as the glass shattered, pieces crumbling to the rug. Blood welled from her fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will lowered the jug, his gaze dropping to the glass. \u201cBloody hell, Lena.\u201d He leaped out of bed, moving with the same economical grace that always drew her eye.</p><p>An excess of golden skin. Naked skin. Lena\u2019s eyes widened. She had a second\u2019s grace to drop her gaze before he swore and jerked the sheet around his waist, tucking the edge in.</p><p>Oh my goodness.</p> <p>Anatomy books could not even come close to picturing the truth. The heat flushed out of her face. She\u2019d caught only a glimpse of his member, half aroused and enormous, bobbing from the thick thatch of dark hair that nested it. The breath caught in her throat. There was no possible way they could fit together...</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Will snarled, taking the remains of the glass from her and tearing a piece off the sheet. He dipped it in the water jug and wrung it out, then dabbed tenderly at the cut on her hand. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt cracked in my hand,\u201d Lena said distantly. A shiver of need swept through her, igniting desires she\u2019d kept under lock and key in her heart.</p><p>Will hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a piece of glass in there.\u201d A frown drew his eyebrows together. \u201cLena, can you not feel that?\u201d A shivering stroke over something in her hand.</p><p>She looked away from the broad, naked expanse of his chest and saw the piece of glass sticking out of her hand. As soon as she saw it she felt the acid bite of pain and bit her lip. \u201cA little. It doesn\u2019t hurt very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Into whiskey warm eyes with their impossibly thick lashes. She leaned forward, resting her free hand against his chest, feeling the delicious slide of silky-soft skin beneath her fingertips.</p><p>Will sucked in a breath. Then his gaze dropped and pain throbbed through her hand. \u201cGot it,\u201d he said. Dabbing at the cut, he examined it for any sign of glass and then tied another strip of sheet around it firmly.</p><p>The scent of him, warm and musky, wrapped around her senses. As soon as he let her hand go, she placed it against his stomach, feeling the flinch beneath her fingertips.</p> <p>\u201cLena,\u201d he warned, in a husky voice. The heat in his eyes contradicted his tone. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she whispered, sliding the backs of her knuckles down his rippled abdomen. \u201cYou want to. I want to.\u201d Tears pricked at her eyes and suddenly her throat was thick. \u201cI thought that I\u2019d lost you. That you were gone. Forever.\u201d One hot, salty tear slid down her cheek. She shook her head and looked up fiercely. \u201cNothing else matters.\u201d A deep breath, her heart pattering madly in her chest. She couldn\u2019t quite meet his eyes, but that didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI was so scared that I would never have a chance to touch you. To kiss you again. To tell you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d He caught her wrists, thrust them behind her.</p><p>Her nipples abraded the linen nightgown. She stared up at him, at the fierce expression on his face. Flickers of warming amber lit his eyes. That was what she wanted to stir. The uncontrollable passion in him. The need. She leaned closer, let her breasts rub against his skin. Sensation shot through her abdomen, clenching white-hot between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d he repeated, more of the amber drowning out the brown of his eyes.</p><p>Lena leaned forward and kissed his chest. Will shuddered, his grip on her wrists loosening. \u201cHow much I miss you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI played games with you, Will, because I was afraid if I were serious, and you weren\u2019t...that I\u2019d...I wanted you to kiss me. I tried to drive you to it, but you would never dare. I thought you didn\u2019t want me and it hurt so badly, because I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Another shudder of conflicting need within him. He shook his head, his lips parting. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d But his hands were easing on her wrists and suddenly it was easy to slip from his grasp.</p><p>She slid her hands over his chest and stepped closer. Will backed away, his knees hitting the back of the bed. He tumbled onto the bed, his fist clenching in the blankets. The sheet around his hips threatened to dislodge. Lena knelt on the edge of the bed, slinging her leg over his hips.</p> <p>His muscles clenched. \u201cLena, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me or not?\u201d A breathless moment as she waited for the answer.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pressed a finger against his lips. The nightgown rode up around her thighs, the lacy edge trailing over her sensitive calves. Licking her lips, she relaxed down onto his lap, gasping at the feel of his rigid member against her wet heat.</p><p>So sensitive there. So sweet the feeling. She threw her head back and arched her hips, grinding herself against him.</p><p>Fingers clenched in her bottom, almost painfully tight. He urged her against him again and Lena cried out as need tightened within her.</p><p>The sheet was trapped between them. She could feel her own body wetting it, the rasp of the linen against the sensitive nub that drove her insane. Suddenly it wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted more. Needed more. Sinking her hands into his hair, she fisted it and dragged his mouth up to hers.</p><p>Will bit at her lip, suckling it into his mouth. Their tongues clashed and she pressed herself against him, rubbing her breasts, her hips, her quim against his hard body. The taste of his mouth was intoxicating.</p><p>The sheet drove her crazy. She slid a hand between them and tugged at the length he\u2019d tucked into the waist of it. Too late he realized her intentions and caught her wrist. Lena held onto the end, feeling it unravel beneath her. She ground her hips against his and this time it was flesh that met hers. Hard, swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, not daring to let him go. His cock surged, huge and potent against her and she wet it with her own body, riding along the edge of it. Will made a strangled sound in his throat, his hands digging into her thighs and his eyes glazing. The head of his cock brushed against her, a stretching sensation\u2014</p><p>Lena\u2019s mouth fell open. Will caught her by the hips and then the pain and stretching was gone and he slammed her back against the bed, hovering over her with a strained growl. His hands pinned her wrists to the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Breathing hard, his back heaving with the strain of it, he looked up and met her gaze. Amber burned desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he admitted. Something flashed through his eyes, a sadness that made her heart clench. \u201cI can\u2019t, Lena. I promised I\u2019d protect you. Even from myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his eyes shut. \u201cLena, have you never thought of how the loupe is spread?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth then froze. Not once had she considered it. \u201cI don\u2019t know very much about it.\u201d Few people did. Nobody in the Echelon spoke of it. \u201cThe craving is spread by blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is the loupe.\u201d His body softened on hers, hips driving her into the bed, need a hard edge in his golden eyes. \u201cAnd also through a man\u2019s seed. Why d\u2019you think I ain\u2019t been with a woman?\u201d</p><p>Another stunning revelation. \u201cEver?\u201d she whispered in surprise.</p><p>He shook his head, eyes darkening. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Some fierce sense of possession burned within her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I thought\u2014\u201d Her mind raced. Not once could she recall seeing him with a woman. She\u2019d never thought of it before, preferring to assume he kept his assignations quiet.</p><p>Will\u2019s grip eased and he knelt over her, hands on his thighs. His cock bobbed against his stomach, but the dejection in his shoulders told her everything she needed to know. Grabbing the remains of the sheet, he wrapped it around his hips.</p><p>\u201cUnless a woman had the loupe already. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lena shook her head. This couldn\u2019t be happening. Just when she had finally admitted to herself the depth of her feelings for him... \u201cPerhaps...\u201d She licked dry lips. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind. If we could be together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His expression hardened. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re askin\u2019. I\u2019ve been cut and beaten and even half gutted before, and they\u2019re nothin\u2019\u2014nothin\u2019\u2014compared to the agony of the loupe when it first hits you. Not everybody survives, Lena.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that. Not to you.\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred her vision. The tenuous future she\u2019d begun dreaming of was washed away with the maelstrom of his words.</p><p>\u201cLena,\u201d he whispered. A gentle hand brushed the back of her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she replied, trying to dry her eyes on her sleeves. Somehow she summoned a weak smile. It faltered. \u201cYesterday I thought you were dead. I said I\u2019d do anything to have you back, to have you safe\u2014\u201d The words broke. She couldn\u2019t say anymore. Sobs overtook her.</p><p>Sheets rustled and then Will dragged her against him. \u201cI never meant to hurt you.\u201d He murmured. \u201cI tried to stay away from you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, shakily drawing in a breath. \u201cI can see that now.\u201d All of the times she\u2019d thought he didn\u2019t care for her and he\u2019d only been trying to stop this before it got too far.</p><p>He kissed her cheek, his lips wet with her tears. Then her jaw. Her lips. Lena turned her face to his hungrily, wrapping her body hard against him. They kissed desperately, clinging to each other and she almost broke down again, knowing that this was the last time she could ever do this.</p><p>Her fingers twined in the silky strands of his hair. Will dragged her closer against him, his cock an emphatic presence against her thigh. His mouth trailed lower, nipping at her chin, then her neck, his tongue tracing the salty rime of her tears.</p><p>The shock of his hand against her breast made her suck in a breath. \u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this. Just once.\u201d The other hand slid her nightgown higher, his forearm cradling the curve of her bare bottom.</p><p>Heat flushed through her. There was never any intention of saying no. If this was all she could have of him... \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Will eased her back onto the bed and knelt over her. The rasp of his stubble against her throat arched her off the bed and she dug her nails into his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of this... Dreamed of this.\u201d Teeth grazed the vulnerable column of her throat, a teasing bite that threatened and tempted both. \u201cI want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered with longing. He was asking for her surrender. She gave it completely. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>His lips soothed the ache of the bite. Hands sliding over her nightgown with feverish need, he caught the hem of it and shoved it up.</p><p>Cool air stirred against her naked flesh. Lena lifted her hips and shoulders off the bed, letting him remove it. Will tossed the nightgown aside, never taking his eyes off her. They burned like a blacksmith\u2019s forge, the heat blistering her soul.</p><p>Uncertainty beating in her breast, she lowered her hands against her sides. Her breath lifted her breasts, drawing his gaze to them. Her nipples hardened and she let her gaze rove his face, searching for something, anything.</p><p>His expression softened. Still fierce in his desire, the odd hint of longing shaped his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Gently he traced her collarbone, his fingers tickling over her skin. They raked lower, drawing gentle concentric circles around her left breast. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo small,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He leaned against her side, one leg thrown over hers. Capturing her gaze, he slid his rough palm over her breast, cupping it. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he growled and lowered his head.</p><p>Lips traced the smooth curve of her flesh. She gasped as teeth found her nipple and bit it gently. The hand on her breast slid lower, skating across her quivering stomach. So much sensation. She could barely contain it, especially when his hand delved between her thighs.</p><p>A new world. She felt remarkably gauche, untutored. She knew nothing of this, of pleasure. Theory had nothing on practice. Will\u2019s fingers found her and she threw her head back, gasping, against the sheets.</p><p>\u201cTake your hair out,\u201d he whispered, one finger tracing small circles against the wet bud between her thighs.</p><p>She could barely move, trapped by the sensation of his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she gasped, her hips quivering.</p><p>Movement ceased. He pressed the heel of his palm against her mound. \u201cTake it out.\u201d</p><p>Demand filled his voice. Lena lifted her arms over her head and started working on her braid. Her hair tumbled over the sheets in loose waves, thick and dark. Will\u2019s expression grew lazy, heavy-lidded. He lowered his mouth to her nipple and suckled it. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>The coil in her stomach grew. She slid her hands over his shoulders, learning the smooth muscle of his flesh. Then through his hair, fisting in the length of it, unable to string coherent thought or sound together as his lips played with her breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hot tongue swept over her, rasping at her nipple. An inarticulate sound echoed in her throat, harsh and guttural. A wordless plea for more. As if in answer, his fingers danced lightly over her wet flesh, circling the entrance to her body.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lena gasped, back arching obscenely. \u201cWill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d A hint of curiosity gleamed in his eyes. This was new to him too and yet he moved with a confidence that fooled her.</p> <p>A finger slid deep into her passage and she clenched around it, eyes rolling back in her head. Soft laughter echoed against her flesh, a rumble of pleased satisfaction. So male.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were clenched in his hair so tight he had to feel it. She tried to relax. And failed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Another finger stretched her and she felt the burn deep within as her body eased to accommodate him. Shadows filled his eyes\u2014he wanted it to be his own body\u2014and he bit the soft curve of her breast with a snarl as the amber overtook his irises.</p><p>Lena lifted her hips to his hand, silently demanding more. The world narrowed, becoming little more than the sound of shifting sheets and soft sighs and the feel of his fingers pumping within her.</p> <p>Something beckoned, a sensation she knew she wanted to feel. Tossing her head from side to side, she tried to find it, tried to push harder against his hand. Will\u2019s thumb rode over the nub of her flesh and she clenched with a gasp, grabbing at his wrist.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she whispered desperately. \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d A thumb pressed hard against her.</p><p>She cried out, her hips lifting higher. So close. Almost... The edge threatened to collapse beneath her and his thumb rode her again. There\u2014</p><p>Lena screamed as sensation rode through her, blinding her to all else. Nothing but the feel of his body remained, his finger driving deep within her. Claiming her as she wished his body could.</p><p>Too much. She cried out and caught his hand, clenching her knees tightly together as she rolled onto her side. Gasping, her face pressed into the sheets, she came back to the world slowly. Will curled around her, his face nuzzling the back of her neck and his shaft pressed against her bottom.</p> <p>She shifted, driving it between her thighs, her own slickness creating a vacuum. Will sucked in a sharp breath, his hands clutching her tight. \u201cLena.\u201d</p><p>Yet his hips pressed against her bottom, the nest of springy hair at the base of his shaft tickling her. His hot flesh rode against her sensitive nub and she gasped again, white lights dancing behind her eyes.</p><p>Sinking a fist into her hair, Will dragged her face back, baring her throat. His hips bucked against her again, tearing a new sensation through her.</p><p>Teeth sinking into the soft muscle of her trapezium. His fist, a dominating presence in her hair. She couldn\u2019t move, trapped by his body. Will ground himself against her again and again, thrusting hard between her thighs. She clenched her knees, her fingers digging into the sheet.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she cried, her body tipping over that sharp, electric edge again.</p><p>His cry echoed hers, hot seed flooding against her stomach. Lena collapsed against the sheets, panting hard. There was no time to relax. Will shoved her onto her back, his eyes wild as he wiped the seed from her skin. Only when the last trace of it was gone did his shoulders relax. He balled the sheet up and threw it away.</p><p>Lena reached for him, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>The muscle strained in his thighs. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d His gaze drifted to the sheet, voice hoarse. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have risked even that.\u201d</p><p>Languorous heat settled through her body. She wanted to sleep, desperately. Stretching catlike, she smiled up at him. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a question, Will.\u201d</p><p>He owned her utterly. And yet, when it came down to it, she owned a part of him too.</p><p>He came, his body pressing hard on hers, driving her into the mattress. Lena smiled to herself and held him close, rubbing her cheek against his throat.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>But they were words she didn\u2019t dare utter, words that would only cause pain in this moment. She didn\u2019t want to cry. Didn\u2019t want to see that sleepy satisfaction fade from his eyes. This moment was for them. The last one they could ever have.</p><p>The thought made her smile fade slightly but she forced it away. Mine, she told herself, sliding her arms around him and holding him tight. The familiar scent of his body flooded her nostrils and she pressed her face into his hair and breathed deep.</p><p>No thought of the future. No thought of what couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Just the moment.</p><p>One she never wanted to let go of.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>A soft hand stroked his chest.</p><p>Will yawned and struggled to open his eyes. He felt better than he had in years, so relaxed he could barely lift his head off the pillow. The room was dark, the sheets stained with the scent of Lena and the musky scent of\u2014</p><p>He froze.</p><p>Then caught the hand that stroked his chest.</p><p>\u201cLena,\u201d he whispered, lifting his head off the pillow. Starlight glittered through the crack between the curtains.</p><p>\u201cMmph?\u201d She made a sleepy sound and snuggled against him.</p><p>She was naked, her leg thrown over his and her head resting on his shoulder. Panic erupted, his heart bursting into a racing staccato. He could feel every inch of impossibly smooth skin, her body slick against his.</p><p>The scent of sex. Of his seed, mingled with the delicious scent of her own body.</p><p>The loose end of the bandage on her hand tickled his chest. What had he done? Looking around wildly, he saw the discarded roll of sheet. Memory flooded back in. His fingers, wet within the heat of her body, Lena gasping beneath him, her face twisted with ecstasy. Thrusting hard between her thighs, her knees clamped together like a vise as he spilled his seed against her stomach...</p><p>Will\u2019s head hit the pillow. Thank God. He hadn\u2019t taken her. Hadn\u2019t infected her. Relief flooded through him and he caught her hand, squeezing it gently.</p><p>The bandage tickled his fingers. He brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her fingertips. Lena barely stirred.</p><p>Frowning, he rolled onto his side. She tumbled into his arms like a rag doll, a flush of perspiration on her gleaming, naked skin.</p><p>\u201cLena?\u201d he whispered. Why the devil wasn\u2019t she responding?</p><p>His side was wet where she\u2019d been lying against him. Will\u2019s eyebrows furrowed deeper and he pressed a hand against her forehead.</p><p>Perspiration drenched her hair. She moaned slightly, her head lolling as if she sought to remove his hand. He drew it back, mind racing.</p><p>She felt hot. Most of the time a human\u2019s skin felt cold against his burning heat. Lena always had, her body feeling like cool silk against his. For him to register her skin as hot, she had to be burning up, almost as hot as he himself.</p><p>There was only one possible reason for that.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, turning her chin to peer at her face.</p><p>Faint circles of red shadowed her cheeks. Sweat gleamed on her breasts and stained the sheets beneath her. Will rose up onto his knees, his gaze falling on the bandage around her hand.</p><p>He yanked it off, lost to any sense of tenderness. Lena whimpered, her head twisting on the pillow and wet strands of hair sticking to her throat. He almost didn\u2019t want to look, too afraid to know the truth.</p><p>Forcing himself, he opened her curled fingers and stared hard at the palm of her hand.</p><p>Smooth pale skin.</p><p>Not even a hint of a welt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, throwing himself off the bed. Panic churned in his stomach and he raked his hands through his hair, shooting her an incredulous look.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. He\u2019d been so careful with her. No blood, no sex... And he knew saliva was safe or he\u2019d never have kissed her.</p><p>Cold dread spiraled through him. \u201cLena,\u201d he whispered, crossing to the bed. \u201cLena?\u201d</p><p>She blinked sleepily, wincing as if her head hurt. \u201cWill?\u201d A soft murmur, her head lolling to the side.</p><p>Will caught her chin. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel well, do you?\u201d</p><p>Her pupils looked the size of small marbles. She looked past him, her gaze focusing on nothing. \u201cJust...head aching...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Her eyes started closing again and he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her gently. \u201cDamn it, Lena. How long have you been feeling poorly?\u201d</p><p>Blinking up at him, she caught his hands, her own grip feeble. \u201cHurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He ground his teeth together and let her go. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. How long has it been hurtin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays?\u201d she whispered, licking at her dry lips. \u201cThe morning after you came...to my room.\u201d</p><p>Will slumped on the edge of the bed. \u201cDays?\u201d he repeated. What the hell had happened that night? He\u2019d kissed her. Tasted her skin. Her breasts. But nothing else. It had to have been blood, but he couldn\u2019t remember if he\u2019d been bleeding. He was always so careful. \u201cWas I injured? Did you see any blood on me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, curling back into the pillow as if her body ached. As it no doubt did. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Cupping her hands over her face, she whimpered. \u201cHurts.\u201d</p><p>He hovered over her uselessly. \u201cI know.\u201d God, how he knew. Joints aching, body burning up, head pounding as if it were fit to split. The insatiable need for water. He stroked her back, light circles to ease the aching he knew she\u2019d be feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch you some water,\u201d he said, leaning down and kissing her brow.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d His heart hammered in his chest as he fetched her nightgown and laid it over her. Anything more would only chafe her skin. Tugging on the pair of trousers he found strewn over the end of the bed, he eased out of the room and shut the door quietly.</p><p>A soft whimper echoed from within, stabbing him hard in the chest. Will leaned back against the door, closing his eyes in despair.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>The reality of the situation didn\u2019t truly hit him until he\u2019d helped her finish a full jug of water. As Lena collapsed back on the sheets into a feverish sleep, he dragged a clean sheet he\u2019d found over her and stood back, staring at her petite figure. She shivered, her skin clammy to the touch.</p><p>Will backed away, swallowing hard. What have I done? He should never have laid so much as a finger on her.</p><p>But years of aching loneliness had their toll. He\u2019d always desired Lena. Too much so. When he first took the letter off her he should have gone straight to Blade. Let him deal with the mess, with Lena\u2019s protection. He\u2019d known how much of a temptation she represented for him.</p><p>With his feet dragging, he slowly climbed the stairs to the attic. The faint swish of skirts told him who was awake up there.</p><p>A murmur of voices greeted him as he lifted his hand to knock. Blade too, then. Guilt choked him but he forced himself to rap at the thick wooden door. There was nothing he could do now. Lena needed her sister.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Will,\u201d Honoria called.</p><p>Light sheared through the darkness as he opened the door. Honoria\u2019s usual chignon was a bedraggled mess as she perched in an armchair by the hearth. Blade rifled through the books on the shelves, peering intently at the spines.</p><p>Honoria met his gaze, dark circles swallowing her eyes.</p><p>She knew.</p><p>He faltered in the door, shaking his head, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cOh, Will,\u201d she whispered, coming to her feet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth but no words came out. Only an inarticulate sound of pain and guilt. The room blurred as heat filled his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I was always so careful. I don\u2019t know how\u2014\u201d And then a flash of image swam into his mind. Of the jewelry store. \u201cMy lip,\u201d he said, touching it. \u201cI had a fight with Colchester and he split my lip.\u201d Guilt punched him in the chest. \u201cI kissed her. I didn\u2019t think.\u201d He\u2019d been more concerned with not bedding her, of fighting away the desire to claim her as his own. He\u2019d forgotten, for a moment, the dangers of his blood. And the wound had been so minor...</p><p>Honoria wrapped her arms around his waist and for once he let her. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Will. No matter what we all said, she would never have stayed away from you.\u201d The warmth of her body soaked into his and he rested his chin on the top of her head, holding her awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cI should have made her.\u201d He drew back and wiped his sleeve across his eyes. \u201cI should never have thought I could do this. I should have come straight to Blade when this all happened. Let him deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen all what happened?\u201d</p><p>Too many secrets. He shut his mouth and raked his hands through his hair. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>Honoria stared at him for a piercing moment, then let it go. She turned away, gesturing at the half-opened books that littered the room. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Will. We\u2019ve been reading all day\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer temperature\u2019s too hot. It\u2019s not human. And I could guess.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her, suddenly angry. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were in no condition,\u201d she replied simply. \u201cAnd we knew little about the loupe. I needed to find out more before I could start to treat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEase up, lad,\u201d Blade warned, his eyes darkening. He had his hands shoved into his pockets, but the way he rocked onto the balls of his feet indicated swift movement if needed.</p><p>Will turned away, shaking his head. No point getting angry. The only thing that was important now was Lena. \u201cHave you found anythin\u2019? Anythin\u2019 at all?\u201d</p><p>A slight hesitation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about how to deal with the transition or the first initial stages of the virus. The loupe isn\u2019t a very well-documented disease in Britain. I don\u2019t think anyone in the Echelon cared whether people survived it. What did they do when you were first infected?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t remember much.\u201d Just heat, incessant heat. His body aching. Screaming through a newly reknitted throat as his body changed. And the merciful coldness of the cellar as his da\u2019 tried to bring his temperature down. \u201cCold,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cold helped. Me father put me in the cellar where it were cool.\u201d He turned around. \u201cShe\u2019ll be thirsty. You have to keep her drinkin\u2019.\u201d A shrug. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anythin\u2019 else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a lot to go on.\u201d Honoria bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI were only five and barely lucid. Do you think I wouldn\u2019t mention somethin\u2019 if I could remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t accusing you of anything, Will.\u201d</p><p>Blade had taken a step closer.</p><p>Will turned away, fists clenched. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m on edge. I can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d His worst nightmare. Come to life.</p><p>A hand slid over his lower back. \u201cWe know,\u201d Honoria whispered. \u201cCome. We\u2019d best get prepared. I don\u2019t think it will be long before her temperature starts spiking. She\u2019s already got the rosy cheeks. It\u2019s the following fever that will...\u201d</p> <p>As if realizing what she was about to say, she stopped.</p><p>\u201cHold,\u201d Blade said.</p><p>They both turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 in your books and Will don\u2019t remember,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s some in London right now who might know how to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Scandinavians,\u201d Honoria whispered. She clapped a hand to her head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they likely to help?\u201d Honoria looked up at Will.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI barely know \u2019em. But they might.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go,\u201d Honoria demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leavin\u2019 her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is her best chance,\u201d she stressed. \u201cPlease, Will. You know I\u2019ll look after her. I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>He wavered. Honoria would do her best, but he could hardly bear to leave, knowing that Lena might... Baring his teeth, he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s her best chance. I\u2019ll fetch one of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that didn\u2019t sound as if you were goin\u2019 to drag \u2019em \u2019ere, willin\u2019 or not,\u201d Blade muttered.</p><p>Will pounded on the door of the manor that the Norwegians were leasing for the duration of their stay. Rain dripped incessantly, tangling in his hair and running down his face. The journey into the city had been a mindless one. He could barely remember any of it.</p><p>Glancing at his watch every few seconds did little to alleviate the tension riding him. It had taken him twenty minutes. Twenty minutes in which he didn\u2019t know what was happening to Lena.</p><p>Footsteps finally sounded in the entrance and the door opened on a harried-looking butler. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He pushed forward, into the doorway. \u201cIs the Lady Astrid in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s not at liberty\u2014\u201d</p><p>He had the man by the throat in seconds. \u201cYou go and fetch her,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cOr I\u2019ll rip your heart out through your nostrils, you understand?\u201d</p><p>The man went sprawling as Will released him and scrambled back across the marble tiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d someone barked.</p><p>The Fenrir stepped out of the shadows of the library, clad in his court attire. The wolf fur was secured around his broad shoulders with a polished bead of amber, and his gray beard and hair had been combed. The menace in his eye nearly threw Will over the edge.</p><p>Don\u2019t look him in the eye. Deep breath...</p><p>\u201cYou dare come into my house like this?\u201d the Fenrir asked in a deadly soft voice. \u201cYou dare treat my servants like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle.\u201d Astrid\u2019s voice. Soothing and calm. She strode to Magnus\u2019s side and eased a hand over his arm. \u201cLook at him. He\u2019s barely containing himself. Something\u2019s set him off.\u201d With an appeasing look, she turned to Will. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, overwhelmed by the scent of too many of his kind. \u201cIt\u2019s Lena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour woman?\u201d She frowned, then understanding dawned. \u201cShe\u2019s got the loupe, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI were only five. I don\u2019t remember how to deal with it, how to help her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay not be any help, lad,\u201d Magnus grumbled, subsiding. He stroked his beard. \u201cShe\u2019s the small girl?\u201d</p><p>Both he and Astrid exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s strong willed,\u201d Will blurted. \u201cShe\u2019ll fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have stayed away from her,\u201d Magnus said, lips thinning. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t mate with humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t touched her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Astrid said, shooting her uncle a look. \u201cLet me fetch my cloak. I\u2019ll come. Whether it helps or not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your carriage?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Will shook his head. \u201cCame on foot. By rooftop.\u201d</p><p>Astrid stared at him, her pale white skirts swishing around her ankles. Then a blinding smile crept over her lips. \u201cHow interesting. Let me change.\u201d</p><p>Magnus caught her arm as she turned to go. \u201cYou\u2019re not going alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s supposed to be at what\u2019s-his-name\u2019s ball. That hatchet-faced vulture who thinks he\u2019s amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Morioch,\u201d Magnus replied dryly. \u201cTake Eric. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll relish the opportunity to avoid another night of boredom.\u201d He turned his gaze toward Will. \u201cI\u2019m giving you my son and my niece. You bring them back to me or I\u2019ll mount your head on a spike, you understand?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. A man who spoke his language. \u201cPerfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rookeries, eh?\u201d Eric leaped off the rooftop onto the muddy streets below, his fur-lined cloak swirling around him.</p><p>Will followed, pushing past to lead the way. The warren came into view and some of the tension went out of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI expected a manor,\u201d Astrid murmured, landing beside them and staring up at the decrepit appearance of the building. \u201cDo you have a cellar? Or ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he muttered, shoving the front door open.</p><p>Rip guarded the front door, his hand straying to his belt as the door opened. Charlie and Lark sat on the bottom of the stairs, arguing over who\u2019d won the game of jacks. Charlie\u2019s jaw dropped as Astrid followed him in.</p><p>She\u2019d changed into a pair of tight leather breeches, with a vest that cinched her waist to a ridiculous span. Her hair had been braided back tightly, leaving her cheekbones bare, and the fur cloak she wore turned her into a barbarian princess. Even Rip\u2019s eyebrow rose.</p><p>Eric followed. The Norseman smiled, ruffling Lark\u2019s hair as if she were a little girl. Charlie looked like he was contemplating a fur cloak and chain mail addition to his wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Charlie blinked, tearing his gaze away from the exotic pair. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Honor won\u2019t let me in. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on, Will? I heard Lena crying\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoved past, heading straight up the stairs.</p><p>Soft whimpering sounds came from within Lena\u2019s room. Rapping softly on the door, he poked his head in.</p><p>Lena writhed on the bed, her cheeks burning with fever. Her nightgown clung to her body with sweat, and Honoria hovered by her head with a cool cloth. Blade was trying to keep her still, a glass of water in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDid they come?\u201d Honoria asked, strain showing around her mouth.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Lena. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Honoria\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cHer temperature\u2019s getting higher.\u201d</p><p>Something shoved him out of the way and Astrid pushed past. She took in the scene at a glance, slinging her cloak over a nearby chair. \u201cYou need to cool her. Fast. We\u2019ll need ice, and something large enough to put her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bath?\u201d Blade asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn me rooms,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She pressed a hand against Lena\u2019s temple, closing her eyes. \u201cVery close to the peak, but not there yet. There\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get hotter?\u201d Honoria gasped.</p><p>\u201cShe dies if she does,\u201d Astrid replied bluntly. \u201cWill, fetch me ice. Lots of it.\u201d</p><p>He spent the next twenty minutes smashing the heavy ice blocks to pieces, then carrying it from the deep cellars to Blade\u2019s room. The cellars were freezing; Blade needed a continuous supply of ice in order to keep his blood chilled.</p><p>Astrid and Honoria had taken over the bathroom. Astrid filled the bath to the brim with cool water, then poured buckets of ice chips into it.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain this is safe?\u201d Honoria asked. \u201cThey used to do this to the inmates at the institute I worked at. It was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will hurt, yes,\u201d Astrid replied, her expression unchanging. She met his gaze, knowing he\u2019d be the one to protest. \u201cWhatever she does, you must not interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much will it hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLike fire.\u201d She put a hand out to stop him. \u201cThis is her only chance. In Norway, we use the snow to quench the fever.\u201d</p><p>He hovered on the balls of his feet. The worst thing was knowing how much pain Lena was in right now. How much pain would come. He\u2019d spent two days clawing at the dirt in the cellar before the fever broke.</p><p>But there was no help for it. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>Astrid gave him a serious look. \u201cTwo or three days. Perhaps one has already passed. She seems halfway through it.\u201d</p><p>This was her only hope, he reminded himself, though the thought of hurting her made him feel sick. \u201cI\u2019ll go fetch her.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>The moment they put her in the water she started screaming.</p><p>Will held her down, despite her weak thrashing, his teeth clenched and his body tense. Astrid had said the shock of the cold might kill her, but without it her temperature would keep rising until she died.</p><p>The ice water burned his arms, his fingers eventually numbing. He could only imagine what it felt like for Lena. And it was all his fault. His eyes blurred with heat as he held her down, whispering to her that he was there, that she would be all right.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her thrashing to subside and her body to slump into his arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked. \u201cLena?\u201d There was no response. Only the slight quiver of her lip as she shivered.</p><p>\u201cBring her out,\u201d Astrid commanded.</p><p>Will cradled her carefully in his arms, icy water splashing all across the marble floors. They dried her off, with Astrid monitoring her temperature and the timepiece Honoria had given her.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs she better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer temperature\u2019s dropped a degree,\u201d Astrid said, taking the thermometer away. She exchanged a glance with Honoria. \u201cWill, I need more ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor next time.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Lena lolled in his arms, her skin clammy with cold, yet burning with an inner radiance. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach time her temperature goes up. Until the fever breaks.\u201d</p><p>The hopelessness of the situation hit him. \u201cShe\u2019s not goin\u2019 to make it, is she?\u201d</p><p>Astrid stroked the wet strands off Lena\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou told me she is strong willed, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn as rock.\u201d Tears burned in his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen bring more ice, Will.\u201d Leaning down, she whispered in Lena\u2019s ear. \u201cYou must fight, little one. Fight for your man, as he fights for you.\u201d</p><p>The night stretched out, hour after brutal hour. A never-ending vignette as he broke the heavy ice blocks into shards and carried them upstairs, then bathed her in the water. Honoria started crying, silent tears that streaked down her face. He couldn\u2019t look at her or he would break. Lena barely stirred when they put her in the bath now.</p><p>\u201cCome, mo cridhe.\u201d He kissed her forehead, wishing there was something, anything that he could do. But there was nothing he could kill here, nothing he could protect her from. His very uselessness battered at him.</p> <p>Too late...</p><p>For so many things. Too late to hold her now. Too late to kiss her, to give himself over to her as he had always feared to do. To tell her that he loved her, as he knew she had longed to hear.</p><p>He had held her at arm\u2019s bay, for fear of the very thing that was occurring now.</p><p>\u201cI will give you the world,\u201d he whispered, stroking the hair off her forehead. \u201cI will protect you, I swear. I\u2019ll never let you hurt again, I promise. Just come back, Lena. Come back and let me love you.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t hear him.</p> <p>Lost to the fever, she didn\u2019t hear any of them.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u201cHer heart\u2019s barely beating,\u201d Astrid said in a quiet voice.</p><p>Morning had broken, sunlight streaming through the window. The room was drenched, as if someone had waged war in the bath. Perhaps, he thought, it had been a war of sorts. And now it was becoming apparent that they were losing.</p><p>He could hear the thready beat of her heart. Clasping her hand, Will held her close against his chest, waiting numbly for that horrible moment when Astrid would force him to put her back in the bath. He didn\u2019t think Lena could take it anymore.</p><p>He barely could.</p> <p>His hands were shriveled and he shivered as he held her wet body in his arms. He could barely see or hear the world around him, his body fighting to sleep, to renew itself.</p><p>All he could feel was the body in his arms, the heat of her skin as the fever raged, despite their attempts to contain it. In the last hour, her temperature had increased two degrees. A human would be long dead by now.</p><p>Come on. He rocked her, muttering lullabies he could barely remember from his youth. When his mother had not looked at him as if wondering how such a monster could have stolen her son.</p><p>Come back to me.</p><p>A soft hand touched his shoulder. Astrid. \u201cWill, you must let her go.\u201d</p><p>No! He snarled and shook her away. If they tried to take her, he would kill them. All of them.</p><p>Quiet whispers. \u201c...too late. He\u2019s given himself to her... If she dies, he will pine away...\u201d</p><p>Honoria. Crying.</p> <p>He forced himself to his feet and staggered toward the bath. It was easier now, for he barely felt a thing. Lowering himself into the bath, he dragged Lena against his chest, her cheek resting on his shoulder. The slow tick of her heartbeat pulsed against his chest. Ice burned across his skin until he was numb all over.</p><p>The world faded.</p><p>Then hands were dragging him out of the bath, dragging Lena out of his arms. He snarled and flung them away from him, trying to reach for her. Blade\u2019s face swam into view. \u201cEasy now, let \u2019er go, Will. Let \u2019er go...\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Blade by the throat and tossed him aside. Eric was helping Astrid with Lena. He went for them, throwing Eric back into the mirror. It shattered and Astrid stiffened.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she cried. \u201cEverybody get out. Leave him to her. Before he kills someone.\u201d</p><p>Shoving Lena into his arms, she backed away, dragging her cousin with her. The door closed and he was alone, the bathroom a ruined mess.</p><p>\u201cLena,\u201d he whispered, curled around her in misery. Why wouldn\u2019t she come back? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Gods, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The bath was half-empty. He couldn\u2019t do it to her anymore. She was shivering as it was, goose flesh pebbled all over her skin.</p><p>Dragging himself to his feet, Will lurched toward the bedroom. If she died, then he didn\u2019t want her to be cold anymore. Ripping off her nightgown, he laid her down on the sheets of the bed and dried her carefully. Every inch of her was white with cold, her cheeks and chest flushed with a red rash. Every time he touched her, he felt the icy chill of her skin and that burning furnace deep within. A heart of fire buried beneath the ice.</p><p>Starting with her feet he began to chafe the heat back into her. No more cold. He couldn\u2019t let her die that way. Even now, her heartbeat was a weak echo in his ears.</p><p>It took a long time to rub the chill from her skin. Stripping off his wet clothes, he curled up beside her, dragging the blankets over the top of them. He dragged her into his arms, tried to use his own body heat to somehow revive her.</p><p>Long hours passed as he felt the heat burning deep within her. It answered his own, rising to the surface until they were both wet with perspiration. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, again and again, kissing her damp shoulder.</p><p>Sweat broke over her skin, along with a violent attack of shivers. Will buried his face against the back of her neck and breathed in the faint scent of her body. He was so tired. He just wanted to close his eyes and never wake up, but something was struggling against him.</p><p>A gasp.</p><p>A body wriggling weakly, skin slick with sweat, in his arms.</p><p>Opening grainy eyes, he stared in disbelief as Lena whimpered and tried to push him away.</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d she rasped. Her pupils were enormous still, her gaze unfocused.</p><p>Will sat up abruptly and she tumbled onto her back, barely able to move. \u201cLena?\u201d</p><p>Dry, cracked lips, her cheeks flushed with red. She\u2019d never been so beautiful. Shoving aside the blankets, she tried to move and sprawled onto the mattress face-first.</p><p>Grabbing the blanket, he draped her in it and tried to help her sit up. \u201cLena?\u201d Grabbing her chin, he held her eyelid up. A ring of bright copper circled her pupils. Incredulous breath expanded his lungs. \u201cYou survived.\u201d Her forehead was clammy with sweat as he cupped his palm against it, but the intense heat had abated. \u201cThe fever\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>She pushed at him weakly.</p><p>Plumping the pillows under her back, he eased her back against them. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some water. Stay here. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop himself from capturing her face in his hands. She was barely lucid, but the fever had broken. \u201cI love you.\u201d He kissed her hard, then drew back when she tried to whimper again. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you lots of water.\u201d</p><p>Honoria paced the kitchen, her cheeks scalded with tears and her eyes dry. There was nothing left in her. She\u2019d done all she could and still failed.</p><p>Blade dragged her back into his arms. \u201cThere\u2019s still \u2019ope. She ain\u2019t done in yet or we\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel ill.\u201d She pushed him away and leaned against the bench as a fist of nausea threatened to choke her.</p><p>She could sense Blade hovering over her, trying to get her to drink a glass of water. He suddenly looked up and she spun toward the door. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>The pair of Norwegians waited in the corner, faces tight with strain. She knew as soon as she looked at them that it was Will coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered, her knees going out from under her.</p><p>Blade caught her, drawing her up so that she was standing when Will came through the door.</p><p>Sweat gleamed over his naked body. Wild eyes, wild hair, his muscles burnished with heat. Honoria\u2019s jaw dropped and she looked away as he snatched the jug of water off the bench.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thirsty,\u201d Will growled, then turned and vanished the way he\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cThirsty?\u201d Honoria whispered. She spun toward Astrid. \u201cDoes that mean...?\u201d</p><p>Astrid\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cGoodness,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhat a shame he\u2019s already bound to her...\u201d</p><p>Eric punched her lightly in the arm and grinned. \u201cPut your eyes back in your head, cousin.\u201d He stood and clapped Blade on the back. \u201cIf she is thirsty, then all is well. The fever must have broken.\u201d</p><p>Honoria turned toward the door, but Eric caught her wrist and shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must trust that he will care for her. Leave them alone or risk having your head handed to you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing her expression, Astrid smiled. \u201cHe is acting inn matki munr. Like a newly mated male. He\u2019ll be insufferable for days, especially given that he nearly lost her. Leave them alone and give him time to calm down.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>Sunlight shimmered through gauzy lace curtains.</p><p>Lena moaned under her breath and tried to cover her eyes. Then she blinked. This wasn\u2019t her room. Where was she?</p><p>Sitting up sent a shaft of throbbing pain through the base of her skull. Wincing, she cracked her eyelids open and looked around.</p><p>Bare timber floor. Rough hewn furniture. A table in the corner with a single chair seated by it. And a pair of boots, attached to long muscular legs.</p><p>Will.</p><p>She was at Will\u2019s flat.</p><p>Sunlight caught the coppery tips of his hair and burnished his tanned skin. He dozed, propped up in an old armchair, his arms crossed over his chest and his head nodding forward. Dark circles shadowed his eyes and his jaw bore the signs of several days\u2019 rough growth.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen him he\u2019d been frantic; tucking her into his own cot, muttering that she was safe, that she would be all right now. Telling her again and again that he was sorry.</p><p>Lena frowned. When had that happened? She had a vague flashing memory of pain and heat, and then screaming as someone dropped her into what felt like a vat of burning oil. Honoria peering at her worriedly as she tried to give her water. Will snapping at Honoria, driving her from the room as he dragged Lena out of bed and brought her here.</p><p>What the devil had happened?</p><p>Tossing aside the blankets, she tried to stand up. The world spun and she staggered into the stove, her nightgown tumbling around her ankles. The faint odor of lavender clung to her. Not her usual soap. Someone must have been bathing her.</p><p>Will blinked sleepily. \u201cLena?\u201d He leaped to his feet and caught her, as if she were too fragile to even stand. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 out of bed?\u201d</p><p>The heat of his body was a welcome sensation. She burrowed her face against his chest and breathed deep. His scent was so familiar, so warm and masculine, but beneath that she caught myriad scents. Starched linen, soap, sweat, a hint of her sister\u2019s perfume, even the oil he used to clean the heavy hunting knife he wore strapped to his thigh.</p><p>How curious.</p><p>\u201cCan you shut the curtains?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s so bright.\u201d</p><p>His scent changed, became somehow sharper. \u201cIt\u2019s your eyes. They\u2019ll adjust, but it\u2019ll take a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdjust to what?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. His scent became even bitterer. \u201cLena.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cDo you remember aught of what happened?\u201d</p><p>The seriousness in his face and tone sobered her. She fought for recollection and failed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened? Is everyone all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>An odd question. She considered her body. Now that she was on her feet she felt better, an incredible lightness of being that she couldn\u2019t quite explain. \u201cVery thirsty?\u201d And another pressing need she didn\u2019t want to admit. Heat flushed through her cheeks. \u201cDo you think I could...use your washroom?\u201d</p><p>Will stared at her for a long moment, coppery rings burning around his pupils. He gave a short nod. \u201cO\u2019 course.\u201d</p><p>Herding her to the washroom as if she were an invalid, he started to follow her inside.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d She tried to shut the door in his face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in here,\u201d she replied firmly. \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>It took a moment, but his lips thinned and he turned on his heel. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch you some water to wash with.\u201d</p><p>He brought water, soap, and a small towel. As soon as he shut the door, she turned to the unmentionable. Perhaps she had been hasty. By the time she washed her hands in the jug of water on his washstand, her knees were shaking. And the water looked damned good. She was half tempted to drink it straight from his shaving jug but forced herself to merely rinse her mouth and scrub her teeth. Using his washrag, she stripped her nightgown off then washed herself with the cloth and soap. Lavender scent assailed her. He\u2019d definitely been bathing her.</p><p>Tugging her nightgown over her head, she ignored her discarded drawers. She wanted clean clothes, something to drink, and a good hot meal.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d She twisted the knob, but the door sprang open in her grip. Will hovered on the other side with a glass of water for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now that she\u2019d taken care of one need, others were begging for attention. Her gaze went straight past him, to the icebox, just as her stomach gave an embarrassing growl. She took the glass and gulped it down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mutton stew,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd bread and cheese. It ain\u2019t much, but there\u2019s lots of it. I had \u2019em send round as much as Esme could bake.\u201d</p><p>Stew. Her mouth watered. But there were other more pressing concerns. \u201cWill, why am I here? What\u2019s been happening? I can hardly remember the last day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been four actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Raking a hand through his hair, he turned away from her. \u201cHere. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Snatching the small bone-handled mirror off his washstand, he held it close, as if he didn\u2019t want her to see.</p><p>Sudden dread filled her. What was wrong with her? Her hands flew to her cheeks, but her skin felt normal. Snatching the mirror, she bought it up and stared at her reflection.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes,\u201d she whispered. They stared back at her, the pupils ringed with bright bands of copper. Slowly she lowered the mirror. \u201cBut how...? What...?\u201d</p> <p>Will couldn\u2019t meet her gaze. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry. I told you I ought never have come near you.\u201d He looked up, heat and anger swirling through his eyes. \u201cThis is why. I nearly lost you. I nearly killed you!\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and strode away, hands entwined behind his head. Lena risked another quick glance in the mirror. \u201cI have the loupe?\u201d she asked wonderingly.</p><p>He flinched as if she\u2019d hit him.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d Putting the mirror aside, she crossed toward him, but he jerked away, circling the table and chair as if she were hunting him. Taking a slow breath, she put her hands on the back of the chair and leaned on it. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I told you I wouldn\u2019t mind. If I could be with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly died!\u201d he snapped, eyes rolling with white.</p><p>And she realized then just how close it must have been. His hands clenched and he looked away, tearing his gaze from hers.</p> <p>\u201cHow bad was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t think you were goin\u2019 to make it,\u201d he replied hoarsely. \u201cI thought you were dyin\u2019, before the fever broke. You don\u2019t know what it did to me.\u201d He rubbed his chest. \u201cI went a little insane. I threw Blade across the room and brought you here. Honoria comes by every day but I couldn\u2019t let her... Not \u2019til you woke...\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached for the pain emblazoned on his face. \u201cI survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>His fists clenched and he turned his face away. \u201cYes, it does. You don\u2019t know what this means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat this means?\u201d She shoved the chair out of the way. Then the table. It was ridiculously easy. \u201cIs that you don\u2019t have any more excuses.\u201d</p><p>Will backed up against the cot, his hands held in front of him. \u201cDamn it, Lena,\u201d he growled. \u201cI infected you! Your life ain\u2019t gonna be the same.\u201d</p> <p>She stalked him. \u201cI certainly hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand perfectly.\u201d Stopping in front of him, she pushed on his chest and he stumbled back onto the cot, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>Staring at her hands in wonder, she couldn\u2019t stop her smile. \u201cHow strong do you think I am now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d I wonder if I could dangle a certain blue blood off the edge of the Ivory Tower?</p><p>The world had become a different place, full of blazing color, heat, and scents. Dust motes swirled through the shaft of light that lit them. She held her hands up, stirring them about. All her life she felt as though she\u2019d been blind, with the details of the world around her only newly revealed.</p><p>\u201cYou see this as a curse,\u201d she said, sliding onto his lap. The muscles in his thighs tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t. I know there shall be limitations. I know my time in the Echelon is done\u2014it was done the moment you carried me out of that ballroom.\u201d Seeing his mouth open, she pressed her finger against his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve been afraid for a very long time, Will. I\u2019m not afraid now. Not even a little. Is that part of it?\u201d</p><p>His gaze locked on hers. Mutiny burned there. He didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about my old life that I want to go back to,\u201d she whispered, sliding her leg up to straddle his hips. The nightgown slid up around her thighs, and he sucked in a sharp breath, his fingers clenching in the blankets. Lena rocked against his hips, the rasp of the buttons on his trousers riding over her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cI want a new life,\u201d she told him. \u201cWith you. I know that now.\u201d Sliding her hands over his shoulders, she leaned closer, breathing in his delicious musky scent. \u201cI finally know what I want. And I\u2019m not afraid to admit it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena.\u201d His hand curled against her bottom, as if in warning. \u201cYou\u2019re verwulfen now. A slave in the Echelon\u2019s eyes. You might never be able to leave the \u2019Chapel again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I need to?\u201d She brushed her mouth against his. \u201cWho says I ever need to leave this bed?\u201d</p><p>Another gasped breath. But his eyes were burning now, turning hot with a flood of amber color.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Will.\u201d A smile of victory curled over her lips as soon as she saw the change. \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt me anymore. You don\u2019t have any more excuses. You can hate yourself all you want, but quite frankly, I\u2019m rather impressed with the changes.\u201d</p><p>As she leaned toward him, he leaned back. Stubborn, stubborn man. Lena followed him, kneeling over him and drinking in the sight of that tempting body.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She kissed at his mouth, licked it. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>Hands hovered at her sides. Fingers stiff, half reaching for her. \u201cLena, damn it. You weren\u2019t well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone would think you a skittish bride on her wedding night.\u201d A smoky laugh, her voice lowering. \u201cNow that you can\u2019t hurt me, think of all the things you could do to me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze darkened. \u201cYou\u2019ve just recovered from a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel wonderful.\u201d She bit his lower lip, sucking it into her mouth. \u201cI feel better than wonderful.\u201d She laughed, dug her nails into his chest. \u201cI feel like I could do some very wicked things to you, right now.\u201d</p><p>Hands clamped on either side of her hips, and he opened up to her, his mouth chasing hers. \u201cDamn you, I thought I lost you.\u201d A shudder ran through him. \u201cI don\u2019t have the words to say... I can\u2019t fight it anymore,\u201d he admitted hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Their mouths met, the taste of him hot and furious, full of denied hunger. It felt so right. She almost shuddered, pressing herself against him, desperate to get closer, skin on skin, to let him sink himself deep within her. Need swamped her. Furious, desperate need.</p><p>Grabbing the hem of her nightgown, Will shoved it up. They broke the kiss just long enough to get it over her head, then she was naked against him, the rasp of his shirt abrading her nipples, his hands clenching in the soft flesh of her bottom. Lena wove her fingers through his hair, grabbing fistfuls of the silky strands.</p><p>A groan tore through her throat. She threw her head back as his hot mouth closed over the column of her throat. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. Her eyes shot wide as his teeth grazed the smooth slope of her breasts.</p><p>Her hands half lifted to cover herself, but he caught them and held them wide.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou promised me everythin\u2019 I could do to you. And I owe you for that bashful bride comment.\u201d</p><p>The domination in his voice thrilled her.</p><p>\u201cInstinct,\u201d she replied and threw her head and shoulders back. Light gleamed off her pale skin, her nipples hard and pink. A breathless fist twisted in her stomach at the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Hard lips captured hers. The answer was evident against her thigh, the thick, heavy heat of him branding her intimately. His tongue drove into her mouth even as his hands caught her hips and ground her against him.</p><p>It felt so good. Lena whimpered, her hands sliding up through his hair, her nails raking his scalp. The laughter was gone, faded. In its place was a desperate insanity, a hunger, a need to consume. The empty ache between her thighs almost undid her. She scrabbled at his shirt, tearing it over his shoulders until only the briefest scraps of linen hung from his elbows, still buttoned at the wrists.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he growled into her mouth, hands capturing her wrists.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She caught the top button of his trousers, but he drew her hands away.</p><p>\u201cPlenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>This time it was his turn to laugh. Caging her in his arms, he crushed her against his chest, his mouth possessing hers. Long, slow, hot kisses. Enough to drive her crazy. She wriggled, wanting more, desperately drinking at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He tumbled her onto her back, his hard body driving her back into the mattress as he pinned her. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna rush this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said you had a choice?\u201d</p><p>Another smile. His special smile. The one that melted her deep inside. \u201cI\u2019m still stronger than you.\u201d</p><p>Lena stroked her fingers down his abdomen. \u201cAnd bigger.\u201d Definitely bigger. She shivered. Splayed her hands over his chest. \u201cI always wanted to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She dragged her nails down his stomach, tugging at the waistband of his trousers. \u201cWhen I was younger, after I first moved into the warren. I wanted to touch you. To taste you. I dreamed of you,\u201d she admitted, heat flushing her cheeks.</p><p>Will met her eyes, his own sober. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to.\u201d Another devastating smile. \u201cDamn it, Lena, you don\u2019t know how much I wanted to. You drove me crazy. I ain\u2019t never felt such a thing for a woman before and you were too young... Too... I thought it were only a game for you. I had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Not truly.\u201d She smiled, latching onto the few words that interested her. \u201cYou\u2019ve never wanted a woman before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>A warm glow lit her from within. She tugged at his waistband, sliding her finger behind the button. It popped open and Will\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough wanting. Enough waiting,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impatient.\u201d</p><p>But he ran the backs of his fingers over the curve of her breast, watching the movement with a rapt fascination. Lena felt that touch in other places. She shivered, writhing beneath him.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Wide, slow circles around her breast, drawing ever nearer to her nipple. She arched under his touch, like a cat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019re teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Warm humor filled his eyes. \u201cI think I know somewhat how that feels.\u201d</p><p>The devil. She bit her lip and reached for him, but he reared away.</p><p>\u201cNo. Put your hands on the bed head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>He caught her wrist, forced her fingers around the iron bed head. \u201cI weren\u2019t askin\u2019.\u201d Taking the other hand, he repeated the motion. \u201cDon\u2019t make me tie you down.\u201d</p><p>Tie her down? The thought sent a shiver of need straight through her. She considered the demand, then relaxed her hands around the iron. \u201cVery well. Just don\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><p>Will lowered his head, his lips skimming across her collarbone. A soft laugh whispered over her skin. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the position to be making demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth closed over her nipple, the heat of it scalding her. Her mouth dropped open. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d He looked up at her, his tongue tracing the hardened bud, a devilish look in his eyes. Since when had he ever been this playful?</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s nice. I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Teeth grazed her soft skin. White heat turned her vision blank. When she could breathe again, he was laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cI told you to keep your hands on the rail.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d clenched her fingers in his hair.</p><p>\u201cBet you can\u2019t keep \u2019em there.\u201d</p><p>Lips firming, she grabbed the bar and curled her fingers around it. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I can. What do I win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d The murmur shivered over her skin. He licked her again, swirling his tongue around her nipple. \u201cIf you win... Perhaps I\u2019ll let you return the favor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTie you down?\u201d She sucked in a breath. Her arms were quivering. It was increasingly difficult to keep her thoughts straight. \u201cAnd if I lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen for a week you\u2019ll do everythin\u2019 I say, without even a single argument.\u201d</p><p>Lena lifted her head off the pillow. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t move your hands. No matter what, Lena.\u201d</p><p>Ducking his head, he kissed his way across to her other breast and lavished the same attention on it. The sensation shot through her like the charged lightning the Echelon used and stored in Leyden jars.</p><p>Throughout it all she clung to the bed, her hips arching up, desperately pleading for something, anything more. Her thighs were wet with her own need, the scent of it flavoring the air. He had to know.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d he told her, smugly wiping his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s about to get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>His fingers tickled her thigh. His mouth trailed down her stomach and she forgot to breathe. Little white dots danced before her eyes. \u201cWill!\u201d</p><p>Nuzzling into the thatch of dark hair between her thighs, he eased them wider. \u201cHeard enough stories \u2019bout what a woman likes. Might take some practice though. You let me know how I\u2019m doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>His mouth closed over her sensitive, wet flesh. Lena\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWill!\u201d The word was almost a scream, the shock of it slicing through her in waves of sensation.</p><p>Heat seared her as his tongue delved deep inside her. The rasp of his stubble against her oversensitized skin tore another gasp from her throat. Good heavens! What was he doing? How did he know? He nuzzled higher, sucking at the tender nub at the center of the sensation.</p><p>Lena lost her bet.</p><p>She clung to his shoulders, her hips jerking beneath him as he lathed her delicate flesh. \u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d She arched her hips up, trying to force herself against his mouth. \u201cOh, my God! Don\u2019t you dare stop!\u201d</p> <p>Delicious tension stretched and furled deep within her. Head thrown back, she gasped as he lapped at her, suckling her into his mouth. So close... So close to the edge...</p><p>She screamed as it broke within her. Screamed as he suckled her hard, driving her spasms higher, forcing the sensation through her. Sensation finally ceased as he lifted his head, eyes dark with amusement. He licked his lips and she rolled to the side, involuntary quivers shooting through her body as she sucked in desperate breaths.</p><p>Fingertips trailed up her thigh, circling her hip. The muscle jumped beneath his touch. \u201cLena.\u201d Humor flavored his voice. He kissed her hip. \u201cDid you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay I liked it rather a lot,\u201d she gasped. \u201cBut I\u2019m not quite sure at the moment. The world seems to have shifted.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his voice dropping to a smoky whisper. \u201cYou taste delicious.\u201d Another kiss, against the curve of her hip. He crawled up over her, nudging aside her arm and capturing her nipple between his lips.</p><p>It was too much, too soon. But she could no sooner have pushed him away now than she ever could have. Rolling onto her back, she slid her legs around his hips with a shudder. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing your trousers.\u201d</p><p>He caught her questing fingers and pressed her flat onto her back. As he captured her mouth, she tasted her own body on his lips. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve lost your bet.\u201d</p><p>Lena lost herself in the taste of his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re getting better at this,\u201d she whispered, tracing his tongue with her own.</p> <p>A pinch to her bottom made her jump. \u201cFirst the blushin\u2019 bride, now you question me skill at kissin\u2019?\u201d Grabbing her by the hips, he rolled them until he lay flat on the mattress and she straddled him. \u201cSince you\u2019re the one with all the experience, I\u2019ll let you lead.\u201d</p><p>Lena slid her hands over his bare chest. Will cupped his hands behind his head, the very picture of male repose. \u201cI like the fact that you\u2019ve never kissed another woman before,\u201d she protested. \u201cI like being your first. And I intend to be your last.\u201d The last few words came out as a low growl.</p><p>She slid her hands lower and tugged open the buttons on his trousers. The heavy ridge of his cock strained against the fabric then sprang into her hands with an eager thrust.</p><p>He was enormous, her fingers barely closing around the girth of him. A drop of pearly white glistened at the swollen head, thick veins curving around his shaft.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to do. All of the lessons about her flesh rights flew straight out of her head.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, seeing her helpless look. Grabbing her hands, he curled them around his cock. \u201cLike this.\u201d</p><p>Lena wet her lips, her hands stroking him carefully. His eyes glazed and he threw his head back, lip curled up in a silent snarl as he gripped the end of the bed. Thick muscle strained in his biceps as he squeezed tight.</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d she whispered, her hands loose as she stroked him.</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>Tightening her grip, she pumped the silky-slick skin in her hands. She couldn\u2019t tear her gaze from his face, watching as the violence of pleasure twisted his features, made him gasp. She made him gasp. The thought was heady and with it inspiration struck.</p><p>Years ago she\u2019d seen pictures of how to please a man and one thing had always stuck...</p><p>Lena bent low and licked at the slit on the throbbing head of his shaft. Will\u2019s hips pumped and he cried out wordlessly. It had felt so good for her, so she greedily suckled him into her mouth, tasting the saltiness of his seed on her tongue.</p><p>A hand fisted in her hair, driving her lower, his hips thrusting up, filling her mouth, her throat, with his cock. Feral light blazed in Will\u2019s eyes and he lifted his head off the bed to watch.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lena.\u201d A gasp. \u201cThat feels so fuckin\u2019 good.\u201d He collapsed back against the bed, his hands urging her away from him. \u201cYou have to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d She licked at the thin slit on the head of him. She\u2019d barely begun to learn what he liked\u2014</p><p>The world shifted. He yanked her up, rubbing his shaft between her thighs. \u201cCan\u2019t. Have to be inside you. Now.\u201d Snarling, he lowered her hips, the tip of his heavy flesh stretching her.</p><p>Lena gasped. She could feel the inexorable stretch of her body as he edged deeper. Pain burned. She couldn\u2019t do it. He was too big.</p><p>As if recognizing her distress, he froze.</p><p>Sweat gleamed against his hairline. The muscles in his arms trembled. \u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019. Tryin\u2019 to hold it,\u201d he whispered hoarsely.</p><p>And he would. He would turn away from this if he thought he was hurting her. Chain whatever turbulence drove him deep inside, force it back into the cage. The hunger gleamed in his eyes, the sheer need to possess her, but he would do it.</p><p>For her.</p><p>Lena shoved down, her mind branded with shock as he filled her. Will hissed, his fingers digging into her hips, even as the pain shot through her.</p><p>She gasped, wilting over him, her body so full of him that she didn\u2019t know where she began and he ended. The hurt was a pulsing throb where they joined, yet with it came the satisfaction of finally being in his arms, finally sheathing him in her body. She would do anything, pay any price to be his.</p><p>Will\u2019s hand slid up her back, cupping the back of her neck. \u201cDamn it, Lena. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but you feel so good, so tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fading,\u201d she whispered, lifting her head a little. The pain was receding, the loupe healing her. A part of her wanted to own that pain, to brand herself with the proof of his possession.</p><p>Will\u2019s hips flexed. He groaned, throwing his head back against the pillow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kissed his chest, a shivery sensation spreading through her. \u201cThen don\u2019t stop. I want to be yours.\u201d Rolling her hips brought another gasp to his lips. She tried again, squeezing him deep within, her body knowing instinctively what her mind didn\u2019t.</p><p>Will\u2019s fingers dug into her bottom. He thrust up, the heat of his body burning her from within.</p><p>The pain was gone, chased from her body by a dawning exhilaration. He was hers. He was finally hers, and she was never going to let him go. Lena threw her head back, his hands helping her to find the rhythm that pleased him and taunted her. Each slick glide brought her temptingly close to the edge.</p><p>Will curled his back, lifting off the pillow and claiming her mouth. The movement impaled her deeper, her knees driving into the mattress and the base of his shaft rubbing against her slit. Body tightening, she gasped, but there was no escape. From his mouth. From the feel of him, deep inside. From the hands that cupped the base of her skull.</p><p>Fingers clenching in her hair, he dragged her head back, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh of her trapezius. Marking her. Claiming her. Driving her over the edge.</p><p>Lena cried out as it took her. Her body clenched around his and he groaned, his hips slowing, his thrusts becoming deeper. Crying out, he shuddered violently against her, one hand against the small of her back as he drove her against him.</p><p>Long minutes of breathless gasping as she came back to herself. She\u2019d never felt safer, more at peace, than this moment in his arms.</p><p>Skin slick with sweat, his heart pounding against hers, she lifted her head slowly. Will shivered. His eyes were bright as copper pennies and fueled with uncertainty. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nibbled at his ear. Her body ached with the possession of their joining. And she loved it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight, mo cridhe.\u201d He stroked her face tenderly.</p><p>Lena cupped his hand against her face. Mo cridhe. Incomprehensible words she could remember him whispering to her in the fever, amongst others. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle one.\u201d He smiled, but the tension lingered in his bronze-warmed eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it means that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She kissed his palm, looked deep into his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Will chuckled against her skin and dragged her against his chest as he lay back. His body still nestled within hers. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he said, with a satisfied yawn. His eyelashes fluttered against his cheeks. \u201cBefore I\u2019m tempted to have me wicked way with you again.\u201d</p><p>He roused sometime later, just long enough to roll her onto her stomach and bite the back of her neck. Lena blinked sleepily as he tugged her hips up and thrust inside her. This time there was no gentleness. Whatever thought spurred him out of sleep, he slaked it on her body, filling her, owning her. Claiming her with such desperation that she collapsed panting on the bed afterward, unable to breathe, her body still tingling with aftershocks.</p><p>And again. Barely hours later, with evening darkening the sky. Driving her into the mattress, his eyes gleamed with copper, lost to the feral side of his nature.</p><p>It ignited something within her. Urges she\u2019d never felt before. They kissed and bit and thrust at each other, desperate to leave some mark, some shadow of themselves on the other\u2019s skin. The darkness within her unfurled and she raked her nails down his back as she screamed her pleasure into the night.</p><p>She lost count of how many times he took her. The world faded. Became little more than skin and sweat and seed, the thrust of his body, the acceptance of her own. Sometime before dawn they both collapsed, exhaustion shivering through her body.</p><p>Will crept from the bed and fixed a plate of stew for her, warming it on the stove. Her hungers changed and she ate two plates ravenously before collapsing back onto the cot. There was barely room for two, but he curled around her, dragged the blankets over them, and nuzzled into her hair. A part of her liked the fact that the bed wasn\u2019t bigger.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he whispered, as if he wasn\u2019t the cause of her sleepless night.</p><p>She snuggled against him, her eyelashes fluttering heavily against her cheeks. \u201cOnly...if you let me...\u201d</p><p>She was asleep before she finished her sentence.</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>A sharp rapping at the door woke her. Lena lifted her head off the warm pillow it rested on\u2014Will\u2019s chest\u2014and blinked sleepily. Despite the two bowls of stew she\u2019d consumed, her stomach rumbled as if she\u2019d been starved for a week.</p><p>The muscles beneath her tensed. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>He rolled out of bed, dragging his trousers on. Lena lazily enjoyed the view, tempted to drag her fingernails over his bare buttocks. She\u2019d once thought him too bulky and coarsely built, but she\u2019d been wrong. He was perfect. All sculpted muscle and bronzed skin. Beside him, the blue bloods paled into insignificance with their padded shoulders and pale skin.</p><p>One of the buttons on his trousers was missing, no doubt in her enthusiasm last night. He shot her an exasperated look, then crossed to the door. Lena sat up, searching for her nightgown. Her gaze settled on a pile of abandoned white linen near the door. Dragging the sheet around her body, she tucked it between the crevice of her breasts and tried to comb out the snarls in her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door thundered beneath the weight of someone\u2019s fury.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019,\u201d Will muttered and snatched it open.</p><p>Honoria staggered into the room, her face pale and her eyes flashing dark with fury. \u201cYou let me in!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. I want to see her! She\u2019s mine too, you kn\u2014\u201d Her gaze lit on Lena and she darted under Will\u2019s outstretched arm with a soft cry. Sliding to her knees, she wrapped her arms around Lena and dragged her close.</p> <p>\u201cI sent you a message,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>Lena breathed deeply, filling her lungs with her sister\u2019s familiar scent. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she said as Honoria burst into tears.</p><p>Blade sauntered inside with a shrug. \u201cYou got five days,\u201d he said to Will. \u201cThat\u2019s all I could \u2019old \u2019er for.\u201d</p><p>Will tried to shut the door but it jerked back in his direction and Charlie slid inside with a cheery smile. It faded when he saw her, turning to a puzzled frown. \u201cWhy ain\u2019t you wearin\u2019 any clothes?\u201d</p><p>Heat burning in her cheeks, Lena helped Blade collect Honoria. \u201cGive me time to wash up and dress,\u201d she murmured. Snatching up her nightgown, she darted into the washroom.</p> <p>Barely a minute later, Will followed her inside, a harried look on his face.</p><p>\u201cToo much of my family?\u201d</p><p>His gaze roamed down her naked body and he reached for the washcloth. \u201cAye. Need a moment. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>She squealed under her breath as he slid the washcloth between her thighs. \u201cWill!\u201d Dropping her voice, she tugged it out of his fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>Washing swiftly, she dragged her nightgown back over her head. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you thought to bring anything for me to wear with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI weren\u2019t plannin\u2019 on keepin\u2019 you dressed.\u201d He tickled her bottom.</p> <p>Catching his fingers, she glared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re in a rare fine mood this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He nuzzled closer, his breath sliding over her throat. \u201cHelp me wash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to get us out of here in a hurry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hands slid over her hips.</p><p>Lowering her voice to a bare whisper, she pushed him away. \u201cNot with my family in the next room, thank you. Wash up and get dressed.\u201d Taking her chance, she ducked under his grasping arm and slipped through the door.</p><p>Honoria was drying her eyes when she reappeared.</p><p>Lena took her hand and led her to the chair. \u201cSit,\u201d she instructed, pushing on Honoria\u2019s shoulders. It felt odd to be giving orders, when Honoria had always been the one to issue them. Leaning closer, she kissed her sister\u2019s wet cheek. \u201cCheer up. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p> <p>Dragging one of the blankets around her shoulders to cover her thin nightgown, Lena nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t remember very much of it at all. I do remember your voice though. Thank you for looking after Will.\u201d</p><p>Honoria exchanged a glance with Blade. \u201cNot that he allowed much. He virtually kidnapped you.\u201d</p><p>Blade poured water into a battered old kettle. \u201cYou \u2019as to let \u2019er go sometime, luv.\u201d</p><p>Honoria\u2019s lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cI am all of twenty,\u201d Lena reminded her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still my little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can beat you in an arm wrestle now.\u201d</p><p>The reminder didn\u2019t sit well with Honoria. Lena laughed and settled on the edge of the cot. Will chose that moment to enter, tugging his shirt into place. Water turned his gold-tipped hair darker, spiking his eyelashes together. Her breath caught. So handsome.</p><p>\u201cUrgh,\u201d Blade muttered. \u201cTell me we weren\u2019t that bad?\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for Charlie to comprehend. His eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re \u2019ere! You and Will? That\u2019s smashing! When did that \u2019appen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie, don\u2019t forget your h\u2019s,\u2019\u201d Honoria corrected.</p><p>A roll of the eyes. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He punched Will in the shoulder. \u201cHow do you like that, eh? Another man in the family. Thank God it ain\u2019t one o\u2019 them prancing blue bloods from the Echelon. I never thought she\u2019d be sensible enough to choose a decent man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Lena said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be having me back anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Charlie peered at her eyes. \u201cI like them,\u201d he declared.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d She laughed, then realized that Blade and Honoria were exchanging another of those long glances that spoke volumes. \u201cWhy? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo\u2019s visited three times,\u201d Honoria said. \u201cThe prince consort wants to know why Will isn\u2019t doing his duty and has requested Lena\u2019s presence. Leo\u2019s trying to placate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re signin\u2019 the treaty tomorrow,\u201d Blade said. \u201cIf the Norwegians will come to the party.\u201d</p><p>Will eased a possessive hand over her shoulder. \u201cThey can\u2019t see Lena. Spreadin\u2019 the loupe\u2019s punishable by death.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s hand shot to his. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She looked from him to Blade. \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt Will, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I\u2019ve anythin\u2019 to say \u2019bout it.\u201d Blade sobered. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to \u2019ide. The prince consort already knows. I believe the Lady Astrid told him. She probably thought it didn\u2019t matter much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t dare hurt Will,\u201d she said, finding her feet and dragging the blanket tighter around her. \u201cHe can\u2019t risk alienating the Scandinavians until they\u2019ve signed the treaty. Will, your best chance is to make an appearance tomorrow, force his hand. Make him publicly acknowledge me and what has happened when he must keep face with the Scandinavians.\u201d</p><p>Will glared down at her. \u201cI ain\u2019t takin\u2019 you into the heart of the Echelon. Not with the Norwegian\u2019s allegiance still in doubt and them pasty-faced maggots swarmin\u2019 round us. Not \u2019til the treaty\u2019s signed and you\u2019re safe by the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they won\u2019t change the law unless the Norwegians sign,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDo you think they will?\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s silence was answer enough. \u201cAstrid and Eric helped us. But they ain\u2019t the ones in power. And I don\u2019t think the Fenrir rules with his heart. I think he knows exactly which way he\u2019s gonna play this and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we need to convince him otherwise,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me in danger. But I\u2019m not about to sit and watch when it\u2019s your head that\u2019s on the line!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised we\u2019d work together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I thought it were dangerous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you! Not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Will snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been spat at or had women hide their children from you. You\u2019ve never been trapped in a cage, Lena, whilst the blue bloods sneered that that was where you belonged. I tried to tell you. This is a different world and I\u2019m so bloody sorry for that. I\u2019ll try to get them to sign the treaty, but I won\u2019t risk you. Not again. I couldn\u2019t bear to lose you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. Arguing with him was futile. She had to be rational if she had any chance of winning his approval. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the court. You don\u2019t know the dangers to be encountered there. You don\u2019t see them because you don\u2019t play such games yourself, therefore you don\u2019t expect them to be played.\u201d He opened his mouth but she hurried on, determined to finish. \u201cIt won\u2019t be knives or fists or fights in dark alleys, Will. It\u2019ll be played with words. You wouldn\u2019t even realize the trouble until you were buried in it. You need me. I know this world. I know how to play the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you fail, then you die,\u201d she replied bluntly. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be nobody to protect me. Especially not the law.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. \u201cDamn it, Lena\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Strain whitened his jaw and his eyes rolled with white. But his shoulders slumped and she knew she had him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t leave my side. Not even for a moment. If anyone makes a move against you, I will kill \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d she said softly. Sensing his distress\u2014to let her do this went against every instinct he owned\u2014she stroked his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d Blade laughed, then clapped Will on the back. \u201cYou know you\u2019re in trouble when you been outmaneuvered by a mere slip of a lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you laugh,\u201d Honoria warned. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we dusted off your court clothes and made an appearance. We can help guard Lena.\u201d</p><p>Blade winced. \u201cThe Echelon\u2019s gonna love that.\u201d</p><p>Lena scraped the last of the soup out of the bowl and peered inside it mournfully. She\u2019d already eaten half a kidney pie, a plate of stew, two slices of bread, and now the bowl of soup. And she still felt hungry.</p><p>The others had taken over Blade\u2019s sitting room at the warren and were arguing about how to convince the Scandinavians to accept the treaty tomorrow. Will glanced over at her with a frown, then looked down at the bowl. \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, he took the bowl out of her hands and crossed to the soup tureen on the table. \u201cGotta keep your strength up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get plump.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and filled the bowl. \u201cIt ain\u2019t likely, but it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d</p><p>The bowl warmed her hands almost as much as his words warmed her heart. Lena peered down into the broth. All her life she\u2019d been nothing more than a pretty face to most men. Her father\u2019s princess. A piece of froth to the Echelon.</p><p>Only Will saw her as something else. Something more.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door and Blade swung around sharply as Esme entered. \u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured with a cheerful smile. \u201cBut I\u2019ve a letter for Lena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena?\u201d Will straightened.</p><p>Lena frowned, accepting the letter. Who would think to find her here? The only one who knew she visited with any great regularity was Leo.</p><p>Sliding a thumbnail under the edge of the envelope, she slid it open. It was empty except for a small curl of hair, tied neatly with a ribbon.</p><p>Blond hair. Silky fine.</p><p>It smelt like Charlie.</p><p>Lena froze. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she asked hoarsely.</p><p>The room stilled as everyone sensed her sudden fear. Esme licked her lips. \u201cThere was a man at the door not a few minutes ago. Said he had a letter for you.\u201d</p><p>Blade crossed to the windows, twitching aside the curtains. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>As Esme stammered out a vague response, Will took the tuft of hair from her and sniffed at it. He shot a look toward Charlie, then raised a questioning brow at her.</p><p>Lena put the soup aside, her appetite destroyed. She knew exactly what it meant. She hadn\u2019t been performing as expected. Someone wanted her to destroy this treaty and so far she\u2019d made no headway.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>Lena shook her head, pushing herself to her feet. Her throat felt thick. It had to be the person from Crowe Tower. If he could get to Charlie here, get so close as to steal a lock of his hair...</p><p>She froze, her hands clenching in her skirts. What could she do? Destroy the treaty and she risked Will\u2019s life. But if she didn\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cLena?\u201d A warm hand slid over the small of her back.</p><p>They were all looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d</p><p>Will would hate her for this. She thought of his smile, only moments earlier, of the gentle way he stroked her back now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Charlie\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Honoria asked quietly, her eyes locked on the piece of hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Lena?\u201d</p><p>Tell them and she risked losing Will... But no, that was a selfish thought. Her stomach clenched. Charlie\u2019s life was at risk, and so was Will\u2019s. This had grown beyond her capabilities to solve.</p><p>Her shoulders sank. \u201cIt\u2019s Charlie\u2019s. It\u2019s...\u201d One glance toward Will, as if she couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you. Somebody threatened me. They had one of Charlie\u2019s clockwork soldiers that they\u2019d taken from his room. They said that if I didn\u2019t destroy the treaty they\u2019d hurt him.\u201d The words wouldn\u2019t stop now. \u201cI thought if I did what they said it would be all right. But I couldn\u2019t. Not when it meant your freedom...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will looked as though she\u2019d struck him. Lena cringed and grabbed his hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never meant to do it. I never wanted to...\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand and she flinched. Will froze, then slowly reached out and brushed his fingers under her jaw, tilting her face toward him. \u201cSomebody threatened you?\u201d The words were soft. Dangerous.</p><p>Lena trembled. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t want anything more to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>His brows drew together. \u201cLena, I ain\u2019t gonna hurt you.\u201d His fingers tightened on her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m gonna smash someone else\u2019s head into a wall, but I would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Relief welled up like a sudden flood. A hot tear leaked down her cheek. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be angry with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d He grabbed her roughly, enveloping her against his chest. \u201cNo more secrets \u2019tween us. Promise?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, breathing in his familiar scent. Her fingers clenched in his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFoolish plots and all.\u201d</p> <p>Stroking the sticky hair off her face, he lowered his head and brushed his mouth against hers. Lena kissed him desperately, clinging to his shirt.</p><p>Behind them someone cleared their throat. \u201cWhat, precisely, is going on?\u201d Honoria asked.</p><p>They were all four staring at her. Blade examined the situation, his eyes narrowed. \u201cSomeone came in here, took one of Charlie\u2019s toys, didn\u2019t they? Took a lock of his hair?\u201d</p><p>Charlie clapped a hand to his head, as though searching for the lack.</p><p>Will took a deep breath. \u201cLena? You may as well tell \u2019em. Blade\u2019ll need to know, if we\u2019re to keep the boy safe.\u201d</p><p>Lena slid her hand into his and locked her gaze on Honoria\u2019s. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t yell.\u201d</p> <p>Honoria crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to make a promise I might break.\u201d</p><p>This was the price of keeping secrets. Lena squared her shoulders and told them everything.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, everyone was looking at her. Honoria\u2019s mouth was a hyphen, but at least she wasn\u2019t screaming.</p><p>\u201cHumanists,\u201d Blade muttered. \u201cLike your father?\u201d</p><p>Honoria nodded sharply. \u201cI assume this has something to do with the cipher-text Will wanted me to decode?\u201d</p><p>Lena breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cYes. I thought it was only times and dates for them to meet. Information.\u201d</p><p>Her hopeful look died when Honoria\u2019s gaze skittered away. \u201cI tried an auto key cipher, but I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it,\u201d Honoria said. \u201cSo I asked Leo. His colleague, Lord Balfour, has this wonderful machine, based on one of Babbage\u2019s uncompleted designs. It\u2019s an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message,\u201d Blade interrupted with a slight smile.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Project Firebird aborted. Suspect sabotage from within, holding off and awaiting orders. Mechanists under hand once more. Await further instructions.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Lena asked.</p><p>Honoria shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFirebird,\u201d Will muttered. \u201cThe draining factories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ros... Mercury claimed they had nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she lied,\u201d Will said. \u201cOr someone else is sendin\u2019 these messages from the humanist faction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody politics,\u201d Blade muttered.</p><p>Honoria frowned. \u201cWhat I want to know is why you kept all of this to yourself. Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Lena stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d Her gaze speared Will. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Blade, then away. \u201cI thought I could handle it.\u201d</p><p>Honoria\u2019s eyes narrowed. She looked between the two men. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>Blade stared at her, his arms crossed defensively over his chest. \u201cWill didn\u2019t want me comin\u2019 up against the Echelon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been drinkin\u2019 \u2019uman blood again,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cIt\u2019s why me CV results ain\u2019t been comin\u2019 down more.\u201d</p><p>Honoria\u2019s jaw dropped in surprise. \u201cBut...but why? My vaccinated blood was curing you. If we kept going your CV results might almost negate themselves. You might be completely cured. You might be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Uman,\u201d Blade said softly. He looked like a man facing the tumbrel. \u201cIt takes away the threat o\u2019 the virus, luv, but it takes me strength, me speed.\u201d His face screwed up. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to know I ain\u2019t facin\u2019 the Fade anymore. I can\u2019t afford to be weaker. The Echelon\u2019d be upon us like a pack o\u2019 rabid dogs. Will were tryin\u2019 to prevent that from \u2019appenin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Honoria stared at him helplessly, her eyes gleaming with tears. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone tell me these things?\u201d Her hot gaze flashed to Lena. \u201cAm I truly so rabid, so fearful, that you\u2019re all too scared to tell me? I only want what\u2019s best for you. For all of you.\u201d</p><p>Blade let out a sharp breath, as if he\u2019d feared worse. \u201cIt ain\u2019t that, luv. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you. You were so set on a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not irrational,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too rational,\u201d Blade said with a tentative smile. He stroked her fingers and she slowly turned her palm toward him, accepting the touch. Relief flooded his expression.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Honoria let out a sharp breath. \u201cSince we\u2019re so set on spilling our secrets today.\u201d She pressed her hand to her midriff and blurted, \u201cI think I\u2019m with child.\u201d</p><p>The color drained out of Blade\u2019s face. For a moment he looked as he had three years ago, when he stared the Fade in the face. \u201cHonor?\u201d The whisper was a mix of terror and awe.</p><p>Delight swam up inside Lena\u2019s chest. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d she asked, taking her sister by the hands.</p><p>\u201cI saw the midwife yesterday,\u201d Honoria replied, her eyes flooding with tears again.</p><p>Lena hugged her close, happiness surging through her. \u201cYou deserve it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a wonderful mother.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help a rueful grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve had plenty of practice at mothering all of us.\u201d</p><p>Esme embraced them both. Over Honoria\u2019s shoulder Lena saw Blade stagger against the armchair. Charlie caught him with a grin. Even Will\u2019s lips curled in a smile.</p><p>\u201cBloody \u2019ell,\u201d Blade muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Then he reached out and dragged Honoria into his arms.</p><p>The next day Lena took a deep breath and smoothed the aubergine taffeta over her hips. The girl in the mirror looked like a stranger; corseted and bustled, with elegant feathers in her hair and one of the pretty clockwork brooches she\u2019d designed at her breast. The tiny dragonfly\u2019s brass wings fluttered rhythmically and she knew it would draw the focus off her eyes.</p><p>Will said they\u2019d change, the coppery ring around her pupils gradually taking over. Lena quite liked them. It was a sign that this pretty girl who stared back at her was no longer powerless. No longer prey.</p><p>She smiled and the reflection smiled back at her, teeth slightly bared. Yes. That was better. That was more herself now. She was tired of being afraid, and telling everyone her secrets had taken the last weight off her shoulders. Blade had tightened security on the warren and Charlie was safe and sound now. Nobody would get near him.</p><p>All that remained was to bring this treaty to a close.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. She was very much going to enjoy ruining the mysterious assailant\u2019s plans.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Leo called, rapping at her opened door. He\u2019d insisted that she accompany him. Not only would it help disguise the rumors about her precise relationship with Will, but the weight of his title would offer further protection. If the mysterious assailant made a move toward her, he\u2019d be waiting. Between he and Blade, they\u2019d both resolved to dig out the traitor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Mrs. Wade to the door?\u201d</p><p>The first thing she\u2019d insisted upon when she returned to Waverly Place the night before. She\u2019d had enough of being manipulated and betrayed. Mandeville had finished the outer casing of the transformational and picked up the interior this morning, professing his sincere apologies, but she felt it would be a long time before she could trust him again.</p><p>\u201cWith a reference.\u201d Leo\u2019s dark expression betrayed his curiosity, but he wouldn\u2019t ask. They\u2019d never shared a relationship like that. He\u2019d protected her and guided her through the dangerous waters of the Echelon, but he always held her at a slight distance. Indeed, a distance with which he held the world.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, stretching up on her toes to press her lips to his cheek. \u201cFor everything you\u2019ve done for me. For taking me in when I didn\u2019t know what to do with my life.\u201d</p><p>A slight pause. Then an enigmatic lift of his brow as he drew away, a rash of heat curving across his cheeks. \u201cI believe what you\u2019re saying is good-bye.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know where I belong now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cthere are only so many ways the loupe can be spread. I don\u2019t even want to imagine how you caught it, since you\u2019re my...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister,\u201d she prompted.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI can never be your brother. Not in public. You know that. This was all I could ever give you.\u201d</p><p>Always so stiff and distant. She smiled mischievously. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an uncle, you know?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped swiftly to her midriff, then away.</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>An incredulous expression broke over his oh-so-proper countenance. \u201cGood God. He\u2019s breeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is your brother-in-law,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWith any luck their baby will be just like him.\u201d</p><p>Horror gave way to a calculated expression. \u201cYes,\u201d Leo murmured. A smile edged over his lips. \u201cThat would be justice.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, the sound of it following them all the way to the carriage.</p><p>Steam carriages disgorged their occupants onto the cobbled courtyard outside the Ivory Tower. Lena gathered her skirts and looked around for Will. The courtyard was a flurry of color, with bright parasols and elegant hats. At a ball, a debutante seeking a protector was expected to wear white. During the day, the vibrant nature of the Echelon sprang to life.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will?\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Blade\u2019s carriage,\u201d Leo murmured. \u201cPerhaps they\u2019re not yet here. Traffic in the streets is rather congested.\u201d</p><p>Her eye caught a conservative group near the stairs. \u201cThe Norwegians.\u201d Snapping open her parasol, she straightened. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak to them whilst we wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLena\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a blithe smile she turned and stepped into someone. They collided in a tangle of skirts, and Lena grabbed the other woman\u2019s arm before she could help herself.</p><p>Green eyes widened and Adele looked away sharply. \u201cPardon,\u201d she murmured, attempting to move past.</p><p>Lena\u2019s fingers tightened. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please, Adele.\u201d</p><p>A pained expression crossed her friend\u2019s face. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy father\u2019s on the verge of signing a thrall contract for me with Lord Abagnale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old brute?\u201d</p><p>Adele glanced around. \u201cI can\u2019t be seen with you. You know what they\u2019re like. This is my last chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdele, there are whispers he beat his last thrall to death!\u201d</p><p>Color faded from Adele\u2019s smooth cheeks. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m aware of that?\u201d She looked away and Lena\u2019s gaze was drawn to the heavy pearl choker that draped her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d</p><p>Adele shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d She reached up, as if to move it, but Adele snatched her fingers and stared at her pleadingly.</p><p>\u201cThey think I\u2019m anyone\u2019s game now. Colchester found me alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColchester?\u201d Lena hissed. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said since I liked it so much with Cavendish...I couldn\u2019t stop him. That\u2019s why I need Abagnale. He\u2019s rich and he gives his thralls everything they desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to make up for the bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Adele\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cIf he gives me enough, maybe I can pawn it. Maybe I can get enough money to run away. To America. To New York.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lena\u2019s gut clenched. For a thrall to break his or her contract meant execution. \u201cThey\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>Adele\u2019s shoulders slumped as if hearing the truth had stolen her last hope. \u201cThen I\u2019ll stay with Abagnale for as long as...as I can.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair. Lena had found her own sense of freedom, if she could convince the Norwegians to accept the treaty. But Adele hadn\u2019t. And neither had any of the young women fanning themselves in the square, putting on airs as they tried desperately to attract a benefactor.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t accept him,\u201d she said, tearing her glove off. Grabbing the ruby on her finger, she twisted it off and pressed it into Adele\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s got a concoction inside it that will incapacitate a blue blood. Here. Like this.\u201d She swiftly flicked the tiny thorn out and showed Adele what to do. \u201cIt\u2019ll give you a chance to get away if any one of them tries to hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>A fierce light flashed through Adele\u2019s eyes. Then faded. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Damn this world. Lena wanted to scream at the injustice of it. \u201cIf you need help you can come to me. Or to Leo. Tell him I sent you.\u201d Sudden inspiration hit. A way to protect those like her, who didn\u2019t have any way to fight back. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m going to open a house. A place for young women in trouble to come to, where no one can hurt them or force them to submit. A place they can stay as long as they want, until we can find a new life for them.\u201d</p><p>Adele stared at her. \u201cAnd how do they get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start a new fashion,\u201d she declared. \u201cIn ruby rings.\u201d</p> <p>Adele looked down, at the gem sparkling on her finger. \u201cI like it,\u201d she whispered and a tiny hint of hope returned to her expression.</p><p>\u201cAdele!\u201d Mrs. Hamilton snagged her by the other arm, shooting Lena a glance she might have given a stranger. \u201cCome. Lord Abagnale wanted to admire your pretty new necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make any decisions,\u201d Lena pleaded. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Then Adele was swallowed up by the crowd and Lena was left behind, with a new dream smoldering in her heart.</p><p>To do such a thing would mean going up against the blue bloods who liked their little game. It also meant surviving the next day. Forcing the prince consort to recognize what Will was doing and hold him to his pledge to change the laws.</p><p>Her determined gaze settled on the Norwegians.</p> <p>They saw her coming, the grizzled old Fenrir\u2019s eye narrowing on her. He\u2019d made little concession to the event, still wearing his stark eye patch and wolf fur pinned over his shoulder. The pair of handsome young men at his side had cast off their own furs and wore matching navy uniforms, buttoned up the left breast, with gold frogging and epaulets. She recognized Eric, with his windswept golden hair and the queue of swarming ladies nearby.</p><p>Lena nodded to the Fenrir. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you survived,\u201d he growled back.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lena replied, ignoring his rudeness.</p><p>Turning, she greeted the other members of the party. Lady Astrid wore a slight smile, her pale blond hair gleaming against the silvery ruff of fur over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cConsidering how ill I was, I\u2019m quite surprised at the swiftness of recovery. I feel in most excellent health,\u201d Lena said.</p><p>\u201cThe initial fever is the only danger,\u201d Astrid replied. \u201cYour body\u2019s attempts to repel the virus are what threatens you. Once the fever abates, the virus heals you rapidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast, furious, and rather violently passionate,\u201d Lena mused. \u201cReminds me of someone I know.\u201d</p> <p>Astrid smiled. \u201cIt will take months yet for your full strength to settle in. You will find your moods erratic and yourself prone to emotional outbursts. You must learn to control these, for fear of hurting someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven a woman suffers from such tempers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially a woman,\u201d Eric jested.</p><p>Astrid turned her quelling gaze on him. \u201cConsidering how many times you were dumped in the sea or chained in the cage, you are bold to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay nicely.\u201d Magnus eased a hand on both their arms. His hungry gaze narrowed on someone. \u201cWe are being watched.\u201d</p><p>The breeze stirred Lena\u2019s skirts as she followed his gaze. The Warhammer watched them from across the courtyard. The Duchess of Casavian conversed with him, but that wasn\u2019t what caught Lena\u2019s attention. On the other side of him, the Duke of Lannister glared at her over a flute of champagne.</p><p>Colchester.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d taken a step toward him until Astrid caught her arm. The sudden burning rage she felt almost choked her. He had threatened her, hunted her, and almost killed her. And then he\u2019d tried to do the same to Adele. A shimmering red haze settled in her vision.</p><p>\u201cYou must breathe. Nice and slow,\u201d Astrid cautioned her. \u201cThis is what I warn you of. This fury. This uncontrollable need. You must let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d With the fury coursing through her she felt powerful, invincible. Without it, she was afraid she would feel like she always had\u2014a timid little mouse, scuttling away whilst Colchester stalked her.</p><p>\u201cYou would not reach him,\u201d Astrid said. \u201cThey will cut you down, then turn on us. You know this to be true.\u201d</p><p>A heavy hand settled on her shoulder. \u201cBreathe,\u201d the Fenrir commanded. The weight of his hand calmed her. \u201cBreathe in.\u201d As she complied, his hypnotic voice continued. \u201cAnd as you breathe out, you must let it go.\u201d</p><p>Colchester tipped his champagne flute toward her in a mocking salute.</p><p>Lena\u2019s fists clenched. \u201cI hate him. I hate him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must let it go,\u201d Magnus commanded. \u201cBreathe, Miss Todd. Here is your hotheaded young man.\u201d He turned her toward the line of carriages. \u201cWhat will he do if he sees you so upset?\u201d</p><p>Will would rip Colchester to pieces. Lena sucked in a deep breath. She couldn\u2019t allow that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe understand,\u201d Magnus replied. \u201cMore than most.\u201d A brief smile crossed his hard features. \u201cLet it go. Let your anger and your hate go. Let it wash through you. Like the wind. Cleansing you. Bringing you peace.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, Lena listened to the soothing timbre of his voice. The muscles in her shoulders relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI think you had best take your hand off her,\u201d Eric murmured. \u201cOr risk an international incident.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of his touch was gone. Lena opened her eyes to see Will bearing down on them with Blade and Honoria in tow.</p><p>He wore a brown leather waistcoat, the brass buttons riveted to the seam, and a gorgeous velvet long coat that at first glance appeared to be black. Only on close inspection did she realize it was so dark a navy as to look like midnight. The wind ruffled his tangled golden-brown hair as he strode across the yard toward her, scattering ladies and blue bloods alike.</p><p>Taking the stairs two at a time, he surged to her side. Lena couldn\u2019t stop herself from looking down. Supple leather boots finished just above his knee, with a pair of brass, military-style spurs jangling on the marble tiles.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She had to touch him, brushing the backs of her fingers against his thigh. \u201cWhere did you get those from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boots? They was Blade\u2019s little gift to me this mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have suspected his tastes,\u201d she replied, eyeing the rest of him with appreciation. \u201cThe coat too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider meself lucky its only velvet,\u201d Will replied. His eyes were warm with heat and unspoken need.</p><p>Lena leaned toward him, then forced herself to stop. They had to behave impeccably today. No matter how much she wanted to grab his lapels and yank his face down to kiss her.</p><p>Blade guided Honoria up the stairs with a protective hand on the small of her back. Lena eyed the stark leather coat he wore, and the garish red waistcoat. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d It could have been worse.</p><p>Honoria was all charm, greeting the Fenrir and his group with practiced ease. Ignoring their standoffish looks, Blade added his own greetings.</p><p>\u201cThis is your master?\u201d Astrid murmured, eyeing Blade with open hostility.</p><p>Blade snorted. \u201cWhen it suits \u2019im. When it don\u2019t \u2019e just tells me to shove off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Magnus murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re not of the Echelon.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cPasty-faced maggots.\u201d Blade winked at Magnus and scanned the crowd with a slightly predatory air. \u201cWatch \u2019em all coo and scuttle about now, like I was a cat thrown in with \u2019em. Let\u2019s just say, me presence weren\u2019t expected.\u201d</p><p>Will leaned down toward her and whispered in her ear, \u201cWe\u2019ve found the girl as took Charlie\u2019s clockwork soldier and cut off a bit of his hair. It were one of his blood donors. Said as how a fancy lord paid her for it. Never saw his face though.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded through her. \u201cShe\u2019s no threat?\u201d</p><p>His gaze hardened. \u201cNot anymore. Charlie\u2019s drinkin\u2019 his blood cold from now on and I put the fear of God into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter that than dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Taking a deep breath, he turned to the Fenrir. \u201cI\u2019ve an apology to make. I lost me temper the other night. I should never have forced me way into your home or made such demands of you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Magnus stared at him for a long time. \u201cIn my homeland, if one of the Fenris\u00falfr\u2014this verwulfen that you call us\u2014lost control in such a manner, we would cage him and he would be whipped. It is necessary. To learn to control the berserkergang, the fury. The only time we show leniency is during spring rites, when a warrior chooses his mate. Such times are trying. Our instincts overwhelm what we know we must do.\u201d He nodded slowly. \u201cYou have no apology to make. This once, I grant you leniency, for you yourself suffer such spring madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d Eric repeated. \u201cHe means this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw you across the room,\u201d Will said, uneasy with the man\u2019s good nature. In his place, Will would have been at his throat.</p><p>\u201cI should not have reached for your woman.\u201d Eric shrugged. \u201cAll is well. I am not a man to hold a grudge.\u201d Shadows darkened his blue eyes. \u201cAnd I understand how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Horns sounded. Conversation lulled as everyone turned toward the tower entrance, prepared for the signing.</p><p>\u201cTime to watch this foolery,\u201d Magnus growled.</p><p>Astrid caught Lena\u2019s arm. \u201cMight I have a word, Miss Todd? I should like to speak with you and your man.\u201d</p><p>The trio of Norwegians froze.</p><p>\u201cAstrid?\u201d Magnus arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d She waved them toward the door. \u201cI will be only a moment.\u201d</p><p>Circling the colonnade, Astrid stared out over the rail, the wind whipping her blond curls back like a banner. \u201cMy uncle is old,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cA traditionalist. He remembers when we fought the blue bloods and I fear in his heart, he cannot accept this treaty.\u201d</p><p>Will leaned back against the rail, crossing his arms over his chest. His heart was pounding. Lena could hear it over the beat of her own.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you tellin\u2019 us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have a personal stake in this matter,\u201d Astrid replied. \u201cBut I appreciate your honesty. You have never once tried to manipulate us. I trust this. I trust you. And I need honest answers right now.\u201d</p><p>Inside, the majority of the Echelon had gathered in the Grand Hall, prepared to watch the historic episode. The prince consort and queen had not yet arrived, but the Council of Dukes was gathering. Will needed to work fast, but Lena knew his answer before he mouthed it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>He was too loyal, too honest for this work. It was one of the reasons he would not last long in this world alone. And yet she held her breath as Astrid nodded. If he had tried to play them false, would the churlish Norwegians have ever accepted him?</p><p>\u201cCan your prince consort be trusted? Can your Council of Dukes?\u201d Astrid asked.</p><p>For this he looked to Lena. \u201cI don\u2019t trust \u2019em as a whole. But my opinion against \u2019em\u2019s not wholly rational. Lena knows more.\u201d</p><p>Lena considered the question. \u201cThe prince consort... No. No, I don\u2019t think so. As for the Council, they oppose him in some matters, but not all. He has several of them in his pocket, but each of them has their own agenda. There are some few you can trust. Leo is one. The Duke of Goethe. Maybe the Duke of Malloryn. And the Duchess of Casavian\u2019s motives are entirely opaque. I don\u2019t know what game she\u2019s playing, if any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Swedish ambassador intends to accept this treaty. I am trapped in a hard place. If we do not accept, we become caught between two powerful empires. The Swedes have long since wanted to destroy the last of our clans, and with the British on their side, we have no allies. If we do accept, we become the minority in this treaty. To involve us is a gesture, nothing more.\u201d Astrid frowned. \u201cI must find an ally for my people. There are none on the Continent. The Hapsburg Empire leash their verwulfen for their armies, and the French are incited with this newfound Illumination cult. The only place I have to search is here. In London.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And if not with the Echelon, then who? Lena\u2019s breath caught, her mind taking one of those swift leaps it sometimes did. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust them!\u201d she blurted.</p><p>Both Will and Astrid gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cTrust who?\u201d Astrid asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe humanists.\u201d</p><p>Astrid stilled. \u201cSuch talk is treason. Especially when I know whose enemy they truly are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never betray you to the Echelon.\u201d Lena swallowed. \u201cYou can trust me, because I was one of them until very recently. I know they intended to approach your delegations, to make their own deals with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have been approached,\u201d Astrid admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cThey have their own agendas. I was instructed to stop this treaty at all costs. That\u2019s what they truly want. They\u2019re planning a war, Astrid. They have these enormous metal monsters they strap themselves into. Once they have enough of them to threaten even the Echelon, they\u2019ll attack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill they succeed?\u201d Astrid asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Lena replied. \u201cThere are factions within the group. One side wishes to wait, to see what the Echelon will do. The others have tried to start a war already. They\u2019re killing each other from within.\u201d</p><p>Astrid released her breath. \u201cThen they can offer me nothing. I need help now.\u201d Her fist clenched. \u201cI had hoped...\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Inspiration struck again. Suddenly Lena knew exactly what she had to do. They\u2019d been wrong all along. Magnus might be the one in charge of the Norwegian party, but here was where the power lie.</p><p>\u201cYou need someone that you can trust.\u201d Lena smiled brilliantly. \u201cAnd we need you to sign our treaty. What if I could guarantee a way to have your voice heard as equal to the Swedish?\u201d</p><p>Astrid\u2019s eyes narrowed curiously. \u201cAnd how would you perform this miracle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI shall need a little help.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cI hope this works,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d Lena\u2019s smile radiated confidence. \u201cI told you I know this world.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort and his queen swept into the Grand Hall to much fanfare. Towering nearly a foot over Blade and Honoria, Will had a good visual of the room.</p><p>The Council waited silently, along with both parties of the Scandinavians. Leo Barrons rested at ease, barely aware of the plot that would soon sweep him up. Astrid needed someone she could trust and Will knew the perfect man. The only blue blood aside from Blade that he\u2019d let at his back.</p><p>Crossing his arms over his chest, he allowed himself a tight smile. When he\u2019d thrown up Leo\u2019s name as a potential ambassador for the Norwegians to work with, Lena had agreed after a slight hesitation.</p><p>\u201cSomeone like Leo,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cOf course. Someone you can trust. Someone who will hold you in higher regard than the Swedish delegate. Someone even Magnus might accept.\u201d</p> <p>The two women exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cSomeone we can trust,\u201d Astrid repeated, liking the idea.</p><p>The speeches droned on until he swiftly lost interest. He wanted the treaty signed now. Then he could return to Whitechapel, taking Lena along with him.</p><p>\u201cPay attention,\u201d she commanded, quivering with heightened tension. \u201cThey\u2019re about to get to the treaty.\u201d</p><p>The Swedish ambassador stepped forward with a sly smile and said all of the right things. Behind him, Magnus maneuvered into place beside Leo and whispered something in his ear. Not even Will could hear him over the loud ringing of the Swedish count\u2019s voice.</p><p>Leo blinked in consideration. After a moment, he nodded and then crossed to the prince regent\u2019s side to whisper something.</p><p>There was too much to watch. Will applauded as the Swedish count finally finished and the prince regent stepped forward to make his own remarks.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentleman,\u201d he boomed. \u201cAn auspicious day for our two empires. As you all know, we are here to sign a treaty with our friends, the Scandinavians. We hope it shall be a long and fruitful union, and to that end, we have decided to announce the appointment of our new ambassador.\u201d</p><p>Whispers broke out. Several of the dukes exchanged sharp glances. Only Leo seemed at ease, and everyone noticed it. The Duchess of Casavian shot him a narrow-eyed look, then glanced at the prince consort and queen.</p><p>\u201cThis appointment carries great weight and a great deal of responsibility,\u201d the prince consort continued. \u201cWe are pleased to announce Mr. William Carver as our new liaison to the verwulfen alliance.\u201d</p><p>The world dropped out from under him. Heads turned as everyone sought to find him, and the sound of dozens of shocked gasps filled the room.</p><p>Will froze, his hands prepared to clap. \u201cThis weren\u2019t the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, go on!\u201d Lena whispered, a hint of desperate glee in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Will. Leo was a very good suggestion, but there was someone else who was better. You were the only one who couldn\u2019t see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be ambassador,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Around them, the crowd\u2019s clapping started to fade as everyone turned to see what was taking him so long.</p><p>\u201cThen the treaty\u2019s off,\u201d Lena whispered, the smile sliding off her face. \u201cPlease. I know you don\u2019t like the idea. But think of how much power you could have! Enough to make sure your laws are changed. Enough to offer protection to any verwulfen who needed it. And I\u2019ll be there for you. I won\u2019t let you do this alone. I\u2019m so sorry, Will. This was the only way I could think to protect you.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. The room was closing in on him, suddenly far too small. All his life he\u2019d been trapped in the cage, and then in the confines of Whitechapel. It was too much for him.</p><p>A hand slid into his and squeezed it tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d she whispered, with utmost certainty. \u201cHere is your freedom, Will.\u201d</p><p>Her hand became an anchor in a world that was swirling around him, a riot of color. Lena was right. Barrons could do this, but he would never have enough loyalty, enough stake in this to truly care. The verwulfen needed someone who would be on their side. And the prince consort needed someone to placate his eastern allies.</p><p>But he had other responsibilities. Other debts of honor. Blade met his gaze, his green eyes knowing.</p><p>\u201cGo on then,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Blade shook his head. \u201cRip\u2019s muscle enough to do me enforcin\u2019. And this\u2019ll give you power you ain\u2019t \u2019ad before. Use it,\u201d he said ruthlessly. \u201cTimes are changin\u2019. Me, a knight o\u2019 the realm and you as ambassador?\u201d He laughed. \u201cGotta adapt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Will looked down at Lena. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be terribly old-fashioned, however, and insist on marriage. I ain\u2019t doin\u2019 this alone.\u201d</p><p>A warm light infused her eyes, the copper in them glowing. \u201cHow middle-class, Will. Marriage? Truly? Not merely a consort?\u201d With a happy laugh she pushed him toward the center of the crowd. \u201cI accept. Now go.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s heart swelled with pride as she watched him shake the prince consort\u2019s hand and bluntly accept the appointment. The whispers in the hall were overpowering. Colchester looked like he was going to explode with fury, his eyes staring daggers at Will.</p><p>Suddenly he smiled.</p><p>A tremor of premonition edged down her spine. Not Will. He could make any move against her that he wanted. But not Will.</p><p>Edging onto her toes, she realized she was suddenly too far away to help if he did something. Knowing it was irrational\u2014Colchester would never dare, not here\u2014she pushed her way past Blade, using her newfound strength to make spaces in the crowd where there were none.</p><p>Magnus shook Will\u2019s hand with a tight little smile. Allies perhaps, but Magnus would fight for what he thought was best for his people. The Swedish count examined him with a piercing gaze, then took his hand. Will was doing a smashing job despite his unease. He said the right things, even managed a smile.</p><p>The prince consort called for the papers. A pair of liveried servants hurried forward, carrying a small signing table with a gold inkwell. Beaming with satisfaction at seeing all of his plots come to fruition, the prince consort made a small gesture to the side.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, a small token of our gratitude!\u201d he called.</p><p>A pair of young lads sprang forward, clad in black and gold and dragging a heavy platform into view. The figure stood seven feet tall, draped in a pristine white silk sheet. The crowd clapped as the Swedish ambassador accepted the gift with good grace.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d the count asked.</p><p>One of the young men grabbed the edge of the sheet and whipped it away with a flourish. A heavy iron-plated man stood on the rolling platform, his arms and chest chiseled, the rough-hewn plating of his face sharp-edged and raw. She\u2019d not bothered to file the rough edges. It suited him\u2014her heavy clockwork rendition of Will.</p><p>Lena stilled as the crowd erupted into loud clapping. What was it doing here? The last time she\u2019d seen it, she\u2019d given it into Mr. Mandeville\u2019s keeping with a good riddance.</p><p>The young lads backed away and as they did, she caught a glimpse of one of their faces.</p><p>The young boy who\u2019d helped Mendici kidnap her.</p><p>The humanists.</p><p>Her world slowed, sound draining off at the edges. The Swedish count gestured to Lady Astrid, who stepped forward with a light smile to wind it.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d she said, and Lena heard the words as clear as a bell.</p><p>Something was wrong. Lena stared at it frantically, recognizing her own artistry. And recognizing, too, the faulty join along the side. Where it had been tampered with.</p><p>Astrid turned the handle once. Twice. It strained against her as it never should have. Something was caught near the mainspring or one of the cams. As Astrid released it, the iron man began to quiver, his clockwork cogs sounding like the tick of a clock.</p><p>Tick.</p><p>Tick.</p><p>Tick.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d she screamed, her voice cutting through the din. Through the haze of her panic, she saw his amber eyes shoot to hers. Pointing at Astrid, she barely started to speak before he took off.</p><p>Launching himself across the room, he shoved Astrid to the ground, covering her with his heavy body. People scattered out of the way, confused by his actions, yet recognizing something in his expression that incited fear.</p><p>Too many people. Crushed together. Most of the Echelon, including the whole Council and the prince consort. The perfect place to destroy the blue bloods.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to explode!\u201d</p><p>Her cry was taken up, echoed around the chamber. Screams rang out and she found herself shoved aside. The clockwork automaton trembled violently, unable to complete its transformation. Steam hissed out through its vibrating plates.</p><p>Catching a glimpse of Will, she saw him shove Astrid into Eric\u2019s arms, then turn to look for her. Lena staggered as someone smashed into her, catching his gaze. She shook her head desperately. They were at opposite ends of the room. Safer to go through the opposing doors.</p><p>She pointed, then tried frantically to gesture. \u201cGo back!\u201d</p><p>A body smashed into her. She was thrown off balance, caught in the whirlpool of pushing and shoving people. The last thing she saw was Will, his face set in a mask of grim determination as he shoved his way toward her through the crowd.</p><p>Why was he not going back?</p><p>She staggered through the door, swept out of the raging current like a piece of flotsam. Strong arms caught her, wrapping around her body like steel.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she gasped, straining to see Will through the door.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said a familiar, silky voice. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be thanking me at all, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Lena\u2019s blood ran cold as something sharp dug into her spine. \u201cColchester,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>Will shoved open the second iron-bound door frantically, the swell of people suddenly surging through. Behind him, the slow, steady tick of the transformational threatened death, steam hissing from it now with teakettle consistency.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>He shoved a man out of his way and fought free of the crowd. Lena had been right here, with Colchester\u2019s arm around her waist. The look in her eyes as she realized who was standing behind her would fuel his nightmares for months.</p><p>Red haze threatened to overwhelm him. He hunted the hallway, but there was no sign of her. Colchester had chosen his moment perfectly. The crowds muddied her scent trail and the bastard could use them to hide.</p><p>He had to be somewhere close. Somewhere nearby.</p><p>But where?</p><p>Suddenly the world went white-hot, flinging him off his feet. He hit the wall and fell hard, pain slashing through his side. Screams filled the air, the sound of cracking plaster tearing through the hall. Inside the Great Hall, flames licked at the furnishings and smoke billowed through the open doors, turning the hallway into a congested nightmare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t see. Couldn\u2019t smell anything but smoke.</p><p>\u201cLena,\u201d he whispered, shoving desperately to his feet. She had to be here somewhere.</p><p>And that was when he heard it.</p> <p>Faint sounds of the woman he loved, screaming.</p><p>Colchester shoved her into an antechamber, his sharp bloodletting knife in his fist. Lena stumbled over a chair, tripping on her damned skirts. He\u2019d cut her, the blade slicing through her cheek and flinging fat droplets of blood onto the pale carpets.</p><p>The chair splintered beneath her as she fell. Lena pushed herself to her hands and knees and saw the heavy antique leg of the chair beside her. Snatching it up, she scrambled to her feet and turned to face him, brandishing it like a club.</p><p>Colchester locked the double doors with a threatening click. Leaning against them, he smiled lazily. \u201cAnd now, I finally have you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWill won\u2019t be far behind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d He looked up, toward the floor above them. \u201cThat explosion should have ripped most of the Great Hall and the hallway apart. \u2018Neither fire nor iron told against them,\u2019\u201d he said, repeating the famous quote about verwulfen, \u201cbut not even he could survive such a thing. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>On her own. A tremble started, deep within her body. \u201cYou knew,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew it was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Colchester\u2019s gaze slid toward her. \u201cYou will never prove such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smiled. Right before Astrid started winding the transformational. And you very strategically placed yourself nearest the door.\u201d</p><p>She sidestepped around a small writing table as he stepped toward her. The horror of it shocked her. She\u2019d known that the letters she carried between the Ivory Tower and Mandeville came from someone high within the Echelon, but she had never expected it to be him.</p><p>\u201cA happy coincidence.\u201d Colchester picked up the edge of the table and flipped it aside. \u201cNowhere to hide, my dear.\u201d The small bloodletting blade sliced the air threateningly. Back and forth.</p> <p>Lena licked dry lips. Where had her courage gone? Her confidence? Where was the surge of invincibility that she\u2019d felt in the yard? She darted behind the sofa into a shaft of sunlight.</p><p>Colchester prowled forward, a hunter completely at ease. If she let him, he would kill her, right here, and nobody would ever know who\u2019d done it.</p><p>Colchester leaped onto the sofa and over it, his coat flaring around him as he came through the beam of sunlight. She barely had time to think before she swung the chair leg up and smashed him across the face with it.</p><p>Dark blood flew, spattering the cream walls. Lena scrambled over the sofa, a surge of excitement running through her veins. Colchester\u2019s screams chased her, and he came to his feet, clutching his ruined face. His entire cheekbone caved in, bone gleaming through the torn flesh.</p><p>The sight of it excited her in a way it shouldn\u2019t have. She felt herself trembling, a sweep of severe cold rushing through her veins. \u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you anymore.\u201d</p><p>As she tilted her face up, he suddenly froze.</p><p>\u201cYou little whore,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou filthy beast. You let him infect you?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen her eyes \u2019til now. Lena hefted the chair leg. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest gift any man\u2019s ever given me.\u201d</p> <p>The words incited him to a rage she\u2019d never seen before. Ignoring his ruined face, he flipped the sofa up and over, then smashed aside the small reading table. Debris sprayed everywhere as he tore down a bookcase.</p><p>Turning on her with a snarl, he held his blade with deadly intent. \u201cI could have given you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threatened to take everything I had away. I hated you. I feared you. I don\u2019t anymore.\u201d Blood was burning in her veins, ice cold. Her heart pounded as she took a step toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re the monster, Colchester. Will is a greater man than you could ever hope to be. You\u2019re nothing beside him. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>He screamed in rage and launched himself at her. Before, the movement would have been too fast for her to follow, but some part of her had recognized the shifting of his body weight, a precursor to movement. As he leaped, she swung the chair leg, driving it up into his ribs.</p><p>The knife scored across her shoulder. It felt like ice, sizzling once, the pain swiftly fading. Colchester curled over the club she wielded, then drove forward, smashing into her body.</p><p>Lena hit the floor hard. The breath smashed from her lungs, his body riding hers to the floor in a tangle of skirts. She could feel his cold breath on her face, his hands tightening around her throat. Maddened eyes glared down at her.</p><p>No fear. There was no fear in her, even as her vision narrowed, darkness threatening to loom. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw his knife, discarded on the rug. Groping for it, she caught the handle in her fingertips as Colchester put all his pressure on her throat.</p><p>The room darkened. Numbness spread through her until all she could feel was the knife handle. Clenching her fingers around it, she drove it up, straight into his chest.</p><p>He screamed, his hands springing from her throat, the short handle of the blade sticking from his chest. Rearing over her, coughing bluish blood, he met her gaze. \u201cTake you...with me.\u201d His fingers closed over the knife and he wrenched it from his chest in a surge of fresh blood.</p><p>Lena screamed as the blade rose.</p><p>The knife never fell. Instead, an explosive sound ripped through the room, fresh blood spattering her.</p><p>Colchester roared in pain, his left arm missing from the elbow down. Black flooded into his eyes, a sign that the demon in him had taken control. He\u2019d feel no pain now, barely even notice the blood that poured from the stump of his ruined arm. She must not have hit his heart.</p><p>Looking past him, Lena stared at her rescuer in shock.</p><p>Smoke curled from the muzzle of a pistol and Rosalind stared at her grimly. She wore black leather from head to toe, men\u2019s clothes that somehow suited her, covered over with a long black coat that flared at her hips. A neat little cap covered her distinctive hair and a mask hid the lower half of her face.</p><p>Turning, Colchester grabbed the knife from the floor\u2014from the ruined fingers that lay on the carpet\u2014and flung it.</p><p>\u201cLook out!\u201d Lena screamed.</p><p>Rosalind staggered backward, clutching at the blade in her side. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u201d she whispered, the pistol dropping from nerveless fingers. \u201cWe found out, only this morning, what they\u2019d planned. The transformational was gone and so was...so was my younger brother, Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>Colchester staggered toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re a humanist,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Lena rolled to her feet as Rosalind\u2019s knees gave out. \u201cNo!\u201d She darted forward, driving her body against Colchester. They both went down.</p><p>Colchester grabbed her hair with his remaining hand and yanked her head back. Lena clawed at his face, catching a glimpse of the black soulless misery of his eyes and his shining white teeth as he went for her throat.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>The bellow shook the air. Blunt teeth sank into her throat, biting hard enough to tear the flesh. Lena screamed.</p><p>Then suddenly rough hands tore Colchester away from her. Will towered over him in all his fury then turned and flung the duke into the wall.</p><p>Colchester dropped to his feet. He met Will halfway, staggering from blood loss but no less dangerous. Lena saw a flash of silver as he tugged a knife from his boot with his remaining hand.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d she screamed. \u201cHe\u2019s got a knife!\u201d</p><p>Will blocked the swing, his fist straining as he forced the duke\u2019s arm back. Slamming him into the wall, he drove the blade toward Colchester\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how you like the taste of the blade,\u201d he snarled and drove it into the duke\u2019s throat.</p><p>Lena turned away as Colchester made a gurgling groan. The bright scent of hot, fresh blood filled the air and the rasp of the blade as it cut through his windpipe.</p><p>The body hit the ground with a meaty thud, the head almost decapitated. Lena looked around, her chest rising with her harsh breath. Will\u2019s fist was bloody, the knife clenched in his fingers. A dark, violent expression rode his face and he turned slowly to look at Rosalind\u2019s slumped form.</p><p>Lena darted between them, holding her hands out. \u201cWill. No.\u201d</p><p>Bright copper burned in his eyes. He stared at her, lip curled.</p><p>\u201cShe saved my life,\u201d Lena told him. \u201cShe shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the person behind the bomb.\u201d He took a menacing step forward.</p><p>\u201cI came to stop it,\u201d Rosalind corrected. With a deep breath, she yanked the blade out of her side and winced. Blood bubbled against her waistcoat. \u201cI was too late. We never wanted this. After the smoke clears, the Echelon will comb the city hunting for whoever did this. We can\u2019t afford the scrutiny. Not yet. We\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find your brother?\u201d Lena asked, helping her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of his body upstairs. He must have escaped.\u201d Rosalind\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cI knew he was fond of Mendici. I allowed it. I should have realized the mechs had poisoned his mind, filled him full of glorious stories. They sent him to deliver the transformational. The bastards sent him to die.\u201d</p><p>The world was beginning to intrude. Shouting and screams. Footsteps pounding through the corridor outside.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get going,\u201d Lena said, taking Rosalind by the sleeve and looking up at him. \u201cIf they find us here over the body, they\u2019ll kill us. He\u2019s a duke. Nobody can know what happened here.\u201d</p><p>A violent quiver went through Will\u2019s body. His eyelids lowered, a lazy, dangerous look at Rosalind that sent Lena\u2019s heart into a paroxysm. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, he couldn\u2019t a grabbed her.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind bent low, snatching something off the ground. Grabbing Lena around the waist, she hauled her back into her body, shoving the pistol under her chin. The muzzle bit into her soft skin and Lena froze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Lena warned him. \u201cShe\u2019s got the same bullets you were making for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirebolts. Take off an arm or worse,\u201d Rosalind snapped.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have him tear my head off?\u201d Rosalind snarled. \u201cNot bloody likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Lena said, catching and holding his gaze. \u201cI give you my word that he won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her to you,\u201d Rosalind said. \u201cBut if you make one move toward me, I\u2019ll shoot her first. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Lena staggered into his arms as Rosalind shoved her in the small of her back. She barely had time to think before Will pushed her behind him, using his own body to protect hers.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d She snatched at his coat, wrapping her arms around his waist. \u201cI promised her you wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is twice you\u2019ve threatened her life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved it once,\u201d Rosalind replied, pointing the pistol straight at his chest. She licked her lips. \u201cThat counts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. You wanted to kill Colchester more than you wanted to save Lena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a practical woman. Two boons for the price of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever come near her again and I swear I\u2019ll rip your head off.\u201d</p><p>The pistol lowered a fraction. Rosalind clapped a hand over the wound in her side, bending over a little. \u201cI promise. She\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d A faint grimace. \u201cI have certain things to put in order, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to get out of here?\u201d Lena asked. \u201cWithout the guards seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame way I came in.\u201d Rosalind crossed to the bookshelf Colchester had half torn from the wall. She swung it open, revealing a hidden staircase. \u201cThe whole place is riddled with tunnels. We stole the schematics months ago. Come.\u201d She gave Will a wary nod. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out without anyone seeing. We can part ways at the bottom. That makes me even, no?\u201d</p><p>Lena rubbed the small of his back, coming out from behind him. \u201cWill?\u201d They had to get out of here without anyone seeing them.</p><p>He nodded to Rosalind. \u201cYou go first. Where I can see you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>Opening the door to Leo\u2019s steam carriage, Will helped Lena into it. Violent shivers shook her body and her eyes were distant. When he\u2019d asked her what was wrong, she\u2019d tried to summon a smile and a shrug. Before he could chase her thoughts down, Blade and Honoria appeared.</p><p>Blade and Leo had gotten Honoria out, then Leo had gone back in to help. Smoke poured from the building and the tower guards were frantically trying to assert control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Time to get out of here. Before people started pointing fingers.</p><p>Blade helped Honoria into their own carriage. There was barely room for two more and Will wanted to be alone with Lena for a moment. He hadn\u2019t had a single chance since the explosion, and the urge to drag her into his arms, to make sure she was all right, was driving him out of his mind.</p><p>Giving swift instructions to the driver, he eased into the carriage and shut the door. It lurched into motion, cutting out of the queue and into the streets. Will jerked the blind closed.</p> <p>Lena blinked, finally coming out of her reverie. \u201cYou do realize this is Leo\u2019s carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe walk\u2019ll do him good,\u201d he replied, pushing aside her skirts and easing onto the seat beside her. \u201cLena.\u201d A hesitation. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but he caught her hand. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that smile. I know you\u2019re upset.\u201d Stroking her dirty gloves, he reminded her, \u201cI can smell it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped, her shoulders slumping. \u201cHe\u2019s finally gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColchester.\u201d Bright tears shone in her eyes. \u201cI feel so overwrought, Will. I\u2019ve been watching over my shoulder for months, knowing that he\u2019d be there, knowing that even if I was in company I was never safe. When he looked at you and smiled today, it frightened me so much. I thought he was going to do something to you. But it was the explosion. He knew about it. I don\u2019t know how. At first I thought he was my contact in the tower, but now I don\u2019t think so. He was disgusted when he realized Rosalind was a humanist.\u201d She tugged one of her hands from his and wiped her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cBut I can\u2019t stop shaking. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re both safe. That you\u2019re safe.\u201d Her fist tangled in his shirt. \u201cI nearly lost you...\u201d</p><p>Dragging her into his lap, he buried her face against his shoulder. He hated seeing her cry. \u201cHe can\u2019t ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. Her hands slid over his shoulders, frantic with need. \u201cTouch me, Will. Remind me that you\u2019re here. That you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, mo cridhe,\u201d he whispered, finding her mouth in the shadows.</p><p>Lena kissed him as if she\u2019d never let him go, her mouth hungry and her hands insatiable. Will gathered bunches of her skirts and dragged them out of the way, settling her on his lap. His cock raged behind the flap of his breeches and he ground her against him, tongue clashing with hers. This was heady. This was life. Every hot, sweaty, gasping moment of it.</p><p>He bit her throat, tugging on the drawstrings of her drawers. Lena gasped, rocking against his fingers, urging him on.</p> <p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He dragged them down, but she was straddling him and the material bunched around her thighs. Snarling in frustration, he tore them in two, sinking his fingers into the fleshy curve of her arse.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned. \u201cHave to...taste you.\u201d</p><p>Tumbling her back onto the seat, he knelt between her thighs. Thick dark hair tumbled over her shoulders and she gasped as he dragged her hips to the edge of the seat, tossing her legs over each of his shoulders. Shoving her skirts up, he cupped her arse and plunged his tongue deep into her quim.</p><p>Lena\u2019s cry was music to his ears. He wanted to drive away her tears, to claim her as his woman once again. Tasting her, sucking and nibbling at her, he listened to the breathy sounds of her gasps and felt the tension tightening in her body. He wanted to learn every inch of her, to teach himself how to please her best.</p><p>Nails raked his shoulders. \u201cStop!\u201d she gasped. \u201cI want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tongued her deep, suckling the wet pearl of her clitoris between his teeth. \u201cWant to what?\u201d</p><p>Lena shuddered, her knees clamping around his head. Panting with need, she dragged her gaze to his. \u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cInside me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>It was the determination in her voice that undid him. He tugged his breeches open and freed his cock, palming it in his hand. Shoving up, he filled her with a single thrust, dragging her closer to the edge of the seat.</p><p>So tight. So wet. So hot.</p><p>Lena cried out, her thighs clamping around his hips. Clinging to his neck, she dragged his face to hers for a devouring, hungry kiss, no doubt tasting the muskiness of her own body. Will\u2019s hips moved of their own accord, plunging into her, his entire body shaking with need. God, she felt so sweet. He wanted to fuck her hard, to drive her down onto the cushions of the carriage and fill her with his cock.</p><p>Little urgent gasps broke between them. Lena\u2019s body undulated against his, driving him wild with need. He held her against him, grinding the base of his shaft against her. Shudders racked her body, and her inner muscles tightened around him. She liked that, liked what he was doing to her. He could feel the edge of something building within her, feel it in the sudden gasping inattention she gave their kiss. See it in her widening eyes as she cried out silently, her body jerking around his.</p><p>A little fist tightened in his chest. His woman. His. Nobody could take her away from him now and he couldn\u2019t hurt her. She could be his forever. Hope swelled in his chest as he ground his teeth together and shuddered. So close. He rode her through the storm, giving himself up to the sensation that streaked through him.</p><p>Lena wilted backward, dragging him with her. Will kissed her lips, earning a halfhearted response as his body slid from hers. She made a wordless protest, but he tucked his cock back in his breeches and dragged her into his lap.</p><p>His breathing slowed, his heart thundering through his chest. Will buried his face in the warm mahogany lengths of her hair and breathed in the scent of her.</p><p>Lena tucked her face against his throat, curling up in his lap. She stroked his chest, splaying her hand over his heart then held it still, as if listening to the beat of it. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>A slight hesitation. \u201cWith the treaty?\u201d</p><p>He could barely think, his eyelids threatening to shut. But she hadn\u2019t been paying attention to anything that had happened since they scrambled out of the cellar. \u201cBlade said they\u2019re gonna reschedule it. If the explosion hadn\u2019t torn apart half of the blue bloods too, it mighta been a different story. The verwulfen might\u2019ve blamed the Echelon and likewise. Barrons wants to get to the bottom of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll like that,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHe likes puzzles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you goin\u2019 to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Rosalind?\u201d</p><p>Lena thought about it. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe her nothin\u2019,\u201d he growled. \u201cThey\u2019ll cause trouble, you mark me words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand how she feels,\u201d she replied. \u201cHelpless. Fighting for a lost cause. I won\u2019t betray her, Will. Not unless she makes a move against anyone I love.\u201d</p><p>He stroked a hand over the silk corseted boning covering her back. Her innate sense of loyalty was one of the things he liked most about her. \u201cShe makes one wrong move and I\u2019m straight to Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lena\u2019s finger tangled in his shirt collar. She lifted her tearstained face, bright eyes burning with unsaid emotion. \u201cWill...are you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the trick Astrid and I played? About demanding you as ambassador in exchange for the Norwegians\u2019 allegiance.\u201d</p><p>He thought about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not somethin\u2019 I would have wanted for meself.\u201d Sensing the tension in her small frame, he hurried on. \u201cBut I\u2019m the only one as can. The thought of change scares me, Lena. I hate the Echelon, hate dealin\u2019 with \u2019em. I were happy bein\u2019 Blade\u2019s second-in-command, because it meant I never had to leave me safe, little world.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cYou were right. About lettin\u2019 \u2019em make me what I were. Whitechapel were just another little cage that I were allowin\u2019 meself to be put into. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m thrilled \u2019bout it, but maybe I need this.\u201d He squeezed her tight. \u201cI know I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d She traced her fingers over his lips.</p><p>Will shook his head. \u201cLife were gonna change anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t expect you to live with me in that little hovel.\u201d</p><p>A shy smile touched her lips. \u201cStaying there with you were some of the happiest moments of my life.\u201d</p><p>The fist in his chest grew tighter. \u201cMe too,\u201d he admitted gruffly. Capturing her face, he dragged it to his, forehead to forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re everythin\u2019 to me.\u201d</p><p>Playing with his collar, she gave him a saucy little smile. \u201cAre you trying to tell me something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much you adore me?\u201d</p><p>Will kissed her cheek. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cHow much...you care for me.\u201d Another slightly flirtatious look at him. Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she stroked the rough stubble of his jaw. Then they sobered. She opened her mouth, but he sealed it with a kiss. A way to tell her the answers to the questions she was asking without saying them.</p><p>She was breathless by the time he drew back. But not silenced. \u201cHow much you love me?\u201d The whisper was a challenge.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why she needed to hear the words, when he\u2019d been damned certain he\u2019d shown her exactly how he felt. This was some unknown neediness he hadn\u2019t expected to find in her, she with her confident ways.</p><p>Will kissed her lips lightly, chasing away the questioning tone. \u201cYou know I love you,\u201d he said. Her body quivered against his, but he pressed a finger to her lips, stalling her. \u201cI would die for you,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019d kill for you. I faced down mechanical squid, rampagin\u2019 humanists, and lessons in etiquette for you. I danced at a ball for you.\u201d</p><p>The smile on her face warmed his heart. Radiance shone from the center of her being. He didn\u2019t care what he had to say to keep that look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her sternly. \u201cI always will. You\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve ever seen. The only woman I ever wanted. I know I ain\u2019t much of a catch\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time it was her turn to put her finger to his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Heat flared in her beautiful amber-ringed eyes. \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest woman in London. In the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, mebbe.\u201d He slid his arms around her waist. \u201cAre you tryin\u2019 to tell me somewhat?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLook at you, fishing for compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot compliments,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Lena kissed him, cupping his face in her hands. \u201cI love you too,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cOh, Will. I think I\u2019ve been half in love with you for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just took me a while to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you not? I gave up the Echelon for you. I faced randy dukes, clockwork bombs, and verwulfen clans. I ruined three sets of gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll have to replace \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will,\u201d she warned. \u201cI won\u2019t be showing off my wrists in public ever again.\u201d</p><p>Possession curled through him. His arms tightened. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t be. Only I get to see your wrists. Among other things.\u201d</p><p>Drawing back, Lena toyed with the ribbons of her bodice. \u201cSpeaking of... We don\u2019t appear to be moving very far with this traffic. I don\u2019t suppose that you\u2019ll be willing to entertain me...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntertain?\u201d he drawled, heat sliding through his groin. \u201cIs that what they\u2019re callin\u2019 it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d She tugged the ribbons open. \u201cI believe there are some areas of my education that are lacking. I\u2019ll teach you how to belong in this world as long as you teach me something else...how to please you.\u201d</p><p>The faint swell of her breasts curved over the top of her corset. Will\u2019s mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, luv,\u201d he said, sitting up to help her undress. \u201cYou know how to please me.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>The prince consort strode in through the double doors. Cold fury tightened his features and a handful of Coldrush Guards swarmed through the room, ensuring it was safe for him and destroying half of Sir Jasper Lynch\u2019s evidence.</p><p>Lynch exchanged a telling glance with Barrons. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he warned one of the guards. The man froze and Lynch pointed to the bloody footprint he\u2019d been about to step in. \u201cRuin that and I can\u2019t track the owner.\u201d He straightened, meeting the prince consort\u2019s hard gaze. \u201cYour Grace. It appears the Duke of Lannister has been murdered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The prince consort peered at the body. Then spun on his heel and broke into a string of invective. \u201cBloody bombs! The Scandinavians howling for answers and now this! How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade to the chest, shot that took off half his arm and near-decapitation. I believe it was the decapitation that killed him, though the shot bothers me,\u201d Lynch recited. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those firebolt rounds we\u2019ve discovered on certain members of the population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumanists,\u201d the prince consort spat.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Lynch replied. He never made a judgment until all of the evidence was in. And there\u2019d been more than one person in this room. He\u2019d managed to track the signs; the strands of hair, splatters of blood, even the scent trails. Four people and a fight, if he wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>And he was fairly certain he knew who had struck the killing blow. How the others couldn\u2019t smell the heavy musk of a verwulfen man\u2014a man Lynch knew well\u2014he\u2019d never know. Perhaps it was all the cologne they wore? Or perhaps, he thought, looking at Barrons\u2019s cool gaze, some of them knew precisely who had been here.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re uncertain whether the murder was connected to the bombing, or simply an opportunity that someone took advantage of,\u201d Barrons said. He paused for a telling moment. \u201cYour Grace, Lynch informs me that one of his humanist informants passed along information about a potential bombing last week. As Colchester was in charge of finding the humanists, Lynch reported the finding directly to him.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort turned, fury whitening his face. \u201cAre you telling me that Colchester knew about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Barrons said softly. \u201cAs much as Lynch himself knew.\u201d</p> <p>Waiting for the explosion, Lynch held himself stiffly. \u201cIf I\u2019d believed he wouldn\u2019t pass it along, I\u2019d have sought an audience with the Council. It was my oversight, Your Grace. And the information spoke only of a possible assassination attempt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he keep this information to himself?\u201d the prince consort asked softly. The tone set Lynch\u2019s nerves on edge. This was when the consort was at his most dangerous.</p><p>Barrons hesitated. \u201cHe made no secret of his feelings about this treaty and the Scandinavians. And if you look at the people closest to the bomb\u2014the Council, yourself, even the queen\u2014there was a chance that he might be the most powerful man remaining in the Empire.\u201d</p><p>Stillness. The prince consort\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cI will see the House of Lannister destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch an act would leave the Council unbalanced,\u201d Barrons protested.</p><p>Casting a harsh look around the room, the prince consort ignored him. \u201cWho was the girl? The one who screamed the warning? I want her found\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s my ward,\u201d Barrons said swiftly. \u201cMiss Lena Todd. She creates clockwork toys and jewelry and sells them to a clockmaker in Clerkenwell. She recognized that the automaton had been tampered with and cried the warning.\u201d</p><p>Lynch said nothing as the young lord settled into silence, but he could read the undercurrents in the room. Barrons was protecting someone. The obvious answer would be his ward, but Lynch often found that taking the obvious path blinded one to the truth.</p><p>A scrap of material caught his eye. Black. And stained with blood. It was caught on a stud from the upholstery of a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d The prince consort stabbed a finger toward Barrons. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of discovering who tried to assassinate half of my court. And how they got into the heart of the bloody tower itself. And you...\u201d</p><p>Lynch straightened.</p><p>\u201cFind the humanists.\u201d The prince consort spun on his heel, toward the door. \u201cAnd bring me their heads.\u201d</p><p>Barrons let out a deep breath as the doors slammed shut behind the prince consort and his men. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cThat went well, I thought. He wasn\u2019t too concerned about who murdered Colchester.\u201d</p><p>Lynch knelt down. Touched the piece of fabric. Blood stained his finger and heat swam behind his eyes at the sight of it. \u201cThey probably saved him the hassle.\u201d</p> <p>He licked his finger. Taste exploded over his tongue, the ecstasy of a thirst long denied. His mouth went dry and he had to force his body to calm. From the faint scent on the fabric, it had once adorned a woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d</p><p>Lynch rubbed the smear of blood between his fingertips. The lingering residue of gunpowder caught his nose. \u201cA mystery.\u201d He looked up. \u201cThere were four people in this room. Colchester, two verwulfen, and this one. A human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the mystery of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one...this one was the humanist,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one who fired the gun.\u201d</p><p>And he would find her. </p> </body></html>"]
