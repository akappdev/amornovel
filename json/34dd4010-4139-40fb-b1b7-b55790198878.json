Shea</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we cut it at your shoulders...two silver marks.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella winced. It wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cWhat if you take it all?\u201d</p><p>The barber jerked his eyes from Cinderella\u2019s brilliant hair and gaped at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much will you give me if you take all my hair?\u201d Cinderella asked, pushing an elbow-length lock of hair over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle, you couldn\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>The wigmaker studied her hair again. \u201cThe extra length will mean a finer style for the wig. Five silver marks.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella bit her lip. He was overpaying her. Her scarlet-red hair was unusual, and her hair was thick and luxurious, but even with those qualities, the best she could hope for was four silver marks and a handful of copper coins. But the chateau roof needed patching, and Cinderella could not afford to turn down such generosity. \u201cDone,\u201d she said.</p><p>The wigmaker wiped his scissors on a clean cloth. \u201cYou have fine hair, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella gripped the arms of the wooden chair until they creaked when the man sheered the first lock from her head. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella left several minutes later, her pockets heavier and her head lighter. Folk gave her odd looks as they darted past her on the street, staring at her shamefully short hair.</p> <p>Her magnificent strawberry-colored mane was sheered in a pixie cut. She still had a red fringe of bangs that flopped into her eyes, but the rest of her hair was almost peasant-boy-short.</p><p>The hairstyle would bring looks of disapproval until it grew out, but Cinderella didn\u2019t care. She needed the money. Aveyron needed the money.</p><p>Cinderella squared her shoulders and glanced at the sky. The sun was a thin disk, almost entirely blocked by the capital\u2019s walls. \u201cHome it is then,\u201d Cinderella said, turning her feet towards her lands.</p><p>At the dolphin plaza, she ran into a squadron of Erlauf soldiers in their gray and burgundy uniforms. Their armor reminded Cinderella of dragon scales the way it overlapped and hinged together.</p><p>The lieutenant leading the squadron watched Cinderella as she walked past them, but he watched just about every Trieux city resident.</p><p>Three years ago, Erlauf invaded Trieux\u2014Cinderella\u2019s country\u2014in a brutally short war and claimed it as Erlauf territory. Erlauf had taken Trieux with little pain, but dislike still brewed between citizens. There hadn\u2019t been any violence since the takeover, but there was plenty of hate to go around.</p><p>With Trieux\u2019s soldiers mostly killed or imported deep into the heart of Erlauf, the citizens of Trieux had no way to resist. The sheer number of soldiers present in the city was outrageously large considering the lack of rebellion.</p><p>But Erlauf was ruled by the cautious Queen Freja and her equally cautious consort, and both of them intended to keep Trieux in their clutches.</p> <p>Cinderella left the capital\u2014the Erlauf monarchs had renamed it Werra, obliterating its original Trieux name, Arroux\u2014and followed a dirt road through the rolling farmland.</p><p>The sky was a canvas of colors when Cinderella reached her home, Aveyron Chateau. She slapped dust from her cloak and ventured into the boundaries of her buildings. She waved to one of the stable boys bringing a pair of draft horses into the stable for the night and paused to count the chickens before entering the chateau.</p><p>Gilbert, the land steward, and his daughter Jeanne, the housekeeper, were talking in the kitchen. When Cinderella entered the warm room, they fell silent. This was not unusual. In spite of her ventures, the father and daughter remained stubbornly formal with her, but the gaping looks of horror they gave her were unusual. They hadn\u2019t been this appalled since Cinderella donned servant clothes as her everyday dress months ago.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>Jeanne covered her mouth to stifle her gasp.</p><p>\u201cYour, your hair\u2014b-but\u2014why?\u201d Gilbert said, laying a hand on a table to balance himself.</p><p>Cinderella jingled her pocket, making the coins in it bounce. \u201cSend for a carpenter tomorrow, please. We can afford to see that hole in the south wing ceiling patched,\u201d Cinderella said, removing her cloak and hanging it near the fire.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said in a pained voice.</p><p>\u201cIt needed to be done, Gilbert,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave my step-mother and step-sisters already had dinner?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>\u201cPheasant in a cream sauce, baked potatoes, and apple sauce,\u201d Jeanne said, finding her voice.</p><p>\u201cAny complaints?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>Jeanne shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Cinderella said, taking a cooled baked potato and biting into it like an apple. The potato crumbled in Cinderella\u2019s mouth and tasted creamy. \u201cI like this potato. What kind is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinter Red, mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of our winter crops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe they were harvested two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinter Red...I will make note of that for the next winter. Any new activity I should be made aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the men took inventory of the beehives today. Most of the bees survived the winter,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cOne of the horses lost a shoe today when cultivating. The blacksmith already gave him a new one.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella nodded. \u201cHow much did it cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe account is waiting for you on your dressing table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said, folding at the waist in a bow.</p><p>\u201cA buyer has approached us. He is interested in a specific painting,\u201d Jeanne said.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the ones I have listed for sale?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>Jeanne hesitated. \u201cNo, Mademoiselle\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you will excuse me, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said, bowing again before he took his leave from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Gilbert,\u201d Cinderella called after him before turning back to his daughter. \u201cWhich painting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it pleases you, I will show you, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p> <p>Jeanne led Cinderella through the dark Chateau, navigating by the thin slices of sunlight shed by the setting sun. Light meant candles and firewood, both of which were costly or labor intensive. To save funds, Cinderella and the servants resisted using either whenever possible.</p><p>Jeanne led the way to Cinderella\u2019s private quarters. She dropped a curtsey before entering the room, which was a shadow of luxury and beauty. Once upon a time, Cinderella\u2019s room was crowded with paintings, bottles of costly perfumes and oils, gold jewelry boxes, the finest crafted furniture, and sculptures.</p><p>The few reminders of those lavish times were the beautiful murals painted on the walls, and a single, ornately framed painting.</p><p>The painting was a portrait of Cinderella, finished before the war. Before Erlauf. It showed Cinderella in a beautiful, elaborate\u2014and uncomfortable, as Cinderella remembered\u2014ivory dress that complimented her fair skin and made the dusting of freckles on her nose and cheeks look charming rather than untidy. Her hair was piled elaborately on the top of her head, and pearls and rubies hung from her neck, wrists, and ears. She was surrounded by pink flowers, which made her gray eyes stark in the light-hued image. Cinderella smiled in the portrait. She remembered her father had asked her to be solemn for the occasion, but Cinderella couldn\u2019t help it, so the painter had given her a wide smile.</p><p>It was a personal painting, not one meant for wide-spread admiration.</p><p>\u201cThe buyer requested the portrait of your likeness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis? They want this?\u201d Cinderella said, thrusting a finger at the painting.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne said.</p> <p>Cinderella blinked. \u201cWhy?\u201d she said.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered listing the painting for sale because she very much doubted anyone would actually want it.</p><p>\u201cI am not certain, but the buyer requested it,\u201d Jeanne said. \u201cThe offer is a tidy sum.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella would have sold it if someone would take a few copper coins for it. \u201cDoes the buyer know the frame cannot be salvaged? I tried having the portrait removed to sell the frame alone, but the art dealer said the frame would have to be broken irreparably to get the painting out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are aware,\u201d Jeanne said.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cI do not know the buyer\u2019s name. He or she is making the inquiry through an Erlauf broker\u2014the one that has bought a number of chateau belongings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVon Beiler? Hm,\u201d Cinderella said, studying the portrait. She reached out to caress the corner of the frame.</p><p>It was the last reminder she had of the lady she used to be, and of the opulence she once lived in. \u201cBut keeping everyone fed and employed is more important than a vain reminder,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Try to drive the price up, if you can, but take whatever they are willing to give you for it,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?</p><p>Cinderella looked once more at the girl in the portrait. Back then she was nothing but a silly girl who trusted her father to look out for her in all things. She couldn\u2019t go back to that life, not with her father dead.</p><p>\u201cI am positive. Thank you, Jeanne,\u201d Cinderella said, leaving her room and heading back to the kitchen. She didn\u2019t want to see the young housekeeper remove the portrait from her room.</p><p>Cinderella watched another Erlauf patrol squad pass through the market. \u201cIt seems to me they are patrolling more frequently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps they are, Mademoiselle,\u201d Vitore, an Aveyron lady\u2019s maid who had voluntarily become the market-stall-minder, said.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Cinderella said as the soldiers disappear deeper into the market. \u201cVitore?\u201d Cinderella said when the maid did not respond. Most of Cinderella\u2019s servants would not speak familiarly with Cinderella. However, Vitore, a renowned gossip, tended to be less tight-lipped than the rest of the staff.</p><p>Vitore made a show of looking around the produce stall, but she and Cinderella were the only representatives from Aveyron in the market. \u201cThere are rumors someone broke into the Royal Trieux Library,\u201d Vitore whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s nothing new. Those incidents started well over a year ago,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I heard they\u2019re close to capturing the culprit,\u201d Vitore said.</p><p>Cinderella winced. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>When a potential customer strolled closer to the stall, Vitore remembered herself and bobbed a curtsey, cheerfully calling out to the customer. \u201cWinter wheat, potatoes, and carrots! All of them as sweet as summer,\u201d she sang out like the rest of the market stall merchants.</p><p>As Vitore haggled with customers, Cinderella finished stocking the stall. She secured the chicken eggs so they wouldn\u2019t fall, propped up a basket of goat-milk soaps, and arranged the vegetables.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re set,\u201d Cinderella said during a brief lull in sales. \u201cA stable boy will check in with you at noon to carry any empty baskets home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Mademoiselle,\u201d Vitore said, curtsying to Cinderella.</p><p>Cinderella wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be...\u201d</p><p>\u201c...Mademoiselle?\u201d Vitore said when Cinderella didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>Cinderella nodded her head at a group of Erlauf soldiers who strolled into the market. There were too many to be on patrol, but they were in uniform, so it was likely they were still on duty. They all wore the burgundy Erlauf uniform covered by charcoal-gray chest armor, gloves, boots, and helm.</p><p>A man at the front of the herd wore the garb of a ranking officer. He had a long, burgundy coat that fell past his knees and was slit from behind like a swallow\u2019s tail. Medals were pinned over his heart; his undershirt, the hem of the jacket, and his breeches were Erlauf gray. His most striking feature was the black patch covering his right eye. It was secured to his head with two black bands that stretched across his face and ran through his messy, dark brown hair that poked out from underneath his military hat. The brim of the hat was wide and drooping, and, following Erlauf custom, the left brim was pinned to the side of the crown. Based on all the medals pinned to his chest, he had to be at least a captain, perhaps even a major.</p><p>Cinderella clenched her sweaty hands into fists. It was unusual to see a ranking officer, especially one so young. He couldn\u2019t be much older than twenty.</p> <p>The market went quiet as the officer and his men strolled down the lane, stopping at Cinderella\u2019s stand.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Cinderella said, keeping her voice polite but cool as Vitore retreated to the back of the stall.</p><p>The officer studied Cinderella as a few of his men prodded the produce. He said nothing as his eye traced Cinderella\u2019s body.</p><p>Cinderella swallowed hard and kept herself schooled in spite of the revulsion that curled in her stomach. \u201cSir?\u201d she said.</p><p>The officer returned his attention to Cinderella\u2019s face, his eye taking in her short hair.</p><p>\u201cDidya have a tangle with someone?\u201d a soldier at the officer\u2019s right shoulder asked, gesturing to Cinderella\u2019s hair.</p><p>Cinderella stared at him for a moment before she shaped her lips into a fake smile. \u201cHow could I with all of you fine sirs patrolling this city and keeping us safe?\u201d</p><p>A few of the soldiers guffawed.</p> <p>The officer reached into a pouch that hung from his black belt. \u201cHow much are the carrots?\u201d he asked. His voice was low-pitched, like a cat\u2019s growl.</p><p>\u201cFive cooper coins for a bundle, ten for a basket,\u201d Cinderella said, overcharging the market price by two copper coins.</p><p>The officer tossed ten copper coins on the stand. \u201cOne basket,\u201d he said, his eye fixed on Cinderella.</p><p>Cinderella felt his gaze as she tucked the coins away and dumped a basket of carrots in a sack and offered it to the officer. \u201cThank you for the business.\u201d</p><p>As she held the vegetables out, a smirk spread across the officer\u2019s lips. \u201cUntil tomorrow,\u201d he said, touching the brim of his hat.</p><p>Cinderella shoved her hands behind the stand after the officer took the carrots, shielding her shaking fists from the soldiers\u2019 notice. She pressed her lips into a thin line as she watched them go.</p><p>\u201cAnimals,\u201d Vitore muttered in the back corner as she folded burlap sacks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella grimly agreed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella shivered, as if she could shake off the feeling of the officer\u2019s eye on her. \u201cI\u2019m off. Send word to Marie Raffin\u2019s residence if you need me,\u201d Cinderella said, snatching up a basket and frayed cloak.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mademoiselle,\u201d Vitore said, bobbing another curtsey as the activity resumed in the market.</p><p>Cinderella left the market and its produce and goods behind for the big buyers and sellers\u2014the government-approved merchants. Instead of setting up their goods in open air markets and stands, the merchants owned brick and mortar shops. A few were forced out of business after Erlauf\u2019s takeover, and a few more left when faced with Erlauf\u2019s strict taxes, but many of the merchant families were still around.</p><p>Cinderella stopped outside a shop that had a sign emblazoned with a bear walking across a fallen tree trunk. A bell rang when Cinderella entered the store, getting the attention of the shopkeeper. \u201cShe is out back, Mademoiselle,\u201d the shopkeeper said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said, ducking into a back room. She skirted through a hall stuffed with shipping crates and goods and darted past a tiny office crowded with papers and books. \u201cMarie?\u201d Cinderella said, poking her head outside the back end of the store.</p><p>There was a small patch of grass where two horses were hitched. A young lady dressed in a comfortable but expensive dress stood in front of the horses, hand-feeding them green tendrils. \u201cCinderella! What in the name of Trieux have you done to your hair?\u201d the woman said, dropping the grass to embrace Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cI chopped it off. A wigmaker gave me a good price for it,\u201d Cinderella said, brushing the slanted fringe of her bangs out of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt looks dreadful,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>Cinderella rolled her eyes. \u201cI am ever so glad I can count on you to hearten me, Marie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s just...it\u2019s so short,\u201d Marie said, tilting Cinderella\u2019s head to get a better look at it. \u201cDid you really have to chop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, the color is still pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. As much as I loathe Erlauf fashion trends, I am beginning to think I should follow their example and cover my head with a scarf or some such thing,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You look pitiable to be certain, but you are by no means the only girl who has sold her hair in the past few months,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but just before I left the market, a flock of Erlauf soldiers gawked at me,\u201d Cinderella said, running her hand through her short locks.</p> <p>Marie clicked her tongue. \u201cRuffians,\u201d she said. \u201cA gentleman would behave better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is business?\u201d Cinderella asked, leaning against the hitching post.</p><p>\u201cWell enough, I think. Armel has managed to come home at a decent hour these past few days, and he hasn\u2019t mentioned moving to Loire for the past month,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does your Aveyron fair?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shrugged. \u201cWe scrape by. All the farming changes have made it more profitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what drove you to beggar your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaxes, again,\u201d Cinderella said, offering her palm to one of the horses. \u201cWith their cost, I can barely afford to pay Aveyron\u2019s upkeep. I swear each month the tax burden grows heavier and heavier. If they don\u2019t increase the tax on every servant per household, Queen Freja places a tax on every acre of farmable land or imposes a tax on glass windows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t let any of your servants go?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her determination weighing the word down like steel and iron.</p><p>Marie sighed and dusted off her hands. \u201cYou have a hero complex, my darling Cinderella. Life would be so much easier for you if you were even a little bit selfish, like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot fool me,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI recognize your shopkeeper. She was your nurse until you turned thirteen.\u201d</p><p>Marie sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. With business improving, Armel hired more help, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cinderella said. She slid her hand down the horse\u2019s glossy neck before stepping back. \u201cI need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stay for tea?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella held up her basket. \u201cI have work. I only stopped by to say hello and to check on my sign. Have there been any inquires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. I left the names with my nurse; ask her for the list on your way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot thank you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the least I can do for you. It was good to see you, and your lack-luster haircut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care, Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinderella?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stopped at the doorframe and turned to face her friend.</p><p>\u201cI, I would help you more, if I could.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella smiled. \u201cI know. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Marie mutely nodded.</p><p>\u201cI will drop by again later this week. Until then,\u201d Cinderella called as she disappeared inside.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The following day, the Erlauf army officer showed up again at the chateau\u2019s market stall shortly after Cinderella and Vitore finished unpacking the day\u2019s produce. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d the officer said, a mocking pitch colored his tone as he spoke the Trieux title.</p><p>Cinderella brushed her bangs from her eyes. \u201cHow can I help you, sir?\u201d</p><p>The officer tilted his head as he studied Cinderella the way a fox studies a chicken. He glanced back at Vitore\u2014who bustled behind Cinderella.</p><p>Vitore busied herself with arranging eggs in a basket, but Cinderella did not miss the way the maid/produce-seller quivered in fear.</p> <p>\u201cSir,\u201d Cinderella repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnother basket of carrots, if you would be so kind,\u201d the officer said, his smirk cutting into his black eyepatch.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Cinderella said, pouring a basket of carrots in a sack.</p><p>\u201cThe price is still ten copper coins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Cinderella said. She handed the vegetables over after the officer placed a stack of coins on the rough, wooden counter.</p> <p>\u201cUntil tomorrow, Mademoiselle,\u201d the officer said, tipping the brim of his hat before turning to his soldiers.</p><p>Cinderella said nothing and watched him go.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a rake, that one is,\u201d Vitore muttered.</p><p>\u201cI wish he would buy his carrots someplace else,\u201d Cinderella said, pinching a copper coin between her fingers. \u201cBut coin is coin, even if it comes from Erlauf.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was churning butter when Gilbert found her. It had been almost a week since the Erlauf officer became a consistent customer. Neither he, nor his soldiers, ever said much, but the officer\u2019s gaze seemed to linger on Cinderella during the transaction.</p><p>\u201cVitore is right. He is a rogue. I\u2019ll have to be careful with him,\u201d Cinderella muttered as she thumped the churn, working out her aggression in the buttery milk.</p> <p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d Gilbert called. The land steward\u2019s voice was muffled as he wandered through the section of the barn where the cows slept.</p><p>\u201cIn back, Gilbert.\u201d</p><p>Gilbert followed Cinderella\u2019s voice to her spot outside where she thumped the butter in the shade of an ancient tree.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle, the newest tax regulations have been posted. Pierre was in the capital to collect Vitore\u2019s empty baskets and copied them down. Would you like to look at them?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella wiped sweat from her face with her apron. \u201cYes, please,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you tell Pierre he has my thanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said, passing a curl of birch bark to Cinderella. (Paper was expensive, after all.) Cinderella was relieved to see the biggest tax increase was the one already imposed on carriages. It wouldn\u2019t affect Aveyron. Cinderella had gotten rid of the carriage collection months ago, and the carriage horses were now used to pull loads of lumber and carts of produce.</p><p>The tax on income had decreased slightly, but there was an increase in landholding tax. She couldn\u2019t be certain (as mathematics and finances were not her strong point), but Cinderella suspected there would be little change to Aveyron\u2019s taxes. Perhaps a slight increase, but nothing unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask Pierre,\u201d Cinderella murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Mademoiselle?\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Cinderella said, looking up from the birch bark. She had forgotten the steward was there. \u201cIf they can be spared, could you send a stable boy or kitchen girl to Lord and Lady Delattre to see if there will be a meeting? I imagine the other Trieux noble families will have something to say about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gilbert,\u201d Cinderella said, handing the land steward the birch bark before wiping her hands off on her rough dress. A callous on her hand snagged on the material.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>Cinderella returned to the butter churn. \u201cAveyron doesn\u2019t have any carriages left, but the other remaining noble families of Trieux do. Erlauf certainly knows how to kick us where it hurts.\u201d</p><p>With all the riding horses sold and the carriage and work horses resting from a long day of work, Cinderella\u2019s only available method of transportation was to walk to the Delattre estate. Thankfully, the Delattre estate was only a half-hour walk away, as it bordered Aveyron.</p><p>When Cinderella entered the magnificent manor, a maid took her cloak and showed her to one of the salons.</p><p>\u201cCinderella, darling. It is so good to see you,\u201d Lady Delattre said, rising from the settee to embrace Cinderella.</p><p>Lady Delattre was an older woman with dove-gray hair and beautiful manners, as exemplified in the way she noted Cinderella\u2019s shortened hair and plain day dress that was little better than a servant\u2019s uniform, but said nothing. \u201cPlease, sit. We have a few moments to share between the two of us. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough, thank you. How are you, Lady Delattre?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am quite well, now that winter has left. The cold weather makes my old bones ache,\u201d Lady Delattre said as she poured Cinderella a steaming cup of tea. \u201cHow is your step-mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not seen much of her,\u201d Cinderella reported. \u201cNor of my step-sisters. They mostly keep to their rooms, and when they venture out, it is to visit friends from Erlauf,\u201d Cinderella said, holding her tea for extra warmth.</p><p>Lady Delattre sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime against goodness, what that woman does. I do not understand how she can live off you like a parasite. To think she refuses to help you pay the taxes you incur through Aveyron\u2014the estate of the man she married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe married Papa only because the Queen Freja ordered her to, and she does pay for her and her daughters\u2019 living expenses,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cNo woman should allow a child to take on the burdens you have, darling,\u201d Lady Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cI am seventeen,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Lady Delattre\u2019s sharp features softened. \u201cYou are too kind to her, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly\u2014,\u201d Cinderella started. She cut herself off when Lord Delattre\u2014a rail-thin man who always wore solemn expressions\u2014entered the salon with Lord and Lady Rosseux and their eldest son, Julien Rosseux.</p><p>\u201cI am telling you, Delattre, they will see the end of us yet,\u201d Lord Rosseux said, his face flushed. \u201cThey might not have killed and exiled us like they did to all other Trieux families of nobility, but that is only so they could slowly wring our wealth from us like a rag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLord Rosseux, there are ladies present,\u201d Lady Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Lord Rosseux said, throwing himself into an arm chair.</p><p>\u201cAre the Girards, Feautres, and Leroys not coming tonight?\u201d Lady Rosseux, as soft-spoken as her husband was loud, asked as she seated herself on a settee with her son.</p><p>\u201cIt was too far for the Girards to come at such short notice; the Feautres are indisposed, and the Leroys decided it was best not to come,\u201d Lord Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Erlauf\u2019s dogs still watch us for any sign of rebellion,\u201d Lord Rosseux said, covering his eyes. \u201cA meeting of the only six remaining noble families of Trieux would be marked with suspicion, but a meeting between an eligible lady, her chaperon neighbors, and a family with a marriageable son would raise less interest.\u201d</p><p>Julian, a handsome blonde who was a few months older than Cinderella, cleared his throat and blushed.</p> <p>He and Cinderella looked in opposite directions and did not acknowledge Lord Rosseux\u2019s observation.</p><p>\u201cLord Rosseux, I beg you to rein in your words. You have allowed your emotions to run freely,\u201d Lady Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have. We\u2019ll be forced to lay off more servants to make the tax.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella took a sip of her tea\u2014it was weak. Lady Delattre had probably used the leaves two or three times already. It was a handy way to save on what was becoming an expensive import.</p><p>\u201cWe will sell one of our carriages to minimize the effect of the tax,\u201d Lord Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cSome Erlauf scum will buy it,\u201d Lord Rosseux grunted.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do, Lady Lacreux?\u201d Julian asked. With his quiet temperament, he took after his mother more than his father.</p><p>Cinderella put her tea cup down. \u201cIt won\u2019t affect Aveyron. I sold all our carriages sometime ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou persist in retaining all your servants?\u201d Lady Delattre asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>In a country that used to brim with lavishly dressed lords and ladies, only six families remained. The rest had been slaughtered in the takeover or exiled. The remaining nobles were left to face an enormous tax burden. Most of the families, like Rosseuxes, made the taxes by lowering the wages of their servants or dismissing them. Cinderella was an extreme opposite. She sold everything she could and kept all of Aveyron\u2019s staff on. The Delattres held the medium ground, dismissing some of their servants and selling some of their possessions.</p><p>The taxes were harder on some families. The Delattres owned the least land and the smallest taxable income. Cinderella, on the other hand, possessed the largest estate and the highest title\u2014Duchess. The taxes imposed on Aveyron were the highest in the country.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear the Erlauf Queen gave the Lefebvre Estate to an Erlauf army officer?\u201d Lord Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cI did. Lefebvre must be rolling in his grave,\u201d Lord Rosseux said. \u201cThe queen is taking her time in handing out the estates. They\u2019ve been in royal possession for two, almost three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they\u2019re trying to decide which of their army officers to plant where. Their country places the highest importance on military service. Even nobles are required to serve,\u201d Lord Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cWorking, pah,\u201d Lord Rosseux said.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t most of the officers titled nobles?\u201d Julien said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is my understanding that officers are esteemed as highly as members of nobility\u2014perhaps higher in social standing, if not economic. Most of the officers, I believe, are sons of noblemen,\u201d Lord Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cGiving out Trieux estates is a brilliant way to reward them, then. If officers are second or third sons, they won\u2019t inherit a title or lands,\u201d Julien said.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant of the Erlauf Queen and her consort, yes,\u201d Lord Delattre said. \u201cBut it saddens me to see my countrymen\u2019s\u2019 lands going to...,\u201d he glanced at Lady Delattre and Cinderella and trailed off.</p><p>Cinderella smoothed her plain dress on her legs, and was surprised when Lady Delattre took her hand. \u201cYou look tired, darling,\u201d the older woman whispered.</p> <p>\u201cI might be a little, but my work is not without its rewards,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYou will not let even a single servant go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are just as stubborn as your father,\u201d Lady Delattre said, shaking her head. \u201cIt is very noble of you, but what will you do when you marry? Julien and Marcus cannot afford Aveyron.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella kept her face a smooth mask. When Cinderella\u2019s father was alive, no one had dared to push the topic of Cinderella\u2019s marriage. Now that he had been gone for over two years, Cinderella\u2019s marriage seemed to be the only thing noblewomen could think of.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t like the groom was going to be a surprise. Cinderella had two choices: Julien Rosseux or Marcus Girard\u2014who was several years younger than her.</p><p>It was expected she would marry, and with taxes as high as they were, she would be forced to marry without a dowry. Her husband would take her to preserve Trieux nobility, not to inherit Aveyron, as had once been the reason for her popularity. When she married, it was likely that Aveyron and everything in it would have to be sold, for no one would want an estate of such monstrous size to care for in addition to their own.</p><p>Cinderella wished there was another way, but she couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cCinderella?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella gave Lady Delattre her best smile. \u201cI apologize; my thoughts clouded my mind for a moment. I do not know what I will do,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lady Delattre sighed. \u201cIf only my Rodolf hadn\u2019t died in the war,\u201d she said, referring to her deceased son. He never would have been a candidate for Cinderella\u2019s hand before\u2014the Delattres weren\u2019t of high enough standing to be joined to Cinderella\u2019s family in the lavish times before the Erlauf invasion.</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry, Lady Delattre,\u201d Cinderella said, resting her fingertips on the older woman\u2019s hand.</p><p>Lady Delattre took a shuddering breath and bravely nodded.</p><p>When Cinderella removed her attention from her saddened hostess, she met Julien\u2019s gaze.</p><p>The shy young man blushed and looked away.</p><p>Cinderella folded her hands together and returned her attention to Lord Delattre and Lord Rosseux\u2019s conversation. She wouldn\u2019t give up on Aveyron until she had exhausted all other options.</p><p>Julien and Marcus were nice enough, but Cinderella\u2019s priority was Aveyron.</p><p>\u201cYou seem distracted today, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella tore her gaze from the squad of patrolling soldiers. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she said, setting the officer\u2019s usual bag of carrots on the counter.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing to pardon,\u201d he said, coins clinking in his hand. \u201cIt was merely an observation.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella said nothing and held her hand out for the coins as the officer did not seem inclined to place them on the counter as usual.</p><p>The officer held Cinderella\u2019s gaze, his mouth slanting in a smirk as he brushed his fingertips against her palm, touching her hand longer than necessary.</p><p>Cinderella jerked her hand back. \u201cThank you for your business,\u201d she said, her tone as stiff as the set of her shoulders.</p><p>Three soldiers stood with the officer instead of his usual pack. One of them laughed at Cinderella\u2019s reaction and nudged the officer.</p><p>The officer still smirked. \u201cWhat is your name, Mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella, in the process of sliding the coins in the money box, almost dropped the coins. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella puffed up like an anxious cat. Behind her Vitore squealed and dropped a basket of winter potatoes. She could lie, but the farce wouldn\u2019t last long. Hair as red as hers was rare, and everyone knew the produce stand belonged to Aveyron.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d the officer said, his smile growing more crooked.</p><p>\u201cCinderella. My name is Cinderella,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>The officer tipped the brim of his hat. \u201cUntil tomorrow, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>He left with his cronies, exiting the market the same way he entered.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d Vitore said, hovering at Cinderella\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cinderella said, her heart icing over as the officer disappeared from view.</p><p>With his exit, market business resumed. The cobbler went back to mending a busted shoe; a baker once again shouted his list of baked goods, and even the meat chickens five stalls up started clucking again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tap of the cobbler\u2019s hammer on the bottom of the shoe barely resumed before a mousy-looking woman scurried across the market. \u201cLady Lacreux, whatever will you do?\u201d the mousy woman wailed.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Cinderella said, checking on the potatoes Vitore had dropped.</p><p>\u201cAbout the officer. You\u2019ve caught his eye, mark my words. He\u2019s going to try and seduce you,\u201d the woman said, wringing her hands.</p><p>\u201cThe Erlauf devil,\u201d added the milkmaid in the stall next door.</p> <p>\u201cHe can try all he wants. I will ignore him,\u201d Cinderella said, placing the potato basket on the counter.</p><p>The mousy woman tisked. \u201cBut he\u2019s with the Army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see what that has to do with my refusal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe queen has a soft spot for her army lads,\u201d the tanner\u2019s wife said, joining the mousy woman. \u201cShe may let him yank you before her with the complaint that you have scorned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so,\u201d the mousy woman emphatically nodded.</p> <p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d Vitore said, hunching with distress.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine, Vitore,\u201d Cinderella said before turning to her growing audience. \u201cAll the man does is buy carrots from me. He has given me no reason to think he sees more to the exchange than obtaining vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but he asked for your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you cannot miss the way he eyes you\u2014like you was a wee rabbit and he a fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou best watch your step with him, Lady Lacreux,\u201d the potter across the way called as he wrapped a clay pot for a customer. \u201cNo telling what he might try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes it plain he comes here for you,\u201d the sharp-mouthed milkmaid said, feeding her goats some hay. \u201cHe enters the market and heads for you, as if you\u2019re the only person here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d said a woman selling candles. \u201cThe rest of us is plain as dirt. You, Lady Lacreux, you\u2019re why \u2018e comes \u2018ere.\u201d</p><p>The public reckoning warmed Cinderella. Most of the after effects of the war with Erlauf were negative, but not all things were bad. Previously no commoner would have spoken to Cinderella. The change probably had something to do with seeing her work side-by-side with her servants, but their concern softened Cinderella even if their worries were aggravating.</p><p>\u201cI will be careful,\u201d Cinderella said to the expectant crowd.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d the mousy woman said. \u201cWe want none of their kind messing with our nobles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you stay away a few days?\u201d the ropemaker, a friend of the milkmaid, asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat a grand idea,\u201d Vitore said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cinderella said, wiping her hands on her apron. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything yet to make me worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brushed your hand as if he was caressing your cheek,\u201d Vitore muttered.</p> <p>\u201cIf he makes any further insinuations, I will avoid the market,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>The mousy-looking woman planted her hands on her hips. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me for speaking so, Lady Lacreux, if that foreign devil looked at one of my daughters the way he looks at you with that eye of his, I would pack her up and send her to her aunt in the country before the day was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d the tanner\u2019s wife asked.</p><p>\u201cBut I do have the protection of Aveyron, and my title. They don\u2019t mean as much as they used to, but it should be enough. Furthermore, I have made many allowances, but I will not let Erlauf keep me from conducting business,\u201d Cinderella said, sticking her chin out. She paid her taxes and upheld the law like a good conquered noble, but she would not let this feckless officer affect her any further!</p><p>The commoners exchanged glances. \u201cPride of nobility,\u201d the milkmaid offered.</p><p>\u201cFoolish thing,\u201d the ropemaker said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your concern. Should the situation grow dire, I will not hesitate to take action,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cNobles, think they\u2019re above the worldly desires of others,\u201d the tanner\u2019s wife said, shaking her head in disgust.</p><p>Cinderella had to choke back the laughter. There was truth to their words\u2014Cinderella would have to be stupid to miss the wolfish way the officer looked at her. But they were forgetting\u2014those from Erlauf hated the citizens of Trieux just as much as the citizens of Trieux hated them. Why would the officer want anything to do with a high-ranking noble whose heritage, country, and inheritance was something he hated?</p><p>It was dusk when Cinderella started home. The market stall had been packed up earlier in the afternoon, but Cinderella had stayed behind in Werra for...reasons. Not that it mattered\u2014she failed in the goal she meant to accomplish.</p><p>The walk from Werra improved her flagging spirits. The dirt roads were peppered with people taking their goods home and walking with their pack animals and flocks. The countryside was painted hues of orange and crimson from the setting sun, and the birds still sang.</p><p>It was beautiful, and it required no work on Cinderella\u2019s part to enjoy it. She treasured the quiet moments when she didn\u2019t have to worry about her future or taxes.</p><p>A farmer on a cart pulled by two mules doffed his cap to her as he passed by, his wagon laden with bags of grain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella elbowed her cloak out of the way and waved.</p><p>\u201cAt times like this it seems like nothing has changed,\u201d Cinderella said, tossing her head to get the fringe of her bangs out of her eyes. She watched wild geese and swans fly overhead, returning to the north as winter fled the onslaught of spring.</p><p>The beauty of the moment was shattered by raised voices.</p><p>Further up the road, a small caravan of four wagons was stopped. One cart was filled with cages of ducks and chickens, another had produce, the third was packed tight with goods\u2014blankets, pots, and the like\u2014and the final wagon held a handful of commoners. Cinderella recognized the drivers and the passengers as sellers and craftsmen from the market.</p> <p>A squad of Erlauf soldiers had stopped them. Some of the soldiers were rattling the poultry cages, and several others were going through the wagon of goods.</p><p>A soldier tore open a sack from the produce wagon, inspected it, and tossed it back into the wagon, untied.</p><p>The commoners protested.</p><p>\u201cPlease have some respect,\u201d the driver of the produce wagon said as he reached to tie the sack shut.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only come from the market. Whatever you\u2019re looking for, we don\u2019t have it,\u201d an older man\u2014the potter\u2014said.</p> <p>A baby cried,. Its mother bounced it up and down to try and cheer it.</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d the lieutenant\u2014the leader of the soldiers\u2014said.</p><p>Cinderella caught up to the farmer with the wagon and mules. He pulled his team to a halt a short distance away from the stopped caravan and watched the interchange with stormy eyes.</p><p>The two soldiers going through the goods abandoned the cart for the produce wagon.</p><p>\u201cAnything of interest?\u201d they asked the soldier who opened sacks and tossed them back in the wagon.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d the soldier said, helping himself to a handful of peas from the wagon. He bit a pea pod in half and tossed the rest on the road to be stomped into the ground.</p> <p>The driver of the produce cart\u2014the farmer\u2014scowled deeper as he watched the soldiers ransack his cart. The baby cried louder in spite of the mother\u2019s best attempts to shush it.</p><p>A boy\u2014perhaps thirteen-years-old or so\u2014climbed off the passenger wagon so he could restore order to the wagon of goods.</p><p>One of the soldiers noticed and returned to that wagon. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say we were finished, boy.\u201d</p><p>The boy ignored him and tucked a clay jar beneath several blankets.</p><p>\u201cI said we aren\u2019t finished,\u201d the soldier said, grabbing the boy by the collar of his shirt. He pulled him away from the wagon and pushed him, sending the boy sprawling to the ground.</p><p>Two Trieux men sitting in the passenger wagon stood, and the driver of the produce cart leaped from his seat.</p><p>Things were going to get ugly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Cinderella said, hurrying forward to step between the soldier and the boy. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your concern,\u201d the soldier sneered.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is Lady Lacreux to you, soldier,\u201d Cinderella said, using every bit of her manners schooling to stand tall and elegant in a way that demanded respect. \u201cAnd it is my concern as we stand on lands belonging to the Duchy of Aveyron.\u201d</p><p>The soldier hunched his neck into his shoulders. \u201cWhat?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cThese lands are my lands. So would you be so good as to explain what you are doing on my estate?\u201d Cinderella said, folding her arms across her chest as she tipped her head back and looked down her nose at the soldier.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d the soldier said.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Your Ladyship,\u201d the lieutenant, mounted on the only horse, said. He urged the beast a few steps forward so he could address Cinderella without shouting over the wailing baby. \u201cWe received information of several armed ruffians traveling through these parts. For the safety of all, we are performing random checks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cinderella said, magnanimously bowing her head. \u201cWhen one is searching for ruffians and the like, it is always the wisest course of action to shake down farmers returning home from the capital.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant\u2019s saddle creaked as he leaned. \u201cPerhaps I allowed my men to be too enthusiastic in their duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cYou have conducted your search. Are they not free to go?\u201d Cinderella said, gesturing liquidly with her right hand. (Since the takeover, Cinderella had been bitter about investing so many years in dancing and fan-work, as fun as it was, and finding herself stupid in the ways of running an estate. But perhaps there were some uses for learned elegance.) As if testing Cinderella, a soldier rattled a chicken cage, making the bird squawk.</p><p>\u201cIf you are so worried they are secretly ruffians, please allow me to vouch for their character,\u201d Cinderella said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey are your serfs?\u201d the lieutenant asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but they all have stands in the market near Aveyron\u2019s stall. I know them quite well. As a member of nobility, I despise all forms of thievery and bullying. I can promise you none of the people before you are the kind to delight in such behavior,\u201d Cinderella said, taking care to highlight her noble accent, making her words crisp and clear.</p><p>The lieutenant dipped his head to her. \u201cVery well, Your Ladyship,\u201d he said before wheeling his mount around to face his men. \u201cBack into formation. We return to Werra.\u201d</p><p>The soldiers left the wagons and formed two lines. They marched back towards the capital, leaving ruffled commoners and peasants in their wake.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Mademoiselle,\u201d the produce wagon driver said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Are you all alright?\u201d Cinderella asked, extending a hand to the fallen boy.</p><p>He scrambled up without any help and bowed three times to Cinderella, almost falling again when he tripped on his bare feet. \u201cYes, Mademoiselle. Thank you, Mademoiselle.</p><p>\u201cBlessings over you, Mademoiselle,\u201d the mother of the howling baby said.</p><p>Cinderella smiled. \u201cThank you, take care,\u201d she said before continuing ahead, splitting off on a small road that ducked between some of Aveyron\u2019s plowed fields. It was a farming path, but it would cut minutes off the walk.</p> <p>\u201cMind you watch out for that Erlauf officer, Mademoiselle,\u201d the potter said.</p><p>Cinderella raised her hand to acknowledge the comment and kept walking home.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>When the Erlauf officer strolled up to the market stand, Cinderella pretended not to notice him. Her back was to him as she sorted through a basket of onions, but she knew he was there because the market went quiet in the way it did only when he was around.</p><p>It was earlier than usual. Some of the market vendors hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Vitore was gone with the milkmaid stand-neighbor, fetching water for the day. The maid\u2019s absence made Cinderella uneasy.</p><p>She was reassured when the baker started humming\u2014sounding much closer than the location of his stand warranted\u2014and the ropemaker nonchalantly sidled up to the milkmaid\u2019s goats and started petting them.</p> <p>\u201cI heard you ran into some trouble yesterday, Cinderella,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>Cinderella stopped sorting and reluctantly turned to face the high-ranking soldier. Based on the quirk of his lips he knew very well she was Lady Lacreux, the Duchess of Aveyron. \u201cTrouble?\u201d Cinderella said, widening her eyes. \u201cI have no idea to what you are referring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told you came upon some soldiers as they were in the process of conducting random searches,\u201d the officer said, tugging on his black eye patch. He was alone this time, although he still wore his army uniform.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cThat is true, but I have no recollection of there being any trouble.\u201d Normally she would ornament such a statement with her brightest smile, but she did not want to encourage this officer in any way.</p><p>The officer studied Cinderella, his face blank and emotionless for the first time since he started coming to the market.</p><p>His scrutiny was unnerving, so Cinderella busied herself with the carrots. \u201cThe usual?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, Cinderella looked back to the officer. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToday I have a different offer in mind,\u201d the officer said. \u201cBut first, my mother would tell me introductions must be made. Cinderella-who-has-no-curiosity, allow me to introduce myself. I am Colonel Friedrich of First Regiment of the Dragon Army.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella almost dropped the carrots. She immediately fixing her reaction, casually brushing her fringe of bangs out of her eyes. \u201cColonel?\u201d she said, as if enquiring after the weather.</p><p>\u201cQuite so,\u201d the-no-longer-nameless-officer said.</p><p>Oh dear. I should have listened to everyone, Cinderella thought. Although she was able to keep herself schooled, the baker came down with a coughing fit and the ropemaker froze\u2014he didn\u2019t even notice when one of the milkmaid\u2019s goats started nibbling his shirt.</p><p>A colonel was one of the highest offices an Erlauf soldier could achieve. A colonel ran a regiment of over 600 soldiers and served directly under a general. There were only a handful of them in existence, and the rank was a great honor.</p><p>As a conquered noble, it was safe to say Colonel Friedrich\u2019s rank was considered higher than Cinderella\u2019s\u2014even though Cinderella had more assets and a higher monetary worth. Such was the value Erlauf placed on the Army.</p><p>What this meant was Cinderella could not safely disregard the Colonel. If he was so inclined, he could make her life a misery. In the span of a few heartbeats, the Erlauf officer had gone from an irritation to a danger Cinderella could not flee.</p><p>\u201cI am honored to make your acquaintance, Colonel Friedrich,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d the Colonel dryly said.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, sir?\u201d Cinderella asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would like to spend the day with you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella twisted her fingers together. \u201cI am afraid I must respectfully decline, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d the Colonel said, his voice weighted with his displeasure.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have...prior engagements,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cThen tomorrow?\u201d the Colonel said, tapping his fingers on the rough wood of a beam that supported Aveyron\u2019s stand.</p><p>Cinderella almost winced. He was going to be persistent, was he? Perhaps it was better to bore him into giving up. \u201cI may be able to accompany you today if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my time was properly compensated,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>The Colonel went very still. His eye was neither friendly nor amused as he studied Cinderella. She could almost feel the power and danger radiating from him as he asked, \u201cYou want to be a paid woman then?\u201d</p> <p>As a proper lady, Cinderella didn\u2019t know exactly what kind of work the colonel referred to, but she knew it was a kind of work no lady would do. Cinderella\u2019s anger burst past the walls of decorum. \u201cWHAT?\u201d she shrieked, stepping back from the Colonel.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who said it,\u201d the Colonel said, his stance once again relaxed and liquid.</p><p>\u201cI said compensated. I work in Werra in the afternoon, and I cannot afford to miss the pay! I meant as long as you expected me to trail behind you, I had better get a pay equal to my job\u2014or I will never be able to accompany you,\u201d Cinderella said, the words rushing from her mouth before she was aware she thought them. When she realized what she said, she almost clamped her hands to her mouth, but settled for stiffly awaiting the Colonel\u2019s anger.</p><p>To Cinderella\u2019s surprise, the man seemed amused. \u201cYou work? Why?\u201d he said, his familiar smirk flashing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Have you something to say about working for a living?\u201d Cinderella said, pointedly staring at the medals pinned to the Colonel\u2019s uniform.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing at all,\u201d the Colonel said, chuckling with a maddening confidence. \u201cI would be happy to pay you for your missed wages. I shall return in an hour then to pick you up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you so sure you can cover my pay?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cI assume it isn\u2019t more than a handful or two of copper coins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day\u2019s work is one silver coin,\u201d Cinderella said, giving herself an outrageous raise.</p><p>The one-eyed Colonel shrugged. \u201cHardly more than spare change. In one hour, then,\u201d he said before setting off.</p><p>Cinderella angrily gawked at his back as he left the market. A silver coin was spare change? \u201cFilthy-rich dandy,\u201d Cinderella scoffed, angrily stuffing carrots back into the basket.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d the ropemaker ventured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella hissed.</p><p>It rankled her that an army officer could treat such a sum like it was nothing when Cinderella\u2014a duchess\u2014clambered for every copper coin she could get.</p> <p>The ropemaker winced. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Cinderella said, calming as the officer slinked out of sight. \u201cJust...irritated.\u201d</p><p>The ropemaker hesitated. \u201cAre you going to be alright?\u201d</p><p>The anger left Cinderella like a cloud on a windy day. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said, her shoulders slumping. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem...terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them do, until they reveal their true colors, Mademoiselle,\u201d the ropemaker said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a Colonel. I dare not offend him; the risk isn\u2019t worth it. I can only try to bore him in hopes that he will move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere lie the remains of the Sanct Pavilion, which saw the signing of the Griford Agreement. The Griford Agreement, as you may recall, was the third piece of the Glitter Accords, the articles that gave jurisdiction over magical matters to the Veneno Conclave,\u201d Cinderella said, indicating to a pile of rock and rubble. \u201cTrieux, Erlauf, Kozlovka, and Loire were the first countries to agree to the Glitter Accords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella ignored him and pointed the white flap of cloth she fixed on the end of a thin, whip-like willow branch to a beautiful but abandoned stone building. \u201cNext door is the historic Lutenau. Most recently, it was used as the capital offices for Trieux nobles when conducting governmental business. It was built over two hundred years ago, however, as a summer home for an Erlauf lord who was madly in love with a Trieux princess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCinderella,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cThe Lord, Lord Worgl, built it as close to the Trieux Royal Palace as he could,\u201d Cinderella said, spearing her makeshift flag in the direction of the palace. The prism-like points of the palace towers could be seen from just about anywhere in Werra, but they were especially close now. \u201cHe desired to be close to his lady love, although the princess scorned him. One day when he approached her in the public gardens, the princess\u2019s dog bit him. The bite grew infected, and Lord Worgl was rushed home to his manor in Erlauf. He nearly died from the bite, and he lost a finger in the process. It was not all in vain, for he fell in love with and married the woman who nursed him back to health, earning him the nick-name One-Less-Worgl\u2014the man who is credited with inventing the Erlauf tricorner hat, which can be adjusted without a thumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on doing this the whole time?\u201d the Colonel said, his head lolling to the side.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>The Colonel indicated to Cinderella\u2019s flag. \u201cThe history lesson. You cannot possibly mean to take me on a guided tour all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella batted her eyes. \u201cI only want you to get your money\u2019s worth, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is your part-time job? Historic tours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistoric Tours of locations from Erlauf Lore, yes,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cSo if I pay you another silver coin, can we stop the tour, discard the chaperon, and go eat?\u201d Friedrich said, turning to stare at the Aveyron housemaid that trailed approximately five feet behind him.</p> <p>Oh yes. I really hate him for being rich, Cinderella thought as the housemaid sniffed and fanned herself with a paper fan.</p><p>Cinderella kept her expression pleasant as she spoke. \u201cForgive me, sir, but it would be improper for us to be without a chaperone, and I could not stand to see you overpay me so.\u201d</p><p>It was amazing how intensely the Colonel could stare with one eye. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, the two words dripped with sarcasm. (He must have known she overcharged him a great deal for the \u201ctour,\u201d and that her maid was no proper chaperone, but was there to ensure he did nothing...untoward. Even if it was a little late, Cinderella would try to mind the wisdom of her fellow market stall sellers.) \u201cIs there any way I can convince you this history lesson is unnecessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice sunny and bright. \u201cIf you look to your left, you will see the Reflective Pool of Serenity. It is empty now, but previously it held a family of gold-scaled fish. Those fish, or their ancestors more correctly, were gifts from the Erlauf King Cristoph II.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel didn\u2019t try to mask his impatient sigh, but he trailed behind Cinderella with remarkable perseverance. After the first hour, Cinderella thought she would have shaken him off, but the persistent Erlauf officer stayed with Cinderella until her voice died just before sunset.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was why pointed shoes went out of fashion,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice rough like sandpaper. She gave the Aveyron maid a grateful smile when the woman offered her a water skin.</p> <p>The Colonel squinted at the red horizon. \u201cAre you done now?\u201d he asked as Cinderella drank her fill.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d Cinderella said, handing the water skin back to the maid.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a camel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not know what a camel sounds like, sir,\u201d Cinderella said, resting a hand on her throat. Never before had she given such an ungodly long tour. She almost bored herself to tears. How did the Colonel endure it?</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Shall we stop at an inn or pub to get you a drink?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cI must respectfully decline, sir, for I am expected at home,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice giving out several times.</p><p>The Aveyron maid nodded in approval.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the Colonel said, as sweet as sour dough.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you enjoyed the tour. Have a good night, sir,\u201d Cinderella said, curtseying. She\u2014and the maid\u2014turned away from the Colonel when the officer called out after her.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, then?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stopped and turned to face him. She struggled several times to speak before she could make her tired voice say, \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will pay you another silver coin for your afternoon, if you are willing,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella frowned. \u201cYou want to do this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would be willing to forgo the history lesson.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella opened her mouth to reply, but the Colonel beat her to the punch. \u201cNo, I shall spare your camel-voice and answer for you: you will insist on another sightseeing tour with the chaperone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to spend the afternoon together,\u201d Cinderella said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The soldier sighed. \u201cFine. Tomorrow, then. I will find you at the market,\u201d the Colonel said, bending the brim of his hat to Cinderella before he made his exit and walked towards a group of Erlauf soldiers who were congregating beneath an arch a short distance away.</p><p>\u201cErlauf. Nothing but trouble,\u201d the Aveyron maid said before she made her way to the market where Vitore and a cart were waiting.</p><p>Cinderella watched the Colonel go and felt for the silver coin in her pocket. Tonight she would have Pierre test its authenticity. There was little she could do to dissuade the Erlauf Colonel. Her best chance was to continue stringing him along on tours and hope he grew bored with it, and with her.</p><p>\u201cCinderella!\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella grimaced as a pig wiped its snout on her dress. After the Erlauf Colonel bought her afternoons for a full week, Cinderella suspected Marie would pay her a visit. Cinderella had hoped it would be at a time when she was not filthy and muddy.</p><p>So much for hoping.</p><p>\u201cCinderella, you cannot hide from me! Jeanne said you were out here,\u201d Marie said, sounding just as imperial as she used to back when she wasn\u2019t a merchant\u2019s wife but a duke\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d Cinderella shouted, skidding in the muck and mud the pigs created by dumping their water trough. She almost fell flat, but steadied herself by grabbing a great, black pig.</p><p>The animal ignored her and nosed through food scraps.</p> <p>Cinderella edged her way out of the mud hole. She popped over the wooden fence just as Marie\u2014in a clean, crisp dress\u2014rounded the corner of the dairy barn.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cinderella,\u201d Marie sighed.</p><p>\u201cThe pig boy is helping out in the high pastures today. Someone had to feed the pigs,\u201d Cinderella said, trying not to shudder as she looked at her dress. The thighs up had remained clean, but lower, the pigs had nosed and brushed against Cinderella\u2019s legs, making the hemline of her dress filthy and her legs coated in mud.</p><p>\u201cYes, but did you have to crawl into the pen to feed them?\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cI will know better next time,\u201d Cinderella grimly said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to know at all!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarie,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I would hug you, but I will decline to touch you. You smell like refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. What brings you to Aveyron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about the officer,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Cinderella said, starting for the dairy barn. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole capital talks of it. One of the maids mentioned when the Erlauf officer started stopping by your stand every morning. That was forgivable. Irritating, but not dangerous. But, Cinderella, is it really wise to spend your afternoons with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. Didn\u2019t your maid tell you? He\u2019s a Colonel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is? Oh dear,\u201d Marie gasped. \u201cI thought it was unusual you would even look twice at an Erlauf rat. What do the two of you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, it is three of us. Even I am not so bold that I would accompany a stranger without a chaperone, so a housemaid attends to us. And it is not a true social interaction. I give him tours\u2014although I am beginning to run out of places tied to Erlauf history to visit. I have tried to make it as business-like as possible. He even pays me for the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to get rid of him, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs best I can. It is not going well,\u201d Cinderella said, stopping at a well. She dropped a bucket into well and waited for it to sink before drawing it back up.</p><p>\u201cDo Julien and Marcus know?\u201d Marie asked, naming the two eligible, Trieux noble boys.</p><p>\u201cJulien must. His family is too close to Werra not to have heard of it,\u201d Cinderella said, grunting as she pulled the bucket of water over the lip of the well.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet the Rosseuxes have made no move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from them since I last saw them at Lord and Lady Delattre\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow unusual. One would think they would sweep in and snatch you up before the Erlauf rat ruins you,\u201d Marie said, backing away from the well when Cinderella started scrubbing.</p><p>\u201cI am not surprised. Lord Rosseux is bitter, but cautious. If the Colonel is petty, he might get nasty if someone tried to step in,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cBut it is so dishonorable to leave you alone to defend yourself. What of the Girards?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella considered the family for a moment. They\u2014from Lord and Lady Girard to fourteen-year-old Marcus\u2014were a younger sort of family. \u201cThey might step in and make an official marriage offer if they lived any closer. As it stands, it will take a good week or two for the news to reach them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could write to them,\u201d Marie suggested.</p><p>Cinderella, pink skinned from the cold water and the spring air, shook her head. \u201cIf they make an offer, I will have to accept,\u201d she said, studying the chateau, which austerely stared down at her from a hill. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give Aveyron up, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish girl. If you wait much longer, the worst might happen\u2014and no one will want you,\u201d Marie said wrapping a shawl around her shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Marie crossed the short distance between them.

By staying here, you are only delaying the inevitable, or, worse\u2014bringing personal ruin upon yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie\u2014,\u201d Cinderella started.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Can\u2019t you just...Couldn\u2019t you....,\u201d Marie\u2019s face crumpled as she tried to keep from crying.

You\u2019re all I have left\u2014I don\u2019t want to lose you too,\u201d Marie said, her voice fragile.</p><p>Cinderella patted Marie\u2019s back. The takeover was difficult on Marie in a different way.</p><p>Marie was a Trieux Duke\u2019s daughter, or she had been. Several years ago, she met and fell in love with Armel Raffin, her husband. He was wealthy, but he lacked a Trieux title and noble blood. Marie\u2019s father forbad her from marrying him, but she did anyway.</p> <p>So Marie\u2019s father disowned her. He cut all ties with her, and her family acted as if she had died rather than married beneath her station.</p><p>When Trieux was invaded, all of Marie\u2019s family was executed. No one was left, except for Marie\u2014who had been spared because of the separation.</p><p>Marie had been furious with her father for refusing to acknowledge her marriage, but she was perhaps even more enraged with him for dying before they could make any sort of amends.</p><p>\u201cI hate them,\u201d Marie said, as if reading Cinderella\u2019s mind. \u201cI hate those Erlauf soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately they are here, for better or for worse. And we are no longer citizens of Trieux, but citizens of Erlauf,\u201d Cinderella said when Marie pulled away.</p><p>Marie sighed. \u201cIt is as you say. Could you stay home from the market for a few days?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cHe knows I do not enter Werra on the days the market is closed,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Marie suggested. \u201cHe may forget about you in your absence and go plague another pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Cinderella said, grimacing as she studied Marie\u2019s dress. It was ruined, pressed with the same filth on Cinderella\u2019s work dress.</p><p>Marie paid the damage no mind. \u201cIt will work. You can see to the activities of Aveyron for a few days, and he will forget you. It is a winning solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but what if he sends inquires after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInquiries can be ignored. Social interaction is the real danger. And surely this Colonel wouldn\u2019t come to Aveyron to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, no. Even an Erlauf rat couldn\u2019t be that shameless.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 4</p><p>Marie was wrong. He was that shameless.</p><p>Cinderella was considering rugs with Jeanne when Gilbert delivered the news.</p><p>\u201cGilbert, wonderful timing. We could use your help. Which rug do you think we could get a better price for? The bear fur from Verglas or this velvet rug? The imported bear skin is rarer, but this velvet is awfully close to Erlauf burgundy,\u201d Cinderella said, prodding the rug with her foot.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>\u201cA visitor? One of the Trieux nobles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie or one of her husband\u2019s minions, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella clasped her hands to her heart. \u201cNot a tax collector?\u201d she said in horror.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert hesitated. \u201cIt is an officer of the Erlauf Army.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella felt as if a large rock had fallen into her stomach. She hadn\u2019t been visited by an army officer before. It was either the Colonel or someone he dispatched on his behalf. \u201cMercy on my soul, he is a pushy thing,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him standing in the front hall with a footman,\u201d Gilbert stiffly said. Apparently his good manners and delight in decorum did not extend to Erlauf houseguests, or he would have seen the Colonel to the least shabby sitting room.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gilbert. Jeanne, may we resume this conversation later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne curtsied.</p><p>Cinderella left the shadowy library and made her way to the front hall.</p><p>The Colonel stood near the front entrance, admiring a vase of wildflowers.</p><p>\u201cColonel Friedrich, what brings you to Aveyron?\u201d Cinderella said, briefly curtseying to the officer as he removed his attention from the flowers and turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Cinderella. I am here for you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, but I do not understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is the fourth day you have been gone from Werra. I thought your absence was an indicator of poor health. Although you seem to be quite well,\u201d the Colonel said, his eyes traveling the length of Cinderella\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cI am fine, but I thank you for the inquiry,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>The Colonel clasped his arms behind his back. \u201cWhat kept you from the market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was needed here in Aveyron,\u201d Cinderella said, lying through her teeth. Besides deciding what items to sell, there was very little Cinderella could do at Aveyron except get in the way of the servants.</p> <p>\u201cYou will soon return to spending your days in Werra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella reluctantly said. The extra coin she received from the Colonel kept her fortified for the past few days, but she had to return to Werra for reasons besides money.</p><p>\u201cI am heartened to hear that. May I place an early reservation on your afternoon\u2014and your maid\u2019s afternoon, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella studied the Colonel. \u201cHaven\u2019t you tired of history, or my voice?\u201d Cinderella asked, her tone closer to sincerity than the stiff politeness she usually used.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d the Colonel smirked.</p> <p>Cinderella briefly closed her eyes. \u201cVery well. I shall see you tomorrow afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI eagerly await the moment. Until then, be in good health,\u201d the Colonel said, tipping his hat to Cinderella before he made for the door.</p><p>The footman leaped to open the door for the Colonel, and slammed it on the officer\u2019s heels. Although the footman said nothing, the look of distaste on his face was clear.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Cinderella said. She shivered in the chill of the chateau and wrapped her arms around herself before she made her way back to the library where the rugs awaited. She was almost out of the entrance when her step-mother, Lady Klara, called.</p><p>\u201cCinderella,\u201d she said. Her voice was crystallized ice: sharp, jagged, and as cold as winter.</p><p>\u201cYes, Step-Mother?\u201d Cinderella said, brandishing the title like a weapon.</p> <p>Lady Klara was just as cold as her voice with icy eyes and hair the color of a stormy sky. She always stood straight, as if she had an icicle pressed to her back, and her expression was cool. Today, probably due to Cinderella\u2019s heavy-handed words, her top lip curled in a sneer. \u201cThere was an Erlauf guest?\u201d she asked as she elegantly descended the staircase that led to the second floor of the chateau.</p><p>\u201cYes, Step-Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did not wish to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Step-Mother. He was here for me,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Lady Klara folded her hands in front of her. \u201cI see. I apologize for detaining you so. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Step-Mother,\u201d Cinderella said, curtseying before she fled the room, shivering. Lady Klara had that effect on her. The woman never liked Cinderella\u2019s father, and Cinderella was no better in her eyes.</p><p>Cinderella co-existed with her step\u2014family because their presence made her unmarried state possible. Without them, Cinderella would not be chaperoned, and Aveyron would be snatched from her by the queen of Erlauf before Cinderella could turn eighteen.</p><p>However, whatever positives there were to their presence, Cinderella still disliked them\u2014and the feeling was mutual. Lady Klara was from Erlauf. She was the widow of an army officer who was slain in battle.</p> <p>Housing the enemy, feeding them, and seeing to their desires rankled Cinderella. Thankfully, they seemed to dislike their housing situation as much as Cinderella did, and mostly kept to their rooms or spent all of their time with other Erlauf friends.</p><p>\u201cIt seems those from Erlauf will not give me rest,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI wish they would all just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Erlauf Count Linz once stayed here. During his visit he...,\u201d Cinderella trailed off as she watched another squad of Erlauf soldiers troop past. They seemed to be out in high numbers today. She would have to wait to perform one of her less-than-legal errands thanks to the sudden influx.</p><p>\u201cCinderella?\u201d the Colonel said, shattering Cinderella\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did this count do during his stay?\u201d the Colonel said before he yawned.</p><p>\u201cHe broke his toe and hobbled for the rest of his life. This way, please,\u201d Cinderella said, holding up her makeshift flag as she led the Colonel and her maid deeper into the historic district of Werra.</p><p>\u201cYou made that up,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have. You cannot tell me a Trieux history book would contain that kind of information. No Erlauf historic text would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Cinderella said, passing five soldiers as she led the Colonel through what remained of the Royal Gardens.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle!\u201d</p><p>Cinderella paused, recognizing the voice.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle Cinderella,\u201d a young boy called as he scurried to catch up.</p><p>Cinderella squinted, recognizing the young boy as a servant from Aveyron. If memory served her correctly he was the youngest shepherd in the duchy. \u201cYes, Florian?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cVitore sent me. She needs assistance,\u201d the young boy said, panting.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Florian shook his head. \u201cCustomer bought out all our potatoes for the day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we bring a dozen bushels?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cAye. Cook up at the castle bought \u2018em, but he needs help transporting \u2018em. Someone needs to mind the stall while Vitore \u2018n me deliver the potatoes,\u201d Florian said.</p><p>Cinderella almost clapped her hands in glee. All the potatoes were sold out? And it was still moderately early in the day. What good luck!</p><p>\u201cOf course we can return,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going refuse to give me my money\u2019s worth, then?\u201d the Colonel asked, his voice lazy.</p><p>Cinderella winced. She had forgotten him. \u201cNo, of course not, sir.\u201d</p><p>In Cinderella\u2019s hesitation the housemaid stepped forward. \u201cI will go will go with young Florian.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s sense of decorum briefly fought with her great desire for money. \u201cAre you sure you do not mind?\u201d Cinderella asked as the housemaid stalked closer.</p><p>\u201cIf you will pardon me, Mademoiselle, I will send someone from the market to watch you. The Tanner\u2019s wife, perhaps,\u201d the maid said, whispering to Cinderella.</p> <p>Cinderella smiled in relief. \u201cVery well. That sounds excellent, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The shepherd and maid bobbed in a bow and a curtsey before they scrambled in the direction of the market.</p><p>Cinderella watched them go before she continued on her course, heading through the historical district.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>\u201cTo the Ruins of Alsace,\u201d she said, naming a historic Trieux building that Erlauf had torn down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already visited Alsace. Twice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I did not tell you all there is to know of it,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait to hear more,\u201d the Colonel said, his voice lacking enthusiasm.</p><p>Cinderella glanced over her shoulder. The bored Colonel stared at her, and behind him walked the five soldiers from the gardens. \u201cI am sure,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you desist playing tour guide?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cI should think never. It is the greatest aspiration of my life to give historic tours,\u201d Cinderella lied as they approached the toppled building. The grounds surrounding it were a wreckage of rubble and stone.</p><p>The Colonel snorted. \u201cI see. I suppose those of Trieux have a different, perhaps inferior, sort of aspiration they shoot for.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stopped and swung around to face him. She was about to blast him with some sharp words she would regret later but was silenced by the sight of the five Erlauf guards.</p><p>They followed Cinderella and the Colonel all the way to the ruins, an area rarely patrolled, and even less often frequented by normal citizens.</p> <p>\u201c...Cinderella?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella tilted her head as she studied the soldiers.</p><p>The Colonel briefly turned to see what Cinderella gawked at. \u201cPay them no mind,\u201d he said, returning his attention to Cinderella.</p><p>Cinderella ignored his advice. There was something off about the soldiers. Cinderella watched as one of the men swung a quiver off his back. Her heart stopped when she realized what it was.</p><p>The soldiers were dressed in Erlauf burgundy and gray, but their quivers held arrows fletched with feathers dyed Trieux lavender, and their swords were the ornate, beautiful kind Trieux nobles used to use.</p><p>They were not Erlauf soldiers.</p><p>They were assassins.</p><p>Cinderella shifted her gaze from the assailants to the Colonel. He stared back at her with boredom.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Cinderella could make an excuse and dart off, and he would be killed. One despicable Erlauf officer would be wiped from the world, and one of her problems would be solved.</p><p>She could be wrong. Maybe they weren\u2019t here to kill him, but no one would blame her if she didn\u2019t speak up, right?</p><p>The Colonel blinked his dark eye at her. \u201cCinderella? Are you finally done?\u201d</p><p>All she had to do was leave.</p><p>The assailants spread out in a formation, giving her the opportunity to turn her back.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Cinderella scrunched her nose up. \u201cBlast,\u201d she said before grabbing the Colonel\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the Colonel said, sounding amused as Cinderella dragged him into the ruins.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t slouch along, run,\u201d Cinderella hissed, jumping a fallen support beam. She pulled him behind a crumbling wall. \u201cStay down,\u201d she ordered before she peeked around the wall, looking for the men.</p><p>\u201cWhat has gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose weren\u2019t Erlauf soldiers,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did they carry Trieux weapons?\u201d Cinderella asked, glancing at the crouching colonel.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey were obviously hired to kill you,\u201d Cinderella whispered, spotting a soldier who was headed into the stone maze of the ruins.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d the Colonel scoffed.</p><p>Cinderella ducked, avoiding an arrow that clipped the wall.</p><p>\u201cImpossible, you say,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about you? You aren\u2019t a no-name. They could be after you,\u201d the Colonel argued as Cinderella abandoned her flag and indicated he should follow her.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they kill me with Trieux\u2014fletched arrows?\u201d Cinderella asked, jumping a toppled wall before she darted into what once was an office. It was one of the few room in the building in which all four walls were still intact.</p><p>The Colonel said nothing, but stepped in front of Cinderella, as if to take the lead. \u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d Cinderella said, sliding in front of him. \u201cYou have no idea where we are. I\u2019m leading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation has changed, Lady Lacreux. This is no historic tour,\u201d the Colonel said. Somewhere along their flight, he had unsheathed his sword. He held it so naturally at his side Cinderella hadn\u2019t noticed it until he brought it near to her body.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? But you cannot fight five men. We have no choice; we must retreat. You don\u2019t know where we are, and I do; therefore, I lead,\u201d Cinderella said, starting through an open doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a civilian. You aren\u2019t trained in evasion techniques.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella snorted. \u201cI\u2019m certainly a great deal more trained at evading in Werra than you are,\u201d Cinderella said, heading for a winding staircase posted in the corner of the room. It led to the second floor, which was visible through great, gaping holes in the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? This cannot be stable enough to hold us,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop fussing and just follow me? You\u2019re wasting time,\u201d Cinderella said, halfway up the staircase.</p> <p>\u201cThis is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk only where I walk,\u201d Cinderella instructed when the Colonel joined her on the second floor.</p><p>Cinderella edged down the hallway, navigating her way through yawning chasms and weak floors. Although the air was cool, sweat beaded on her forehead. She tensed when a floorboard creaked when the Colonel stepped on it, but it held him.</p><p>When Cinderella heard footfalls on the stairs, she led the Colonel into a side room. Most of the floor was gone. Cinderella thought the Colonel would hiss something at her, but he was quiet and faced the hallway, crouched in a defensive position.</p><p>Cinderella grabbed a ladder that leaned against the closest wall. With the ease brought by practice, she lowered the ladder across the hole. She fixed it between two support beams, creating a precarious bridge.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Cinderella said crawling across the hole.</p> <p>\u201cWill it hold me?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>\u201cI should think so. A quite obese soldier used it once and it didn\u2019t budge then. Come,\u201d Cinderella bid.</p><p>Rather than shuffle across on his knees, as Cinderella had done, the Colonel stooped and leaped from rung to rung, his sword outstretched.</p><p>The ladder buckled, but the Colonel safely crossed. Cinderella hauled the ladder across the gap. A lavender fletched arrow struck the ladder from below.</p><p>The assailants worked soundlessly. They did not call to one another, but Cinderella could hear the pattern in their footfalls.</p><p>Cinderella slid the ladder across the small bit of floor and threw a rock into the next room. She stepped up onto the crumbling outer wall\u2014which was only a foot or two above the floor\u2014and motioned for the Colonel to join her. When he did, she took another brick and threw it into the room she slid the ladder into.</p><p>Cinderella heard the thud of an arrow embedding into wood in the next room\u2014her mislead had worked\u2014before she picked her way along the crumbling perimeter wall.</p><p>Cinderella and the Colonel shuffled along, traveling the length of the building. When they reached the far end\u2014the same end at which they entered the ruins\u2014Cinderella shimmied down a thick length of ivy.</p> <p>When she reached the ground, the Colonel slid halfway done the vine before letting go and dropping with the elegance of a cat.</p><p>It was unfortunate, but besides the rubble, Alsace was stranded in an expanse of green lawn. Thankfully, once they cleared the park, soldiers were close.</p><p>\u201cWe go this way,\u201d Cinderella whispered, pointing in the direction of the Royal Trieux Library. \u201cThere are more patrols there. We will run into reinforcements faster. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Colonel said before he and Cinderella started running.</p><p>Cinderella was grateful for her knee-length skirts\u2014sprinting in a full-length dress would have been torture\u2014although she kicked up pebbles that stung her bare skin.</p><p>Cinderella didn\u2019t hear the soldiers, but the Colonel must have, for he wrenched Cinderella aside just in time to avoid getting hit by an arrow.</p><p>A soldier with a bow stood on the second floor of the ruins. He fitted another arrow to his bow as one of his companions chased after Cinderella and the Colonel, Trieux sword extended.</p><p>The Colonel dragged Cinderella in a serpentine pattern, snaking back and forth. It kept the archer from taking an easy shot, but it let the soldier with the sword catch up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The archer shot at the Colonel just before they darted in between two buildings. He missed, but they weren\u2019t safe yet. There were still another two blocks to run before they could join the swirling masses of Werra.</p><p>Cinderella yelped when the pursing soldier caught the hem of her skirts and yanked her backwards.</p><p>The Colonel could have left Cinderella there. If he was smart, he would have. Instead, he lunged after her. He sliced through Cinderella\u2019s skirts\u2014shortening the back by several inches but freeing her\u2014and kneed the soldier in the side.</p><p>He nailed the soldier in the sternum with the hilt of his sword, driving the man back, before grabbing the soldier by the throat and smashing his head against a wall.</p> <p>The man wore a helmet\u2014so it did not knock him out\u2014but it jarred him enough that the Colonel was able to kick his feet out from under him and slam him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cKeep running,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Guessing what he was about to do, Cinderella turned on her heels and fled.</p><p>The Colonel joined her a few moments later, his sword red with blood.</p><p>Cinderella shivered, her blood chilled, but she could hear the noises of activity and animals. She sucked in air before screaming, \u201cHELP!\u201d</p> <p>The Colonel blew a metal whistle and hauled Cinderella along by her elbow. They ran an additional block before they were surrounded by a sea of Erlauf soldiers wearing the dragon-plate-like armor and dressed in Erlauf burgundy.</p><p>\u201cFive men. One is down one street back, dead. Two archers, one dagger user, and another swordsman,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Two squads peeled off from the mass of soldiers, heading for the ruins of Alsace. The remaining soldiers moved into an organized, protective formation around Cinderella and the Colonel.</p><p>Cinderella stared at the Colonel\u2019s bloodied sword.</p><p>\u201cCinderella.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella snapped her head up so fast her neck cracked. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you well? Were you hurt?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice sounding muffled and echo-y to her ears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important\u2014the weapons were likely laced with poison. Did the swordsman even graze you?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella rocked back and forth on her feet. \u201cNo. I stumbled in the ruins, but that\u2019s all,\u201d she said, her eyes falling back to the Colonel\u2019s sword. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well,\u201d she said before her legs gave out underneath her.</p><p>Something roared in her ears. All Cinderella could think of was the Colonel\u2019s red sword and the man he killed. She was vaguely aware that the soldiers around her stirred.</p><p>\u201c\u2014see she receives medical attention for you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I will take her there myself. It\u2019s just shock, I think. No small wonder. I doubt she was ever chased by assassins before,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella felt arms around her before she was picked off the ground. She would have protested, but her vision was blurry, and it felt like her heart might pop out of her chest.</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t run off and leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but she was the one who noticed...\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014brave little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s head rolled back against her will, and she lost track of the conversation as her stomach heaved. \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick,\u201d she said.</p><p>The Colonel and his soldiers didn\u2019t react fast enough.</p><p>Half an hour later, Cinderella sat in a guardhouse with a steaming cup of tea in front of her. Two soldiers were posted at the door, stone-faced and holding wicked-looking scythes.</p><p>\u201cMay I go home?\u201d Cinderella meekly asked.</p><p>They ignored her.</p><p>Cinderella looked back at her tea, inhaling the soothing, herbal scent.</p><p>The Colonel entered the room, his hair damp\u2014probably from bathing\u2014and wearing a fresh uniform.</p><p>Cinderella guilty looked away. \u201cI apologize,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was understandable. Normally, I would have let you lie down where you were, but I did not want to leave you so close to danger,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella grimaced, upset with herself and with the Colonel. It wasn\u2019t her fault she couldn\u2019t stand the slaughter. But there was something shameful about throwing up on the man who was carrying her to safety.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse reported you were fine,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella leaned into the steam of her cup. \u201cYes. May I please go home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d the Colonel said, taking a seat across from Cinderella. He clasped his hands together and stared at her with an alarming amount of intensity. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me? You could have made an excuse and left. They would not have followed you. Why did you run with me?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella pressed her lips together and said nothing.</p><p>The silence stretched between them, twisting around Cinderella like a snake.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Cinderella finally said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook at me, Cinderella,\u201d the Colonel said, his voice sharp like the edge of a sword. \u201cI want an answer. My country has done its best to grind you under its heel. You hate me and everything I stand for. Why?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella squirmed under the Colonel\u2019s intense gaze before blurting out, \u201cBecause you\u2019re still a person. You\u2019re an Erlauf officer, but even Erlauf soldiers deserve life. I won\u2019t just sit there and watch someone be murdered in cold blood, even if the victim would be you. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel leaned back in his chair, the first hints of a smirk curling the corner of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI still hate you,\u201d Cinderella darkly added, lifting her tea cup to her lips.</p> <p>The Colonel\u2019s suggestion of a smirked bloomed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any less,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you smiling?\u201d Cinderella irritably asked, scrubbing her hands through her short hair.</p><p>\u201cBecause you are universally kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very rare and admirable trait.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella drank her tea and ignored the compliment. A part of her still couldn\u2019t believe she dragged the Colonel off, but she was glad she had. Her father would be proud of her, even if the Colonel was from Erlauf.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is bringing porridge for you\u2014the nurse suggested you eat a little. After you eat it, you may go,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Cinderella eyed the Colonel over her teacup and said nothing.</p><p>As if on cue, a soldier carrying a wooden tray entered the room, two officers trailing him.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d the officers saluted.</p><p>The lower-ranked soldier set the tray down in front of Cinderella and saluted before he left.</p> <p>\u201cMajor Timo and Captain Sigmund. What did you find?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo of the assassins were killed in combat. The third was captured, but the fourth escaped, Sir,\u201d one of the men said, saluting the Colonel.</p><p>Cinderella stirred her porridge suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. What does the captive have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery little. We will try torture, of course\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cinderella abruptly shoved the tray of food away from her, once again feeling sick. She arranged her arms on the table top and rested her head on them.</p><p>A chair scraped.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best to continue this conversation at a later time,\u201d the Colonel said as he walked around the table. \u201cSend the Scarlet and Storm Companies to comb the ruins for tracks and traces. Double the night patrols. Has General Harbach been notified?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has, sir. As has the Commander The Colonel sighed. \u201cVery good. Thank you, men. I will speak to you in the holding area in a few moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d the men saluted before leaving the room.</p><p>Cinderella was very still as she remembered with whom she was dealing. The Colonel wasn\u2019t an everyday soldier; he was a powerful man who could wield an entire regiment to do his bidding. And Cinderella just told him she hated him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking when I asked them to report in,\u201d the Colonel said before Cinderella felt him brush the fringe of her bangs.</p><p>Cinderella very slowly picked her head off the table. \u201cThere is nothing to apologize for, sir,\u201d she said, her composure returning.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. You have saved my life. You must call me by my first name: Friedrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would not be appropriate, sir,\u201d Cinderella said, avoiding his eye by stirring her porridge.</p><p>The Colonel shrugged. \u201cWe shall argue about this later. I must go. After you eat, a squad of soldiers will escort you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is unnecessary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is very necessary, and they are under orders to see you all the way to the front door of Aveyron. You will not wriggle out of this one, Pet,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Shocked by the improper nickname, Cinderella could only gape.</p><p>\u201cEat your porridge and rest. Stay at Aveyron tomorrow. I will send some men to check on you. Until then,\u201d The Colonel said, running a finger down the back of Cinderella\u2019s hand before ducking out of the room.</p><p>Cinderella gloomily stared at her porridge. Yes, she had forgotten how powerful the Colonel was.</p><p>Friedrich was in his office, his hands folded behind his head, when Colonel Merrich found him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at? You look like a creepy, old geezer,\u201d Merrich said, leaning on the doorframe.</p><p>Friedrich\u2019s smirk grew. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the attack against you today. General Hardbutt threw such a fit his heart almost stopped. I will be impressed if he doesn\u2019t kill you himself for being alone with a civilian with no escort when you report in tomorrow morning,\u201d Merrich said, playing with the medals pinned to his chest.</p><p>Friedrich stopped smirking. \u201cSo you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone within hearing distance of Werra heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this girl you were with, word is she is a Trieux noble?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich renewed his smile. \u201cCinderella Lacreux, Duchess of Aveyron.\u201d</p><p>Merrich whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s some pedigree and title she\u2019s toting. She\u2019s one of your prospects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the prospect,\u201d Friedrich said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is unexpectedly kind. She hides her hot temper behind pretty words and manners, but her loyalty goes deeper than the oceans,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cIs she beautiful?\u201d Merrich asked, folding his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe is exotic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny, I never thought you would be able to like, much less love, a Trieux brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not think I would either, but Cinderella...\u201d Friedrich trailed off. \u201cI want her,\u201d he said.</p><p>Merrich strolled into the office and ruffled Friedrich\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you. Congratulations, good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dog,\u201d Friedrich said, kicking his friend away. \u201cAnd even if I\u2019ve decided on her, she still hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have your work cut out for you? That makes it all the more fun. You\u2019ve always enjoyed a good challenge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s filled with hate,\u201d Friedrich said, ruefully smiling.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some help with her?\u201d Merrich asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease, no. You would make her hate me more,\u201d Friedrich said, standing up in a liquid movement of deadly elegance.</p><p>Merrich chuckled and slapped Friedrich on the back. \u201cWhen will you tell your men the good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for as long as I can avoid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re busy bodies. They\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich slung an arm across Merrich\u2019s shoulders and dragged him into a headlock. \u201cIf you tell them, I will pay a social visit to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s playing dirty,\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but you keep your patty-paws out of my love affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll leave the Trieux Troll alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you have said that and sounded anymore love-sick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you, lover-boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she slaps you in the face when she meets you,\u201d Friedrich grumbled.</p><p>\u201cMore and more, your descriptions of her intrigue me. You call her exotic and theorize she would punch me. She must be built like an ox.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich briefly reminisced on Cinderella\u2019s beauty: her adorable button nose and the breath-taking combination of her brilliant red hair, the dusting of freckles, and stormy gray eyes. It was doubtful there was a man alive who would call her anything but beautiful...but Merrich was unfortunately handsome and of the same military rank as Friedrich...</p><p>\u201cHer build is...,\u201d Friedrich trailed off misleadingly.</p><p>\u201cThought so. Why else wouldn\u2019t one of the other Trieux tramps snatch her up for their sons? At least she has that charming personality, eh?\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Friedrich echoed, a smirk hanging from his lips. He needed time to sweeten Cinderella up to him and his country, but when she finally came around, he was going to take great delight in introducing her to Merrich. \u201cHer gait is...impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe scuttles, does she? Well, Mutti always said personality and intellect are more important than beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she? Your mother is a wise woman,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cOf course she is. Anyway, you could probably hire trainers or something for your future Trieux misses. They could help. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The day after the attack against Colonel Friedrich, Cinderella broke into the Trieux Royal Library.</p><p>As a result of the increased patrols city-wide, the patrols around the library were lessened to free up soldiers. Cinderella may not get another good chance for her illegal activity, so she waited until the late afternoon before she went to Werra, making her way to the closed library.</p><p>A kerchief tied over her eye-catching hair served as her poor disguise, but none of the patrolling soldiers looked twice at her, so Cinderella judged the time to be perfect.</p><p>She hummed as she walked to the back end of the library, which was pressed against the backside of the Trieux House of Lords\u2014where the Trieux nobility used to meet to vote on matters of the country.</p><p>Both buildings were closed, so Cinderella only had to worry about outdoor activities.</p><p>Cinderella kept her gait slow and even, acting unconcerned as she adjusted the basket on her arm. \u201cRats,\u201d she said when she rounded the corner. The back window she used to squirm indoors was boarded up from the inside.</p><p>Cinderella pushed against the wooden block, testing its strength. It didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cSo much for that route\u2014although it took them months to figure out that was how I got in. Where else can I...ah-hah,\u201d Cinderella said when she spied an open window. It was higher up, well above Cinderella\u2019s head, but its wooden shutters hung, barely secured enough to shield the open window from the weather. The scarcely useful shutters were casualties from the mistreatment the building suffered when Erlauf marched against the capital. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella traveled the back end of the building to peer around either corner. A patrol wasn\u2019t due for a few minutes, but one could never be too careful.</p><p>Cinderella retreated to the window and pushed a crate against the wall. She was still too short to reach the wooden sill. Cinderella piled several planks on the crate before she tried again.</p><p>Cinderella stood on her tip toes, and still lacked the height. She jumped and her hands brushed the window sill, but she wasn\u2019t strong enough to pull herself up. She hung there for the barest moment before her arms gave out, and she fell back on the crate.</p><p>She placed her hand on her hips and glared at the wall before she tried climbing up, wedging her fingers and feet in cracks and gaps between the stone blocks that made up the library.</p> <p>She climbed up only one layer of the blocks when a voice behind her said, \u201cSo you\u2019re the lawbreaker that\u2019s been evading my men for the past year?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shrieked, lost her grip, and fell back on the crate. She lost her balance and toppled over the side. Cinderella rubbed her stinging side as she boosted herself into an upright position. \u201cAh, Colonel Friedrich. What a surprise it is to see you here,\u201d Cinderella said when she realized who stood with her in the back alley.</p><p>It was her rotten luck he would find her.</p><p>\u201cThis explains those skills of evasion you displayed yesterday. You had months of practice from leading soldiers on long, merry chases whenever they happened upon you clawing your way inside the library,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Do you mean\u2014? No, I would never attempt to break and enter! Why, I was trying to secure the open window, of course. Do you know how much damage the wind and rain could do to the books? It surely is an oversight to leave it open,\u201d Cinderella said, gravely shaking her head as she planned her exit. It made her uneasy to be alone with him.</p> <p>The Colonel narrowed his eye. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive you\u2019ve evaded attention so long with your illicit actions. Although I suppose I cannot blame my men for not finding you. I hardly recognized you myself with your hair covered so skillfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Sir, I am offended by your presumptions,\u201d Cinderella said, looking down her nose at the Colonel as he gathered up her basket.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you go in there to actually use the library?\u201d the Colonel said, going over the contents of her basket: a bottle of cheap, ash-based ink; two quills; matches; and curls of birch bark.</p><p>\u201cI, sir, am a law-abiding citizen. As such, I would not enter the library as it is currently outlawed,\u201d Cinderella said, brushing off her skirt. \u201cBut as you are here, I imagine you can deal with the unsecured window yourself. Would you be so kind as to give me back my things, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich,\u201d the Colonel said, setting the basket down. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p> <p>The Colonel wriggled his fingers in a come-closer gesture.</p><p>Cinderella minced over to the Colonel. \u201cWhat,\u201d she started. \u201cDo you want\u2014put me down!\u201d she shrieked when the Colonel picked her up by her waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Cinderella hissed as the Colonel climbed the crate.</p><p>\u201cHelping you break the law. Can you reach the ledge?\u201d</p><p>Held higher, the ledge was shoulder-height. \u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said, scrambling to grasp the ledge. She set her feet against the stone exterior wall and tried to climb in. She shrieked when the Colonel pushed against her backside\u2014boosting her up and touching her posterior. \u201cSir! This is highly improper!\u201d</p><p>The Colonel only chuckled.</p><p>Cinderella purposely booted him in the neck before she squirmed through the window, falling inside. She landed on a narrow walkway set a foot or two down from the window.</p><p>Cinderella poked her head out the window. \u201cMy basket?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComing up with me,\u201d the Colonel said, tying the basket to his belt. The Colonel made the climb much more gracefully. He jumped and grabbed the sill before pushing off the wall with his feet like Cinderella had attempted.</p><p>A few graceful, slithering movements, and the Colonel eased his way inside.</p><p>\u201cWow. It\u2019s a disgrace in here,\u201d the Colonel said, squinting at the dust-coated walkway and railings, and the dusty shelves of books that extended before him like a wooden army.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect? No one has been allowed in since the takeover,\u201d Cinderella said, snatching her basket from the Colonel\u2019s belt.</p><p>She marched down the walkway, taking a set of rickety stairs to the base floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. Will you be able to see in here well enough to read?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>As he had all but thrown her inside, Cinderella estimated the Colonel wasn\u2019t likely to drag her off to jail. His manners seemed to promise that he would not do anything indecent, even though they were alone, either. So she replied, \u201cThere are candles,\u201d as she orientated herself in the library and looked for the places where, in previous trips, she upset clouds of dust.</p><p>\u201cFunny, you don\u2019t strike me as the reading type,\u201d the Colonel said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Cinderella said, leading the way between two rows of books.</p><p>\u201cYou must be. Why else would you break in a library? Unless...do you hawk the books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! First of all, what kind of lowlife steals from a library? And secondly, all the books have the Trieux royal seal on them. Only a madman would buy something with the Trieux seal these days,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cIt does not escape me you have a moral and a practical reason for your lack of black-market selling,\u201d the Colonel said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to read for fun, nor am I hear to steal,\u201d Cinderella said, stopping at a shelf partially cleared of dust.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch,\u201d Cinderella said, selecting several volumes of leather-bound books before she walked deeper into the library.</p><p>In the very center of the library were several desks pushed together to form a work station. There were unlit candles placed in half globes of silver. Cinderella set her books down in the dying light before she dug out the matches from her basket and lit two of the candles.</p><p>The silver globes let Cinderella direct the candlelight to make a sort of spotlight, and they sheltered the light from twinkling up to the ceiling\u2014a light source patrolling soldiers were sure to notice.</p> <p>The Colonel pawed through one of the books Cinderella stacked in front of her. \u201cFarming? You\u2019re researching farming techniques?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said, opening her ink set and dipping a quill in it before she started taking notes on the scraps of birch bark.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you have forgotten, sir, I am a lady. My upbringing did not include classes on crop rotation, field yields, and formulating fertilizer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your servants? Don\u2019t they know about farming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basics, yes. But they knew only what we grew. Aveyron\u2019s income came mostly from livestock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s no longer an option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still is a main source of income, but the taxes your sweet queen imposes on me do not allow for me to waste acreage. I must use all the resources I have available. We can\u2019t keep doing what we always did. We have to expand and investigate other options. Like winter crops. This was the first season we successfully cultivated them since well before my grandfather\u2019s time,\u201d Cinderella said, turning a page in her book.</p><p>\u201cYou should grow flowers,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cEveryone from Erlauf is crazy about flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Cinderella said as she scratched out a list of possible summer crops.</p><p>The Colonel studied their darkening surroundings. \u201cAny idea where the map books are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the takeover, I never once set foot in this building in my life. It took me ages to find the agricultural section. I have no idea where to find any other type of book,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m going to have a look around. I\u2019ll be back shortly, Pet,\u201d the Colonel said, striding off into the shadows of the bookcases.</p><p>Cinderella watched him go with narrowed eyes. She needed to talk to someone about the Colonel\u2019s conduct. He toed the line of propriety, but he did not seem serious in pursuing anything lasting.</p> <p>But who could she talk to? Marie would only push Cinderella to accept Julien or Marcus. Lady Delattre would be a sympathetic ear, but was unlikely to have any useful advice. Lady Klara would be a source of sound advice, as stiff and proper as she was, but Cinderella had a friendlier relationship with the Colonel than she did with her step-mother.</p><p>Who could she approach?</p><p>Cinderella shook her head and turned her attention to the books. She was better off pondering her problems at a time less pressing than the present. The Colonel was a rogue, to be sure, but he was controlled enough that he would not do anything dark or dangerous to Cinderella.</p><p>She would have to be satisfied with that. For now.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella groaned and covered her head with her arms. It had been a long day. All she wanted to do was doze on her bed. Who cared about dinner?</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jeanne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Klara requests your presence.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sat up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Klara requests your presence in her private rooms,\u201d Jeanne repeated.</p><p>Cinderella slid off her bed. \u201cDid she say why? Did she seem angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave no indication why she needed to see you, Mademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne said as they hurried out of Cinderella\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Curse me, it\u2019s as if my ponderings from yesterday brought her attention to me. What does she want now? Cinderella thought.</p><p>When they reached the private parlor situated against Lady Klara\u2019s rooms, they stopped.</p><p>Cinderella tried to shake the worst of the wrinkles from her dress and smoothed her short hair into place.</p><p>Jeanne curtsied to her before she knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Lady Klara said, her voice its usual tone of ice and snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeanne opened the door. \u201cYour Ladyship.

I have been told a young soldier from Erlauf has been paying you a particular amount of attention,\u201d Lady Klara said.</p> <p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s nothing but a common squad soldier,\u201d Silla\u2014the oldest of Cinderella\u2019s two step-sisters\u2014sneered.</p><p>Mariska, the younger daughter and the kinder of the two, dropped the book of poetry she was reading on her sister\u2019s foot. \u201cI am sorry, Silla. Did that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou! Why do you protect her? She\u2019s nothing but a\u2014,\u201d Silla started.</p><p>Lady Klara shifted in her wooden arm chair, making it creak.</p><p>Both of her daughters fell silent.</p> <p>Lady Klara continued, \u201cI am aware you have turned seventeen, making you eligible for marriage. As a result, I caution you to be careful of whom you choose to associate with\u2014a lesson my daughter would be wise to learn as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Step-Mother,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI would not want you to bring shame upon your father\u2019s name, after all,\u201d Lady Klara smirked.</p><p>Cinderella dug her chipped fingernails into the palms of her hands. \u201cYes, Step-Mother,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cThat is all. Good night, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night Step-mother, Silla, Mariska,\u201d Cinderella said, curtseying before she rushed from the room. When she got outside of the poisonous room she leaned against the wall, her shoulders heaving with silent sobs.</p> <p>How dare she. How dare this Erlauf Widow who hated Papa stand there and use him to judge me!</p><p>\u201cI hate them,\u201d Cinderella whispered. \u201cI hate Erlauf.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella frowned as she wrestled thin willow branches into place, trying her hand at making a wicker basket. One of the maids left her with a sample basket and pattern as well as several started bases, but Cinderella\u2019s basket was lopsided, and the branch ends poked out like twigs in a bird\u2019s nest.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make it look like that, or is it supposed to resemble this one?\u201d the Colonel asked, holding up the sample basket.</p><p>Cinderella glared at the Colonel. \u201cDon\u2019t you have work to do?\u201d she asked, savagely stabbing the willow in the weaving pattern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made my afternoons clear for most of the week. More time to spend with you, Pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s endearing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s improper and implies a closer relationship than we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we fix that?\u201d the Colonel asked, sitting in the shade of the tent with Cinderella. They were positioned behind Aveyron\u2019s market stall, separated from the hustle and bustle by canvas drop cloths and tents.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps we should not,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Summer was starting to sweep through Erlauf and its colonies\u2014Trieux included. The temperatures were rising, and all of the spring flowers had bloomed.</p><p>Cinderella was grateful for the shade as she tried bending the willow branch and was whacked in the face for her efforts. \u201cIt is beyond me how a Colonel can find so much time to waste,\u201d Cinderella muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt is rare. You and I just happen to be lucky,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cI feel so blessed,\u201d Cinderella said through gritted teeth. The branch she tried to ease into place cracked. Cinderella plucked the branch out of the basket. \u201cBlast this thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you making baskets for?\u201d the Colonel asked, picking up one of the started bases.</p><p>\u201cWe use them in the market stand, and for collecting crops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why are you making baskets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is better to attempt to be useful than to sit around like a worthless ornament,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cIs that an implication to your resentment of the ban I have placed on your little historical tours?\u201d the Colonel asked, studying the basket pattern.</p><p>\u201cI would never say that, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friedrich,\u201d the Colonel said as he selected a willow branch and started weaving it around the base. \u201cAnd it\u2019s for your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have mentioned that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you still don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were growing tired of history,\u201d Cinderella said, rotating her lopsided basket.</p><p>\u201cI was, but my worry is legitimate. If someone makes another attempt against me they will aim to take you down as well,\u201d the Colonel said, comparing his weaving to the sample basket.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you helped me flee. They think you support me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is there to support? You were a target because you are a colonel in the Erlauf Army. We have nothing to do with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true,\u201d the Colonel said with a sly smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella tried to smooth the uneven lumps in her weaving. \u201cYes, it is,\u201d she firmly said.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t see it that way. As far as assassins are concerned, keeping them from their target is as good as throwing your lot in with their target. I am a soldier, but you are undefended. I worry about you,\u201d the Colonel said, leaning close enough to Cinderella so he could slide his hand under her chin.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your concern, but I assure it is not necessary,\u201d Cinderella said, inching away from the Colonel.</p><p>The Colonel grinned and returned to basket weaving.</p> <p>Several moments later, the curtain dividing the back of the tent from the front stand was thrown aside.</p><p>\u201cCinderella I heard about\u2014\u201d Marie cut herself off with a gasp. She stared at Cinderella and the Colonel, who were both sitting on the ground, surrounded by baskets. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said, snapping a fan open to fan herself.</p><p>Cinderella considered standing to introduce the Colonel before deciding it would give him too much worth. \u201cMarie, I present to you Colonel Friedrich of the First Regiment in the Dragon Army. Colonel Friedrich, this is Madame Marie Raffin, my dearest friend and long-time companion,\u201d Cinderella said, frowning when she realized the Colonel\u2019s basket was more even and round than hers.</p><p>The Colonel stood and set his basket aside to remove his army hat and give Marie a sweeping bow. \u201cThe pleasure is all mine,\u201d he said before taking his spot on the ground again.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Marie said, uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cMadame Raffin, your husband is a merchant, is he not?\u201d the Colonel asked, taking Cinderella\u2019s basket from her and passing her his.</p><p>Cinderella accepted the exchange and started weaving willow branches into his neater basket as the Colonel set about fixing hers.</p><p>\u201cHe is. His name is Armel Raffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have heard good things of your wares. How is business?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>\u201cWell enough,\u201d Marie said, brushing her fan through the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to convince Cinderella she needs to plant flowers,\u201d the Colonel said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Marie cautiously asked, as if the Colonel were a rabid bear.</p><p>\u201cCitizens of Erlauf are enthusiastic about nature, but we are especially amorous of flowers. One could make a fine profit on flowers in this area as it is an untapped market,\u201d the Colonel said, his eyebrows furrowing as he studied the basket pattern.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong season,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cFor spring flowers, yes. However, if you planted summer flowers now you would have enough time for them to grow, I should think,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cDo you want me to visit Aveyron to point out proper places to grow flowers? I\u2019ve been reading up on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, sir,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cFriedrich,\u201d the Colonel countered.</p><p>\u201cMarie, what brought you to Aveyron\u2019s stand?\u201d Cinderella asked, ignoring the Colonel\u2019s wriggling eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cThe usual. Werra gossip and such,\u201d Marie said.</p> <p>When it was obvious the Colonel\u2019s gaze was attached to his basket weaving, Marie flapped her fan and bugged her eyes at Cinderella before jabbing her fan at the Colonel.</p><p>Cinderella shrugged and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThe weather has been quite nice, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Marie hastily said when the Colonel glanced up.</p><p>\u201cIt has. I hope it is just as pleasant in Loire,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the Colonel blinked.</p><p>\u201cFor the royal wedding,\u201d Marie said. \u201cPrince Severin has married a merchant\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Severin? The cursed prince?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cYes. His bride broke the curse, I gather,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI imagine their wedding was lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if not slightly unusual,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is abnormal for a nobleman, much less royalty, in Loire to marry below their station,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve of the union?\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cI cannot fault the Prince or his lady love, or I would be a hypocrite. However, even I must admit it seems...unusual for the Prince of such a grand country to introduce merchant blood to the line,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>The Colonel shrugged. \u201cI forgot, you Trieux folk always modeled yourselves after Loire. It always seemed to me they put on airs. Besides, isn\u2019t Prince Severin illegitimate? For all we know his wife\u2019s blood could be better than his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich!\u201d Cinderella gasped.</p><p>The Colonel smiled in delight, softening the stark black of his eye patch. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was aware of her slip-up, but she was still aghast at his terrible manners. \u201cYou may have forgotten but Marie and I are still ladies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not worry about it. I will forgive you,\u201d the Colonel soothed.</p><p>\u201cYou are being indecent,\u201d Cinderella said, bending a willow branch in her anger.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. Strike the second part of my argument and allow me to amend it with this: isn\u2019t marrying the peasant class vogue right now? King Henrik of Arcainia just married a commoner not four weeks ago, or so,\u201d the Colonel said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Marie acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cAnd everyone knows Crown Prince Steffen of Arcainia married a commoner. Yes, she has the title of Marquise because she killed the ogre, or troll, or what-have-you who ruled the lands before her, but it wasn\u2019t inherited,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cYou are correct,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cBut you still don\u2019t approve?\u201d the Colonel said.</p> <p>Marie shrugged. \u201cTruly it is none of my affair. I will always advocate for lovers to follow their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Cinderella?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>Cinderella stared at the basket in her hands. The Colonel\u2019s beginner but well-constructed base was still intact, but the layers Cinderella added were lopsided and filled with holes. \u201cI think I have no talent for basket weaving.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel chuckled as he set his basket aside. \u201cYou\u2019ll get better. I\u2019m off. It was good to meet you, Marie Raffin,\u201d he said, standing and bowing to both ladies. \u201cUntil next time. Stay safe, Pet,\u201d he said, reaching out to brush Cinderella\u2019s cheek with his hand.</p><p>Cinderella leaned out of his range. \u201cGood day to you, sir.\u201d</p> <p>The Colonel smiled to Marie. \u201cShe plays hard to get, but she enjoys it,\u201d he said before ducking out of the tent to avoid the basket Cinderella threw at him.</p><p>\u201cThat man,\u201d Cinderella seethed.</p><p>Marie twitched the tent diver aside to watch him go. \u201cHe\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worse, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marie hesitated. \u201cI think he may be serious about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? If that was a joke, it wasn\u2019t very funny, Marie,\u201d Cinderella said, joining Marie to watch Friedrich disappear into the market. Even though he and Cinderella were on good terms, most of the market vendors treated Friedrich with suspicion, whispering behind his back and watching his movements with narrowed eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t jesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes no sense. Why would a colonel want a penniless Trieux noble\u2014the daughter of someone he hated? Besides, you saw him. He is a charmer and a player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marie said. \u201cBut how many charmers have you seen sit down and make baskets with those whose hearts they intend to play with?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella froze in the middle of stacking baskets.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201d Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think of him. He could never afford me,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. He may be rich,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows it is mostly the second and third sons of Erlauf nobility who become officers. He has a high social rank and pocket money enough to live comfortably, but he could not possibly supplement Aveyron\u2019s income,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he need to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean to say you would rather see me with that Erlauf rat than Julien or Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smiled. Your smile has been a rare thing these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a sarcastic smile! I find that man to be indecent and barely tolerable. I cannot believe you would even entertain the idea that he would seek to have my hand, and that I would rejoice over it!\u201d</p><p>Marie shrugged. \u201cPerhaps you are right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am right,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cBut if that is the case, if I were you, I would think about how one would decline the suit of such a high-ranking officer.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella looked her friend in the eye. \u201cHe isn\u2019t serious, Marie. I am a toy to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but it would be wise of you to prepare. Just in case,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>Cinderella mulishly tucked her chin to her neck, ready to argue her case. The fight deflated her, though, when she remembered the warnings from the market venders that she hadn\u2019t heeded. \u201cAlright,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cinderella said, puttering with the baskets.</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I am surprised. He seems much more likeable than I would have estimated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, likeable? He acts like a half-daft yokel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought his defense of Prince Severin and his bride was quite endearing,\u201d Marie said, her eyes on the ground.</p><p>Cinderella winced at her callous words. Of course Marie\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter but the wife of a merchant\u2014would be touched by his actions.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite honorable of him,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cNow, what really brought you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I wanted to talk to you about Colonel Friedrich. I did not think I would get the chance to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies for the experience.\u201d</p><p>Marie laughed. \u201cCinderella! At the very least, you must admit he makes a better basket than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the reminder. I shall have to keep that in mind if I ever decide to pursue the livelihood of basket weaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the report from General Harbach,\u201d Merrich said, entering Friedrich\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWhat report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one detailing the questioning of your would-be killers\u2014that delightful group of men you ran into with your trollish lady love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Friedrich ignored the taunt. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d Merrich said, tossing the report on Friedrich\u2019s desk before he sat down in an empty chair. \u201cYou were strategically targeted.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich snorted. \u201cThat is hardly a surprise,\u201d he said, paging through the report.</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s not the bad news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t Trieux rebels or advocates,\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cI should think not. Even Trieux citizens would not be so stupid as to murder me with Trieux weapons. It would start another wave of persecution and suspicion. Our government would crack down even harder on them,\u201d Friedrich said, propping his military boots up on a footstool.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you are taking this seriously enough,\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause if they weren\u2019t Trieux rebels, and no one from Erlauf would hurt a hair on your head, that means we have another enemy out there,\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cThe assailants were paid a private contract?\u201d Friedrich frowned, skimming the papers.</p><p>\u201cYes. They met with a handful of contacts in various countries before receiving you as their elimination assignment. It\u2019s all very cloak-and-dagger. What\u2019s most disconcerting is that they were officially hired and dispatched by a dark mage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne exiled by the Veneno Conclave, yes. Worst yet, she was only a representative. She didn\u2019t write the contract out of personal spite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom did she represent?\u201d</p> <p>Merrich shrugged. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know. All they said was that she hired them on behalf of an organization or movement of some sort.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich grimly leaned back in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cA month ago our southern border was plagued with wraiths. Last week, a company from the Fifth Regiment took out a giant, and now we hear my assassins were hired by a mage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much activity from dark magic to be a coincidence,\u201d Merrich said. \u201cWe used to get a handful of evil based entity fights per year. Now they happen almost weekly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet the parts of Erlauf that used to belong to Trieux remain unscathed,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cYou think Trieux is somehow involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think whoever or whatever is doing this is lulling them into a false sense of security. Our troubles are not widely publicized, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich tapped his fingers on his desk. \u201cI will speak to the Commander. Before we take any serious action, it would be wise to speak to representatives from the Veneno Conclave. We don\u2019t want to step on their toes, after all.\u201d</p> <p>Merrich nodded. \u201cI will tell Hardbutt.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich rolled his eyes. \u201cOne day General Harbach will catch you on that, and he will string you up by your tongue.\u201d</p><p>Merrich laughed. \u201cThank you for your concern, but you had best worry about your own neck first. Which reminds me, I saw Diederick earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said to tell you if you got yourself killed by assassins he would refuse to allocate funds for a gravestone or coffin.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich winced. \u201cSometimes I wonder how he obtained his high position with his terrible personality.\u201d</p><p>Merrich slapped his leg and stood. \u201cHe\u2019s good at what he does. But enough of our dreary discussion. Work calls, and I intend to go out tonight. Will you come with? Friedrich?\u201d Merrich asked when his friend didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just thinking,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich hesitated. \u201cI had decided to take additional precautions regarding Cinderella\u2019s safety, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough. I might need to place more soldiers on guard duty around her as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wise. You can bet whatever is behind this flux of darkness will aim for her now that you have made your infatuation with her infallibly clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she will warm to the idea of strange men following her around.\u201d</p><p>Merrich shrugged. \u201cSo introduce her to them. I\u2019m off.

It\u2019s earlier than I wanted them to know of her, but her safety...\u201d Friedrich trailed off. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he decided. \u201cIt will take some planning, but I will bring Cinderella to the First Regiment.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way to the library,\u201d Cinderella said as she followed the Colonel down a side street in Werra.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said we were going to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had an easier way to get into the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stopped walking and folded her arms across her chest.</p><p>When the Colonel realized she wasn\u2019t following him anymore, he stopped and retreated to her side. \u201cIt was the only way to get you to leave the stand.

Why would I want to meet them?\u201d</p><p>The Colonel smirked down at Cinderella. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going back,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI have a farming book.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stopped and turned around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my office I have a newly purchased book that details farming and growing techniques. If you come with me, I will give it to you,\u201d the Colonel said, adjusting the brim of his military hat.</p><p>Cinderella thought for several seconds. Books were expensive\u2014that was why she was reduced to breaking into the library. With a reference book, Cinderella might not need to perform that illegal activity so often, which would be a blessing. She suspected some of the patrol leaders deduced she was the culprit. Wherever she went, city patrols dogged her steps.</p> <p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Cinderella agreed.</p><p>The Colonel\u2019s smug smile said he knew she would agree to the bargain.</p><p>\u201cBut if you are taking me somewhere indecent to meet these chums of yours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to my regiment\u2019s camp. It will be perfectly safe, and your reputation will remain intact,\u201d the Colonel said once again leading the way.</p><p>The Colonel\u2019s camp was outside Werra, stationed on parkland previously owned by the Trieux King. What once was a party pavilion was now a mere field washed with burgundy and gray-colored tents.</p><p>A battalion of soldiers were practicing with their swords, while a company raced their horses farther out. Men swarmed in and out of the camp, going about their duties and preparing for patrols.</p> <p>As Cinderella and the Colonel entered the campgrounds, most of the soldiers stopped to gawk.</p><p>\u201cColonel, is this her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetite little thing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure she\u2019s Trieux? I never seen hair like that before.\u201d</p><p>Words became indistinguishable as men crowded around Cinderella and the Colonel. They saluted before speaking their mind, shouting to be heard over one another.</p><p>The Colonel ignored the buzz, and seized a soldier by his shoulder and dragged him out of the crush. \u201cIs Merrich here?\u201d the Colonel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir. Colonel Merrich was called to the palace this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d the Colonel said with a smile.</p> <p>Cinderella edged closer to the Colonel as soldiers jostled around her. They remained a respectful distance from her, but there were so many, and they were loud.</p><p>The Colonel put an arm around Cinderella\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMen, listen up. This is Duchess Lacreux of Aveyron. I want you to treat her with the respect and honor she\u2019s due.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella slithered out of the Colonel\u2019s arm, shocked when soldiers started whistling and cat calling.</p><p>\u201cThe Colonel\u2019s got a woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day the Colonel was tamed.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella looked at the Colonel, but he was smiling of all things, as if happy with the soldiers\u2019 observations.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Get back to work, you lazy slugs,\u201d the Colonel said after a few minutes of chatter.</p><p>The soldiers departed, gossiping and watching Cinderella and the Colonel with interest.</p><p>\u201cWho is Colonel Merrich?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cMy goat-footed best friend. You\u2019ll meet him, someday,\u201d the Colonel said, a pleased smile pasted on his lips as he looked out over his camp.</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a tour of the grounds?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella self-consciously smoothed her skirts. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we just go to your office?\u201d she asked. She had been so dazzled by the offer of the book she hadn\u2019t thought the situation through. She was marching into the enemy\u2019s camp. These men had killed Trieux soldiers, and under the orders of their queen and her consort, they had killed nobles, too.</p><p>The Colonel studied Cinderella before offering his arm\u2014for once acting like a gentleman. \u201cJust a stroll,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cinderella reluctantly placed her hand on his arm and allowed the Colonel to lead.</p><p>\u201cOur patrol squads leave from this part of the camp. You can see them getting ready for the changeover,\u201d the Colonel said as they neared a field where six organized patrol squads were lined up.</p><p>\u201cYou use dogs?\u201d Cinderella said, noting the presence of at least one black and brown canine with each squad.</p><p>\u201cThe dogs were recently put on patrol thanks to our scramble in the ruins. They are skilled at tracking and catching,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cGustav, Ivo.\u201d</p><p>Two men from two different squads jogged up to the Colonel. A dog trotted along with each man.</p><p>\u201cColonel,\u201d they said in a chorus, saluting him.</p><p>\u201cPlease introduce your fine companions to Lady Lacreux,\u201d the Colonel said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLady,\u201d both soldiers said, bobbing forward in bows.</p><p>\u201cThis here is Valor,\u201d one of the soldiers\u2014the younger one with mud-brown hair\u2014said, crouching next to his black and brown dog. The dog\u2019s triangular ears flicked when it heard its name. \u201cShe\u2019s been my partner for two years. She\u2019s got the heart of a lion and is a fine lady,\u201d he said, petting the dog.</p><p>The dog\u2019s tail thumped on the ground, and she looked up at the soldier with a dog smile before fixing her brown eyes on Cinderella. Her tail wagged more as she looked hopeful, her body quivering in her desire to be petted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a little young,\u201d her handler said.</p> <p>\u201cJust like you,\u201d the other soldier muttered.</p><p>The Colonel pet Valor, briefly inspecting her ears and teeth before running his hands down her body. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken good care of her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d the soldier saluted.</p><p>Valor, egged on by the Colonel\u2019s attention, went so far as to nudge Cinderella\u2019s hand. Cinderella stroked the dog\u2019s body. The large canine leaned into her, her curly tail flapping like crazy.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is your fine looking companion, Ivo?\u201d the Colonel asked, turning to the second soldier\u2014an older, grizzled man.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Mammoth,\u201d the soldier, Ivo, said.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had Mammoth?\u201d Cinderella asked, studying Ivo\u2019s large dog.</p><p>\u201cAlmost eight years, Your Ladyship,\u201d Ivo said, tipping the brim of his hat to Cinderella.</p><p>Mammoth was more controlled than Valor, and made a point to keep his attention hinged on Ivo\u2014as if disgusted by Valor\u2019s eagerness.</p><p>\u201cMammoth, greet the lady properly,\u201d Ivo said.</p><p>To Cinderella\u2019s surprise and delight Mammoth slid forward on his front paws, bowing to Cinderella.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a boy,\u201d Ivo gruffly said, placing his hand on Mammoth\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThank you, soldiers,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Sensing the dismissal, Gustav and Ivo saluted the Colonel, bowed to Cinderella, and headed back to their positions. Their dogs followed them, although Valor shook her tail at Cinderella a few times before she hurried after her handler.</p><p>Cinderella and the Colonel left the outpost and moved on to a wooden structure. Builders swarmed around it, climbing the roof and nailing shingles in place. \u201cThis is the mess hall, or what passes for one as they finish building it,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>The building held an assortment of empty tables, two masonry ovens, an earth oven, and a fleet of men and women.</p><p>The Colonel led Cinderella to swarming cooks and their hot ovens located in the back of the building. \u201cBerta is the lord and ruler of the kitchens. We\u2019re fed only because of her diligence. Berta, come meet my lady love, Lady Lacreux.\u201d</p><p>Berta\u2014a large, red-faced woman\u2014wiped her hands on her apron. \u201cSo you\u2019ve finally been bested, eh, Sir?\u201d the woman laughed. \u201cYou must be quite the woman to tangle with the Colonel. Welcome to the First Regiment,\u201d Berta said to Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said, aware of all the other cooks and kitchen help staring at her.</p> <p>Berta turned around and bellowed. \u201cWhat are you gawking at like a bunch of turkeys? Get back to cookin\u2019 \u2018n have the decency not to gossip of the Colonel\u2019s Woman in front of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Berta,\u201d the Colonel wryly said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a talkative lot, but they know the kitchens,\u201d Berta said. \u201cJust finished baking my famous molasses bread. Want a piece, Colonel?\u201d Berta asked, waddling over to a wooden table to hack at a dark brown loaf of bread without waiting for a reply. \u201cWhat about you, Lady? You\u2019re all skin and bones. You could use some fattening,\u201d she said, cutting a second piece.</p><p>She slathered both pieces with butter before presenting them to Cinderella and the Colonel.</p><p>\u201cThere. Don\u2019t that hit the spot?\u201d Berta asked.</p><p>Cinderella took a bite out of the bread. \u201cFantastic,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI would join the Army again just to eat your food, Berta,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Berta\u2019s ruddy face turned a darker shade of red. \u201cColonel,\u201d she said, sketching a tipsy curtsey.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get out of the way. Thank you, Berta,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>Berta dipped a second curtsey and waddled back to her minions. \u201cStoke the fire, and get those dishes washed!\u201d she roared as Cinderella and the Colonel left the mess hall.</p><p>The Colonel led Cinderella through the grounds, waving and acknowledging his men, who watched them with ill-disguised interest.</p><p>Cinderella was relieved when the Colonel led the way into a plain but solid building. \u201cThis is the regiment\u2019s headquarters. Any visiting colonels stay here, but it\u2019s mostly living quarters and offices for me, the general I serve, and the officers below us.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Cinderella said, following the Colonel through the building.</p><p>\u201cKurt! Kurt, where\u2014oh,\u201d the Colonel said when a huge, hulking soldier stepped out of the shadows in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ensign Kurt Werlauf.

I\u2019ll be along in a minute, although I shall miss you every second we are apart,\u201d the Colonel said, clasping Cinderella\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u201cI would have thought you wouldn\u2019t act so silly in front of your men,\u201d Cinderella said plucking her hands from the Colonel\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cWhere would be the fun in that, Pet?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella waggled her hand at him. \u201cBe gone. I want my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Dearest,\u201d the Colonel said before he headed up the hallway.</p><p>Ensign Kurt led Cinderella in the opposite direction, the wooden floor boards creaking under his massive girth. He stopped outside a wooden door and opened it, revealing Colonel Friedrich\u2019s office.</p> <p>It was stuffed with books, scrolls, maps, and papers. The walls were lined with bookshelves, a full scale model of Trieux and Erlauf was nestled into the window seat, and the fireplace was clean and empty.</p><p>Writing utensils, sticks of wax, and bottles of ink were everywhere. There were two chairs in the room besides the Colonel\u2019s stationed behind his desk, but they were the only bare surfaces in the room.</p><p>Ensign Kurt bowed to Cinderella before he stepped out of the office and shut the door behind him.</p><p>Cinderella approached the Colonel\u2019s desk with trepidation. \u201cHow am I supposed to find my book in this mess?\u201d Cinderella muttered.</p><p>There were army accounts, activity reports, and patrol timetables stacked together. Cinderella tried to turn a blind eye to them as she shifted papers. She finally found a book near the bottom of the paper mess. It was bound leather, dyed blue, and titled: The Growing and Harvesting of Flowers.</p><p>Cinderella wouldn\u2019t have thought it was her book, but there was a scrap of paper poking out of it that read \u201cCinderella.\u201d Plus, the Colonel was insistent she try growing flowers. It was no surprise he mislead her about the book\u2019s subject.</p> <p>\u201cStill, a book is a book. If it is useless I can sell it,\u201d Cinderella said, flipping through the volume before seating herself in one of the free chairs.</p><p>The book had helpful drawings of various flowers, gave detailed planting instructions, the desired conditions, the necessary types of soils, and more. Cinderella read enough to conclude she should hold onto it\u2014in case she did ever venture into the flower selling market\u2014before she realized she had been left alone for some time.</p><p>Cinderella opened the door, earning herself a nice view of Ensign Kurt\u2019s broad back. \u201cExcuse me, where is the Colonel?\u201d Cinderella asked when the ensign turned around.</p><p>Ensign Kurt blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cThe Colonel, Colonel Friedrich?\u201d Cinderella repeated.</p><p>Ensign Kurt bowed and started down the hallway. His great thudding steps made the floor shake.</p><p>Cinderella ducked back in the office. She plopped down in the chair and studied the office some more.</p><p>Judging by the building, it seemed the Colonel\u2019s regiment was settling in for the long haul. Like the Colonel\u2019s office, the building layout was simple, but comfortable. In the hallway, there were maps on the walls and rugs on the floors, and in the Colonel\u2019s office, the glass windows had storm shudders fastened to them.</p> <p>The Army was planning to stay in Werra. Probably permanently.</p><p>Cinderella wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it.</p><p>\u201cThinking of me?\u201d the Colonel said, stepping into his office.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cEnsign Kurt tells me you called me by my name,\u201d the Colonel said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cI called you Colonel Friedrich,\u201d Cinderella protested.</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before you cut the title,\u201d the Colonel said.</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d the Colonel asked as he opened his window\u2014the only real luxury of the room.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>The Colonel gestured outside, where a company of soldiers practiced mounted maneuvers. \u201cOf them. Of my men. Are they not what you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you think of the Erlauf Army, I can only guess you picture a mindless hoard of barbarians who kill and slaughter.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella tapped a foot on the floor. \u201cWas that why you paraded me through here? To show me they\u2019re still men? That they talk and laugh just like everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the Colonel said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella joined the Colonel at the window. Before meeting the Colonel, it was easy to paint a negative portrait of Erlauf soldiers...but somewhere between helping her break into the library and basket-weaving, Cinderella\u2019s view of the Colonel had altered.</p><p>Similarly, it would be easy to look at the soldiers and wonder how many Trieux men they had slain, but it was also easy to see how they were like any other human being.</p><p>\u201cNobody wins in war. At least, that was what my Father said,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d the Colonel said.</p> <p>Cinderella looked to the Colonel, surprised he should feel the same. Even Cinderella wasn\u2019t entirely sure what her Father meant by the phrase. The Colonel\u2019s voice was coated with something. Cinderella couldn\u2019t quite identify it, but it sounded like wistfulness. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean Trieux wasn\u2019t wronged in the takeover,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you are referring to the taxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe taxes, the slaughter, the exiles, the new laws. If you meant to show me your soldiers are human too, you have succeeded and softened me some. But you have done nothing to convince me your Erlauf Royalty are anything but brutes,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>The Colonel coughed. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said.</p><p>There were a few moments of awkward silence before Cinderella remembered herself. \u201cThank you for the book\u2014although the content was not what I thought it would be.\u201d</p> <p>The Colonel grinned. \u201cI managed to fool you, did I? You\u2019re welcome. I hope you can use it. I have something else for you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella blinked. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>The Colonel rolled his eye as he pulled something from a pocket in his jacket. \u201cIt is not a book or something for you to sell\u2014you are a merchant at heart, do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Cinderella asked, ignoring the teasing.</p><p>\u201cBefore I give it to you, you must promise you will wear it always.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella suspiciously eyed the Colonel. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is a necklace, a token of my affections,\u201d he said, ignoring Cinderella\u2019s huff of disbelief. \u201cYou must wear it, all the time. If you don\u2019t wear it around your neck, I want it tucked in your skirts or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich,\u201d Cinderella said, shocked by his words.</p><p>\u201cI am not joking, Cinderella. You must wear this,\u201d the Colonel said, his dark eye weighing on Cinderella like a draft horse stepping on a blade of grass.</p><p>Curious, Cinderella sighed. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel passed over the necklace, which was a simple design of a flying dragon hanging from a chain. The craftsmanship was splendid, but it did not look particularly costly. Perhaps it was a way his men could identify her? Cinderella wouldn\u2019t put it past the Colonel to soak the necklace in some sort of oil the patrol dogs could easily sniff out.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said, taking the necklace. \u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel watched her expectantly, and Cinderella hesitated. The dragon was clearly styled to resemble the royal Erlauf crest\u2014which was also a flying dragon. Hanging such a symbol from her neck felt almost traitorous.</p><p>Cinderella looked back at the Colonel. \u201cYou said I have to wear it?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>The corners of the Colonel\u2019s mouth briefly turned down. \u201cI thought you might balk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you find it unbearable, carrying it on your person will do well enough.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella studied the Colonel, who rewarded her with a wry smile.</p><p>Cinderella had saved his life, and the Colonel had very likely saved hers by taking down the assassin\u2014however little she liked to think of it.</p><p>Cinderella looked down at the dragon and briefly clenched it in her hand. Like it or not, he had become a strange sort of friend or companion, in spite of his heritage.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s so important to you...\u201d Cinderella trailed off as she fastened the necklace around her neck. It was long and dipped under her dress, hiding the dragon from eyesight.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Thank you,\u201d the Colonel said, his smile turning bright.</p><p>Cinderella fiddled with the necklace and her pricey book. \u201cI should go,\u201d she said, feeling awkward.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Colonel agreed.</p><p>Cinderella arched a scarlet-red eyebrow. \u201cSo eager to get rid of me? How unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. My General and Colonel Merrich-the-goat-foot will be back soon. I would rather avoid you meeting them right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel I will embarrass you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is quite the reverse. I fear they will embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cDarn it, now I\u2019ve intrigued you.

The Delattres recently sent her a dinner invitation for the following week. As these were advance invitations, it was likely to be a more formal event, and all remaining Trieux nobility were invited. Cinderella would have to make a greater effort to look presentable according to Trieux standards.</p><p>\u201cI think I will grow too hot in my winter dress, but my summer dress...,\u201d Cinderella trailed off and brushed the silk skirts. Both dresses were simple\u2014Cinderella sold her more lavish dresses out of practicality\u2014but Cinderella was reluctant to wear her remaining summer dress as it was the last gift she had received from her father.</p><p>Cinderella sighed and turned her back to the nearly empty wardrobe.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by three timid knocks on the door.</p> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne curtsied after she opened the door. \u201cThere is an Erlauf man here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn army officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A government official.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sucked a breath of air in and placed a hand on her stomach, as if to hold it in place. Erlauf officials were never a good thing. \u201cThank you, Jeanne. I will see him now. He is still in the main entrance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said, dread filling her as she made her way to the entrance.</p><p>What could they want? They publically post tax law changes. We paid last season\u2019s taxes. Did we not renew our stall license for the market stand? Cinderella\u2019s mind crawled with possible problems and worst-case scenarios. She was stiff with worry by the time she greeted the Erlauf Official.</p><p>\u201cI am Duchess Cinderella Lacreux. You asked to see me?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>The official raised his eyebrows at Cinderella\u2019s appearance\u2014shorn hair and servant-length skirts\u2014before he extended a stack of papers. \u201cI was sent by Queen Freja to address your unpaid fines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella said, plucking the papers from his grasp.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the war, Aveyron failed to pay several of the landholding fines. As half of them were paid off, the Crown assumed the rest would be forthcoming, but was never compensated. The interest has accrued quite steeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I was never told of landholding fines,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cIt was a one-time amount placed on nobles newly adopted into Erlauf,\u201d the official said.</p><p>That\u2019s a fancy way of saying only Trieux nobles had to pay this, Cinderella thought.</p><p>\u201cBut I never heard of this, I never received any notice of it, nor of the compounding interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the Lord of Aveyron at the time of the fine was Eugene Lacreux. It was his failure to pay off all the fees, but as you inherited his estate, you inherited his debt as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father knew about this?\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>The official indicated the papers Cinderella held.</p> <p>Cinderella flipped through them, taking note of the dates and the signatures. Her Father\u2019s signature was scrawled on some of the paperwork, indicating he acknowledged the fine. The dates all matched up\u2014the fines were from when her Father still breathed.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he just pay them?</p><p>\u201cWhat is the total?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>The Erlauf official took the papers from Cinderella and flipped through them. He pointed to a figure on the second to last page.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cThis cannot be right. That\u2019s half the yearly income Aveyron makes before taxes and expenses are calculated. We cannot pay this on top of our usual tax burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you be unable to pay the fine, the Crown will seize Aveyron itself as payment.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella gaped in shock.</p><p>\u201cThe Crown expects the majority of the debt to be paid off by the end of summer. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat concludes our business. Good afternoon, Lady Lacreux,\u201d the official said. He bowed at the waist and left the chateau.</p><p>Alone, Cinderella sank to her knees.</p><p>This was it. She was going to lose Aveyron, and fail in her duty to Aveyron\u2019s servants and tenants. There was no way Cinderella could pay off the debt. She could have limped by, paying off the initial fine, but the debt had accrued so much the number was a mountain she couldn\u2019t overcome.</p><p>What was Father thinking? Cinderella wondered. What do I do? What do I tell everyone?</p><p>\u201cCinderella? I hope you have a reason for slumping on the filthy floor like a common beggar,\u201d an icy cold voice said. It was Lady Klara.</p><p>Cinderella opened her mouth several times before she was able to speak. \u201cGood afternoon, Step-Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the official want?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella plucked the paper out of the packet that detailed the fines and interest due. She handed it up to her Step-mother, too weak to stand.</p><p>Lady Klara took it and started reading.</p><p>A sliver of hope resonated in Cinderella. Perhaps her Step-Mother would finally be moved to financially help Aveyron?</p><p>\u201cYou will marry and sell Aveyron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella said, her lips stiff.</p><p>\u201cYour only other option is to entirely lose Aveyron. At least with marriage you will not find yourself penniless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hopes crushed, Cinderella stared at the ground, her hands clamped into fists.</p><p>\u201cIt does not matter to me what you choose to do.

She flung them across the room before she slumped forward and pounded the floor with her fists.</p><p>This was it. After everything she had done, she would still lose Aveyron.</p><p>This was the end.</p><p>\u201cYou look terrible.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella closed her eyes. She couldn\u2019t deal with him right now. \u201cGo away, Friedrich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no. You just used my name. This calls for a celebration,\u201d the Colonel said, plopping down in the dirt next to Cinderella.</p><p>Cinderella was huddled against a fountain in the public gardens. It was early in the day, so the gardens were empty, but there were still patrolling soldiers around to ignore Cinderella\u2019s tears and keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d Cinderella asked, covering her swollen, red-rimmed eyes with her hands.</p><p>\u201cSeveral soldiers reported to me that my darling Pet was sobbing her eyes out in the gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you stop with the jokes? You might be enjoying yourself, but this isn\u2019t funny. If you\u2019re just going to call me silly names would you please leave?\u201d</p><p>The Colonel peeled Cinderella\u2019s hands away from her eyes. \u201cCinderella, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked in a gentle voice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost,\u201d Cinderella said in a broken whisper. \u201cAveyron is as good as gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were fines. I didn\u2019t know about them. They were from directly after the takeover, when my father still...They\u2019re so big now I cannot possibly pay them as well as taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you sell any land, or layoff servants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI cannot let any of the staff members go, and the only reason Aveyron survives as it has is because of all the farm land and grazing land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you lose Aveyron, all of your servants will be lost as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAveyron isn\u2019t what\u2019s important. It\u2019s the servants. Choosing whom to abandon and let go\u2014I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what will you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEither I lose Aveyron to the crown at the end of this summer, or I sell it. Unless I want to be penniless and homeless, I will have to marry,\u201d Cinderella said, tipping her head back to stare at the blue sky. It seemed wrong that the weather could be so delightful as Cinderella\u2019s world fell apart.</p><p>\u201cSo marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Friedrich repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou must be out of your mind,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could possibly move you to want to marry someone from Trieux?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHAH!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you jaded,\u201d Friedrich said, adjusting his black patch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in love with me. You aren\u2019t even hurt by my refusal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very hurt. Deep inside my heart is crying,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella snorted.</p><p>\u201cAnd although you might fight it, you\u2019re considered an Erlauf citizen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does nothing to change my situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know; I just wanted to be sure you knew. But you\u2019ve gotten me off track. Cinderella Lacreux, please marry me,\u201d Friedrich said. He picked up one of Cinderella\u2019s hands and grazed her knuckles with his lips.</p><p>\u201cFriedrich, I\u2019m going to have a mountain of debt on me. You could not possibly pay it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I can\u2019t pay it off, but I have other resources,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella shook her head. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. Unless you can afford to pay this amount as a bride price, my answer is no.\u201d Cinderella said, digging the crumpled paper that listed the amounts Aveyron owed out of her apron pocket.</p><p>Friedrich smoothed the paper and whistled. \u201cI hope your servants are worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. If I get this amount and present it to you, you\u2019ll marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have it before the summer is over, yes,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Can I keep this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want,\u201d Cinderella said, massaging her temples.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, I have something that might bring you a smile,\u201d Friedrich said, shifting so he could unhook a pouch from his belt.</p><p>\u201cI cannot possibly take another gift. You\u2019ve already given me more than I can repay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen consider it not a gift, but a reward for wearing the necklace,\u201d Friedrich said, nodding at the bit of chain that was visible on the back of Cinderella\u2019s neck before he passed the pouch over.</p><p>She opened the bag and peered inside. \u201cSeeds?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlower seeds.\u201d</p><p>On a normal day, Cinderella would hate Friedrich for once again being so free and careless with great amounts of money\u2014signifying his financial wealth, or at the very least independence\u2014but instead Cinderella eyed the seeds with new appreciation. Planting flowers might be grasping at straws, but it was better than waiting for the inevitable. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSun Skips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of them,\u201d Cinderella said, swiveling to look in the direction of the library.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the book I gave you, you criminally-minded mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cThis looks like a lot of seeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough for a field. They\u2019re blasted costly to purchase, so I suggest you save the seeds from your flowers when they die. You could plant some next year and sell the rest,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re \u2018blasted costly\u2019 how did you get them?\u201d Cinderella asked, eyeing Friedrich.</p><p>\u201cThrough legal methods. It\u2019s not like you are in a position to look down on me, Lady Break-and-Enter,\u201d Friedrich said, tweaking the tip of Cinderella\u2019s button nose.</p> <p>Cinderella laughed. \u201cThank you, Friedrich,\u201d she said, grateful to be amused even as her world fell apart.</p><p>\u201cFor marrying you?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella rolled her eyes. \u201cFor the seeds. For coming,\u201d she said before she stood up and dusted off her dress. She held the pouch of seeds up to the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to give up hope. I forgot that. Thank you,\u201d she said, smiling down at the officer.</p><p>Friedrich tilted his head. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll forgive our lovely queen, her wonderful husband, and her charming sons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Cinderella sourly said.</p><p>\u201cI thought as much, but it was worth a try,\u201d Friedrich said as he, too, stood.</p> <p>He leaned closer and closer to Cinderella, lowering his face towards hers. When he was a hand\u2019s width away, Cinderella asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, Cinderella had both her hands clamped over his lips. \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich sighed, his breath warm against Cinderella\u2019s hands. \u201cWhy not? Don\u2019t I deserve it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing is not a matter of deserving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is an easy way to express affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known you would scorn the easy way. You enjoy making things difficult. What\u2019s so bad about the easy way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI find it unimaginative, not to mention disloyal to my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whom my husband will be until the proposal is accepted and the wedding date is picked. A million things could happen before the offer. It has been expected of me to marry Julien Rosseux since my father died. My body is the one thing I truly have to barter with now that Aveyron is swimming in debt. I suspect I\u2019m worth more as long as I remain untouched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it. If I were to marry you, how would you feel knowing I kissed Julien a great deal?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich was silent.</p><p>\u201cAnd there you have it. Physical affection, for me, is a matter of loyalty and wealth. I will fight for my future, even if I don\u2019t know whom it involves,\u201d Cinderella said, clasping her hands behind her back before she started walking.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I feel better, I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich muttered about headstrong females as he squinted up at the sun.</p><p>\u201cFriedrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said. She smiled, a gesture that transformed her already pretty features into a vision of gentleness and beauty. \u201cThank you for coming, and thank you for cheering me up.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich dumbly nodded \u201cUntil tomorrow,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow, my love!\u201d Friedrich called.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be ashamed of myself,\u201d Friedrich shouted as Cinderella left the gardens, a smile on her face and a spring in her steps.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Cinderella was the last to arrive to the Delattres\u2019 dinner party. She wore her beloved summer dress\u2014a creation of lavender silk that brought out the stark gray of her eyes and the vivid red hue of her hair.</p><p>It was a day costume, so Cinderella was woefully underdressed, but at least she was more presentable than usual. She even had a clean, black shawl she wore for the walk to the manor. As she handed it off to a servant, someone called out for her.</p><p>\u201cCinderella!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d Cinderella said with a smile. \u201cMy, you\u2019ve grown taller since we last met.\u201d</p><p>Marcus was all laughter and smiles. \u201cI\u2019m taller than Mama, and I\u2019m nearly taller than you too, I think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think so as well,\u201d Cinderella said, slowly walking in the direction of the sitting room. \u201cDid only you accompany your parents, or are your little brother and sister present as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me. The littles wanted to come, but Father said they\u2019re too young.\u201d Marcus said before remembered himself and offered his arm to Cinderella, which she took. \u201cEveryone else is already here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Feautres, the Leroys, and the Rosseuxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich of their children did they bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Leroys arrived with one of their sons and daughters-in-law. No grandchildren, blessings be said and repeated,\u201d Marcus said, wiping his forehead with great exaggeration. \u201cThe Rosseuxes brought Julien, of course, but not Cerise, which is a shame. She has this ear-piercing whistle she said she would teach me\u2014ah,\u201d Marcus broke off and cleared his throat. \u201cThe Feautres arrived shortly after we did. Their daughters are with them,\u201d Marcus scowled.</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d Cinderella asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, just the two oldest,\u201d Marcus said, his scowl deepening as they stood just outside the salon.</p><p>Cinderella smiled fondly at the young nobleman. He was doing his best to act mature for her sake, but he was barely fourteen, and as squirrely as a puppy. Cinderella patted Marcus\u2019 arm. \u201cYou are spending the night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have time, tomorrow please stop by Aveyron,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Marcus dropped his young enthusiasm. \u201cOh?\u201d he said.</p><p>Amused, Cinderella inclined her head to the younger boy. \u201cOne of the sheep dogs had a litter of puppies four weeks ago. I thought you might enjoy playing with them while your parents have tea or refreshments with the Delattres. I will not likely be around to show you the puppies, but any of Aveyron\u2019s staff members can direct you to them.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was rewarded with a brilliant smile from Marcus. He kept it intact as they entered the salon, still arm in arm.</p><p>Their entrance did not go unnoticed. Julien Rosseux stood and bowed to Cinderella, his eyes flicking between her and Marcus.</p> <p>Lady Leroy said with loud horror, \u201cLady Lacreux, what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>As Marcus hadn\u2019t said anything, or even seemed to notice, Cinderella hoped her short hair would pass the observation of the nobles who hadn\u2019t yet seen it. Apparently she was too optimistic. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYour hair,\u201d Lady Leroy said, aghast.</p><p>Lord Leroy held up a pair of eyeglasses to his eyes. \u201cEh?\u201d he said.</p><p>Cinderella ruefully ran a hand through her shorter locks. \u201cAh, yes. I had it cut,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cShorn is closer to the truth,\u201d Lady Feautre said, her voice tight and hateful.</p><p>\u201cI think its jolly,\u201d Marcus said, impudent and quick to defend Cinderella. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how hot you ladies are in the summer with the sun and heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d Lady Girard warned.</p> <p>Marcus grunted in impatience, but bowed to Cinderella before he left her to stand beside his mother at the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cIt is a cut unfit for a lady of nobility,\u201d Lady Feautre said.</p><p>\u201cIt is quite unseemly,\u201d Rosette, the Feautres\u2019 second daughter, said. She widened her china doll blue eyes as she stared at Cinderella. She sat with her sister, Violette, on a settee.</p><p>Violette was kinder than her mother and her sister, but she was a mousy, quiet thing. She gave Cinderella a scared look but said not a word.</p><p>\u201cNow, now. Let us not be unkind to Lady Lacreux,\u201d Lady Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cIt is not unkind to note what she takes no pains to hide,\u201d Lady Feautre said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lord Leroy loudly asked, his gray mustache quivering as he leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cCinderella has cut her hair,\u201d Lady Leroy shouted into her husband\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Lady Lacreux does have bright red hair,\u201d Lord Leroy nodded.</p><p>\u201cShameful,\u201d Lady Feautre murmured.</p><p>\u201cLady Lacreux looks divine no matter the state of her hair,\u201d Julien said, bowing over Cinderella\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Julien,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Lady Feautre rolled her eyes and huffed.</p><p>\u201cNow that we have all arrived, shall we proceed with dinner?\u201d Lord Delattre said, diverting the topic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Lord Rosseux muttered.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit where your name card has been placed,\u201d Lady Delattre said as she took her husband\u2019s arm and led the way to the dining hall.</p><p>Julien accompanied Cinderella.

She is a miser who will not overlook her grudge against us,\u201d Lord Rosseux snorted.</p><p>\u201cShe cannot hope to tax us much more,\u201d Lady Delattre said.</p> <p>\u201cNever underestimate the greed of Erlauf,\u201d Lord Rosseux said as servants placed trays of food on the table.</p><p>\u201cI was told a delegate from the Veneno Conclave will meet with their majesties over the summer. Perhaps they mean to discuss Erlauf\u2019s conduct?\u201d Lady Girard said.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Lord Leroy\u2019s son said. \u201cThe Veneno Conclave takes great pains to stay out of government and country debates, lest they be accused of siding with someone or using magic to aid one country over another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we were smart, we would have bought an estate in Loire the moment Erlauf camped in Werra,\u201d Lord Girard said.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I leave my country and my land because of some Erlauf upstart?\u201d Lord Rosseux asked.</p><p>\u201cErlauf has more military power than Trieux could ever hope to muster,\u201d Lord Delattre said. \u201cThat was why we six, now five I suppose, voted as we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so. Which is why it would have been best to flee Erlauf\u2019s grasp altogether. They wouldn\u2019t dare bother us in Loire\u2019s borders. Loire is still the biggest, most influential country,\u201d Lord Girard said.</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Lady Leroy said.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Julien said. \u201cBut they lost some of their opulence when they bowed to Arcainia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoire, bow to Arcainia? That peasant-infested place? Pah,\u201d Lord Rosseux said. \u201cWhat nonsense have you been filling your mind with, boy?\u201d</p><p>Julien slumped under his father\u2019s criticism, but said, \u201cThey had proof the princes of Arcainia dispatched Verglas assassins to kill His Highness Prince Severin. Instead of taking action, they solidified ties with Arcainia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is true; you cannot deny the nearly perfect Loire lost some of its splendor through that trial,\u201d Lord Leroy\u2019s son said.</p><p>\u201cRumor has it, Arcainia has an edge in the global marketplace on exports and agriculture ventures,\u201d Lord Girard said.</p><p>\u201cFarming! Such things are for the common class to worry over, not nobility,\u201d Lady Feautre said. \u201cAs members of the peerage, we should be more concerned with preserving our bloodlines, lest the Erlauf commoners try to take our daughters, too,\u201d she said, casting a look at Violette and Rosette.</p><p>\u201cDo not worry about us, Mama. We know better than to associate with that kind,\u201d Rosette said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I raised you to be above that,\u201d Lady Feautre said. \u201cBut it is not just my girls I worry for.

Unknowingly so, I suppose,\u201d Lady Feautre said.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Lord Leroy said.</p><p>\u201cLady Lacreux is engaging the enemy,\u201d Lady Leroy told her husband.</p> <p>\u201cYou must have misheard, Lady Feautre.

They would imagine us to be an easy bunch who will associate with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must do something, Lady Lacreux,\u201d Lady Leroy urged. \u201cYou have your title and family name to think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be already in disrepair from your actions, but you should at least salvage your reputation, for the sake of whatever family you marry into,\u201d Lady Feautre said, her jealousy showing as she stared hard at Julien and Marcus sitting on either side of Cinderella before looking to her girls. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Lady Rosseux?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the quiet lady murmured.</p><p>Angered that her fellow nobles, her allies, would set her out like this and judge her, Cinderella narrowed her eyes in a show of resentment \u201cIf you must know the reason for Colonel Friedrich\u2019s visits, it is because I was caught up in an assassination attempt and nearly killed,\u201d she said. There was no need to tell them the assassination was meant for Friedrich. It would get them railing against her again. \u201cHe visits out of concern for my welfare. I find the gesture to be noble, especially when one takes our differences into consideration. Furthermore, you have no right to judge my interactions with the Colonel. While he does not always act as a gentleman, he has consistently treated me with respect and bows to my wishes and sense of decorum\u2014something I cannot say for everyone present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Lady Leroy huffed.</p><p>\u201cA weather mage stopped through Werra, not four days ago. I spoke with him, and he thought the summer would be balmy but wet,\u201d Lord Delattre said, trying to change the topic.</p><p>\u201cOh? Isn\u2019t that weather good for crops?\u201d Lord Girard said, eagerly grasping the new topic.</p><p>Lady Feautre, however, wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cThis is what happens when one lets young children run amok with no chaperone: moral ruin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Feautre!\u201d Lady Delattre said.</p><p>Several other dinner guests started to correct Lady Feautre, but Cinderella had enough.</p><p>Cinderella set her wine glass down and stood. Her eyes flashed as she pushed her chair back. \u201cLady Feautre, Countess of Eveloy. When you become of such an elevated title that you may question me, Duchess of Aveyron, I will listen to you. Until that day comes, I suggest you bite your tongue. I will forget your ill-bred remarks against myself and Colonel Friedrich if you apologize this instant. If you do not, I shall pay a visit to the courts of peerage tomorrow and lodge a complaint.\u201d</p><p>The dinner party froze, as if put under a spell. Since Erlauf took Trieux over, the remaining Trieux nobles united\u2014associating with each other in spite of the difference in rank. It was rarely brought up that as the only remaining Duchess of Trieux, Cinderella held more power than all of those in the room.</p><p>Rank had not been pulled since Trieux became Erlauf, although the option was still available. As a Duchess\u2014even a penniless one\u2014Cinderella would absolutely win the complaint. (Not everything had changed with Erlauf, after all.) The silence of the room was broken when Lord Girard nudged his son, causing Marcus to rocket up into a standing position.</p><p>\u201cThe Girards will stand witness,\u201d he said, earning an approving nod from his parents.</p><p>\u201cAs will the Rosseuxes,\u201d Julien said, glancing at his parents as he also stood.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for my ill-timed words,\u201d Lady Feautre stiffly said.</p> <p>\u201cI will forgive you for your poor conduct in voicing the worst of your thoughts,\u201d Cinderella said before she sat.</p><p>Julien and Marcus mimicked her, both uncomfortable with the power Cinderella\u2014heiress and titled\u2014wielded.</p><p>\u201cSo this weather mage. What was his name?\u201d Lord Girard asked.</p><p>\u201cI did not have the chance to ask. He was in quite a hurry to pay homage to an enchantress\u2014a full-ranked Enchantress, not a specialized one\u2014who recently arrived in Trieux, that is to say, Erlauf,\u201d Lord Delattre said.</p><p>\u201cAn enchantress, you say?\u201d Lord Leroy\u2019s son said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella relaxed as conversation resumed around her. She was about to start eating again when Marcus whispered to her, \u201cWell done, \u2018Rella.

She went to the market with Vitore, but her sour mood scared off three customers before Vitore sent her out back behind the tent to restock baskets with produce.</p><p>When potatoes persisted in rolling out of a misshaped basket\u2014one she had made\u2014Cinderella lost her temper and threw the empty basket.</p><p>It rolled a few paces before falling at a pair of Erlauf army boots. \u201cWhy is it that the past few times I have seen you, you are in the process of an emotional outburst?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sighed. \u201cHello, Friedrich.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich snatched the basket up before joining Cinderella with her produce. \u201cIt is too hot for such anger. What is wrong?\u201d He asked as he briefly removed his hat from his head to wave it in front of his face.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cIt is nothing.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich replaced his hat. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is only...It\u2019s just...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night I dined with the remaining Trieux nobles, and...they talked about us.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich handed the basket back to Cinderella. \u201cSo you want me to stop hanging about you, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! I\u2019m just so angry at what they implied,\u201d Cinderella said, the basket creaking ominously in her hands as she clenched it.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they imply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are a dishonorable knave who hangs about me and salivates like an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they say nothing of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, they said my conduct was reprehensible. But what makes me so angry is that they would say such judgmental, ill-mannered things when they don\u2019t even know you!\u201d</p><p>Friedrich slid out of his Erlauf burgundy army jacket. \u201cI\u2019m from Erlauf. They don\u2019t have to know me to judge me. Or so they would think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could they dare to say such, such foolish lies about you and imply that I am morally ruined for speaking to you?\u201d Cinderella spat.</p><p>Friedrich did not respond and looked out at the bustling back street.</p><p>\u201c...Have your friends said the same sort of things about me to you?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cHm? Not quite. They know I wouldn\u2019t madly throw myself at just any girl,\u201d he said, brushing the fringe of Cinderella\u2019s bangs.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t think less of you for befriending a Trieux lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. They tease me a bit, mostly because they haven\u2019t seen you yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would there be such a stark difference between our treatment? One would think you would have it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re from Erlauf! You took over Trieux. Wouldn\u2019t they look down on you for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s prejudice if I ever heard it,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t escaped me that in spite of our close relationship,\u201d Friedrich said, attempting to lean forward and kiss Cinderella on the forehead.

We both know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said this was important.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cBecause we are the only six families that voted against invading Erlauf in a meeting of the House of Lords. Because of the landslide positive vote, our King approved the petition, and the attack went forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the which you were slaughtered against our military might. We turned the tables and instead invaded and conquered Trieux. Poetic justice, one might say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to sound so gleeful about it,\u201d Cinderella said, dusting off her dress.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t done yet.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella placed her hands on her hips. \u201cWhat more do you want me to say? That Trieux is responsible for the slaughter of your soldiers and the draining of your coffers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you so loyal to your servants? Most Trieux families treat servants like pieces of furniture. No one else is so blasted stubborn in holding on to them. Before the war, you likely saw them as pieces of baggage as well. Why will you not let them go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was the Aveyron servants who risked their lives to speak up for my father and me in an Erlauf court of justice. They were the ones who told that ice-cold queen of yours that Father voted against the war. There, are you satisfied?\u201d Cinderella said, turning her back to the Colonel.</p><p>Friedrich placed his hands on Cinderella\u2019s shoulders as she transferred onions from a crate to a basket. \u201cIt does not give me joy to make you say this. I just want you to admit Trieux is not the wounded lamb you want it to be.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s motions slowed. \u201cI know we were wrong. Father said we were fools for thinking we could take Erlauf on, and our government and nobles were too greedy to see that. But...\u201d Cinderella turned around. \u201cHaven\u2019t we been punished enough? Haven\u2019t we paid enough, sweated enough, to make up for that? Must my children and my children\u2019s children mortgage their futures for the sake of one foolish generation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have, and soon, I hope, your trials will end. The Crown Prince knows the country he will inherit is not united, but terribly divided. He will have to reckon Trieux to Erlauf for it to be a solid kingdom. Our children will not have to go through what you have gone through. The Erlauf Royal Family will see to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no confidence in your royalty. And our children? We are not married,\u201d Cinderella said, ducking out from under Friedrich\u2019s hands.</p> <p>Friedrich ignored the nay-say. \u201cYou will have to forgive them, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Erlauf Royal Family. They are not doing this to be cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will admit Trieux marched to their doom, but you forget: I am the daughter of a man who was forced to marry an Erlauf widow against his will, a woman I still house and feed. I have sold almost every personal possession I own and almost every decorative piece in Aveyron to pay your Erlauf Royal Family\u2019s taxes. I very much doubt they are doing this as a kindness.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich sighed. \u201cI suppose your recognition of Trieux\u2019s actions is the most I could hope for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Cinderella said, turning around to face him again. \u201cYou have some admitting to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more is there to admit? I agree the taxes are heavy and that the Crown Prince will have to do something about that,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but that isn\u2019t all. Trieux was wrong and terribly foolish, but the grip Queen Freja has over the country isn\u2019t healthy,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen Freja acts more like a tyrant than a monarch, and for once I am not referring to the taxes.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich frowned.</p><p>\u201cHear me out. She has absolute control, and no one holds her accountable. In Trieux, each noble family had a vote in the House of Lords. The King still had the ultimate power, but he often leaned on the House to make decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say Queen Freja should add a group of law-makers to our government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cThe side-effect of having the House of Lords is everyone knew the government\u2019s business. Nothing was hidden\u2014it\u2019s how Aveyron\u2019s servants knew of Father\u2019s vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what has that to do with Queen Freja?\u201d Friedrich asked.</p><p>\u201cThe reason Trieux citizens treat her with suspicion is because we cannot trust her. If she explained why the random searches and increased patrols are necessary, or if she had a reason for taxing us to poverty, we could better accept it. We would still hate her, but I do not think the tensions between our countries would be quite so...overwhelming,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich blinked. \u201cYou want her to explain herself?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.

That is most assuredly not the way of Trieux.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich shifted. \u201cIn the Army, I give orders and expect my men to follow them...but usually an explanation accompanies the orders. It would be dangerous to send ignorant soldiers into combat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Cinderella triumphantly said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are right,\u201d Friedrich said, looking uncomfortable. \u201cFrom a logical standpoint, I can see why it would assure you of Trieux to hear of the queen\u2019s doings. As an Erlauf citizen, though, I do not think it would be easy to change that aspect of the Erlauf monarchy. It is ingrained in our culture that we must trust our monarch implicitly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen our best hope is the Crown Prince,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cIf he is as aware of the strife as you say he is, he might be more accepting of change.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich cleared his throat. \u201cI think a great deal of it will also rest in whomever he marries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps...,\u201d Cinderella said, considering the thought.</p><p>Friedrich was quiet for a few moments. \u201cDid you plant the flowers?\u201d he asked changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cThe day after you gave me the seeds. They have already begun sprouting,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cAlready? It has been barely two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe book you gave me mentioned they have a short growing period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I expect you will be able to turn a profit more swiftly than originally estimated?\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Thank you again for the seeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour desires are my goals, Pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you call me that?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course; it is endearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not. It is, ugh. How would you feel if I called you...Scamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonored.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...Fred?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich pulled back, as if Cinderella had backhanded him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cinderella smiled and rubbed her hands in delight. \u201cWhy not? Fred is a respectable name.\u201d</p> <p>Friedrich winced. \u201cWords cannot describe how much I dislike that particular shortening of my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least you will know how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinderella,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I think I\u2019m hysterical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilljoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems General Hardbutt intends to keep the Second Regiment at Werra,\u201d Merrich said, sipping his pint of ale.</p><p>\u201cI believe it is in preparation of Queen Freja\u2019s departure at the end of the year,\u201d Diederick, a friend of Friedrich\u2019s and a government official, said. \u201cThe country is stable, but if she intends to tour the lands, the Third Regiment will accompany her,\u201d he said, swirling his mug.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Commander,\u201d Merrich added.</p><p>Diederick nodded. \u201cAnd the Commander,\u201d he echoed. \u201cTheir absence will make things... interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a rebellion is very likely,\u201d Merrich said. \u201cThe taxes are stiff, yes, but the commoners don\u2019t seem to mind them too much, and there\u2019s hardly anyone left to lead them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe remaining Trieux nobles are too aware of the precarious situation they are in. No, my friend, Trieux is definitely a part of Erlauf. At least on paper. The peoples\u2019 hearts and loyalties don\u2019t belong to Erlauf, but that is not something I am not responsible for,\u201d Diederick said.</p><p>Merrich laughed and leaned back in his chair. \u201cDo you hear that, Friedrich? Friedrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called me Fred,\u201d Friedrich said, scowling into his pint.</p><p>Merrich laughed again and pounded his hand on the table at which they sat.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Diederick asked, adjusting his wire-rimmed eyeglasses.</p><p>\u201cHis Trieux misses,\u201d Merrich grinned. \u201cLady Lacreux. She has the looks of the troll, but she sounds like barrels of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lacreux? She does not look\u2014,\u201d Diederick started. He quieted when Friedrich kicked him under the table. \u201cSo that is whom you have chosen? She has a fiery temper, I\u2019ve been told. Are you certain you have not bitten off more than you can chew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one for me,\u201d Friedrich said, lazily balancing his chair on the back two legs.</p><p>He and his friends were seated outdoors in front of a tavern where they could watch commoners\u2014Trieux and Erlauf alike\u2014hurry on their way, call out their wares, and gossip and laugh in the open.</p><p>Diederick shrugged. \u201cPersonally speaking, it makes very little difference to me whom you marry. You will be the one to live with her. You think she is a good choice in every way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer servants would die for her\u2014although I doubt she knows. They handle her with kid gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA footman popped one of my soldiers in the head when I sent him to check in on her. The footman thought he was spying on her. The butler nearly busted my man before I could send word,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cShe is a good choice. Her blood and heritage will bring legitimacy to your position\u2014but do you think she\u2019ll actually say yes?\u201d Diederick asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on her,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cShe\u2019s softening to Erlauf.

The Great Erlauf architect Filibert Frejem designed it over a hundred years ago with the purpose of stimulating commerce. He made revolutionary changes that allowed for shops to be placed close together, with limited fire hazards.\u201d</p> <p>There was no mistaking that mop of red hair. And even though she was mostly blocked by a group of Erlauf soldiers, Friedrich could never forget the white flag she waggled above her head.</p><p>It was Cinderella.</p><p>All the soldiers with her were from the First Regiment. Friedrich thought he saw Ivo and Kurt among the crowd, perhaps even Gustav.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just?\u201d Merrich prompted.</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Diederick turned in his chair to see what Friedrich stared at. \u201cOh, is that\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you will excuse me, gentlemen, I must leave for a moment. I will return for more drinks, you can be sure,\u201d Friedrich said, standing up so quickly his chair was thrown to the ground. \u201cKeep him here,\u201d Friedrich said to Diederick as Merrich righted the chair.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Diederick said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d Friedrich said, slapping him on the back before he hurried after Cinderella and his men.</p><p>He caught up with them when they made a turn, heading towards the Trieux Royal Library.</p><p>\u201cDown this road we have\u2014,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a sight,\u201d Friedrich said, darting in front of them. \u201cMy Lady Love and my underlings,\u201d he said, glowering at his men.</p><p>They sheepishly scuffed their boots on the ground but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Friedrich. Do you ever work? I\u2019m starting to suspect you don\u2019t,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich nonchalantly adjusted his eye patch. \u201cI thought we agreed you were finished with historical tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, perhaps. But these fine gentlemen are soldiers. Your soldiers. I couldn\u2019t be safer anywhere else than I am with them. And besides, they asked so sweetly. Marie said they saw the sign in one of Armel\u2019s stores and asked for a tour with all due niceties and polish.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich looked from Cinderella to his men. \u201cAnd the lot of you were filled with the sudden thirst for history lessons, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>Gustav nodded passionately. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to experience what you so deeply enjoyed on your tours with Lady Lacreux.\u201d</p><p>Another soldier smacked the back of Gustav\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cWhat he means to say,\u201d Ivo drawled. \u201cIs he never knew Erlauf history was entrenched so deeply in Trieux.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the tour attendees nodded in agreement with Ivo.</p><p>Friedrich sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being selfish by trying to keep all this historical knowledge to himself,\u201d Cinderella murmured.</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cYou were meant to,\u201d Cinderella said with a smile as sweet as fresh baked pastries.</p><p>\u201cI suppose even if I tried to stop this, you would not stand for it?\u201d Friedrich asked.</p><p>\u201cI would want them to get their money\u2019s worth, else I would feel terrible,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich studied his men with his stoniest look. Kurt and Ivo stood strong, but Gustav and a few others shivered. \u201cJust this once,\u201d he said to them. \u201cNever again. Tell anyone back at camp with the same harebrained scheme: NO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d his men said, saluting him.</p><p>\u201cWell then, let us continue. As I was saying, down this road one may find the historical building of Volognex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOohhhh,\u201d Gustav said in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cQuite so. It is famous because...,\u201d Cinderella\u2019s voice trailed out of hearing range as the soldiers trailed after her like a herd of attentive cows.</p><p>Friedrich adjusted his hat. \u201cI want them to like her. I want her to like them,\u201d he repeated to himself. He groaned as he headed back to his friends. \u201cWho am I kidding? Diederick is right.

Because of their circular shape and the way they swayed, the Sun Skip flowers looked like tiny suns bounding across the field.</p><p>The wind tugged at Cinderella\u2019s apron and skirts, and she clamped her chin-length hair to head with her hands as she looked at her gorgeous crop. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to sell, but they are beautiful,\u201d she said, her gray eyes softening as she inhaled the sweet fragrance.</p><p>\u201cIt is as you say, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>Two months ago, Friedrich had first given her the flower seeds. Now, near the last month of summer, it was time to test his words. \u201cCut enough to fill a dozen buckets. We\u2019ll take some to the market today,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cI will inform the men, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said, turning from the field. \u201cThere is something I must do. It will take but a minute,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mademoiselle,\u201d Gilbert bowed.</p><p>Cinderella picked up a wooden bucket, filled it at the kitchen well, and grabbed a ladle before she returned to the flower field. As she walked the perimeter, she watched the servants cut the flowers with great care before arranging them in buckets of water.</p><p>\u201cThey look striking in the crimson, morning sunlight,\u201d Cinderella said as she stopped by a copse of trees and held out the bucket.</p> <p>Ivo\u2014one of Friedrich\u2019s men\u2014bowed as he stepped out from behind the tree. \u201cMy apologies, Mademoiselle. I did not mean to be intrusive,\u201d he said, taking the bucket.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t. It is merely that I know better. One of you is always skulking in my shadow. Or is it more than one today?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Colonel has forbidden me from mentioning your three-man guard,\u201d Ivo said before he sipped water from the ladle.</p><p>\u201cThree of them? Goodness, my criminal skills are rusting. I only saw you,\u201d Cinderella sighed. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe barn roof and the bushes by the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI am going to the market as usual. Would you like a ride in the wagon?\u201d</p> <p>Ivo shook his head. \u201cThank you for the offer, but we will catch an assailant off guard if he doesn\u2019t see us with you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella squinted up at the grizzled soldier. \u201cIt\u2019s been months since Friedrich was attacked. Isn\u2019t the danger over by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as long as the Colonel courts you, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sighed. \u201cSometimes I wonder if your charming Colonel is more trouble than he is worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will delight him to hear that you called him charming.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella snorted and felt for the chain of her dragon necklace. \u201cPerhaps. Could you signal to your comrades to come out of hiding for a moment? I would like to see you all watered before we leave for the market. It is to be a hot day, and you all make me uncomfortable with your long sleeves and armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Mademoiselle,\u201d Ivo said, holding up a small mirror. He flashed it several times, making sunlight bounce across the land.</p><p>Cinderella saw a soldier slide off the cow barn roof, and another slip out of the bushes Cinderella stood by when filling the bucket.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Ivo,\u201d Cinderella said, taking the bucket back. \u201cYou are a saint of patience. I don\u2019t know how you stand these boring guard duties.\u201d</p><p>Ivo shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Colonel doesn\u2019t force us to guard you. We sign up for the duty.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella tilted her head. \u201cIf you will excuse my bluntness: why?\u201d</p><p>Ivo shifted, making his weapons clack and his armor creak.</p><p>Cinderella flattened her lips. \u201cI will wait until Gustav is on duty and ask him. He will tell me.\u201d</p><p>Ivo rolled his eyes, more in disgust over his young associate than Cinderella\u2019s craftiness. \u201cAs you wish, Mademoiselle,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cinderella grinned and started to walk away. \u201cCarry on, Ivo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye-aye, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella watched Vitore sell an armload of the Sun Skip flowers to a well-to-do Erlauf woman. After the lady passed over the right amount of change, she took her flowers and walked through the market\u2014the flowers marking her with a halo of gold.</p><p>\u201cVitore, how many flowers have we sold?\u201d Cinderella whispered.</p><p>\u201cAll but one bucket, Mademoiselle,\u201d Vitore whispered back.</p><p>\u201cThe market opened an hour ago!\u201d</p><p>Vitore crossed herself. \u201cMercy on Aveyron, I never thought flowers would outsell hotcakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the customers are from Erlauf,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cAll the customers, except for Madame Marie,\u201d Vitore said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a strange phenomenon.

She had one field of flowers, but she needed to keep some planted in Aveyron so the seeds could be harvested. They cut a small portion of the flowers that morning, and according to the book Friedrich gave her, Sun Skip flowers could be harvested and sold for two weeks.</p><p>If they raised the price of the flowers...</p><p>\u201cIs it enough, Mademoiselle?\u201d Vitore asked, watching Cinderella count on her fingers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Vitore drooped.</p><p>\u201cBut, it\u2019s quite a bit. Depending how high we can raise the price, it could cover a sizable portion of the fine,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Vitore smiled. \u201cWe will make it, Mademoiselle,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>As Vitore bustled about, collecting the empty buckets, Cinderella tried not to despair. The flowers would take care of a fourth of the fine. It was an incredible amount for a single field, much less a single crop. If Aveyron pulled through this, Cinderella would expand the crops to include a variety of flowers. However, there were few other options of fundraising as the rest of Aveyron\u2019s income was already spoken for between upkeep, servant wages, and regular taxes.</p><p>Still, chopping a large chunk off the fine was more than Cinderella imagined. Hope was not lost, yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to step out for a few minutes,\u201d Cinderella said, untying her apron and stowing it beneath a basket.</p><p>Vitore raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m going to call on Friedrich,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t explain yourself to me, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Cinderella dourly said. \u201cI won\u2019t be long. I\u2019m sure even Friedrich must be working this early in the morning,\u201d she said, running a hand through her bright, silky hair.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mademoiselle,\u201d Vitore said.</p><p>Cinderella shook her skirts. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already said that, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Vitore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella left the cheeky maid and the market, and marched towards the outskirts of Werra. The closer she got to the regiment\u2019s camp, the more it seemed Cinderella left Trieux for Erlauf. Most government officials and officers made their homes near the army camps, and their families milled up and down the streets during the day. Cinderella could tell their country\u2019s heritage because everything about them was darker\u2014their hair, eyes, even their clothes were dark and boring.</p><p>Every once in a while, there would be a splash of gold against the muted Erlauf colors\u2014someone wearing a Sun Skip pinned to his shirt, woven into her hair, or set in the band of his hat.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a different culture,\u201d Cinderella murmured.</p><p>When she reached the First Regiment\u2019s camp, the soldiers guarding the gates did nothing to stop her. They saluted her, but their eyes passed over her without care. However, as she passed through the gates, a large square of scarlet red cloth was hoisted up the flag pole with the Erlauf flag and the flag of the First Regiment.</p><p>The path Cinderella took was dotted with sedate, orderly soldiers. Like the ones at the gate, they all saluted her. Occasionally one or two of the soldiers smiled at her, but most appeared to move along at a brisk pace.</p><p>Cinderella was not fooled.</p><p>Up in a watch tower, a soldier cawed like a crow, and at the edge of her vision, she saw more than one soldier sprint to the officer\u2019s lodging\u2014her destination\u2014as if hellhounds were after them.</p><p>A soldier \u201caccidentally\u201d let go of his patrol dog. The dog bounded up to Cinderella for a petting before the soldier leisurely collected the animal. Berta also \u201chappened\u201d upon Cinderella and invited her to the kitchens.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want a pasty, or Apple rings? You\u2019re just a small morsel. You need to eat more lest the wind carry you off,\u201d Berta said, planting her meaty fists on her hips.</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI need to see Friedrich first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Your Grace,\u201d Berta said.</p><p>Cinderella was almost to the front door of the officer\u2019s building when a window on the second floor opened.</p><p>Friedrich\u2014impossible to miss with his black eye patch, popped out of the window. He sat on the frame before flinging himself off it.</p><p>Cinderella held in a shriek, but Friedrich landed with ease. He paused long enough to brush himself off and twitch his Erlauf burgundy jacket into place before speaking. \u201cCinderella, my Pet, how happy you make me by coming to visit,\u201d Friedrich said, curling an arm around Cinderella\u2019s shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must be the only officer in the whole Army who involves his regiment in his personal relationships,\u201d Cinderella said, slipping out of the arm, although she followed Friedrich away from the building.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me, but no. I\u2019ll have you know it\u2019s a family tradition. When my Father courted my Mother, he used an even more elaborate system involving his soldiers. However, he didn\u2019t have a regiment under his disposal, so I would like to think I can still beat his antics,\u201d Friedrich said, moving at a rapid pace.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason we are running away from your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my office we\u2019re running from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe general you serve?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich hesitated. \u201cYes. Yes, it is my general I don\u2019t want you to meet. Certainly. You are so sharp,\u201d Friedrich said, reaching for Cinderella\u2019s hand.</p><p>Cinderella darted out of range. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPet! How could you say such a thing? I am deeply wounded,\u201d Friedrich said, relaxing after they darted behind the mess hall\u2014which was finished and fully operational.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. You will be a gloating monster after you hear my news,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to stop denying your feelings and plan to elope and run away with me?\u201d Friedrich said, perking with interest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Friedrich said, easing back into a stance of nonchalance. \u201cThen no. I don\u2019t think I will be doing much gloating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here to humble myself and admit you were right in your advice to plant flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ve bloomed, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve bloomed, and I sold a batch at the market this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSold out already, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all fairness, it seemed unlikely you would ever know that about our culture unless you visited Erlauf. As you haven\u2019t many flowers besides wild flowers here, we don\u2019t often get to express our passion,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cAll the same, I doubted the wisdom of your words. Thank you for pushing the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Anything for you, Cinderella,\u201d Friedrich said, brushing Cinderella\u2019s cheek with his fingers. \u201cWill you make much off them?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella nodded. \u201cA fair amount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not enough to cover the landholding fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Friedrich nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will keep trying. The summer isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps our sweet queen would accept a partial payment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour queen is a harpy, and I very much doubt she would bend that much,\u201d Cinderella sourly said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Next week she and the Erlauf Commander\u2014the consort\u2014are reopening the Trieux Royal Library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It has been renamed. It\u2019s now the Erlauf Repository of Stories and Education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mouthful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling it the Rose for short. See? I told you flowers are important to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you, now. I am impressed she means to open it again, but it may not help me. If they limit the patronage\u2014as they did when it was under Trieux rule\u2014it might be even more difficult for me to conduct my farming research. Do you know what the membership fee is? Knowing your queen, I should think it to be the price of a good horse,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich nodded. \u201cFree for everyone\u2014commoner, servant, noble, Trieux or Erlauf. Everyone can use it.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella tucked her head, uncertain. \u201cThat\u2019s very...generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe patrolling soldiers\u2014mostly from the Second Regiment\u2014were relieved to hear the news. With the library opening again, they no longer need to fear embarrassment by the book thief that persists in evading capture,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cHow fortuitous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an opening ceremony and everything. You should go,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cWill you be attending?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich sighed. \u201cAlas, I cannot. I am being forced to work myself to the bone for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella laughed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t worked a full day since I\u2019ve met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true,\u201d Friedrich objected.</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I have worked less since becoming acquainted with you. Unfortunately, next week even I cannot weasel my way out of work\u2014though I long to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt saddens me to be told that, Fred.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich laughed, a sound that caressed Cinderella\u2019s skin like velvet. \u201cAt least you are beginning to acknowledge how you pine for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of pine, I must return to the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pine for that loose-mouthed maid of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for our customers\u2019 money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I worry you will marry me only for my money,\u201d Friedrich said, leaning over her.</p><p>Correctly interpreting his movements, Cinderella squirmed to the side before he could kiss her cheek. \u201cOne day someone is going to hear the way you moon over me and report back to whatever Erlauf lady your parents have selected for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt makes no difference. My parents already know all about you,\u201d Friedrich said, losing the jesting edge to his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella said, freezing.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I could use my regiment as a sort of go-between and not tell my parents?\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a part of sewing wild oats and what not?\u201d Cinderella said, her forehead scrunching. She had the barest sense of what \u201csewing wild oats\u201d meant, and suspected it was wilder than what she was picturing.</p><p>\u201cThe moment I chose you I told them,\u201d Friedrich said, sliding his hand under Cinderella\u2019s chin.</p> <p>Cinderella shifted and avoided looking at Friedrich\u2019s painfully intense eye.</p><p>Friedrich sighed. \u201cI wish you would stop clamping up whenever I mention how serious I am,\u201d he said, his voice low like a dog\u2019s growl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you aren\u2019t serious,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cYou always flirt and joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I flirt and joke because I doubt you would stay in my company for longer than a moment if you knew just how serious I am,\u201d Friedrich said, sliding his fingers up Cinderella\u2019s jawline.</p><p>Cinderella caught his hand and pulled it away from her face. \u201cFriedrich, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Friedrich sighed and looked up at the sky. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The pair was silent until Friedrich tore his gaze from the sky and smiled at Cinderella. \u201cI will let you run back to your market stand. Take care, Pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou as well, Friedrich,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich was the first to go, leaving Cinderella in the shadow of the mess hall.</p><p>Her relationship with the Colonel was complicated, not just because of the position Cinderella was in, but because of who they were. \u201cIt would never work,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cinderella squared her shoulders and put her chin up. \u201cIt would never work, and he\u2019s not wholly sincere,\u201d she said before she turned on her heels. \u201cI know perfectly well he\u2019s a rogue. He cannot be serious. It just isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella realized she sounded more like she was trying to convince herself than stating a fact.</p><p>It would be easier if he were joking, Cinderella thought before she angrily shook the topic from her head. \u201cSun Skips! That is what I should think of. I must speak to Pierre about their price, and ask how many we should harvest per day so as to not flood the market...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudies and academics are vital to humanity. They allow limits to be pushed and countries to be changed,\u201d Queen Freja said, standing on the front steps of the Trieux Royal Library\u2014now the Erlauf Repository of Stories and Education\u2014with her husband, three army officers, and two government officials.</p><p>\u201cIt is my hope all parts of Erlauf will flourish if its people are properly educated and given the opportunity to seek out knowledge,\u201d Queen Freja said. Her voice was hard, like iron.</p><p>\u201cEvery person, whether he or she is a true scholar or a baker, should have access to books,\u201d the queen continued.</p><p>Cinderella narrowed her eyes as she studied the foreign queen. She had seen her before\u2014she was presented to Freja when she inherited her title from her father\u2014but back then Cinderella saw her as the hardened woman who was slowly choking Trieux to death.</p><p>Cinderella took in the woman\u2019s height and lean stature with new eyes. There was something about her face and the sharp angles of her cheekbones that seemed oddly familiar.</p><p>\u201cShe goes on, doesn\u2019t she, Mademoiselle?\u201d Vitore darkly muttered as the queen continued with her speech.</p> <p>Cinderella shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for her to do something good here. I am sure she must capitalize on the few chances she has,\u201d Cinderella said, safely surrounded by Trieux market vendors.</p><p>The milkmaid whose stand was next to Aveyron\u2019s in the market squawked, \u201cGood? The library was already built and furnished. She\u2019s just renamed it,\u201d she said, brushing goat hair off her skirt.</p><p>\u201cShe is opening it to the public,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cFor the moment,\u201d Vitore grunted.</p><p>Cinderella shifted her attention to the queen\u2019s consort\u2014the Commander of all Erlauf armies. The man was so uninvolved in palace politics and court happenings that Cinderella didn\u2019t even know his name. She did know he was the terror of the Erlauf Army. His title was not something worn casually. The man was a brilliant strategist and just as hard and unmoving as his wife.</p><p>He looked incredibly common. Cinderella wasn\u2019t sure if she would be able to pick him out of a crowd if he wasn\u2019t standing next to Queen Freja.</p><p>\u201cTheir sons must be like slabs of marble,\u201d Cinderella said. Neither of the Erlauf princes had deigned to attend the opening ceremony.</p><p>Cinderella was not surprised.</p><p>\u201cIs that a surprise considering who their parents are?\u201d the acid tongued milkmaid asked.</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Vitore said.</p><p>When Cinderella looked at them with raised eyebrows they blinked innocently.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Mademoiselle?\u201d Vitore asked.</p><p>The milkmaid was not so shy. \u201cPerhaps that Colonel of yours isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d she grudgingly said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell me those Erlauf princes are as good as him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I should think not,\u201d Cinderella agreed.</p><p>\u201c...Therefore, it is with great joy that I pronounce the Erlauf Repository of Stories and Education to be open and free to all. Let no one keep his fellow man from these halls, and let knowledge pour forth from its doors,\u201d Queen Freja finished.</p><p>Cinderella clapped half-heartedly with her fellow market vendors. The pockets of Erlauf citizens cheered louder, a few even threw yellow Sun Skips\u2014purchased earlier that morning from Aveyron\u2019s market stall\u2014on the library steps.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s done,\u201d the milkmaid said.</p> <p>\u201cI would bet my eyeteeth before the week is out there will be some sort of book tax that all property owners who have owned their land for more than five years must pay,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cShe is the rotten sort to do that, if you don\u2019t mind me saying, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Cinderella sighed, fluffing her skirts.</p><p>\u201cShall we return to the stand, Mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I want to have a look inside first,\u201d Cinderella said, nodding towards the library. \u201cYou may go if you like, though. Don\u2019t let me keep you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish, Madmoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will go with you, Vitore. I don\u2019t trust Chas with my goats, not for long, anyway. Last time they got into his stand and ate two lengths of rope,\u201d the milkmaid said, referring to the ropemaker.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said before the pair disappeared in the push of the crowd.</p><p>The consort and his soldiers pushed back the crowds, opening up a pathway to the library. The first through the doors were Erlauf scholars\u2014eager to get their hands on the priceless volumes the Trieux Nobles gathered over the ages.</p><p>After the scholars went Trieux commoners. The library was built and founded decades ago, but it was exclusive in the patronage it allowed, so the average citizen rarely got to see so much as a glimpse inside the decadent building. It was probably why they attended the ceremony\u2014so they could poke their heads inside and gawk at what was once denied to them.</p><p>Cinderella sat on the lip of a large fountain\u2014designed for watering horses\u2014and waited for the crowds to depart.</p> <p>The consort controlled his soldiers\u2014spacing them out and sending a few into the shadows of the library\u2014with several crisp gestures.</p><p>Cinderella noted with great interest that none of the Erlauf nobles who had relocated to Werra after the takeover attended the ceremony. Apparently they felt no need to pay homage to their rulers, or so Cinderella suspected as she watched Queen Freja stand alone in the shadows of the library.</p><p>The tall, stately woman bent over to pick up a Sun Skip. She brushed the yellow petals with her fingertips, and the hard lines of her face softened to an almost humane expression.</p><p>The monarch twirled the flower between her fingers as she returned her gaze to the crowds. People poured up the steps, pressing into the library, but the queen was safe, blocked off by soldiers and standing some feet down the front veranda.</p><p>As Cinderella watched, a little Trieux girl who wasn\u2019t older than four popped between the stone railings that separated the library veranda from the small courtyard. A soldier moved to intercept the blonde-haired child, but the queen indicated he should remain where he was.</p><p>The Trieux girl popped a dirty thumb in her mouth as she stared up at Queen Freja with wide eyes, her pigtails bobbing in the breeze.</p><p>Queen Freja broke off half the stem of her Sun Skip and, to Cinderella\u2019s surprise, crouched down and wove the flower into one of the little girl\u2019s pigtails. When she was finished, Queen Freja smoothed the child\u2019s hair and smiled.</p><p>The little girl returned the smile before she startled and turned around. \u201cMama,\u201d she called before slipping back through the stone railings, having heard her parent call her name.</p> <p>Queen Freja brushed off her hands and returned to resembling iron and flint when her consort approached her. The two briefly spoke before a squad of soldiers surrounded the queen and bore her away.</p><p>The courtyard emptied as everyone smashed inside the library, but Cinderella stood transfixed.</p><p>She realized as she sat there, gaping like a fish, that she hadn\u2019t ever seen the queen of Erlauf smile. With great stupefaction, Cinderella also realized when the queen smiled, she bore more than a slight resemblance to Friedrich.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>A week later, Cinderella walked the length of the dwindling Sun Skip field, reminiscing on Queen Freja\u2019s smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mystery of Freja and Friedrich\u2019s resemblance was resolved. When Cinderella visited Friedrich the day after the ceremony, she asked about it. Friedrich reported with a wide smile, \u201cYou saw it, too? My family is deeply royal. Our lineage goes far, far back\u2014,\u201d Which, as he blathered on about pedigrees and long dead kings, Cinderella took to mean that there was barely any royal blood left in his family, and it was probably more that Queen Freja had mannish facial features.</p><p>But the queen\u2019s conduct with the little girl intrigued Cinderella. She thought the queen would scorn any Trieux citizen\u2014regardless of their age. But Freja was soft and almost motherly towards the little girl. Was she really as bad as Cinderella thought her to be?</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jeanne?\u201d</p> <p>Jeanne bit her lip. \u201cThere is a government official here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wishes to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he says he needs nothing. But he\u2019s wandering around and...I would not bother you, but Father is up in the hay fields today,\u201d Jeanne said.</p><p>Cinderella frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s just wandering around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he is taking inventory of future Erlauf Crown assets.\u201d</p> <p>Anger stiffened Cinderella\u2019s spine. \u201cI will see to him. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the milking barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jeanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne said. She curtsied, but Cinderella was already walking away, her gray eyes flashing like thunderclouds.</p><p>Cinderella found the greasy-looking fellow\u2014some sort of undersecretary judging by his sweat-stained shirt. \u201cCan I help you, Sir?\u201d</p><p>The undersecretary counted the cows. \u201c\u2019fraid not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think you fail to understand me, sir,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI am Duchess Lacreux. How can I help you, or if you need me to use common words, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sorry,\u201d the undersecretary said, turning from the cows. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent to take inventory of your lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre all lands being re-evaluated for tax purposes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you taking inventory?\u201d</p><p>The undersecretary scratched his dry scalp. \u201cThe crown requested it so plans can be drawn for dividing up the lands and stock after Aveyron reverts to the Crown.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Cinderella forced her expression to remain pleasant. \u201cDid the Crown not receive my first down payment against the fine two days ago?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was received and recorded,\u201d the undersecretary said. \u201cBut it is the Finance Department\u2019s opinion that if it is all you were able to pay off over the first few months of summer, you have no possibility of paying the remaining balance by the end of the month. The queen has plans for Aveyron and wishes to move forward with them as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>That beast! Cinderella thought, taking back the few kind thoughts she had of Queen Freja. That pushy, greedy, flint-hearted witch!</p><p>\u201cThat may be so, but until the end of the month, Aveyron is mine,\u201d Cinderella said, the controlled coolness of her voice making the undersecretary squirm. \u201cIf you have no legal purpose to loiter on my land, I must order you to take your leave. The queen may wait to measure and take inventory until Aveyron belongs to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but Her Majesty will be so very disappointed\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe gone,\u201d Cinderella said, every inch of her body drawing up in nobility and attitude.</p><p>The force of her words, although softly spoken, sent the undersecretary scuttling. \u201cAs you wish, Lady,\u201d he said before running from Aveyron.</p><p>Cinderella watched him go with shaking fists.</p><p>Gustav whistled in appreciation as he ducked out from his hiding spot in the barn. \u201cWell said, Your Grace. Even in servants\u2019 dress and dirt, you can issue a command like the Colonel himself. Your Grace?\u201d he said when Cinderella did not acknowledge him and started for Werra.</p><p>She had to see Marie.</p><p>There was no one in Aveyron Cinderella could speak to. Jeanne was the closest thing she had to a companion, and the young woman made sure to hold Cinderella at an arm\u2019s length.</p><p>The servants of Aveyron saw Cinderella go, but they did not stop her, or the three Erlauf soldiers who followed her in the shadows.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s ears were ringing by the time she reached Marie\u2019s residential home. The maid opened the door and took one look at Cinderella before she ran off, calling, \u201cMadame? Madame Marie!\u201d leaving the door wide open.</p><p>Cinderella stepped inside, her eyes sweeping through the pleasant parlor situated near the entrance.

I can imagine she bears grudges against us for the damages and cost we have been to her country,\u201d Marie said, fussing with Cinderella\u2019s hair before gesturing to a servant.</p><p>The servant briefly disappeared, returning to the room with tea and cookies.</p><p>Cinderella groaned, a sound that worked its way up from deep in her heart. \u201cShe\u2019s hateful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Marie agreed, her tone tempered, but edged just as sharp as Cinderella\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Cinderella admitted. \u201cI was hopeful they would accept a partial payment\u2014perhaps half. But based on my interaction today, I don\u2019t think it is a possibility.\u201d</p><p>Marie nodded and served the tea.</p><p>\u201cI will have to marry Julien. I summarized that much from our last meeting. Marcus is a sweet boy, and I like his parents better than Julien\u2019s, but he\u2019s terribly smitten with Julien\u2019s sister. He deserves a chance at happiness,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Marie pressed her lips together.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Colonel Friedrich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he not an option?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella drank her tea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Do you think he isn\u2019t serious in his pursuit of you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Cinderella said, setting her teacup down. \u201cI...I don\u2019t want to bring him misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might l-love me, but what would happen if we were to marry? So far Erlauf has tolerated our friendship, but what penalty will he pay for marrying me? It could cost him his friends, his post, even his career. I can\u2019t ask him to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he wants to?\u201d Marie asked. \u201cI know everyone whispers he is a rogue, but, Cinderella, surely you must realize he follows you with the loyalty of a dog?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella covered her face with her hands. \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, her voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Marie asked after several heartbeats of silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would prefer him over Julien?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Marie smiled sadly. \u201cThe problem is you are too noble. You should be self-centered, just this once.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella groaned as she pressed her fingers to her puffy eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s too late in my life to start thinking of such things now,\u201d Cinderella said with a half-smile when she lowered her hands. \u201cI know what I should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I should run away to Loire. I could...join a traveling show or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine folks would pay to see a noble who feeds pigs, massacres baskets, and runs a market stand,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cI could learn how to ride a trick horse,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a fine income,\u201d Cinderella insisted.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>The two girls stared at each other for a moment before erupting into laughter.</p><p>\u201cY-you took years to learn to ride a horse, and now you want to learn trick rides?\u201d Marie laughed.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I could teach a horse to do tricks?\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cLike a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may work better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could make terrible baskets for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re always welcome to live with Armel and me,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI know, and I thank you. But I am titled and seventeen. I cannot hide from my future forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I would be honored to be your safe haven,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cYou already are,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Madame,\u201d a maid in a crisp, clean uniform said, bobbing to Marie and Cinderella. \u201cThere is a man at the door to see Duchess Lacreux.\u201d</p><p>Marie frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked as she and Cinderella made their way towards the door.</p><p>Out on the front porch, holding the reins of a blood bay horse, was Colonel Friedrich. The Colonel was covered in dust, and the sweeping brim of his hat was cut and squashed. \u201cSorry, Pet. I would have been here sooner, but I was...indisposed,\u201d he said. He pulled a leather glove off his hand with his teeth. He extended his gloveless hand to Cinderella, gently brushing her cheek bones with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m filthy, sorry,\u201d he winced.</p><p>Cinderella walked into Friedrich, pressing her face into his shoulder.</p><p>The collision made dust puff like a cloud, but Friedrich slid his arms around Cinderella after passing off the reins of his horse to Gustav.</p><p>Although he cradled Cinderella, Friedrich looked past her to Marie. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Marie raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe was my friend first before she became your heart\u2019s desire. There is no need for you to thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the same, I still thank you,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cI am not a dog to be cared for,\u201d Cinderella said into Friedrich\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOf course you aren\u2019t, Pet. What do you say to a brief ride? We will share my mount,\u201d Friedrich said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella stepped back from Friedrich\u2019s embrace, her composure regained. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of Werra for a bit,\u201d Friedrich said, adjusting his horse\u2019s saddle.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Cinderella agreed before she turned back to Marie. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Marie smiled. \u201cI am glad to help in whatever way I can.

Hard? She has done her best to make me her legal slave,\u201d Cinderella hissed.</p><p>Friedrich was quiet until they left Werra. They lingered within eyesight of his regiment\u2019s camp, but dismounted and walked through a hay field.</p><p>\u201cYou have a right to hate Queen Freja, and to hate the royal family,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it the right thing?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella tilted her head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten over your hate for Erlauf soldiers and commoners, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said with great hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have grown to realize and accept they are people too. I\u2019ve known all along about Erlauf citizens, but it was difficult to reconcile the thought with soldiers\u2014who killed my neighbors and associates,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you also admit Trieux was in the wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said, her mouth forming an unhappy slant. \u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you extend the same sort of forgiveness to the queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Then perhaps it is because Erlauf commoners do not trek all over Aveyron, eyeing it greedily. Erlauf soldiers do not lie and steal from me, nor do they blackmail me and press me with such hard fines I will lose everything but my own body and my title. I can forgive them because their actions are forgivable. This queen of yours? She will not rest until I am destitute. For such cruelty, I have no forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes a person have to act sorry in order to be forgiven?\u201d Friedrich asked. \u201cI know you have encountered cruelty from others, and yet you forgive them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does my attitude towards your queen bother you so?\u201d Cinderella asked, placing her fists on her hips. \u201cWhatever I think about Queen Freja isn\u2019t of great importance. I am not going to rise up against her in rebellion\u2014surely you must realize that. So what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgiveness takes a great deal of personal strength. A weak person cannot forgive, and their actions will keep them captive and fester like an infected wound,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella stared at Friedrich. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf everyone in this rotten country, you, Cinderella, are the nearest to grasping forgiveness. You are so close to bridging the gap between us. Hate cannot drive out hate. As long as those from Trieux hate those from Erlauf, our countries will be in an eternal struggle. If you can forgive us, you will set not only yourself free, but your countrymen as well. I want you to have the courage to forgive. I want you to be the person to save our countries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich, I am not capable of saving anyone. I can\u2019t even save my own servants. I\u2019m about to lose my lands. I don\u2019t know what hope you see in me, but I am not capable of it,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYou are much stronger than you know,\u201d Friedrich said, stepping closer. \u201cYou can conquer a country with forgiveness,\u201d he said, lowering his head towards Cinderella.</p><p>When he was a hand away, Cinderella covered her mouth with her hands. \u201cDo not even dream of it,\u201d she said, her voice muffled.</p><p>Friedrich sighed. \u201cStill not yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be not ever, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it before. Above all, I will honor my marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though we aren\u2019t married yet?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella removed her hands from her mouth so she could smack Friedrich on the chest.</p><p>\u201cIf only you could apply this same sort of loyalty towards Erlauf,\u201d Friedrich grumbled as Cinderella minced away from him.</p><p>\u201cIf only your queen had a heart,\u201d Cinderella said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Friedrich gathered up the reins of his horse. \u201cShall we return to my camp?

He wore a uniform identical to Friedrich\u2019s, but without the eye patch. His hair was a chestnut shade of brown, and he had good-humored, gentle, hazel-colored eyes.</p><p>\u201cFriedrich, so you are here. Your men insisted you were out for the day but\u2014,\u201d the man cut off when he set eyes on Cinderella.</p> <p>The stable was shockingly silent.</p><p>The two lower-ranked soldiers looked as though they wished the ground would swallow them alive. Friedrich wore a dark scowl on his face, and the unknown officer gaped at Cinderella as if she was a three-headed goat.</p><p>Cinderella cleared her throat and decided no one seemed prone to introducing her to this stranger, so she may as well do it herself. \u201cGood afternoon, sir. I am Lady Cinderella Lacreux, and you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel Merrich of the Second Regiment in the Dragon Army,\u201d Merrich said, his voice just as dazed as his expression.</p><p>\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, Colonel Merrich,\u201d Cinderella said, performing a sweeping curtsey.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nice to him,\u201d Friedrich said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Friedrich, you wound me! Has he said nothing of me?\u201d Merrich asked.</p><p>Cinderella shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Colonel Friedrich has ever mentioned a Colonel Merrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a fine mess,\u201d Merrich said. \u201cYou lied about her beauty, and then you don\u2019t even tell her about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said she was exotic. You were the one who decided she must resemble a troll,\u201d Friedrich said, curling an arm around Cinderella\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Cinderella said, her voice dangerously pleasant as she stepped out of the gesture.</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cI did not tell him how breathtaking you are.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella looked down at her rumpled dress and ran a hand through her windswept hair. \u201cOh yes. Breathtaking,\u201d she said, her voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cBut you are,\u201d Colonel Merrich said with a charming smile. \u201cI have never before seen hair so red and stunning before in my life,\u201d he said, taking Cinderella\u2019s hand.</p> <p>He almost brushed it with his lips before Cinderella pulled her hand from his grasp. \u201cI am charmed,\u201d Cinderella said in the same tone one uses to announce the sight of a dead rat. \u201cIf you will excuse me, gentlemen. I believe I will go wait in the mess hall until you are ready to leave, Fred,\u201d Cinderella said before making her exit from the stable.</p><p>As she left, she heard Colonel Merrich say to Friedrich, \u201cShe is a tough one to crack, isn\u2019t she? I understand why you whine and complain so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I figure I ought to share some with you before I kill you for setting me up as the fool. That lady could stop the sun if she smiled. You said she scuttled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you are referring to,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Are all Erlauf Colonels so roguish? Cinderella wondered, shaking her head as she made her way to the mess hall.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Cinderella sifted through her Father\u2019s office, looking for items she could sell. The office was mostly cleared out from previous passes, but it was best to be thorough and exhaust all possible sources of income.</p><p>The curtains and rugs were gone, as were most of the books. The paintings\u2014the first things to go\u2014were long gone, and Cinderella would have sold the desk if she thought the monstrosity could be removed from the Chateau, but it was built inside the study and could not be shifted through the door.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jeanne?\u201d Cinderella asked, standing on tiptoe to inspect the books. (The remaining volumes were books of Aveyron\u2019s records and a farmer\u2019s almanac.) \u201cA Royal Messenger arrived,\u201d Jeanne said. \u201cHe said to give this to the lady of the house.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella took the envelope Jeanne held out to her. She glanced at the royal seal pressed into wax on the back of the envelope before she ripped it open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an invitation for the annual victory celebration,\u201d Cinderella said, reading the paper.</p><p>\u201cThe Victory Ball?\u201d Jeanne asked, naming the event Erlauf royalty hosted in the Trieux Palace every year since the takeover to laud their victory.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said, stuffing the invitation back into the envelope. \u201cPlease give it to Lady Klara. I will not be attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Mademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne said, curtseying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the housekeeper left the room, Cinderella rested her forehead on the bookcase. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough that they took us over, they must make a spectacle out of it every year, too,\u201d she muttered before climbing a ladder.</p><p>She shuffled the few leather-bound books around the shelves. Nothing new was to be found. Cinderella started to climb down the ladder\u2014intending to search her mother\u2019s old room next. She looked up at the top of the bookshelves, and, on an impulse, climbed the highest ladder rung.</p><p>The bookshelves did not reach the ceiling, but they still stretched up a good ten feet. The ladder was barely tall enough to push Cinderella above their height, so she might see if anything of interest was on top.</p><p>The tops of the elaborately carved shelves were dust-covered and riddled with cobwebs, but Cinderella was rewarded with a package of papers.</p> <p>Cinderella brushed cobwebs from the package, shivering at their whispery touch, and carried it down the ladder with her.</p><p>She wiped the package off and sneezed in the raised dust before ripping the packet open. Papers spilled out. Cinderella recognized her father\u2019s handwriting on the aged, yellow sheets. It was some kind of proof of sales based on the various seals and notaries pressed into the brittle pages.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Cinderella murmured, moving to the window so she could see better.</p><p>The paper went on, but Cinderella couldn\u2019t believe it. Her father had purchased another manor? When? Was he out of his mind? Cinderella paged through the reports. Her blood turned cold when she saw where Windtop Manor was located: southern Loire.</p><p>According to the dates, the purchase was made in the chaotic but brief month Trieux was at war with Erlauf before it was overtaken.</p> <p>Cinderella\u2019s father hadn\u2019t claimed the manor in his assets\u2014Pierre and Cinderella would have noticed it before\u2014and the Erlauf Crown wasn\u2019t likely to let an out-of-country manor go untaxed, even if it was in Loire.</p><p>Cinderella bit her lip as she tried to keep the hysteria down. There was only one reason Cinderella could think of that would drive him to purchase a small manor\u2014incredibly small compared to Aveyron\u2014in Loire.</p><p>He meant to flee.</p><p>With only fifty acres to its name, Windtop could not possibly provide work for Aveyron\u2019s fleet of servants. He meant to abandon everything and run. Cinderella knew without a doubt he would have taken her with, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that her brave, gentle father engineered a backdoor to escape through.</p><p>However...Cinderella could sell this escape plan\u2014surely it was worth the remaining amount of debt Aveyron owed the crown. (This explained the unpaid landholding fines\u2014the money was gone, already used to pay for part of Windtop\u2019s purchase, rather than pay off the debt.) Hope toppled as Cinderella realized the position she was in. She could sell Windtop...and then Queen Freja just might have her imprisoned for embezzlement or whatever word she could use to brand Cinderella a traitor for failing to inform the Crown of the foreign manor.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t want to be imprisoned, Cinderella\u2019s only option was to ignore it...or use it.</p> <p>Marie told Cinderella she needed to start thinking of herself, she should be selfish just this once. Once inside Loire, Erlauf could not touch her. She would have to leave behind the servants...but hadn\u2019t she paid them back for their loyalty?</p><p>To never be harassed, to never be bothered again by Queen Freja...Cinderella was still as she imagined the freedom for a moment.</p><p>If Papa planned for it, surely it couldn\u2019t be wrong, Cinderella thought. Papa was the kindest man I know. If even he made these preparations...</p><p>Cinderella recalled the way her servants dove into flower farming, even though they must have thought she was half mad to try it. She thought of Vitore\u2014the stand-minder who was originally a lady\u2019s maid. There was brave Jeanne, who might not be the warmest person, but who had said no to a suitor to step into her mother\u2019s position of housekeeper when she died. Gilbert, who stayed on even though his wages were lowered. The cowherds, who learned how to tend sheep when Cinderella was desperate for help and unable to afford more. All of Aveyron\u2019s servants hadn\u2019t just stood up for Cinderella and her father when Erlauf rounded up the nobles for the slaughter, they stayed with Cinderella and sacrificed more.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave them,\u201d Cinderella said, her grip tightening on the papers. \u201cI can\u2019t abandon them.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella squared her shoulders.

It is not entirely ridiculous that he would will a small manor to me, provided you agree with my story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they will believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they are cads, no. I am of Erlauf heritage, your Father of Trieux. However, if you support my word as his heir, there is nothing they can do to prove otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they be angry with you for withholding the inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband was a slain war hero, and even after his death I followed my orders and married again, an enemy even. Queen Freja will not arrest me, if that is your concern,\u201d Lady Klara said with great firmness.</p><p>She\u2019s going to help me? Cinderella wondered as she stared at her step-mother.

She hesitated, wondering if she should apologize, before she tucked her head. No, this was important.</p><p>\u201cIn spite of what you may believe about those of us from Erlauf, I am not entirely unfeeling, Cinderella,\u201d Lady Klara said.</p><p>\u201cI have been haunted by debts. I have looked to you for help before, but this is the first time you will give it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that is because I could not help you before,\u201d Lady Klara said.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand just how wealthy you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...Is that a joke?\u201d Cinderella said.

I am on the verge of losing it, and you call me wealthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAveyron is twice, no, three time the size of the largest Erlauf estate. Queen Freja has taken so hatefully to you because you are the sole Trieux estate that has lost not a single acre, servant, or animal. If your father was alive and Duke of Aveyron, I very much doubt she would attack you with the same vigor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father would have sold parts of Aveyron to keep his personal comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was a kind and generous man!\u201d Cinderella said, her eyes flashing.</p><p>\u201cHe was, and yet he bought a manor in Loire which you\u2014dressed in a servant\u2019s uniform\u2014stand before me, desiring to sell so you may keep your estate.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was silent.</p><p>Lady Klara stood, her chin lifted as she fixed her eyes on Cinderella. \u201cOnce Queen Freja finishes giving land and titles to army officers, you will own more land than the Erlauf royal family. She fears you, because you have done what no one else has\u2014in Trieux or Erlauf, for we in Erlauf have also been hit with taxes\u2014has done. You are extraordinarily wealthy, just as you are extraordinarily stubborn, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stared at the floor. \u201cI just want to keep all my servants,\u201d she said, her voice barely above a whisper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf this I am aware, which is why I will help you\u2014though my husband must be rolling in his grave,\u201d Lady Klara said. \u201cBut as I have neither finances nor influence, this is the only way I can help you: by lending you my name.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella raised her gaze to rest it on Lady Klara. What had Friedrich said? Only the strong could forgive.

No one else shares my scruples in selling.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella pushed the thought from her mind. It was more than she could handle at the moment.</p><p>\u201cFirst I must make the arrangements to pay off the debt. I will free Aveyron from this financial mountain,\u201d Cinderella vowed.</p> <p>Cinderella sweated as the government official handling Aveyron\u2019s debts\u2014Lord Diederick\u2014studied the sales bills and receipts for Windtop Manor. It puzzled Cinderella that a titled Erlauf Lord served in the government. Moreover, why was he in charge of debt collection? If there ever was a less glamorous government position, Cinderella certainly hadn\u2019t heard of it.</p><p>\u201cYou claim Duke Eugene Lacreux willed this to you, Lady Klara?\u201d Lord Diederick asked, looking at Lady Klara over the wire rims of his eyeglasses.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Klara said, her voice stiff.</p><p>\u201cAnd have you proof of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly my word, and his heir\u2019s agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Lord Diederick said, returning his attention to the papers.</p><p>Cinderella discreetly shifted in her summer dress. She did her best to look assured and slightly bored, although she wanted to wring her hands nervously.</p><p>Lady Klara looked as unmovable as a boulder, which is to say not at all different than her usual expression.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears to be legitimate,\u201d the young lord finally said, pushing the papers aside. \u201cThe crown will hold the deed to Windtop Manor until it is sold to pay Aveyron\u2019s debts, if that is what you wish to do with the funds you receive from the sale, Lady Klara?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella waited with baited breath.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lady Klara said.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Lord Diederick said. \u201cThere will be an inheritance tax, as this property was not previously reported,\u201d he said, leveling his heavy gaze at Lady Klara and then Cinderella. \u201cAnd after that, a sales tax. If it is priced reasonably, the sale will pay off Aveyron\u2019s debt and have a small amount remaining, which will naturally go to Lady Klara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, there will be some left?\u201d Cinderella frowned.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lord Diederick said.</p><p>Cinderella shook her \u201cHow can that be? Is the debt not...\u201d she trailed off when Lord Diederick showed her a scrap of paper.</p><p>\u201cThis is the remaining debt,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cinderella stared at the number. The Sun Skips canceled a portion of the debt, but Cinderella knew exactly how much she paid off. The number Lord Diederick showed her was incorrect.</p><p>Cinderella frowned. As much as the smaller debt would delight her, the last thing she needed was Queen Freja harping at her again in several years for failing to pay the entire debt. \u201cI believe there may be a mistake,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere has been no mistake. Over the past few days dozens of individuals have trooped through my offices, reducing Aveyron\u2019s debt with copper and silver coins,\u201d Lord Diederick wryly said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cinderella said, her forehead wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cA stable boy was the last to come. He left not an hour before your arrival after depositing five copper coins against your debt. A fellow named Gilbert was the first to make a payment, I believe,\u201d Lord Diederick said, rustling papers.</p><p>Cinderella lost the stiffness in her spine and leaned back in her chair. She stared at the ceiling, doing her best to keep from crying.</p><p>Her servants, Aveyron\u2019s employees, were paying off the debt.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Lord Diederick mildly asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe is fine, just feeling a bit peckish,\u201d Lady Klara said with her usual lack of audible compassion. \u201cMust you retrieve a supervisor to approve the debt payment plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My word is more than plenty,\u201d Lord Diederick said, perhaps a little affronted.</p><p>Cinderella closed her eyes, barely listening to the conversation. She felt ashamed. To think she considered fleeing to Windtop, even if it was for a brief moment. I don\u2019t deserve their loyalty. I have done nothing to warrant it.</p><p>\u201cCinderella, your signature as witness is required,\u201d Lady Klara said.</p> <p>Cinderella bit her lip and pushed the feelings aside. \u201cYes, I apologize,\u201d she said, discreetly brushing tears from her eyes before she fixed a pleasant smile on her face. \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lord Diederick said. \u201cRead the agreement before signing.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella did as he advised and saw nothing alarming. In fact, to her surprise, Lady Klara noted that any surplus profit from Windtop would be used against Aveyron\u2019s land tax.</p><p>\u201cYou will hold all paperwork pertaining to Windtop Manor?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cUntil it is sold, yes. Strictly speaking, the fine will not be collected until after the sale. Holding the deed will assure the crown of future compensation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow fast must Windtop Manor be sold?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>Lord Diederick tapped a spot on the paper. \u201cYou have one year.

He was...concerned for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. In that case, I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Lord Diederick,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Lord Diederick bowed again. \u201cThe pleasure is mine. In the future, I hope to see you for less...personal circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella awkwardly nodded. \u201cI agree,\u201d she said, not certain if she meant it. \u201cIf you will excuse me, Lord Diederick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Good day to you, Lady Lacreux.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood day, Lord Diederick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she is free, now,\u201d Diederick said. \u201cFor better or for worse, she has squirmed out from the pile of debt and is influence free,\u201d he said before tossing back the rest of his drink.</p><p>Merrich leaned forward to avoid the exuberant jubilation of three farmers seated at the table behind him. \u201cYou are giving her quite a long leash. Is that wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her leashed at all,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cI want her free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds terrifying,\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Friedrich said, tracing the rim of his tankard with a thumb. In spite of the uproar in the pub\u2014everyone in the room was drunk or halfway there, excluding Friedrich and his friends\u2014Friedrich retained an aura of intense clarity. \u201cBut I want her. And if we\u2019re all to survive this, the country needs her free. I can\u2019t hold it together, not with my duties in the Army. She must be the one to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the Veneno Conclave representatives had nothing helpful to say, I take it?\u201d Diederick asked.</p><p>Friedrich shook his head and scratched at his eye patch. \u201cThey spoke not at all of the magical mishaps taking place worldwide. The Conclave is scared\u2014you can see it in the way the representatives avoid speaking of the sudden outbreak of cursed royalty and the increase in sightings and skirmishes with dark creatures and users of black magic. I think the Conclave means to ignore the problem because they cannot solve it, and they are terrified to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they ignore it? Even if one excludes the creatures, it is indisputable that the royal class is under attack. Prince Severin\u2014restored as he may be\u2014was attacked in his family\u2019s palace and cursed there. There are the twelve princesses of the south no one can seem to cure, and aren\u2019t we still waiting to see if the Sole princess cursed to sleep will slide through her birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the representatives refused to talk about the dark tide of magic, what did they speak of?\u201d Diederick asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of pretty things, but mostly they communicated their unhappiness with us for taking over Trieux,\u201d Friedrich said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Merrich frowned and didn\u2019t react when the wall next to him was soaked with beer after a tipsy blacksmith threw his mug at the wall. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be impartial. Can they legally say those kinds of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is going to take them to court?\u201d Friedrich asked. \u201cNo one from Trieux will bother, and Erlauf is tapped out of funds and scurrying to pay back our debts to the penny-pinching princess of Arcainia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she and her brothers disappeared,\u201d Diederick said. \u201cAnother victim of a dark curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, but her underlings keep her monetary empire running in her absence. In truth, we shouldn\u2019t have borrowed so much from her to go to war against Trieux. It made the short war possible, but we\u2019re paying for it dearly,\u201d Friedrich said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now we sit with a debt-riddled country; the only council of magic users in the world is upset with us; and our conquered territory persists in trying to rip away as we brace ourselves for a decade of dark magic,\u201d Diederick summarized.</p><p>\u201cIf Trieux separates, it is going to be eaten by darkness,\u201d Merrich predicted.</p><p>\u201cAnd we will be two steps behind them,\u201d Friedrich grimly said. \u201cWe are spent. Even a military as grand as ours cannot fight without money to fund it. It is why we are so desperate to encourage Trieux\u2019s healthy economy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all of this rests on the shoulders of your lovely red-haired lady,\u201d Diederick said as a barkeep refilled his tankard. \u201cAre you certain you want to trust her with the future of her country and ours?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich tapped his fingers on the table. \u201cCinderella is special.\u201d</p> <p>Merrich rolled his eyes, and Diederick chugged his drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being a cad\u2014I mean it. She has a capacity for loyalty and love one doesn\u2019t often see. People want to love her. If she would give up on her last shard of bitterness...I don\u2019t think even a dark enchanter would dare tangle with her. Her love can get people to think beyond themselves. And that is what we need in this age,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>The three friends were silent, dwelling on Friedrich\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Merrich said, slamming his drink down. \u201cIf she\u2019s as great as you say, I will march to her orders until the day I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, provided you don\u2019t get any funny ideas about her,\u201d Friedrich said, eyeing his old friend.</p><p>Merrich rolled his eyes again. \u201cI assure you I can control myself from accosting the love of my closest friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDiederick?\u201d Friedrich asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready yet,\u201d Diederick said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t see the danger of dark magic. It hasn\u2019t touched Trieux, even though we\u2019ve been getting hit with it in Erlauf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to trust she will be ready. I can\u2019t delay a formal engagement much longer. A Trieux brat will pull her out from underneath me,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Diederick studied his friend. \u201cYou would marry her even if you didn\u2019t think she was the best option for our country, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich shrugged. \u201cI love her,\u201d he said.</p><p>Diederick nodded. \u201cIn that case, I, too, will throw my lot in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never pictured you as a champion of love,\u201d Merrich said.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Diederick said. \u201cBut I would not wish a loveless marriage on Friedrich.\u201d</p> <p>Friedrich clasped his friend on the back. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the only thing left to do is to propose.

May you finally get the girl you dream of\u2014who also keeps you in your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d Diederick said.</p><p>\u201cI am so touched,\u201d Friedrich flatly said.</p><p>The friends laughed and talked late into the night, advising Colonel Friedrich\u2014or as his Royal name decreed, Prince Cristoph Friedrich VI\u2014and hoping he made a wise decision in loving a fiery Trieux duchess.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>The morning of the Victory Ball, Julien Rosseux called on Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cJulien, what a pleasant surprise,\u201d Cinderella, awkwardly wiping her hands on her apron.</p><p>\u201cLady Lacreux,\u201d Julien said with an extravagant bow.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just Cinderella,\u201d Cinderella said before turning to her servants, who were packing up the last of the goods for the market. \u201cLeave without me if you must, Vitore.

Typically he wore something more fashionable, but the simplicity of the outfit seemed to fit him better.</p><p>\u201cI am honored and delighted,\u201d Cinderella said, leading him around the perimeter of the chateau. \u201cHow is your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is well. She was disappointed she did not get to see you beard Lady Feautre.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella grinned. \u201cCerise is a girl after my heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe seems to think so too,\u201d Julien chuckled.</p><p>They reached the chateau\u2019s entrance, but Julien seemed oddly unwilling to go inside. \u201cCinderella,\u201d he said, looking at her with unusual directness. \u201cMy family does not know I am calling on you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they think I have gone for a long ride. A very long ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Then you have something you wish to discuss,\u201d Cinderella said, knitting her fingers together and standing with picturesque elegance\u2014as she was trained to stand what felt like a lifetime ago, before the war.</p> <p>\u201cI am aware it is not entirely polite but...I felt you might appreciate a frank discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Cinderella knowingly said. \u201cMarriage?\u201d</p><p>Julien nodded and looked awkward.</p><p>Cinderella smiled, taking pity on the young man. \u201cThen let us walk as we talk,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Julien\u2019s shoulders drooped in relief before he offered her his arm.</p><p>Cinderella took it, and the two walked across the picturesque lawn, ignoring the loose goats that grazed there.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about marriage do you wish to discuss?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if my assumption is correct, and you will not be marrying Marcus Girard,\u201d Julien said. \u201cIt seemed at the dinner party you made up your mind...\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sucked in a deep breath of air. \u201cYou assumed correctly. I don\u2019t think...Marcus is young, and I suspect if we leave him alone he will seek out Cerise\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your only option, then, is me,\u201d Julien said.</p><p>Cinderella looked up at the young nobleman and was struck by a sudden thought. \u201cJulien, do you want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>Julien blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot possibly love me, although I flatter myself in thinking you are fond of me. Do you want to be tied to me for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>Julien hesitated. \u201cI am fond of you, and I feel we can learn to be happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat does not answer my question,\u201d Cinderella said as they stopped and faced each other under the shade of a giant oak tree.</p><p>\u201cOut of all the available girls of Trieux noble lineage, you are the one I prefer and prize. Yes, perhaps we do not love each other now, but there are things about you I admire...\u201d Julien trailed off, cowed into silence by Cinderella\u2019s narrowed but not unkind gaze.</p><p>Cinderella recognized the careful words that she, too, had dwelled on the past few weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a commoner you love, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Cinderella said Julien gawked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very careful to say I am your favored choice out of all suitable. There is nothing wrong with that\u2014I agree with you, actually. However, there are many, many other girls in Werra, much less in the country, who would not meet your parents\u2019 requirements but are still perfectly lovely.\u201d</p><p>Julien was incapable of speech and made a gurgling sound.</p><p>Cinderella patted Julien on the arm. \u201cWhat is her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargrit.\u201d</p><p>It took all of Cinderella\u2019s control to keep from gaping. \u201cShe is from Erlauf?\u201d Cinderella said, recognizing the harsher syllable patterns of the tyrant country.</p><p>\u201cHer father is a secretary for the queen. I met her at the palace,\u201d Julien said. \u201cShe is charming and sweet. Her laugh is like the chiming of a bell,\u201d Julien said, his voice wistful.</p><p>\u201cAnd you love her.\u201d</p><p>Julien hesitated. \u201cYes. But I am a man of honor. When we marry, I will see her no more,\u201d he firmly said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you marry me when you love another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents know nothing of her, and my father would disinherit me if he heard of it. The only reason he still presses me to marry you\u2014in spite of your association with Erlauf soldiers\u2014is to keep our bloodlines pristine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulien, a marriage based on your parents\u2019 desires will be wretched,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Julien shrugged. \u201cEven if they did not force me to, I would still choose you,\u201d he said, his layers of good manners fading to honesty. \u201cYou are alone, and you cannot hold on to Aveyron much longer. I cannot stand by and watch you fail. If it is in my power to aid you, I will. Unfortunately, all I can do is offer to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stared at Julien, struck by the nobility of his soul. He would put aside his personal desires and marry her just because she was in trouble.</p><p>Cinderella smiled at Julien, affection flowing from her, making Julien aware of what a beauty Cinderella was beneath the servant\u2019s uniform and the dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou are a good man, Julien,\u201d Cinderella said, resting her hands on Julien\u2019s. \u201cI thank you for your selfless offer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julien tilted his head. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s smile turned gentle. \u201cBut I will be daring enough to set both of us free. I will not marry you, even if it is the easiest way of survival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Julien asked.</p><p>\u201cWe deserve happiness. Both of us. I may struggle longer, but do not fear. I will seize personal happiness if I must shake it from Queen Freja with my bare hands,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>The comment drew a chuckle from Julien, making him less strained. \u201cBut what will we do? My father will never let me marry Margrit, and Aveyron...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAveyron is my concern. If I drive myself to ruin, it will be through my own stubbornness\u2014from which you cannot save me,\u201d Cinderella wryly observed. \u201cAnd I understand your concerns with your father...but do you really think he can spare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are his only son, and while I love Cerise, she would make a poor heir. Your father knows this. We are in an unfortunate time because of the financial burdens and stresses placed on us, but we are also in the perfect time, because in such uncertain days as these, we can change and defy traditional thought patterns and beliefs,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Julien asked.</p> <p>\u201cForgive my impertinence, but when else in history could a duchess wear servant clothes and work in the market without worry of alienation from her fellow nobles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr when would a duchess condescend to even think of marrying the son of an earl?\u201d Julien said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMy point is your father doesn\u2019t have anyone else who will see to your estate. He will likely yell at you and be enraged with you for a few months, but I think he will come around.\u201d</p><p>Julien nodded. \u201cMother will cheer for me, I think.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella nodded. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Julien smiled widely, without restraint. It startled Cinderella to realize she had never seen Julien look so happy before. \u201cBut what of you, Cinderella?\u201d Julien said after a few moments, his smile dimming.</p> <p>Cinderella shrugged. \u201cI have survived these two, soon to be three years. Every time I think I am at the end of my rope, I find I have just a little more strength. I am stubborn and wild. Queen Freja cannot hope to beat me,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry your Erlauf officer, then?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella pressed her lips together. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You must care for him seeing as you stood against our peers for the sake of your association with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely certain what he feels for me. He mostly seems to be serious, but there are things he says...\u201d Cinderella shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but even if I do not marry him, I will be quite happy at Aveyron.\u201d</p><p>Julien nodded.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we a pair,\u201d Cinderella laughed. \u201cOnce lauded as the sparkling future of the remaining Trieux line of nobility, we are both infatuated with the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t really the enemy. Not anymore,\u201d Julien earnestly said.</p> <p>\u201cMmhmm. I do not think the whole country, or even a sizeable portion of it, would agree with you,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but when they see that we can intermingle\u2014if, no, when I marry Margrit\u2014changes will come \u2018round. They already have. Thanks to your friendship with Colonel Friedrich, you are a beautiful example of noble decorum.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella looked down at her patched dress. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said in a dead voice. \u201cI can see I am in a very pretty spot right now. Hah-hah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou solely look at your outward appearance,\u201d Julien argued. \u201cI can assure you, in the people\u2019s eyes, you wear a crown and jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are overestimating me, but I thank you for the compliment all the same,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cNow, tell me of this Erlauf miss of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe waxed poetry over her gentle manners and soft voice. With all the sweet and kind descriptions he used, I half wonder if this girl is a kitten. Truly, Marie, I think he would have been miserable with me. I am too wild and passionate for him,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Marie scowled at Cinderella. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to convince me you\u2019ve done the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Marie sighed. \u201cI doubt poor Julien would have learned to say no to you. But if you ruled out Marcus, turned Julien away, and discounted Colonel Friedrich\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life will be complete even if I do not marry in the next year, Marie,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it is such a shame. I mean, Colonel Friedrich is deliciously handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie! You are married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that does not mean I am not shallow for your sake,\u201d Marie said with a wicked smile.</p><p>Cinderella rolled her eyes in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will celebrate Aveyron\u2019s momentary freedom before Queen Freja can smack me with another fine,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Marie pronounced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella stood, gathering her basket from its position next to the settee. \u201cEven so, I haven\u2019t the time to slack.

It will soothe him to hear of the conversation from your lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Cinderella doubtfully said. \u201cI\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll be able to see him today, though. It is the day of the Victory Ball. Much of the Army has either been invited to the party, or will be guarding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will have enough time to talk to you.

Farewell,\u201d Cinderella said, embracing her friend before traipsing down the stairs. She set off at a quick walk, humming under her breath as she trekked across Werra.</p><p>She walked down small streets, winding through one of the few residential parts of the city. Houses were smashed against each other like fish packed in a crate, but the occupants seemed happy. Housewives met to gossip while doing the day\u2019s wash; children played together in the streets, and a few grandmothers crowded on someone\u2019s porch, mending and darning clothes.</p><p>It was mostly Trieux folk who lived in this part of the city, but Cinderella knew three streets up was an Erlauf neighborhood. \u201cI wonder if it looks at all different,\u201d Cinderella said, turning around to look back down the street.</p><p>That was how she caught sight of her tail\u2014a bland, harmless looking man. He hadn\u2019t the blonde hair of a Trieux, nor did he have the dark hair of a man from Erlauf. He looked watery, with weedy hair and abnormally dark eyes. The oddest thing about him was his long, black cape and cowl. Fall would soon begin, but the weather was still hot, and the sun shone with enough intensity to make Cinderella sweat.</p><p>He stared at her, not bothering to hide his fixed gaze. He moved his arms, pushing back his cloak. Black jewels and rat pelts hung from a chain that swooped across his chest. As he watched Cinderella, he unhooked a black jewel and held it in a fist. He spoke to it, and black vapor rose from his hand.</p><p>A chill crawled up Cinderella\u2019s spine, and the necklace Friedrich gave her turned as cold as ice.</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>Her instincts kicked in, and Cinderella started running. She shot up the street like a rabbit, shooting between a swarm of playing children and dodging around carts, horses, chickens, and geese.</p><p>As she turned a corner, she glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>The man in the black cape wasn\u2019t moving, but he was less than a block behind her. It was as if instead of running, he was moved to whatever location he desired.</p><p>Cinderella ran into another habited neighborhood, casting a terrified gaze around the streets. Where were her guards? Did they not follow her in the city? Cinderella generally didn\u2019t bother to look for them when off Aveyron lands.</p><p>The First Regiment camp was too far away for Cinderella to reach before the black magic user caught her. She didn\u2019t want to leave public sight\u2014but she didn\u2019t want to drag any helpless innocents into the fight either.</p><p>\u201cPatrol point,\u201d Cinderella huffed, skidding as she planted her feet and started running in a different direction. If Cinderella could reach a central patrol point\u2014where all patrols for the area started and ended\u2014there would be over a dozen soldiers stationed there.</p><p>Bless the Army for increased patrols, and bless me for memorizing their routes for library trips, Cinderella thought, risking another glance over her shoulder.</p><p>The tail was behind her, but on the corner she just skirted. He looked in several directions, searching for her.</p><p>Cinderella vaulted into an empty wagon tied in front of a house, and wriggled beneath a bundle of burlap sacks.</p><p>She held her breath and prayed her pounding heart wouldn\u2019t reveal her as the black mage walked up the street, moving bonelessly.</p><p>His eyes skipped over the wagon, and Cinderella gasped in air when the mage was one street up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whatever his magic skills are, they don\u2019t include tracking, Cinderella thought as she slithered out of wagon. All the same, I should head to the patrol point and send word to Friedrich.</p><p>Somewhere in all the running, Cinderella wound up in the Erlauf neighborhood. Her red hair stuck out among the fair, straw-haired Trieux peasants, but it was more of a flaming beacon among the small scattering of dark-haired Erlauf commoners who walked the streets.</p><p>Cinderella crouched low to the ground to minimize the possibility of being sighted and crept along the houses, ignoring the odd looks from the few commoners on the street.</p><p>She crouched behind a cluster of barrels and winced. Something cold pressed against the skin of her chest. Cinderella realized it was the dragon necklace Friedrich gave her when he first presented her to her soldiers. She tried to dig it out from under her dress, for it felt like a chunk of ice freezing to her skin, when she heard crying.</p> <p>Down the street came the black magic user, dragging an Erlauf woman behind him by her glossy brown hair-braid.</p><p>The woman sobbed, her face twisted in pain. \u201cPlease, let me go,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>The necklace forgotten, Cinderella peered at those in the streets. They would help the poor woman, wouldn\u2019t they?</p><p>The street walkers were statue still, as if carved out of colorful chunks of stone. They didn\u2019t blink, and they didn\u2019t move, even when the black mage clenched a dirty hand around the young woman\u2019s throat.</p><p>The woman struggled, clawing at the mage\u2019s hand. She gurgled and coughed as life was choked from her.</p> <p>If I jump him, he will kill me, Cinderella thought. But if I don\u2019t, he will kill her. An Erlauf woman.</p><p>The black mage turned, looking up and down the street. He was waiting for her. When Cinderella didn\u2019t appear, the mage\u2019s fist encased with black vapor, and the woman\u2019s frantic thrashings became more like the twitches of a dying animal.</p><p>The smell of burnt flesh filled the street.</p><p>Cinderella grimaced, and when the black mage turned his back to her, she pushed her way up a narrow stairway that led to the second floor of the shanty she was pressed against.</p><p>The black mage lifted the woman off her feet and held her high above his head, showing off his prize.</p><p>The commoners on the street didn\u2019t react, and everything was still\u2014except for the dying woman.</p> <p>The black magic user lowered the woman\u2014although he kept his hands fastened around her neck.</p><p>She choked, her eyes rolling back as she convulsed, almost dead.</p><p>The black mage looked down at the nearly dead woman in undisguised pleasure, so he did not see Cinderella when she flung herself off the roof of the house directly next to him.</p><p>Cinderella landed on the mage with enough force to knock him to the ground. Sitting on top of him, Cinderella grabbed him by the throat of his cloak. She slammed his head into the ground two times before he blasted her with his dark magic, sending her careening into the front door of a house.</p><p>Cinderella was up in an instant, even though her ears rang and her sight was fuzzy. If she stayed down she would die. \u201cHELP!\u201d she shouted, her voice loud but shaky.</p><p>The nearly strangled woman was frozen like the others. As Cinderella grabbed a pitchfork leaning against the house, she glanced at the woman long enough to be assured she was breathing.</p><p>Cinderella charged the mage with the pitchfork. The mage\u2014who seemed to take an abnormally long time to move\u2014barely slithered aside in time to avoid being stabbed. He grabbed hold of the pitchfork\u2014which Cinderella easily released\u2014and tossed it away.</p><p>Cinderella had already armed herself with a wooden bucket when the mage turned back to her. She swung the bucket at the mage and clocked him in the skull.</p> <p>\u201cHELP!\u201d Cinderella screamed again before winding the bucket back for another pass.</p><p>The mage shot a stream of his vaporous magic at her. Cinderella dodged, but it brushed her bucket and disintegrated it.</p><p>Cinderella tossed the remaining piece of the bucket\u2014the rope handle\u2014away and groped for another weapon. She found a hoe, but the mage bore down on her.</p><p>He blasted her with another wave of magic, sending her crashing into the wagon she previously hid in.</p><p>Her head lolling, Cinderella groaned in pain. She struggled to keep her eyes open long enough to watch the mage glide towards her, his skeletal hands extended like claws.</p><p>He was almost to her when an arrow pierced his shoulder. He made a choking gasp\u2014the first noise he made since the pursuit started\u2014and the black vapor cloaking his hands disappeared.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d he muttered, staring at his dirty fingers Three Erlauf soldiers were on him in an instant. Two secured his arms and a third smacked what looked like a seal drawn on a piece of parchment on the mage\u2019s chest.</p><p>The paper clung to the mage\u2019s clothes, and the mage howled. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The mage thrashed, but the soldiers secured his legs and arms with shackles.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Your Grace; we were nearly too late,\u201d Ivo said, helping Cinderella stand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other two soldiers held the mage in place and smacked him with more paper seals.</p><p>\u201cHold him still.

His voice was deep, and he was about as wide as an ox. He held the pitchfork Cinderella used to try and stab the mage, but he held it with ease and dexterity as he eyed the mage.</p><p>Ivo nodded in the direction of the woman. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>The man planted the pitchfork and leaned on it.

But Friedrich rarely approves of my actions the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped her, lady?\u201d the ox man said, squinting at Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cIvo, I believe I can stand on my own, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the ox man asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you help her?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella frowned. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo save yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but I couldn\u2019t just leave her to die,\u201d Cinderella said, gingerly touching the back of her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said when the ox man stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from Trieux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The ox man shook his head. He opened his mouth, but before he could further inquire, Ivo interrupted him. \u201cI hear the whistle. Tobias is on his way back,\u201d Ivo said, stepping to help the other soldier, who was anchoring the squirming, bleeding mage in place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost, mage. Save your strength,\u201d the other soldier said, shaking the mage like a terrier shaking a rat.</p><p>\u201cYou and every pest like you that approaches the lady will be crushed,\u201d Ivo growled.</p><p>The mage laughed, a horrible noise raspy and wet with blood. \u201cI have lost,\u201d he said with a whispering hiss. \u201cBut we will not fail. Trieux and Erlauf will be torn asunder. And then they will fester and rot, smothered by their own bitterness and hatred. You all will die,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Cinderella said, \u201care you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not engage in conversation with him, Your Grace,\u201d Ivo said.</p><p>\u201cErlauf and Trieux will remain divided, and darkness thrives in division. We will come for you, and this will be our homeland\u2014a land of all things vile and powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivision, you say?\u201d Cinderella asked, taking a step closer.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Ivo pleaded.</p><p>Cinderella ignored him. Her gray eyes raged like hurricanes, hypnotic and furious. \u201cYou are lying.\u201d</p><p>The mage laughed. \u201cLook to your people! Look to those of Erlauf. You think I am the first to try and kill you? The others didn\u2019t even have magic. Trieux hates Erlauf, and Erlauf hates Trieux. It plays out in your very life. Do you really think that will ever change? War has filled your hearts with hatred. Hatred takes root, and never fails to destroy those who nurture it in their hearts. You are doomed,\u201d the mage broke off.</p><p>Cinderella stood tall. The strength of her presence made the mage shift in place. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think I will allow your kind in my country, in Erlauf, you are sorely mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do nothing,\u201d the mage protested.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Cinderella said, her accent more noble and royal than usual. \u201cIs that why you were trying to kill me?\u201d</p><p>The mage fell silent.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Tobias,\u201d Ivo said, nodding down the street. \u201c Good. He has an entire squad with him.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella turned to look.</p><p>The mage snarled and jumped from the soldier holding him captive, lunging for Cinderella.</p><p>Ivo shouted, and the mage screamed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was over in the time it took Cinderella to turn around. The mage was dead, speared by the pitchfork-wielding Erlauf man.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Ivo said in disgust. \u201cThe Colonel will be angry. I\u2019m sure he would have wanted to question him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was our fault for failing to hold him,\u201d Ivo\u2019s companion soldier said.</p><p>Cinderella retreated several steps and averted her eyes from the gory sight. \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she said, to the ox-man, her voice shaking.</p> <p>\u201cHe was right,\u201d her rescuer said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>The ox-man kicked the dead mage as soldiers trooped down the road. \u201cWe hate,\u201d the ox-man said.</p><p>Cinderella opened her mouth to reply, but the ox-man continued, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no hope,\u201d he said, turning around to watch the injured Erlauf woman stand unsteadily. \u201cNot when a Trieux lady is willing to risk \u2018er life for an Erlauf woman.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella smiled wanly. \u201cAnd not when an Erlauf man risks his neck for a Trieux lady.\u201d</p> <p>The ox-man bobbed his head, and then the soldiers were on them.</p><p>The lieutenant of the squadron and an accompanying captain were riding horses. Ivo picked Cinderella up and tossed her on the captain\u2019s horse before she noticed how close the animal was.</p><p>\u201cGather the mage\u2019s body. We will meet you at camp,\u201d the captain said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ivo said with a smart salute.</p><p>The captain and lieutenant exchanged nods before cuing their horses into a canter. Cinderella clung to the captain and his horse as the city bounced past. There was more than one close call when they almost ran into a wagon or loose animals, but the officers would not slow their pace.</p><p>Before Cinderella could believe it, they were riding into the First Regiment\u2019s camp. \u201cAttack, attack on Lady Lacreux,\u201d the lieutenant shouted.</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Cinderella said, her stomach gurgling from the crazed ride and the image of the violently killed mage dancing in her mind.</p><p>\u201cHave no fear. You\u2019re safe now, Lady,\u201d the captain said, sliding off his horse before helping her down.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d Cinderella said, her head swimming.</p><p>\u201cCinderella?\u201d Friedrich shouted. His voice was pinched, and he broke through the ring of soldiers surrounding Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt? What happened?\u201d Friedrich asked.</p><p>\u201cFriedrich,\u201d Cinderella gasped.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think I\u2019m going to be sick again.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella was curled like a cat on the thin pallet she had dragged to the spot of sunshine at the window. The heat and light caressed her, driving back the nightmares of the mage attack.</p><p>The door to Friedrich\u2019s office opened. Cinderella opened an eye to watch Friedrich duck past Ensign Kurt.</p><p>Cinderella yawned and sat up, ringed by a halo of sunlight. \u201cYou have questions for me?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich crouched down in front of her and placed a hand on her cheek. \u201cSorry, Pet, but the more we learn, the safer you will be,\u201d he said, leaning forward so his forehead touched hers.</p><p>Cinderella pushed Friedrich back with a finger. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell,\u201d she said. \u201cI left Marie\u2019s and noticed I had a tail\u2014and he wasn\u2019t one of yours. He chased me, and I hid, intending to steal my way to the nearest patrol point. I think it irritated him because that was when he found the Erlauf woman. Somehow, he froze everyone on the streets, and I was the only one available to help the poor woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you attacked him,\u201d Friedrich wryly said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy flinging yourself off a roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvo was proud of me for that part.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich held his tongue, but the look he gave Cinderella said he was not impressed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time I\u2019m attacked I shouldn\u2019t run? I did it automatically\u2014because of the library and everything\u2014but it seems I ran so fast, I left Ivo and his compatriots behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cThe mage identified them before you came out of Marie\u2019s house and froze them in place. It was good you ran\u2014you took him so far away, they were out of the range of his magic and recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the mage freeze me in place as he froze everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume he tried, Pet, but because you wear my token of devotion he couldn\u2019t,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella narrowed her eyes. \u201cFriedrich, now is hardly the time\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely serious,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cThe necklace isn\u2019t a bauble I found in the market. It\u2019s laced with magic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella dug into the neckline of her dress to pull the dragon emblem out. She studied it with new appreciation.</p><p>\u201cIt will cancel out any weak levels of magic. The mage\u2019s freezing magic was amateur leveled\u2014one can judge so by the radius around him that he froze. He was usually confined to one city block. Which yes, was enough, but a master mage would freeze at least three blocks, and I would rather not think what a fully credited enchanter could do,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cThe necklace can also neutralize poisons, but to do that you must smear it in your foods and drink first. Your kitchen servants are trustworthy, so I thought it was unnecessary to mention that particular feature to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich, this must have cost you a fortune,\u201d Cinderella gaped, staring at the dragon with new appreciation. Magical artifacts of any kind were highly prized, but one that had the power to block magic\u2014even of a low level\u2014never mind the poison, cost as much as a small manor.</p><p>\u201cIt cost me nothing,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cBecause it is mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been walking around without it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live with 600 soldiers trained for all types of combat. You live with several dozen servants who have only recently become acquainted with the art of farming. You need it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting the necklace aside, after learning firsthand of the mage\u2019s magic, my men chose to attack him from afar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, with the arrow,\u201d Cinderella recalled. \u201cIt must have broken the mage\u2019s concentration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it sealed a bit of his power\u2014which gave them time to get closer and completely cut off his magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what those paper seals were?\u201d Cinderella asked, interested.</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not be able to produce those to sell,\u201d Friedrich said, correctly interpreting her bright eyes. \u201cIt requires a magician with certain strengths to build magic-binding seals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cinderella said, her shoulders slouching.</p><p>\u201cThey cost a pretty penny,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cPerhaps it would be worth it to see that the Army employs such a magician. They are scribe magicians\u2014not enchanters\u2014so I suppose it might be cheaper to employ one than buy the seals in bulk through the Veneno Conclave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they are so expensive, why did my guards have them?\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>Friedrich stood. \u201cBecause there have been several attempts on your life. I assumed it was only a matter of time before a dark mage or magician tried his hand at killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...What?\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cH-how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVarious methods. My men have stopped each attack before it could even begin, which is why you never noticed.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stood as well, her expression stricken. \u201cHas anyone tried killing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone from Trieux?\u201d Cinderella asked, her voice taut like a harp string tightened too much.</p><p>Friedrich rubbed his eye. \u201cIt offends people that I cling to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cinderella sat down on her pallet, dazed. \u201cThen the mage was right. We are divided.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSurely that cannot come as a surprise,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cYou have been subjected to scorn because of me, and you seethe with hatred for Queen Freja, like most of your countrymen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I want anyone to kill over it,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich\u2019s expression softened. He again crouched in front of Cinderella and ran a hand through her silky hair. \u201cSometimes I forget just how good you are,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel hate towards Trieux?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>Friedrich shrugged. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have also made sacrifices for your country,\u201d Cinderella said, placing her finger tips on the Colonel\u2019s black eyepatch.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that I am missing an eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes having one less eye make me less attractive to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich,\u201d Cinderella warned.</p><p>\u201cThen, no. I can\u2019t say I mind\u2014now. But you are right. When it first happened, I was quite bitter,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella slumped. \u201cThen the mage was right; Trieux and Erlauf are seeped with hate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hatred will lessen over time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three years, Friedrich.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd the mage. He referred to a \u2018we.\u2019\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich sighed. \u201cYour brilliance is sometimes a curse. You remember the attempt on my life?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe have learned that the assailants were hired by a mage. The mage was not acting alone. She was a part of something, as far as we are aware, organized under no name or governing system. This force, whoever or whatever it is, seems intent on conquering lands. The royal offspring of many countries have been attacked. Some of them survive and free themselves\u2014as Prince Severin did. Others...We have not seen such wide spread co-operation between forces of darkness since the Snow Queen\u2019s time and the Enchanters came to power,\u201d Friedrich said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, he wasn\u2019t just spouting lies. There is something out there intent on destroying us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only us, but other countries as well. So far they haven\u2019t been able to gain a toehold here, but they seem to be narrowing their focus on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? The Erlauf royal family has escaped curses and magic-based attacks thus far,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cThey are aiming for the royal family, yes, but they also try to stir up unrest in general. We are an easy target not because of the royal family, but due to the bitterness that dwells between our people,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cDarkness is strongest among black emotions like rage, hatred, and bitterness.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella stared unseeingly at Friedrich\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cCinderella? Have I upset you?\u201d Friedrich asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI am angry with myself. I never thought\u2014I didn\u2019t see any of this. The darkness, the evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been occupied with Aveyron, and it is not your job to wipe out threats to our country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...,\u201d Cinderella sighed. She was quiet for several moments before she shook her head. \u201cI need to think. Am I free to go? I assume you must organize your men for the Victory Ball. It will start soon, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave like this,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cYou are upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only thinking,\u201d Cinderella said, smiling wanly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me; I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said as Friedrich helped her stand.</p><p>\u201cDo not take this as a personal affront, Cinderella,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cOur people have chosen this path of destruction. It isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cinderella said, her smile growing stronger.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>In the early evening hours, Cinderella listlessly sat in what used to be Aveyron\u2019s gardens. She leaned against a functioning bird bath and stared at a blooming wild rose bush that had grown to impressive new heights since the gardener was recruited to supervise crop fields.</p> <p>What do I do? Aveyron is saved...but if we are attacked...</p><p>Cinderella cut the thought off.</p><p>\u201cCinderella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Cinderella called.</p><p>Mariska, Lady Klara\u2019s youngest daughter, minced her way around the overgrown rose bush. \u201cMama said to tell you we are leaving for the ball. Our friends have come to pick us up,\u201d she said, smoothing the skirts of her saffron dress. The orange-yellow color complimented her dark hair.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Mariska smiled. \u201cThank you. I have a mask, see?\u201d she said, slipping a mask of the same saffron hue of her dress over her face. It covered her nose, circled her eyes, and was edged with gold beads. \u201cIt is to be a masquerade ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow charming,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cSilla insists it is a stupid idea, but I think it is romantic,\u201d Mariska said, removing her mask.</p><p>\u201cI am sure you will have a fine time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I do hope so,\u201d Mariska said. She awkwardly clasped her mask. \u201cYou are certain you don\u2019t want to come?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella held in a harsh bark of laughter. \u201cI am certain. Even if I wished to, it is too late now. I don\u2019t have anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could borrow something,\u201d Mariska offered. \u201cAlthough I think your hair would clash with all of my clothes, and I am rather tall...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your kindness, but I shall have to refuse,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cEnjoy your evening, Mariska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Good bye,\u201d Mariska said, saluting Cinderella with her mask before she hurried out of the gardens.</p><p>Cinderella listened to the clip-clop of horse hooves as the carriage Lady Klara\u2019s friends arrived in started on its way.</p><p>Cinderella rested her head against the bird bath. \u201cIt\u2019s so bleak. This is a war, but our soldiers can\u2019t even see the enemy and have no choice but to remain defensive...\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sighed. \u201cAnd this country...Even if I wish we didn\u2019t hate each other, both sides still exchange insults. Queen Freja strangles money out of us, and then we fester with hate and snarl at her soldiers who then smash us to prevent unrest. The searches, the constant patrols. They wouldn\u2019t be performed if they weren\u2019t necessary. Both sides hate each other too much. I don\u2019t think it can be breeched.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shifted and recalled a conversation she had with Friedrich. It felt like years ago, but it took place only two or three weeks prior.</p><p>\u201cYou can conquer a country with forgiveness.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cErlauf won\u2019t forgive. Queen Freja has proven she will not forgive,\u201d Cinderella said. She looked over her shoulder at the immense chateau. \u201cI have enough trouble as it is. I don\u2019t need to go solving our country\u2019s problems as well.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s mind was assaulted with the memory of the mage holding the poor, defenseless Erlauf woman above his head, his hands covered with black magic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlast,\u201d Cinderella muttered. \u201cBLAST!\u201d she shouted, making the goats\u2014that were still loose on the lawn\u2014look up at her in wonder.</p><p>\u201cFather... what would you have done? Oh, I know\u2014you would have run to Loire,\u201d Cinderella said, her heart still smarting from that revelation. \u201c...Or would you?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sat up, her thoughts racing. Her father bought Windtop Manor in the chaotic month before Erlauf swallowed Trieux into their country. Shortly after the takeover, the mass murdering of the Trieux nobles took place. There was then a few months\u2019 gap before Queen Freja ordered Cinderella\u2019s father to marry Lady Klara.</p><p>If her father meant to flee, why didn\u2019t he?</p> <p>\u201cHe bought the manor before our servants saved us. After, maybe he decided to stay,\u201d Cinderella said, excited. Her hopeful smile fell from her face. \u201cOr maybe he just didn\u2019t get the chance to leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cinderella closed her eyes and recalled her father\u2019s face, his warm smile, and soothing laughter. \u201cPapa wouldn\u2019t have spread hate,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEven when everyone else was taken captive, he said it was our fault for going after Erlauf first.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella scrambled to her feet. \u201cI will never know if my father meant for us to flee to Loire and leave our servants behind, or if he had another plan entirely. What I do know is that he wouldn\u2019t want me to stand by and watch everyone be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shifted her eyes from the great chateau to the distant city lights. \u201cAnd if that mage meant to murder me, it must mean that I can challenge this shared hatred.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s mind buzzed like a humming bird as she stalked to the front of her property. There were a million things she had to do, and she had to do them immediately.</p> <p>As much as the finances pained her, it was time to hire a few Erlauf servants\u2014perhaps people who knew something of flowers and could assist Cinderella\u2019s poor, over-worked gardener with future flower crops.</p><p>She needed to start hosting again\u2014not the elaborate parties of ages past, but simple and tasteful dinners. She could invite Julien and his Erlauf miss, and Marie and Armel, and whatever officers Friedrich could rustle up. The separation had to end.</p><p>Worst of all, she would have to face Queen Freja and her family. \u201cIf we have to forgive, that means I must forgive,\u201d Cinderella said through clenched teeth. \u201cThis desire, it\u2019s too big for me. How can I change a country when my reach is only to Werra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have dropped your illusion and attacked her with your regular magic\u2014regulations or not,\u201d a cheerful, grandmother-y voice said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already in trouble for using magic in Arcainia. The last thing I need is another broken rule for the Conclave to wave in my face,\u201d said another voice, which was far more youthful and slightly lower pitched.</p><p>\u201cYes, but that wretched queen would be safely dead, and the princes wouldn\u2019t be flapping about as barnyard fowl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t, so our hope rests in Princess Elise. You are sure there is no easy test I can use to sense the strength of her magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with that magic type, dearie. It would take a powerful enchanter to probe her limitations. Your master could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSybilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. Well here is how I see it: Send Elise to face this Queen Clotilde and stand in reserve. If it looks like she will lose, step in, and use your real magic. Sooner or later, you will have to face it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say so. What are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to see a girl. My sources tell me the lady of the house had a nasty run in with a mage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA black mage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betcha. I would like to question her to see what more we can learn.\u201d</p> <p>The two speakers rounded the corner of shrubbery that shielded them from Cinderella\u2019s sight, and Cinderella felt her breath leave her.</p><p>The first speaker\u2014the grandmother-y voice\u2014was a short, squat woman who wore golden wire eyeglasses. She had salt and pepper hair, but it was soft and shiny like a housecat\u2019s fur. She wore a friendly smile, and every part of her plump person leaked comfort and joy.</p><p>Her companion was a stark contrast.</p><p>The lower pitched speaker was also female, but she was young like a blooming flower and was beautiful enough to steal Cinderella\u2019s breath. Her eyes glittered like brightly polished jewels, her hair looked softer than silk, and she wore an iridescent blue dress, which seemed to turn purple as Cinderella gaped.</p><p>\u201cHello there, dearie,\u201d the grandmother-woman said, flapping a hand at Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cYou did not tell me you were here to see Duchess Lacreux,\u201d the beautiful woman said.</p><p>\u201cI am. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duchess is famous for her scarlet-colored hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been tramping across the earth for how long on your doomed quest, and you still can remember that the Trieux Duchess has red hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fact I recently learned while I was looking for these,\u201d the beautiful lady said as held a pair of sparkling glass slippers at her companion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeems impractical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for a mirror. I was told of a \u2018magic glass\u2019 in Werra and thought to give it a try. The rumor never added the last word: slippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dearie.\u201d</p><p>The beautiful woman shrugged. \u201cWhat can one do? But I am being rude. Duchess Lacreux, please forgive our discourtesy and allow us to introduce ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am a Sybilla, a First Appraised Isolator Rank Yellow, charged with childcare and development: a fairy godmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am Angelique, an Enchantress-in-training.\u201d</p><p>It took every bit of Cinderella\u2019s pre-war training to shut her mouth and curtsey. \u201cWelcome, madams,\u201d she said, her voice calm even though she wanted to scream.</p><p>A fairy godmother and an enchantress were standing on Aveyron soil.</p><p>Enchanters were the highest magic rank one could achieve, and a fairy godmother was right below it.</p> <p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>The fairy godmother adjusted her spectacles and pulled a length of parchment and a full-sized quill out of a pouch the size of Cinderella\u2019s palm. \u201cI was told this afternoon you had an encounter with a black mage. Could you describe him for me\u2014oh dear,\u201d the woman said when Cinderella\u2019s legs buckled, and she sat down hard on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cinderella said, trying to push herself to her feet. \u201cPlease forgive my\u2014,\u201d Cinderella cast around for the right word in her brain, but she grew distracted when she realized her cheeks were wet with tears.</p><p>Horrified with herself, Cinderella almost leaped out of her skin when the Lady Enchantress knelt before her. \u201cDo not be alarmed; it is sometimes difficult for a person to be in the presence of magic as powerful as Sybilla\u2019s, even if she is not using it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself, dearie,\u201d the fairy godmother chortled.</p><p>\u201cI can tell your heart is pained. What troubles you, Duchess Lacreux?\u201d Angelique asked.</p> <p>It was the Enchantress\u2019s sympathetic eyes that did Cinderella in.</p><p>Cinderella burst into tears. Not soft, quiet, beautiful tears, but loud, snotty ones that made her face red and splotchy. Somewhere between the sobs and hiccups, Sybilla the fairy godmother joined Cinderella and Angelique on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, dearie. A good cry is just what a girl needs, sometimes,\u201d she said, patting Cinderella with a plump hand.</p><p>When Cinderella\u2019s tears slowed to the occasional trickle, she reluctantly accepted a white lace handkerchief from the Lady Enchantress.</p><p>\u201cNow, what has you so upset?\u201d Sybilla asked.</p><p>Cinderella swallowed with some difficulty and stared at the handkerchief. \u201cIt is as you said. Today I was attacked by a black mage.\u201d</p><p>Sybilla nodded. \u201cA run in with one of those brutes is enough to make any lady cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not it. I-I didn\u2019t know\u2014or maybe I didn\u2019t see\u2014how Trieux\u2019s hatred for Erlauf and Erlauf\u2019s hatred for Trieux is ruining us. The black mage said we would destroy ourselves, and darkness would rule here. I talked to someone, and he said if we want to survive, our attitudes must change, and our people must change. But I don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you not the only Trieux Duchess, the highest ranked of all remaining nobles?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but what can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear lady, forgive me for being blunt, but what can\u2019t you do?\u201d Sybilla kindly asked. \u201cEvery person in your beloved country is born with potential to change the world. But you, who desire to spark the change, have been dealt an incredible hand to play. You are a duchess. I have been in Erlauf for just a few days, and even I have heard how you string the Erlauf First Regiment along like a girl leading a lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect you are thinking of firepower, Duchess Lacreux,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cYou believe you don\u2019t have the power to fight back because you haven\u2019t an army to your name or magic to shield those you love?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella nodded. \u201cThere are things I can do\u2014things that will affect Aveyron and perhaps Werra. But how can I extend my reach? All of Trieux festers with hate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe, Duchess, you underestimate the power of kindness. A gentle word, a smile, an act of compassion, these are the things that can turn hate to love,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cOr, if that is your worry, ally yourself with someone who can reach all corners of the country,\u201d Sybilla said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cQueen Freja, of course,\u201d Sybilla said, adjusting her eyeglasses.</p><p>\u201cAnd how will I win Queen Freja to my side?\u201d Cinderella asked, fighting some of her own prejudices.</p><p>Sybilla patted Cinderella\u2019s hand. \u201cDear, it might not be a matter of \u2018winning\u2019 her. Have any of you nobles from Trieux tried to talk with her?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was silent.</p><p>\u201cSpeak to her. She is a brilliant queen, not a tyrant,\u201d Sybilla recommended.</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is no time like the present. Isn\u2019t there a ball coming up? I nearly drowned in the invitations when the queen learned I was here,\u201d Sybilla said.</p><p>\u201cIt is tonight,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cPerfect! There you have it\u2014a ball is a public party. You will freely be able to approach the queen, or at least a member of the royal family,\u201d Sybilla said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said, warming to the subject.</p> <p>\u201cIf the ball is being held now, you ought to go change so you may leave as soon as possible,\u201d Sybilla helpfully added.</p><p>Cinderella blinked. \u201cI haven\u2019t any dresses suitable for the occasion. My step-sister said I could borrow something of hers\u2014though she is taller than me,\u201d Cinderella frowned. \u201cI know\u2014I can walk to Werra and borrow something from Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorrow? Borrow? Goodness, no. There will be no borrowing of ball gowns tonight,\u201d Sybilla said, shivering as if the word was dirty.</p><p>\u201cThan what am I to wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d Angelique said, standing up. Her dress was spotless and perfect even though she should have wrinkled it while sitting on the ground. \u201cI am a little skilled in alteration magic. If you do not mind the wait, I should have something suitable in a minute or two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that case, please excuse me, so I may wash,\u201d Cinderella said, shakily rising. She ran to the well and scrubbed at her hands, face, and neck. She poked her head in the kitchen, looking for some of Aveyron\u2019s servants, but they were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Cinderella looked through the chateau for a few minutes before she gave up and rushed back to the enchantress and fairy godmother.</p><p>\u201cAhh, there she is,\u201d Sybilla said, clapping her hands.</p><p>\u201cPlease hold still for a moment, Duchess Lacreux,\u201d Angelique said. She walked a circle around Cinderella, first brushing Cinderella\u2019s chin-length hair.</p><p>Immediately Cinderella\u2019s head was heavy with hair as her long, scarlet locks draped to her elbow. As if it had a mind of its own, her hair started moving, braiding small tendrils that pinned themselves to the crown of her head with pearl-topped pins and white roses the size of a thumbnail.</p><p>When Angelique touched the sleeve of Cinderella\u2019s dress, the fabric changed to a beautiful shade of snow-white silk. The changed fabric bloomed across Cinderella, rearranging itself as it moved, and grew until Cinderella had a full-skirted dress that brushed the ground. The tops of her shoulders were bare, but a stretch of pale, storm-gray fabric skirted around the top of Cinderella\u2019s dress and glided around the sides of her arms before fastening in the back. A similar shade of fabric gathered at the waist, held in place by a string of pearls.</p> <p>Gloves the same storm-gray as the highlighter fabric encased her hands and ran up to her elbow. Pearl bracelets appeared on her wrists, and a pearl necklace with a diamond shaped like a heart draped across her chest and fastened itself at the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cIt is a masquerade ball, yes?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cThen you will need this,\u201d Angelique said, brushing her palms together. As she slid her hands apart she revealed a mask\u2014covered with white silk and storm-gray lace\u2014that would cover Cinderella\u2019s nose and circle around her eyes\u2014just as Mariska\u2019s mask did. She handed it to Cinderella, who held it close to admire the lace pattern.</p><p>\u201cAnd for the final touch,\u201d Angelique said, placing the glass slippers she held on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d Cinderella protested.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Angelique smiled. \u201cThey are not what I was searching for, and I have no use for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot thank you enough,\u201d Cinderella said, sliding her feet into the shoes. They were surprisingly comfortable\u2014as if made of pillows of water rather than glass. \u201cYou have helped me beyond what I could have dreamed of. Is there nothing I can do for you?\u201d</p> <p>The Lady Enchantress shook her head. \u201cIt is the duty of those of us gifted with magic to use it for whatever good purposes we can find. I am pleased I could help you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shyly brushed the fabric of her dress. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her cheeks turning light pink.</p><p>\u201cNow, shall we call for your footmen and carriage?\u201d Sybilla asked, eagerly clapping her hands.</p><p>Cinderella smiled uneasily. \u201cI will walk.\u201d</p><p>Sybilla blinked. \u201cWalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAveyron does not have a carriage, and I cannot use the horses. They have worked all day and are likely to be eating their evening hay.\u201d</p><p>Angelique cleared her throat and thoughtfully looked away. Sybilla gaped, her jaw hanging. \u201cNo carriage?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. We shall fix that\u2014temporarily at least,\u201d Sybilla said. She turned and studied the goats. \u201cNo, but I will be back for you later,\u201d she said to the unconcerned livestock. \u201cCows\u2014oh goodness no. You can hardly have spotted horses. Sheep? Too stupid. Hmm, I know. Attention, creatures. This young lady is in need of some assistance to reach a ball. Are there any volunteers?\u201d</p><p>Aveyron was silent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella shifted her gaze to Angelique to see if this was acceptable behavior for a fairy godmother, when there was scuttling at her feet.</p><p>Four clean, well-fed mice scurried across the lawn, stopping in front of Sybilla.</p><p>One mouse sat on his hind legs and twitched his nose at Sybilla. The other three mice cleaned their whiskers and occasionally helped pat a neighbor\u2019s fur into place.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I see. I\u2019m sure she will not object to that,\u201d Sybilla said. \u201cIn that case, I thank you for your kindness. Now, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, be horses.\u201d</p> <p>There was a bang, and a cloud of smoke encased Sybilla.</p><p>\u201cDrat! I forgot about that,\u201d Sybilla coughed from inside the cloud. \u201cWhere are you, mice? Oof!\u201d</p><p>When the smoke rolled away, four horses, outfitted in black harnesses, were lined up in front of Sybilla. The horses twitched their noses a little too often, and their fur was the same shiny, well-kept, velvet brown as the four mice, but they took to their new bodies quite well.</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d Cinderella gulped.</p><p>\u201cSybilla\u2019s magic,\u201d Angelique was quick to add.</p> <p>\u201cYoo-hoo! Yes, you two! I need a footman and a driver. What say you?\u201d Sybilla called out to the two nearest goats.</p><p>The goats chewed mouthfuls of grass and looked unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cHow is that for gratuity? Is anyone else more prone to honor than these two pigs?\u201d Sybilla called to the rest of the herd.</p><p>An ancient, shriveled buck goat Cinderella kept because she didn\u2019t have the heart to see him slain approached Sybilla with one of the year\u2019s baby goats\u2014a doeling.</p><p>The doeling pranced and jumped, leaping over the back of the old goat, who baaed at Sybilla before knocking the doeling in the head with his horns.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much. I assure you the mice won\u2019t be much trouble. I\u2019ve already given them directions,\u201d Sybilla said. \u201cNow, be men!\u201d</p> <p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cHerm. That was embarrassing,\u201d Sybilla said as the goat baaed at her. \u201cI beg your pardon. Be a man and a girl!\u201d</p><p>There was another explosion of smoke. When it cleared, an elderly driver dressed smartly in white and gray stood with a young girl who wore gray breeches, a white shirt, and a white hat.</p><p>\u201cVery good; you both look grand. If you would stand with the horses, please. Now, a carriage. Duchess Lacreux, have you any pots or apple baskets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I see a pumpkin patch yonder. It is the wrong season, but with luck, that will make the pumpkin more cooperative,\u201d Sybilla said, striding off towards a field.</p><p>She returned some minutes later, a suspiciously round carriage plated in gold rolling after her. The mice-horses arranged themselves in front of the carriage\u2014their harnesses curling into place by magic\u2014while the goat driver climbed into place.</p><p>The goat footgirl opened the door of the round carriage, revealing an inside of orange satin.</p> <p>\u201cI could not get it to entirely agree with me, but no one will see the interior anyway,\u201d Sybilla grudgingly said. \u201cNow, dearie, I am sorry to say it, but this magic will only work until midnight. The mice need to be home by then, and I must confess I need to leave the Werra city limit, and once I do, my magic will cease functioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Angelique frowned. \u201cI, too, must be leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff to see that Arcainian princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If she can overtake Clotilde, it would be wisest to make our move as swiftly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Angelique said before turning her attention to Cinderella. \u201cI will stay in the area with Sybilla until midnight, but on a night as suitable as this for my mount, I really should ride. When I fall out of range, my magic will fade as well. I apologize, but I cannot stay longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to apologize for. I cannot repay you for this,\u201d Cinderella said, gesturing to her clothes and the carriage.</p><p>\u201cIt was our delight,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cI wish you all the luck I can spare.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella shakily smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Sybilla narrowed her eyes at Cinderella. \u201cDo not be afraid, dearie. Your good cheer has more power than you know. Even your animals know you labor for them. Now, run along. You are fashionably late, but you haven\u2019t much time to spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cinderella said, accepting the goat-footgirl\u2019s help into the round carriage. The door closed after her, and Cinderella barely had enough time to push aside an orange, velvet curtain to wave at the magical women before the carriage jolted forward.</p><p>Dazed, Cinderella sat back into the satin covered bench. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Victory Ball to speak to Queen Freja,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart pounded in her throat, and Cinderella\u2019s mind buzzed. What should she say? What could she say? No one would mistake her for an Erlauf lady, but did everyone know of her brilliant red hair?</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say my name. Not yet. Even if someone in the court does know of my red hair, they must also know I chopped it. Perhaps they will think I wore a wig as part of the masquerade. I don\u2019t think anyone will correctly guess who I am. I haven\u2019t even met any Erlauf nobility besides when I was presented to Queen Freja as the new duchess.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Cinderella felt ill-prepared when the carriage entered Werra. In less time than Cinderella would have liked, the mice-horses pranced to a stop in front of the palace, which glowed with the setting sun.</p> <p>The carriage door opened, and the goat girl helped Cinderella exit the pumpkin.</p><p>The palace entrance was lined with soldiers and guards. Cinderella looked for familiar faces among the men\u2014although she didn\u2019t see any\u2014as she climbed the stairs. They did not blink or even acknowledge her presence. They stood stiffly, their swords unsheathed but lowered.</p><p>Cowed by the silence and swords, Cinderella followed the burgundy runner rugs that lined the floor and led the way to the ballroom.</p><p>As the palace\u2014and thus the ballroom\u2014were built and designed by Trieux, the architecture was over the top with extravagance.</p><p>The ballroom was two levels\u2014the main floor housed swirling dancers and an orchestra. The second floor was nothing more than a balcony that edged the perimeter of the room, although it held over a hundred guests who strolled, murmured, and admired the views from the full-length windows. On both floors, there were patios and terraces made of the finest white marble that allowed attendees to enjoy the cool evening air and afforded them a lovely outlook of the royal gardens.</p> <p>The ceiling was vaulted and covered with ornate Trieux murals\u2014typically hunting scenes, the Trieux unicorn rearing beautifully, and meadow scenes. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling like glittering webs, and the floor was Trieux blue, made to compliment the night sky and set off the white marble.</p><p>The biggest feat of the room was the throne. The Trieux throne was a monstrosity of white and blue marble, set off by Trieux lavender cushions. The throne was placed on a platform created by the merging of three staircases. Two of the staircases cascaded down from the second floor, and the biggest rose up from the first floor to support the smaller two.</p><p>Chandeliers, blue curtains, and candelabras were arranged around and below the staircases to make the throne look as if it were rising up out of the stars.</p><p>Before Cinderella always thought it was beautiful imagery. Now, a member of the working class and responsible for the livelihood of all her employees, she felt the throne\u2014beautiful as it was\u2014was a tacky show of poor spending.</p><p>Queen Freja stood on the platform, some paces in front of the throne as if to distance herself from it.</p><p>The two Erlauf Princes stood at the base of the stairs that breeched the first level, standing in a military style and speaking to those who shuffled forward in the long line, waiting to speak to the queen. The consort was nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Cinderella considered joining the line until she caught whiff of the refreshments. \u201cFood,\u201d Cinderella said, abandoning her goal and following her nose.</p><p>Tables of food were laid out in a connecting room. There was stuffed cabbage, five kinds of smoked sausage, poppy seed rolls, crepes stuffed with nuts and chocolate sauce, chilled cherry soup, sweet plum dumplings, and many more traditional Erlauf dishes Cinderella did not have a hope of recognizing.</p><p>There were also tables of wines, brandies, and beer to consume, as well. None of the food or drinks bore even the vaguest hint of Trieux influence.</p><p>Cinderella bit her lip before she sampled a piece of sausage. It was fantastic. So fantastic that Cinderella gathered the courage to try the dishes she did not know.

It was simple, thank goodness. All Cinderella had to do was hold her dress with one hand and the Major\u2019s shoulder with the other.</p><p>The Major was a competent dancer. He swept Cinderella across the floor, keeping time with the other dancers.</p><p>Attempting conversation seemed awkward, so Cinderella allowed herself to be silently guided along. When the song finished, she dipped in an elegant curtsey.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the dance,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Lady,\u201d the major said, bowing over Cinderella\u2019s gloved hand and kissing her knuckles.</p><p>After Cinderella reclaimed her hand she muttered, \u201cPerhaps I have not given Friedrich enough credit. Maybe all Erlauf men are the grabbing type.\u201d</p><p>She directed her attention to the line of those waiting to address Queen Freja. The queue curled around the stairs. \u201cStill too long, back to the refreshments,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>When she turned around, she nearly smacked into an elegantly dressed male.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. I did not look to see where I was going,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNo harm done,\u201d the man\u2014he was perhaps a decade older than Cinderella\u2014said, straightening his jacket. \u201cSkirts, I have been told, could almost be considered a weapon. Would you care to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, thank you,\u201d Cinderella said, once again allowing herself to be pulled into a dance.</p><p>Her second time on the dance floor was slightly more difficult, as it was an Erlauf dance Cinderella rarely took part of. She did not mind the lack of conversation as she focused on moving her feet.</p><p>The beat was faster, and by the end of the song, Cinderella knew she was flushed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady, for the wonderful dance. You are very skilled,\u201d Cinderella\u2019s partner said when it was over.</p><p>\u201cYou are too kind,\u201d Cinderella said, breathing heavily. \u201cBut I thank you for the compliment, and for the dance,\u201d she curtsied.</p> <p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine,\u201d the man said, kissing Cinderella\u2019s knuckles like her previous partner.</p><p>Glad she was wearing gloves, Cinderella glanced at the line to the throne\u2014it was still long\u2014before she slipped through the crowd, making her way towards a patio.</p><p>\u201cLady, I beg you to forgive my impertinence, but would you grant me the pleasure of dancing with me?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella almost ignored the request\u2014he couldn\u2019t possibly be talking to her\u2014before she realized she was the only one standing near the man\u2014a middle-aged soldier. He looked to be in his late forties or early fifties. It was difficult to guess thanks to his half mask. His uniform was...different.</p><p>Cinderella couldn\u2019t put her finger on it, but the cut of his jacket was unusual, and he wore no identifying badges or medals.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cinderella said, allowing herself to be led back to the dancers and musicians.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the ball?\u201d her companion asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is lovely,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you enjoy most? The dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food. It is exquisite,\u201d Cinderella said with feeling.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s dance partner released a bark of laughter, drawing glances from some of their fellow dancers.</p><p>\u201cI am glad to hear you think so,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Cinderella noticed that as they swept past a group of soldiers, the men saluted.</p><p>Am I dancing with a general?</p><p>\u201cThe music is skillfully played, of course, and everyone is dressed beautifully,\u201d Cinderella added, slightly insulted by the humor he found in her choice.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of the venue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can say the Trieux Palace is not grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the throne?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was silent for a few beats. \u201cIt is mostly an eyesore,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>The solider\u2014or in all likelihood, officer\u2014smiled at Cinderella. \u201cIt is certainly gaudy. You could feed an army for at least a few months with the funds that monstrosity cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could buy a year\u2019s supply of seed and hay. Perhaps more,\u201d Cinderella said almost dreamily.</p><p>\u201cYou seem like you\u2019ve got a good head on your shoulders,\u201d Cinderella\u2019s dance companion said, his voice colored with approval.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I would like to think I do.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a few minutes more, until the dance was over and they parted ways.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the splendid dance, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Mademoiselle. You have done me a great service,\u201d the officer said. He bowed over Cinderella\u2019s hand but did not touch it with his lips. He clicked his heels, nodded at her, and disappeared in the crush of the crowd.</p><p>Encouraged by the fun, Cinderella once again tried to fight her way to the refreshments. Halfway there, another young man found her and begged her for a dance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This pattern continued for some time. Cinderella could scarcely understand her popularity among the men\u2014masked and parading around with the fair skin of a Trieux lady as she was\u2014but she rarely had a moment alone and did not have time to grab more than a few morsels from the refreshments before a new man would request her to dance with them.</p><p>After hours of dancing, Cinderella was hot and thirsty. She stole off to the refreshments, doing her best to dart behind ladies with large skirts and men of immense bulk. When she reached the tables of food, she greedily took several pieces of sausage\u2014having discovered she had a fondness for it\u2014and approached the table awash with drinks.</p><p>She stood there, trying to decide between a wine or an odd, sweet-smelling juice, when she heard male voices strolling in her direction.</p><p>\u201c\u2014barely made it back in time for the ball. My valet was dumping water on my head to get the goblin slime out of my hair as we rode back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many goblins were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree packs\u2014which was an unexpected surprise. We thought there would only be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose any men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Several were badly wounded though. We left them at the Semon\u00e8 fortification for medical attention.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella chewed her snacks and considered the voices and the implications of their conversation. Goblins moved in packs, but typically the packs didn\u2019t group up together due to the petty natures of the creatures. Furthermore, the last time goblins were seen in Trieux was over a century ago. The black mage hadn\u2019t lied. Darkness was coming. Wondering who would discuss such a thing at a ball, Cinderella risked a glance over her shoulder and choked on her sausage.</p> <p>Colonel Merrich and Lord Diederick\u2014both mask-less and grim faced\u2014strolled in her direction, heading for the drinks.</p><p>\u201cThat was smart of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. So, what have I missed? Have any fist-fights broken out?\u201d Colonel Merrich asked.</p><p>\u201cThe hour is not nearly late enough, and no one has had enough to drink, yet,\u201d Lord Diederick said.</p><p>Cinderella thumped herself on the chest as discreetly as possible to clear her throat before she snatched up a glass of the unidentifiable juice, glided\u2014even when hiding, it was not good for a lady to scurry\u2014behind a support pillar, and faced the entrance to the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cHave the mothers of eligible daughters hounded you all night?\u201d Colonel Merrich asked, selecting a brandy.</p> <p>\u201cNot so much. I suspect they were combing the crowds for you. An army officer is a better prize than a lord, after all,\u201d Lord Diederick said.</p><p>Cinderella peeked around the pillar. She needed to get out of the room without drawing their notice (as they were quite possibly the only two beings in the room capable of recognizing her) and, more importantly, she needed to find out what hour it was. Balls could continue until the wee hours of the morning, but Cinderella only had until midnight, and she still hadn\u2019t talked to Queen Freja.</p><p>\u201cIf you are so jealous of my status, you should have ditched the books in school and joined the Army with Friedrich and me.\u201d</p><p>Content they were absorbed in their conversation, Cinderella started for the door.</p><p>At that moment, a young man Cinderella recognized because he had already danced with her three times that evening and complimented her loudly during every dance, entered the refreshments room. He looked back and forth through the room, searching for someone.</p><p>Cinderella slid behind a woman wearing an elaborate mask and headdress designed to look like a sun. She couldn\u2019t catch the man\u2019s eye, or he would loudly greet her, drawing attention to them.</p><p>She could still hear the men talking from her new position. \u201cI pride myself that I will never sink so low as to be jealous of you.\u201d Lord Diederick said. \u201cI am not in my position for the glory, but the power. I have no use for social niceties, but having an entire financial administration at my beck and call? That is what I live for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Colonel Merrich said, drinking his Brandy. \u201cYou always were stiff-necked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will remember your words the next time I approve your payroll.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella gawked at the pair for the moment. Lord Diederick was in an administrative position? Why in the blazes was he her finance contact at the palace?</p><p>The young man/dancing enthusiast gave one last look around the room before he left. His exit was not a moment too soon, for Colonel Merrich and Lord Diederick started to turn their backs to the alcoholic drinks and face in Cinderella\u2019s direction.</p><p>Still carrying her drink, Cinderella cut in front of a couple and minced out of the room. Once in the ballroom, she downed her juice to moisten her dry mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I escaped that,\u201d she said before setting her empty goblet on a tray.</p><p>A nearby bell tower started to ring, and Cinderella listened to the tolls as she moved to join the reception line.</p><p>Cinderella winced when the tolls stopped. It was eleven. Thankfully the line to see Queen Freja was shortening\u2014it started at the base of the stairs where the princes stood rather than winding around behind them\u2014but depending how long it took, she may not have time to speak to the queen before midnight came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella started estimating how long it would take her to reach the front of the line, counting on her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Mademoiselle?\u201d asked a muffled voice.</p><p>The voice sounded familiar, so Cinderella automatically raised her eyes.</p><p>A young man dressed in black with a gray mask that covered his entire face addressed her. A crown was perched on his head. It was smaller and less ornate than the queen\u2019s, and was made of copper or bronze and had only a large ruby surrounded by polished beads of onyx to decorate it.</p> <p>The air left Cinderella\u2019s lungs as she realized she was addressing one of the Erlauf princes, and she had no idea what either of them were named. \u201cPrince...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCristoph. The older one,\u201d the prince said, his voice sounded amused rather than offended.</p><p>\u201cPrince Cristoph,\u201d Cinderella awkwardly repeated. \u201cI thank you for the attention, but I am fine. I was merely taking note of the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wondering if the wait was worth it to meet Mother?\u201d the prince said. His mask had no opening for his mouth, and the eyeholes were covered with white netting, so Cinderella could see no part of his face. As such, it was hard for Cinderella to tell if he was being sarcastic or not because the mask muffled his voice and made him sound flat. Additionally, he seemed to be speaking oddly, as if he were pitching his voice extra low.</p><p>\u201cI am sure Her Majesty Queen Freja is worth a wait of any length,\u201d Cinderella firmly said. \u201cBut I am not certain I can stay long enough to speak to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen speak with me, and when you return home, you can report to your family that you did speak to a member of royalty,\u201d Prince Cristoph said.</p><p>Cinderella considered the offer.</p><p>He\u2019s not the queen. But I suppose speaking to the Crown Prince is an excellent start.</p><p>\u201cVery well, if you are not opposed to spending some of your time on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Prince Cristoph said before directing Cinderella out of the line.</p><p>The second prince\u2014who wore clothes and a mask identical to Prince Cristoph\u2019s\u2014watched them leave, his face trained in their direction.</p> <p>\u201cWas there anything you wished to discuss with my mother?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d Cinderella said as she strolled with the prince.</p><p>People cleared the way for them, opening up a walking path wherever Cristoph went. Oddly enough, considering the way men had been kissing her hand and taking up her arm with no hesitation, the Prince did not lay so much as a finger on Cinderella, nor did he offer his arm as they walked.</p><p>\u201cDid you wish to scold her over the rising taxes?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked.</p><p>Cinderella frowned. \u201cI would not be so rude and poor mannered to address that topic, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you plan to discuss with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrieux.\u201d</p><p>Prince Cristoph stopped walking for a brief moment. \u201cI see. And what are your concerns?\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella took a deep breath and tried to calm her fluttering heart. \u201cI feel the attitude of Erlauf and the remaining Trieux citizens must be addressed. The people are locked in a struggle against each other, and it is not good for a country\u2014even one as strong as Erlauf\u2014to have a portion of it divided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Queen Freja should reestablish a Trieux government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStars above, no.\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella paused for a moment, composing her reply. Well, he hasn\u2019t made fun of me yet, she thought.</p><p>\u201cIt has come to my attention that Erlauf is under attack, not by another country, but by sheer evil. Trieux cannot stand against an enemy of that caliber. Releasing Trieux will only bring waste to the land,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds melodramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf this I am aware, but it cannot be denied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat proof do you have of this supposed evil?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella grimly considered the question. She had great proof\u2014her own experience, and Friedrich\u2019s words. But she would like to avoid identifying herself. Taking a chance, Cinderella said, \u201cIt is no used to pretend otherwise, Your Highness. I have heard of the various attacks against the Erlauf Royal family.\u201d</p><p>Prince Cristoph neither confirmed nor denied Cinderella\u2019s accusation. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d</p><p>This was it!</p><p>\u201cThe separation between those of Erlauf and those of Trieux must be done away with. It is more an operation of attitude than action, but to succeed Queen Freja will need to make a conscious effort,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYou expect her to heal the divide with kindness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate cannot drive out hate,\u201d Cinderella said, echoing Friedrich. \u201cAs long as hate is shared, Trieux and Erlauf will be in an eternal struggle.\u201d</p><p>Prince Cristoph was silent. \u201cI would not argue that,\u201d he finally said. \u201cBut it seems our lovely Queen will be footing the bill for this forgiveness you desire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot so,\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cI know people of influence among Trieux. They will do their best to offer forgiveness on their side, as well,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>She knew Julien was already on her side; Marie and her husband would be easy to sway\u2014there was something to be said about being a merchant who was more interested in profits than bad blood among nobles. Perhaps the Girards could be convinced, and if they were, the Delattre\u2019s would not be far behind. Also, Cinderella had a strange inkling that the half-deaf Lord Leroy might agree with her without any sort of persuasion at all.</p><p>\u201cWould the lady care for a dance?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked, shattering Cinderella\u2019s thoughts. \u201cWe can still converse as we dance. Your conversation intrigues me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Cinderella said.</p> <p>Prince Cristoph bowed before he approached the orchestra and spoke to them. They abruptly ended the slow song they played, and switched to a different tune.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever danced an Erlauf circle?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cinderella said, slow to commit. It was a dance that required absolutely no touching, although the dancers were still organized into couples. They moved around each other in a circular pattern, sliding close but never touching.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s Father once told her the dance was meant to mimic the movements of the Erlauf Calvary with the horses sliding forward and backward in matched patterns.</p><p>\u201cSo what does this forgiveness look like?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked after he found a spot on the dance floor and lined up across from Cinderella.</p> <p>\u201cLike love,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Prince Cristoph almost missed the musical cue to step around Cinderella. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means Trieux nobles and shopkeepers hire people from Erlauf who immigrated to Werra. It means Erlauf soldiers are gentle with people from Trieux and do not treat them with suspicion,\u201d Cinderella said as she and the prince side-stepped each other. \u201cErlauf citizens can share their knowledge of flower farming, and the Trieux vendors in the market could teach Erlauf folk how to barter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis forgiveness of yours does not sound like the standard forgive and forget arrangement,\u201d Prince Cristoph said as he bowed to Cinderella and she curtsied in tune with the music.</p><p>\u201cForgetting is not at all what forgiveness means. Forgiveness, in the case of our country, is forging ahead together. People from Trieux should intertwine with people from Erlauf. The Erlauf Royal Family should acknowledge they are in what once was Trieux. If they are seen eating a Trieux dish, or using a Trieux word to describe something, I can guarantee Trieux citizens will ponder what goods and crops they can sell that people from Erlauf would like,\u201d Cinderella said, her shoulder almost brushing the prince\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, we should make an effort to adopt Trieux customs and culture into our lives?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked.</p> <p>\u201cIn a way, yes. Right now our countries are saturated with bitterness. If we try being a little less selfish, I think the bitterness can be purged,\u201d Cinderella said, ducking under Prince Cristoph\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI see. And you are willing to make some of the sacrifices you mentioned?\u201d Prince Cristoph asked, stepping back with Cinderella before they came together again.</p><p>\u201cOf course, or I wouldn\u2019t have the nerve to make these suggestions,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI fear there is too much bad blood between Trieux Nobles and Erlauf Nobles for friendship,\u201d Prince Cristoph said.</p><p>Cinderella twirled, her skirts swishing around her. \u201cPerhaps. But there is something you must understand. The hearts of the Trieux commoners are ripe for the taking. For the most part, the upper class did a poor job caring for them. There were some exceptions, but I do not think any of the common class has strong feelings for Trieux nobility. If you can win over the entire commoner class, the remaining nobles and what few Trieux government officials are still alive will have no choice but to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Prince Cristoph said, clapping twice, in synch with the male dancers.</p><p>\u201cAdditionally, you underestimate the next generation of Trieux nobles,\u201d Cinderella said, side-stepping Prince Cristoph again. \u201cSeveral of the houses have young lords and ladies who are poised to take over their parents\u2019 titles. They do not have the same grudges and stubbornness of their parents. You might be able to win them over, if you strike soon,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYour thoughts intrigue me,\u201d Prince Cristoph said as the dance came to an end.</p> <p>\u201cBut you do not support them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that. I am merely withholding judgment. It is warm in here; shall we continue the conversation outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, your Highness,\u201d Cinderella said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Prince Cristoph led Cinderella through the crowd\u2014which opened up before him like magic\u2014and out to a balcony.</p><p>It was of Trieux design, so naturally the balcony was beautiful. There was a white fountain placed perfectly so when silver moonlight struck the trickling water, the surface glowed. Sculpted, well-trimmed plants\u2014the only sign of the Erlauf takeover, Cinderella suspected\u2014made a stark contrast of green among the white balcony, fountain, and benches.</p><p>There were three soldiers on the balcony, but as soon as they saw Prince Cristoph, they leaped to their feet, bowed, and made a speedy exit.</p><p>\u201cYour argument is well thought out,\u201d Prince Cristoph said when they were alone.</p> <p>Cinderella left him at the fountain and seated herself on a nearby bench, sighing in relief. The glass slippers were comfortable, but her feet ached from all the dancing. She hadn\u2019t danced this must since her dance instructor declared her accomplished at age fourteen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Your Highness,\u201d Cinderella said, smoothing her dress over the bench.</p><p>\u201cBut why such passion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Prince Cristoph gestured widely. \u201cWhy subject yourself to such cares and worries? You are a beautiful woman. You could marry and wash your hands of the affair, forgetting the matter. You do not have to save Erlauf.\u201d</p> <p>As tired as she was, the Prince\u2019s words propelled Cinderella into standing. \u201cFirst of all, I resent the idea that if a woman marries, her lot in life is to be empty-headed and pampered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not say that,\u201d Prince Cristoph said.</p><p>\u201cYou implied if I married, things like the country would no longer worry me. Why wouldn\u2019t they? No one is bothering themselves to address this issue. Marriage would not change that, nor would it blind me to the truth that there is much work to be done, and everyone is too selfish to compromise or give up any comforts to see this situation changed,\u201d Cinderella said, her voice hot and angry.</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, whether you and your great mother decide to help me or not, I will face this problem even if I must go at it alone,\u201d Cinderella said, clenching her hands into fists.</p><p>Prince Cristoph pushed off from his perch on the fountain. \u201cYour passion gives you much credit,\u201d he said, stepping close to Cinderella. \u201cAnd your dedication is admirable. I apologize for any offense my thoughtless words gave.\u201d</p><p>Her temper cooling, Cinderella shook her head. \u201cI am afraid, Your Highness. If we don\u2019t make amends, will Erlauf survive?\u201d</p> <p>Prince Cristoph extended a hand towards Cinderella\u2019s face. \u201cWe will\u2014,\u201d he cut himself off when Cinderella jerked away before he could graze her cheek with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI apologize again for my apparently offensive act,\u201d Prince Cristoph said, his words slow and carefully pronounced.</p><p>\u201cOh, it isn\u2019t\u2014you misunderstood,\u201d Cinderella said, clasping her hands in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s only...,\u201d she trailed off, aware that she was starting to blush.</p><p>\u201cYou already have a man you care for?\u201d Prince Cristoph guessed.</p><p>Startled, Cinderella fixed her eyes on his mask. It was to her shame, but he was right. Before she pulled away she hadn\u2019t thought of her marriage prospects, as was her usual concern, but of the disappointed face Friedrich was sure to give her.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she said, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cJust a guess,\u201d Prince Cristoph said, his voice cool. \u201cA Trieux nobleman, I assume? Together you would have a better chance of molding the minds of Trieux commoners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How would\u2014what time is it?\u201d Cinderella said, her heart freezing over when she realized she did not know the hour.</p> <p>\u201cI am not certain. So he is from Trieux?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere can I find a clock?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA clock! Where can I find a clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one above the ballroom entrance, but\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Cinderella was already scurrying into the hot ballroom. She covered her mouth to hold in a shriek when she saw the time\u2014she had fifteen minutes before the magic would fade. In that time she needed to leave the palace, and get out of Werra!</p><p>Cinderella ran back to the threshold of the balcony and curtsied. \u201cI thank you for your time, Prince Cristoph, you have been most gracious,\u201d Cinderella before she turned on her heels and ran.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle, wait! Mademoiselle,\u201d Prince Cristoph shouted.</p><p>Cinderella ignored the calls and slipped her way out of the ballroom, apologizing to anyone she ran into in her hurry.</p><p>\u201cMy lady!\u201d</p><p>Cinderella fled the ballroom and ran down the hallway. She was shocked when she heard the prince call to her. \u201cCan\u2019t you wait, Mademoiselle!\u201d</p><p>She just reached the palace entrance when she heard the Prince order \u201cWait, stop her!\u201d</p><p>Cinderella gave up running like a lady. She picked up her skirts and ran down the long line of stairs where her carriage waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The walkway was lined with soldiers, who started to move towards her, but as soon as Cinderella gathered up her skirts they lunged backwards, as if she had hit them, and avoided looking at her.</p><p>At the bottom stairs Cinderella\u2019s mice-horses neighed to her and twitched their noses twice as fast as usual. The carriage driver baaed at her, and the goat-footgirl had the carriage door open. The orange interior of the carriage glowed in the night.</p><p>Cinderella was almost clear. She picked up her pace, but one of her glass slippers slipped and skid out from underneath her. Cinderella fell into a soldier, who steadied her by her waist before practically pushing her away from him.</p><p>In the bustle, Cinderella\u2019s foot slipped from a glass slipper, but Cinderella was too terrified to care.</p> <p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d she shouted to her unusual attendants before stuffing herself into the carriage.</p><p>The goat-footgirl had just enough time to leap into place behind the carriage before the horses took off, jostling and bouncing the round carriage.</p><p>Cinderella stuck her head out of the window to see Prince Cristoph claiming her abandoned glass slipper and shouting at the soldiers.</p><p>One of the mice-horses let out a shrill neigh\u2014which sounded suspiciously like a squeak, and Cinderella looked ahead to see patrolling squads convening in their pathway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d Cinderella shouted to the goat-driver.</p> <p>The horses bolted down a side street, the sudden turn knocking Cinderella back into the carriage. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a different route! The mice won\u2019t know how to get back, and won\u2019t be able to slip out,\u201d Cinderella winced.</p><p>Soldiers shouted; whistles were blown, and Cinderella\u2019s carriage rolled on.</p><p>One soldier leaped onto the carriage and managed to cling to the door before the goat-footgirl kicked him in the face, dislodging him with great effectiveness.</p><p>The soldiers seemed unwilling to use weapons against Cinderella, her attendants, and her great round carriage, but they showed an unfortunate deftness in building barricades out of crates and barrels.</p><p>\u201cNo, not that way,\u201d Cinderella cried when the mice-horses took another turn that faced them in the direction of the palace. She leaned out of the window to direct her brave steeds and driver. \u201cQuick, take the side street on the left\u2014the one that has the empty beer keg by it\u2014yes!\u201d Cinderella said before pulling herself back in the carriage, for it was a tight squeeze, and in several spots the carriage grazed the alley walls.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the alley opens into a main road, take a left\u2014perfect!\u201d Cinderella said. \u201cNow RUN!\u201d</p> <p>Soldiers on foot pursued them, but thankfully none were mounted. Yet.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s heart thundered in relief when she saw the city gates. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there! We can lose them in the woods and fields!\u201d Cinderella told her mice-horses and goat-attendants.</p><p>\u201cClose the gates!\u201d soldiers shouted, blowing their whistles.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get through!\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>The great wooden gates of Werra creaked and moaned as they were unhinged.</p><p>The bells in the city bell tower started ringing, their clear tolls sounding ominous to Cinderella\u2019s panicked ears.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d she said, shutting her eyes as her carriage thundered along.</p><p>The mice-horses snorted, their hooves clattering on the stone streets. Whistles echoed from all over Werra, and the gates inched along as soldiers pushed against them.</p> <p>The city bells tolled, and Cinderella\u2019s mice-horses slid through the open gap between the doors. The round carriage got stuck\u2014pinched between the doors\u2014but the mice-horses threw themselves against their black harness, and the coach popped free.</p><p>\u201cWe did it! We did it! I can\u2019t believe that we made it! Mice, I will feed you from my hand for the rest of your life!\u201d Cinderella vowed as the doors swung shut behind them.</p><p>Even from behind the city walls, Cinderella could hear the soldiers working furiously to open the doors. A soldier standing watch on the wall blew his whistle and motioned in Cinderella\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cQuick, into the trees,\u201d Cinderella said. They had come out on the wrong side of Werra and were reasonably far from Aveyron\u2019s lands. But Cinderella was satisfied they were out at all\u2014and the different location was a blessing, for the land surrounding the gate was heavily forested for hunting purposes.</p><p>The city bells still rang as Cinderella and her entourage disappeared into the trees. Cinderella threw herself out of the carriage just as it started shrinking, collapsing around her. The black harnesses dropped from the horses, who were temporarily shrouded in smoke with the driver and footgirl when the last bell tolled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the smoke cleared, the elderly goat baaed at Cinderella. The four mice arranged themselves at Cinderella\u2019s feet, shivering, and the young goat stumbled and shook her head.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s fancy dress was gone. She hadn\u2019t noticed when the white and gray fabric transformed back to her servants clothes, but she was grateful it had. She hurriedly took her apron off and ripped it in half. She ripped the ties off the bottom half and tied them around the leather collars the goats wore. She took the top half of the apron and tied it to her head, covering her hair. She placed the glass slipper\u2014the only reminder of the entire mad evening\u2014on the remaining square of apron fabric. She tied the fabric around it like it was a sack of food that she carried.</p><p>\u201cHide for a moment,\u201d Cinderella said to the mice.</p><p>They scurried off into the underbrush, doing as they were told.</p> <p>When the soldiers entered the woods moments later, they found only a servant girl toting two goats instead of the fleeing coach with the agile carriage horses they were looking for.</p><p>\u201cSpread out and see if the dogs can pick up the trail,\u201d a lieutenant riding a black horse shouted, holding a torch above his head.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant dismounted and approached the girl and her goats\u2014who were baaing and shying at the soldiers and their dogs.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, miss,\u201d the lieutenant said, dipping the brim of his hat at the girl. \u201cI apologize for the interruption, but did you happen to see a round, gold carriage come through these woods?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA round carriage?\u201d the girl said, yelping when her buck goat tried to headbutt a dog that was sniffing an unripe pumpkin nearby. \u201cThat would certainly be an odd sight. Nope, I haven\u2019t seen anything like that \u2018round here,\u201d she said, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d the lieutenant asked.</p><p>\u201cI think t\u2019would be rather hard to miss, if you excuse me for saying so,\u201d the goat girl said, a little breathless as her goats yanked her around.</p><p>\u201cVery well, thank you for your time,\u201d the lieutenant said before he returned to his horse and blew a whistle and addressed his soldiers. \u201cRed Dogs, follow the road with the dogs and search for tracks. Gray Boys, search the woods on both sides. Don\u2019t depend on the dogs. Look for tracks, and keep an eye out for any side trails they may have taken. She can\u2019t have gotten too far, or our scouts on the walls would have seen her leave the trees,\u201d he said.</p><p>As the soldiers organized themselves, they ignored the wide-eyed servant girl and her white goats. They didn\u2019t even notice when the girl stopped to let four mice crawl into her sack before she started off, her shoulders stiff and her chin held high.</p><p>Chapter 16</p> <p>\u201cThere you are, Cinderella. You have chosen an unlikely spot to sleep in.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella groaned and rolled over, crashing off the settee she had collapsed in the night before.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d she said. The aches and pains of her body brought the previous night\u2019s events to her mind. Her feet hurt from the dancing and walking without shoes. Her arms hurt from the goats yanking on her the whole way home. As they had popped out on the wrong side of Werra, it had taken over an hour to reach Aveyron. It was all Cinderella could do to put the goats away, free the mice, and collapse in the nearest settee.</p><p>\u201cYour servants are desperately looking for you. Some officials have arrived\u2014they are asking for you.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella finally recognized Lady Klara\u2019s voice. \u201cGreat,\u201d she said into the ground.</p><p>\u201cI will inform Jeanne of your location, but, Cinderella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked lovely last night,\u201d Lady Klara said before she was gone with the swish of skirts.</p> <p>That comment got Cinderella scrambling off the floor. \u201cYou saw?\u201d she squeaked. If Lady Klara realized it was her, did anyone else?\u201d</p><p>Lady Klara was already gone, though, and Jeanne barged through the door seconds later.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d she said, the closest thing she ever came to chiding Cinderella as she took in Cinderella\u2019s wrinkled, askew clothes. \u201cYou must change into something more suitable, now,\u201d she said, hovering around Cinderella in an effort to herd her to her rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cinderella asked, rubbing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPrince Cristoph has called upon Aveyron, and asks to see you!\u201d</p><p>Cinderella froze. \u201cI beg your pardon, who is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Cristoph! You must get changed\u2014Mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sprinted out of the room, manners and elegance forgotten.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to arrest me; he\u2019s going to have me thrown in jail; he\u2019s going to do something!\u201d Cinderella said, darting down the chateau hallways.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d various servants called as she charged past them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella ignored the calls and made a beeline for the kitchens. \u201cIf no one can find me, he\u2019ll go away.

The Prince\u2014,\u201d Cinderella cut herself short and stepped back when her eyes finally caught up with her mind, and she realized Friedrich was not wearing his usual uniform.</p><p>Friedrich wore an outfit of black, and on his head was the copper crown with the ruby setting Prince Cristoph wore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sit down,\u201d Cinderella announced before her legs gave out, and she sat down, hard, on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI thought you would try to run when my men flashed my full title, so I positioned myself in the location you were most likely to exit from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a prince!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe oldest prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Cristoph VI, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you lied? You\u2019ve been lying to me?\u201d Cinderella said, her chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. I go by Friedrich (as Cristoph is a family name), and it can make discussions quite confusing. I don\u2019t use my prince title often, as my main occupation is Colonel of the First Regiment.\u201d</p> <p>Cinderella pushed herself to her feet, anger giving her newfound strength. \u201cThe organizing it must have taken to pull this over me\u2014your whole regiment was in on it, weren\u2019t they?

A way to amuse yourself\u2014by watching the penniless duchess scrabble for change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a marriage interview.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich grabbed Cinderella by her shoulders. \u201cListen to me for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella briefly considered slapping him, but settled for angrily brushing his hands off her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMother and Father will be leaving the Trieux territory soon. For safety and military reasons, they must return to our fortifications in Erlauf\u2014there have been magical attacks, as you know. I am to remain behind and rule in their stead. Since the war, I knew I would have to marry someone of Trieux blood to stabilize our claim to Trieux. So, I\u2019ve been watching all eligible girls from the noble class, the guild and merchant glass, and the daughters of the remaining Trieux officials. I narrowed down my selection to include you, which was when I decided I wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I was the best-bred mare to suit your purposes?\u201d Cinderella said, her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not winning any points for charm, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich ignored the acid in her voice. \u201cI know the story is less than romantic...but it\u2019s all I have. I am the prince of a country that has finished one war and is on the brink of another against an enemy we have no real means of conquering. I\u2019m sorry I only looked at you because I had to marry someone from Trieux. I wish I had approached you with more wholesome intents, but it is unfair to discount my love for you because of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to meet me?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich hesitated. \u201cBecause of...the position I\u2019m in, I knew I needed to be careful with who I selected as my wife. I wanted someone who could learn to love Erlauf as I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about your unusual situation\u2014the way you gave up everything to keep your servants. Your actions were selfless, and they were what made me decide I should meet you. The day you saved my life, I knew, if I could convince you, you would love Erlauf just as fiercely as you love your servants,\u201d Friedrich said, fixing his dark eye on Cinderella.</p><p>Cinderella could feel her anger starting to subside, but she wouldn\u2019t admit it, so she looked away and turned her back to Friedrich.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I fell deeply in love with you, and I worried you would marry me only to save Aveyron. You never gave any indication you felt more for me than friendship. You still haven\u2019t,\u201d Friedrich said, standing behind Cinderella.</p><p>He was so close Cinderella could feel the heat of his body, but he did not touch her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCinderella, who were you thinking of when you refused my touch last night?\u201d Friedrich said, his voice flat.</p><p>Cinderella set her shoulders and did not respond.</p><p>\u201cCinderella, please.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella turned around. \u201cWho do you think it was, but you, you idiot!\u201d she said, smacking Friedrich to cover her embarrassed blush.</p> <p>Friedrich caught Cinderella\u2019s hand and pulled her into a hug, encasing his arms around her. As Cinderella leaned into him, she suspected he hadn\u2019t touched her the night before because there was no way she would fail to recognize his warmth.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me who you were?\u201d Cinderella whispered.</p><p>Friedrich snorted. \u201cCinderella, you are loyal and lovely as the dawn, but you do not hesitate to use yourself as a bargaining chip. You cannot deny it. You would have accepted my offer purely because it would put you in a higher position of power to care for and protect Trieux citizens.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella thought for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s about right,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut you said that\u2019s what you were looking for in a wife.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich kissed the top of Cinderella\u2019s head. \u201cYes, before I fell in love with you,\u201d he said, sounding quite sheepish. \u201cAfter that I grew quite stubborn about wanting to woo you rather than buying your affections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd all the sweet talking of your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you two to get along. You need to get along,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c...You\u2019re going to marry me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that in a minute. I have it all planned, and it will knock your shoes off\u2014again. So yes, you and mother must get along, and I really wanted you to express concern for Erlauf as a whole and see the need for forgiveness because...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Friedrich looked to the sky when Cinderella leaned back far enough that she could see him. \u201cBecause I\u2019m aiming to be the Commander of the Erlauf Army, like my Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so, as my wife, you will be the ruling queen,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella blinked. \u201cSo I will be queen and you\u2019ll be king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will be queen and I will be your consort. I will control the Army, but you will have undisputed control over the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can you...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Erlauf Army needs direct supervision thanks to its size and power. I can\u2019t be the Commander and lead the country. If Johann, my brother, showed any inclination to be the Commander, then I could just be King. But he spends most of his time making eyes at foreign dignitaries and refuses to enter the Army,\u201d Friedrich said, sounding disgusted. \u201cBesides, I take after my father with my sweet, quiet, personality. I am so easily frightened and cowed. Mother always told me I was born to be a consort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are without a doubt your Mother\u2019s son,\u201d Cinderella dryly said as she tried to adjust her mind to the idea. \u201cQueen? And you would only be the consort? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you see why I wanted to be sure you loved me before I told you? Although you still haven\u2019t said you do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t asked me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s take care of that. This way, please,\u201d Friedrich said, taking Cinderella\u2019s hand and leading her to the front of the Chateau.</p><p>Friedrich\u2019s soldiers from his regiment saw them and started hooting and whistling.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t convinced her yet! Stop carrying on, or she\u2019ll run the other way,\u201d Friedrich said as they stopped at a covered wagon. He plucked a sack from the driver\u2019s seat and led Cinderella on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the wagon?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can just sense money, can\u2019t you? It\u2019s gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the exact amount Aveyron owed Mother before you paid off the debt. It is my bribe in case you decide to say no. Sit here, on that bench. Yes, face this way, perfect,\u201d Friedrich said, arranging Cinderella on the bench next to the hulking wild rose bush.</p><p>\u201cPut both feet on the ground, this shoe off, please, thank you,\u201d Friedrich said, twitching one of Cinderella\u2019s shoes off her feet. \u201cStay. There,\u201d Friedrich said, pointing to the bench before he retreated some distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still within view, Friedrich attempted to smooth his clothes, which were as badly wrinkled as Cinderella\u2019s. He tossed his crown aside, and plucked a basket out of the sack. He took a deep breath, held the basket behind his back and turned to face Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cDuchess Cinderella Lacreux, I must confess I have fallen deeply in love with you. If you would marry me, I would be the happiest of men\u2014but there are some things that must be stated. I am in the Army, and while you will always have my love, I cannot guarantee I will always return to you whole, or alive,\u201d Friedrich said, briefly shutting his eye. \u201cAlso, I am the prince of a troubled country. If you marry me, I fear you will be called to show love, kindness, and compassion beyond what a normal human could extend. I am confident my country will learn to love you and cherish you as deeply as I do, but I am aware you have already made great sacrifices... and I do not want to force more on you,\u201d Friedrich said, kneeling at Cinderella\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you not because you have the strength of will to save my desperate country, but because you have stolen my heart for some months now, and I want to spend every second I can in your presence. If you choose to marry me, I will treasure your love and loyalty more than the Crown jewels, and I will do my best to make you happy and to make you smile and laugh for the rest of your life. I am from Erlauf, not Trieux, and most of my worth is based on my military position rather than my royal title. It\u2019s not what you deserve, but I ask that you would consider it, consider me. Cinderella, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>Friedrich\u2019s eye shone with love, and perhaps a little fear. He was a man nearly impossible to read. The display of trust twisted Cinderella\u2019s heart.</p> <p>Cinderella smiled through the tears in her eyes. \u201cCristoph Friedrich, before I answer, there are some things that must be stated,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYesterday I officially refused Julien\u2019s suit because I realized I was in love with another man\u2014you\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to marry anyone else. Also, your country ceased to bother me months ago as you have taught me to look past heritage and study a person\u2019s heart. As for your profession, I would be proud to call a soldier\u2014a calling of bravery and courage that I am ashamed to say I previously did not value\u2014my husband. Finally, I will gladly make personal sacrifices if it means I can marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your answer...?\u201d Friedrich asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Cinderella laughed before throwing her arms around him.</p><p>Friedrich released the deep breath he\u2019d been holding. \u201cI am so glad,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to use my bribe.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella laughed.</p> <p>\u201cMother and Johann cannot wait to meet you. I think you will get on with mother\u2014I hope you hate Johann. He\u2019s a brat,\u201d Friedrich savagely said, running his fingers through Cinderella\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cAnd your Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already met him. You must have impressed him considerably. He said if I bungled this, he was going to demote me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I meet your Father?\u201d Cinderella frowned, pulling back from the hug.</p><p>\u201cDuring the ball. He was the third man to dance with you. The middle-aged military chap,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s eyes widened.</p> <p>\u201cHow rude of me. I almost forgot,\u201d Friedrich said before presenting Cinderella with the basket.</p><p>Inside the basket sat a glass slipper, and nestled in the shoe\u2019s toe, a sparkling ring. \u201cI made the basket myself,\u201d Friedrich added, removing the ring from the shoe before sliding it over Cinderella\u2019s finger.</p><p>On closer inspection, Cinderella gulped. The ring was a large ruby with the Erlauf insignia etched into the surface. It seemed very likely that it was a Crown Jewel.</p><p>When Cinderella looked up, Friedrich wore the same smug, smarmy smile he occasionally wore when he first started visiting her stand.</p><p>\u201cYou have been planning this for a long time, haven\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Friedrich said with his roguish grin. \u201cAbout half of the concerns your market friends had for you were quite valid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, you are more honorable than they said you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly just so,\u201d Friedrich said, sliding his hand down Cinderella\u2019s ankle before he slipped the glass slipper on her foot. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. I have found my queen. Although... it does raise an important question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have both admitted we love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I finally kiss you?\u201d Friedrich said in a tone of long suffering.</p><p>Cinderella laughed so hard Friedrich finally stood up rather than remain crouching on the ground.</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you still laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, yes!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Friedrich blinked before he grasped what she meant. With a swoop he picked up Cinderella and set her on her feet. He slid one hand up her jawline and the other around her waist, pulling her close before he leaned over and kissed her.</p><p>Kissing Friedrich was like getting caught in a summer storm. It was beautiful and perhaps a little terrifying and overwhelming. She didn\u2019t think she could have felt more shocked and alive if the skies opened up and dumped buckets of torrential rains on her. Cinderella felt treasured in Friedrich\u2019s arms, pulled so tight against his chest she could feel the beat of his heart. The hair on the back of her neck prickled\u2014as it did whenever a lightning strike was within a mile from Aveyron\u2014and, oddly enough, she felt peace.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely worth the wait,\u201d Cinderella pronounced, a little breathlessly, when they were finished.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Friedrich said, sliding an arm across Cinderella\u2019s back. \u201cSteel yourself; the audience will demand to know how it went.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow on earth did you get your soldiers to help so much with this whole thing, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully it was more difficult persuading them to leave you alone. My men know who I am. Naturally they were curious about you. You won them over without any help on my end\u2014which is a good thing. It would not bode well if the Army didn\u2019t accept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they accept me if they do not even know me? I have only met soldiers from your regiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord travels fast in the Army, and no one keeps any news to themselves,\u201d Friedrich said as he guided Cinderella out of the gardens and straight into a scene from a tavern.</p><p>The soldiers had uncovered the cargo of a second wagon\u2014which was composed entirely of beer and mead.</p> <p>\u201cKurt! You\u2019re on duty!\u201d Friedrich shouted over the happy cheers when the soldiers caught sight of Friedrich and Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, sir,\u201d Gustav, who was standing with Kurt and a freshly poured pint. \u201cNone of us are. We\u2019re all here off duty\u2014we wanted to see how this would turn out.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich blinked. \u201cKurt! You said General Harbach sent you\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe lied,\u201d Kurt said.</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d Tobias, the soldier who shot the dark mage, said as he raised a tankard in the air.</p><p>Friedrich groaned. \u201cThis is some way to convince you of my administrative capabilities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFriedrich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella giggled and leaned in. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said before kissing him soundly.</p><p>The soldiers roared even louder, hooting at their commanding officer and his lady love.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Cinderella asked, staring at the beautiful, elaborate dress hanging in her armoire. Cinderella felt a moment of panic. \u201cJeanne, I didn\u2019t order any dresses to be made!\u201d She might be engaged to a prince of Erlauf, but that did nothing to change her monetary state until they were married. She couldn\u2019t afford such a lavish clothing item.</p><p>\u201cIt is from Colonel Friedrich, Mademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne said, securing the drapes in Cinderella\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Cinderella frowned and caressed the fabric, grimacing when the tough skin of her fingers scraped the soft fabric. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would assume it is for your presentation to Queen Freja this evening,\u201d Jeanne said.</p> <p>\u201c...What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe presentation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that. It\u2019s...nothing,\u201d Cinderella said, looking at the dress.</p><p>\u201cHe sent a matching jewelry set as well,\u201d Jeanne said, indicating to a velvet box that rested on Cinderella\u2019s bed.</p><p>Cinderella looked from the box to the dress. She caught sight of herself in the cracked mirror positioned across the room\u2014one of the few mirrors retained in Aveyron because the fissure reduced its worth to copper pennies.</p><p>Cinderella\u2019s reflection stared back at her. She wore Friedrich\u2019s dragon necklace openly, sitting on the drab cloth of her servant clothes.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he is ashamed of me?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is not my place to say, Mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeanne, please.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne pursed her lips. \u201cI would find it hard to believe so, Mademoiselle. Particularly when one considers how he carries on.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella nodded. \u201cThank you. Perhaps he means to protect me from his mother.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne\u2019s silence was heavy with dislike, and Cinderella cocked her head as she studied the dress.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cinderella said, closing the door to her armoire.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not wear the dress. Queen Freja had best know who she\u2019s letting into the family. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m as out of place as a black sheep. I go in this,\u201d Cinderella savagely said, jabbing a finger at her fractured reflection.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Mademoiselle,\u201d Jeanne said. Her words were placid, but Cinderella thought she detected just a hint of pride in them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella arrived at the palace, late, in a carriage Friedrich sent to pick her up. The footman nor the driver gave her choice of clothing so much a second glance, but the closer they drew to the Palace, the more aware Cinderella was of the declaration her plain clothes made.</p><p>She was about to meet Queen Freja, Friedrich\u2019s mother and the ruler of the country. I don\u2019t want to antagonize her...but I will not be made into a pretty Trieux doll that stands at Friedrich\u2019s side. She was wrong to tax Aveyron, to tax Trieux so much. I will not pretend otherwise, Cinderella thought before she popped out of the carriage.</p><p>A butler escorted Cinderella through the palace. Cinderella\u2019s heart pounded in her throat when the butler stopped in front of a set of doors and threw them open.</p><p>\u201cDuchess Lacreux,\u201d he announced, stepping aside and bowing.</p> <p>The room\u2014a parlor\u2014was filled with low-pitched murmurings. The whispers fell silent when Cinderella stepped forward, entering the light of the fire.</p><p>Queen Freja stood, her face cold and unmoving as granite. Prince Johann was with her, covering his mouth with his jacket sleeve to hide his grin and muffle his laugh. The consort\u2014Commander Lehn\u2014froze in the middle of standing up.</p><p>Only Friedrich reacted as if nothing was wrong. \u201cCinderella, I\u2019m glad you are finally here. I was almost ready to dispatch a squad to track you down,\u201d he said, strolling up to her side.</p><p>\u201cI was detained,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, was a cow about to calf?\u201d Prince Johann asked.</p> <p>\u201cJohann,\u201d Queen Freja said, her voice sharp.</p><p>Cinderella gave the younger prince her most brilliant smile. \u201cI would be the last person my servants would call upon for such a situation, for I am rather ignorant in that area,\u201d she said, taking Friedrich\u2019s arm. \u201cIt seems, though, you have some knowledge of the act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lacreux, how good it is to see you again,\u201d Commander Lehn said before his son could reply, bowing when Cinderella and Friedrich approached the rest of the family.</p><p>Cinderella swallowed as she met Queen Freja\u2019s dark eyes, preparing herself for the verbal war that was likely to commence. This was it. This was her first meeting with the loathed Queen Freja, the woman Cinderella itched to shake and yell at for years. And she was marrying this woman\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cCinderella, I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have wronged you,\u201d Queen Freja said. \u201cI singled out Trieux nobles\u2014in particular I singled out you, to tax in order to make up for the country\u2019s deficit. It was ignoble and unforgiveable as a monarch acquainting herself with her new subjects.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella opened and closed her mouth, baffled beyond words.</p><p>\u201cI have pushed you and your compatriots to the brink out of sheer spite. It pains me to admit it, but I have done a poor job of ruling Trieux. I ask that you would forgive us, forgive me,\u201d Queen Freja said, bowing her head.</p><p>All of Cinderella\u2019s anger, hatred, and stored words to shout were gone. As the ultimate ruler of a country, it would be difficult to tell a seventeen-year-old Trieux girl she behaved wrongly.</p><p>When Cinderella\u2019s father accepted the rules and regulations Erlauf threw at them after the war, Cinderella thought he was afraid for their lives. But now, Cinderella understood why he reacted without hate. No matter what he left behind, Cinderella had no doubts of her Father\u2019s heart, because of the words he spoke.</p><p>\u201cMy Father, a kind and noble man, once told me nobody wins in a war,\u201d Cinderella said, finding her voice. \u201cI think I finally, fully understand what he meant. Both Trieux and Erlauf have committed transgressions. I accept your apology, and I offer my forgiveness, if you will look past the pain my country has caused you, My Queen.\u201d</p><p>Queen Freja smiled with her eyes. \u201cI am glad Friedrich chose you,\u201d she said, her voice low and melodic.</p><p>Friedrich and Cinderella shared a look. \u201cI knew you would be,\u201d he said, his voice smug as he slid an arm around Cinderella and squeezed her.</p> <p>The royal family laughed.</p><p>\u201c...you mentioned a deficit?\u201d Cinderella asked to cover up some of her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cTo finance the war, we took a loan from Arcainia\u2014a large obligation we have scrambled to fulfill. All of your tax money went straight to Arcainia to pay back what we owe,\u201d Friedrich said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pet, but the kingdom you are about to become Princess over is in debt.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella offered the royal family a weak smile. \u201cIf I know anything,\u201d she said, \u201cIt is debt and deficits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinderella, Friedrich has hogged you for entirely too long. Please, tell me about yourself. What are your likes and dislikes?\u201d Commander Lehn said, his kind smile putting Cinderella at ease. \u201cBesides food,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Cinderella laughed. \u201cFood is certainly something I deeply enjoy. I liked horseback riding, although I cannot boast of much skill in that area. Trade interests me, as do current events,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Johann raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo you are a budding scholar?\u201d he asked. \u201cOuch,\u201d he said when Friedrich kicked him in the back of the knee.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not. I have an abundance of ignorance,\u201d Cinderella sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Commander Lehn asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a girl, I was schooled in womanly subjects,\u201d Cinderella groused. \u201cArts, literature, history, dancing, and the like.

In several months, you will be my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Freja,\u201d Cinderella said before she caught a glance of Friedrich\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Friedrich frowned. \u201cI hoped you two would get along, but I cannot say I wanted you to bond this well.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella blinked.\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not listen to him, Cinderella; he is only jealous. Now that he has successfully won you over, he must actually return to his duties and stop kicking up his heels and using his men like a circus master. General Harbach looks forward to his full-time return,\u201d Commander Lehn said, chuckling at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI knew it. I knew you were skipping out on work. No officer has that much time on their hands,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>Friedrich shifted his gaze to his parents. \u201cWhen are you leaving Werra again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriedrich, don\u2019t be silly. You are going to get married soon; we cannot leave now,\u201d Queen Freja said.</p> <p>Friedrich looked to his brother. \u201cAt least you\u2019re leaving, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to, but mother has me chained to her,\u201d Johann dryly said.</p><p>\u201cBlast,\u201d Friedrich muttered.</p><p>\u201cThink of it this way, son. We will help ease your lovely bride into her new role,\u201d Commander Lehn said.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I would like to address this debt you mentioned. How much is it?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cLord Diederick has the current estimate. After dinner, we can pay a social call to his offices,\u201d Queen Freja said.</p><p>\u201cWait a moment, about those female tutors,\u201d Friedrich said, jumping into the conversation.</p><p>As Cinderella sat down with Queen Freja and Friedrich, she thought of how nice it would be to have a family again. She would be stupid to think she wouldn\u2019t have disagreements with Queen Freja, Friedrich, or the rest of the royal Erlauf family in the future. But Cinderella was confident they would work through the arguments.

It showed a garden scene of several pretty maidens seated among rose bushes with a white unicorn. Cinderella could have drawn it by memory because she had seen it every day of her childhood, until she sold it with the first batch of Aveyron household goods when she became duchess. \u201cThis is mine,\u201d she said.</p><p>Margrit blinked. \u201cIf you will pardon me for saying so, Your Grace, in a few minutes everything here will belong to you,\u201d she delicately said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.

Queen Freja was quite displeased with Prince Cristoph for his extreme patronage of Von Beiler\u2014a broker,\u201d Lady Therese said. Before Queen Freja recruited her as one of Cinderella\u2019s lady\u2019s maids, the woman served as a head accounting officer. (Queen Freja cleverly used the post of lady\u2019s maids to place intelligent, knowledgeable women near Cinderella to act as advisors. Cinderella was very thankful as most of her schooling and training was in history, appreciation of the arts, dancing, and farming.) \u201cVon Beiler, you say?\u201d Cinderella asked, her voice light and airy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Therese said.</p><p>Margrit and the lady\u2019s maids shifted with unease as Cinderella folded her hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI will be back in a moment,\u201d she announced before picking up the skirts of her dress and heading down the hallway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour Grace, your wedding starts in a few minutes!\u201d Margrit said, hurrying after her.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait,\u201d Cinderella said, her glass slippers clicking when she stepped off the rugs and walked on the smooth, polished, stone floor.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, what of your dress and veil!\u201d the lady\u2019s maids squawked.</p><p>\u201cThe Lady Enchantress Angelique spelled them for me. I do not think a short walk will ruin them,\u201d Cinderella said, her veil floating behind her like a cloud.</p><p>In a few minutes, Cinderella stood outside Friedrich\u2019s room. She had never been inside before\u2014mostly because she had no reason to. Friedrich rarely used his rooms in the royal palace, and after they were married, they would have joint quarters.</p><p>Now, however, Cinderella had a sneaking suspicion.</p><p>\u201cYour GRACE,\u201d a lady\u2019s maid shrieked when Cinderella pushed the doors open.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is as I thought,\u201d Cinderella said, entering the room, although she barely had enough space to walk in.</p> <p>\u201cYour Grace, this might be a little unseemly,\u201d Margrit said.</p><p>Cinderella pointed to a beautiful writing desk. \u201cThat was mine,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd I would recognize this rug anywhere. That horse statue used to stand in my parlor\u2014it\u2019s a sculpture of a riding horse I used to have. The tapestry, bookshelf, wall hangings, everything is...,\u201d she trailed off when she got to a painting covered with a white sheet.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d another lady\u2019s maid said when Cinderella yanked the sheet from the painting, which was also from Aveyron. It was the image Cinderella had been shocked to receive an offer for: the portrait of Cinderella in her Trieux finery.</p><p>Cinderella painfully smiled. The last time she saw the portrait, she had shorn hair, dressed in servants clothes, and was selling every last good she had. Now her hair was nearly shoulder length, curled, dressed with pearls and tiny roses, and covered with a snow-white veil. Her dress was made of the finest silk and lace, accented and highlighted with lace that matched the blue-grey of Cinderella\u2019s stormy eyes.</p><p>The color scheme was the same one Angelique used for Cinderella\u2019s ball gown months ago, but this dress had a longer train, was more intricate, and was gathered and pinned into place with real jewels.</p><p>\u201cSo many changes,\u201d Cinderella murmured, reaching out to brush the gold frame, ignoring the squawks of her lady\u2019s maids in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cUm, Your Grace,\u201d Margrit said.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Cinderella asked, turning to look at more of her possessions scattered through the room. \u201cWhat is it Margrit?\u201d she asked when there was silence.</p><p>\u201cShe only wanted to warn you of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cinderella turned around to face Friedrich. He wore a band of red cloth tied over both his eyepatch and his eye, but he was still handsome and alarmingly roguish in his military uniform with his crown fixed on his head instead of his usual hat. \u201cYour lady\u2019s maids tell me you have lost all sense of propriety, and I am to fix you without setting eye on you,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been helping for a long time. Even before you decided to marry me,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy everything, just the items Von Beiler said you seemed to place special value on,\u201d Friedrich said, his voice soft but serious.</p><p>\u201cIt was only because I sold these items that Aveyron survived the first few months after my father\u2019s death,\u201d Cinderella said, looking at the familiar furniture pieces and decorations. \u201cWhy did you help me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen Mother hit you with the inheritance tax, you could have easily dismissed servants. Instead, you sold things. Von Beiler told me you sold your favorite horse and sobbed while it was led away. Someone who cares that much for the people they are responsible for deserves help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?</p><p>Friedrich shrugged. \u201cI wanted to surprise you with all your furniture in our new rooms.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella stood at Friedrich\u2019s side and leaned into him. \u201cI am so grateful for you, Friedrich. And I\u2019m sorry I ever thought wrong of you.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich blindly patted Cinderella before he was able to curl an arm around her waist. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know any better, Pet. I only wish I could have done more\u2014though I suppose if I had you would be dealing with even more monetary issues now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is not as bad as you think. Once I finish selling off the tacky Trieux goods, we should be in a fine position. It was sheer luck Princess Elise of Arcainia agreed to take that ghastly throne in the ballroom as part of our payments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has been exceedingly generous since her brothers are no longer birds,\u201d Friedrich agreed, getting a giggle out of Cinderella.</p><p>They were silent for a few moments, enjoying the quiet and each other\u2019s presence.</p><p>Cinderella sighed. \u201cI suppose we should make our way to the ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would probably be for the best,\u201d Friedrich agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll go first. I will see you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood, just double checking. Until then,\u201d Friedrich said, fumbling for Cinderella\u2019s bare hand before he kissed it. \u201cShe is all yours, ladies,\u201d Friedrich said, joining the lady\u2019s maids in the hallway before pulling off the blindfold.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d the head lady\u2019s maid said, planting her fists on her hips. \u201cIt is good you are concerned for the welfare of this nation, and it is very admirable that you push yourself to learn for our sake. But you must stop for the rest of today.\u201d</p><p>Cinderella sighed in defeat. \u201cAs you wish. Margrit, there\u2019s no reason for you to waste your time with me. I believe Julien is saving a seat for you, yes? You may as well join him,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Your Grace,\u201d Margrit curtsied.</p><p>\u201cBe sure to sit on my side of the cathedral!\u201d Cinderella called after her secretary.</p><p>\u201cWhy does the side matter, Your Grace?\u201d a lady\u2019s maid asked, bribing Cinderella from Friedrich\u2019s rooms with the question.</p><p>\u201cDoes Erlauf not follow the tradition where one side is meant to be the bride\u2019s family and friends, and the other side the groom\u2019s?\u201d Cinderella asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that is an Erlauf tradition as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, well, that is why. I fear my side will be dreadfully empty, as most of my family is gone, and the majority of those whom I invited are not the type to attend\u2014besides the other Trieux nobles of course,\u201d Cinderella gloomily said.</p><p>She had invited all of her servants from Aveyron, but none of them would commit to coming. They were probably counting down the days until their untraditional mistress would be out of their hair.</p><p>The lady\u2019s maids exchanged glances, but none of them said a word as they bustled Cinderella down the hallway.</p><p>When they finally reached the cathedral door\u2014the Trieux royals were apparently so lazy that when designing the palace, they smacked a cathedral in the thick of it so they wouldn\u2019t have to leave their comfort for church\u2014Cinderella could hear the music creep through the doors.</p><p>A lady\u2019s maid handed her a bouquet of white roses\u2014a gift from Prince Severin and Princess Elle of Loire (as flowers were hard to come by in the middle of winter, Cinderella had no idea where they procured them)\u2014and adjusted her veil.</p><p>Cinderella drew her shoulders back and took a deep breath before the door was pushed open.</p><p>Sure enough, Cinderella\u2019s side was only half-filled\u2014a stark contrast to Friedrich\u2019s side, where military officers, governmental employees, and various lords and ladies were packed in like sellers in a market. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All of the Trieux noble families were present. Marcus and Cerise sat together\u2014waving on the sly so they would not be chastised by their parents. Lord Leroy was perhaps the least surprised and scandalized of the bunch. He brushed tears from his droopy eyes and smiled widely at Cinderella as she walked past.</p><p>When Cinderella glanced at Friedrich\u2019s side, she realized many of the Erlauf officers and soldiers she met during the past fall, summer, and spring wore small squares of scarlet red cloth sewn over their hearts on the jacket of their uniform. Ensign Kurt stood with Gustav and Ivo. All three men saluted her when she passed him Lord Diederick and Colonel Merrich, seated near the front of the cathedral, bowed\u2014although Merrich offered Cinderella a sly wink.</p><p>The second and third rows from the front were filled with foreign dignitaries\u2014mostly ambassadors, but a few princes and princesses had deigned to attend. Prince Severin and Princess Elle were there. It was shocking, but Princess Elise of Arcainia had accepted the invitation\u2014which had been delivered to her thanks to her loan-shark ties to their country\u2014and stood with her youngest foster brother, Prince Gerhart. Prince Viggo from Ringsted attended, as did Princess Astra of Baris.</p><p>To Cinderella\u2019s relief, Lady Klara, Mariska, and even snarky Silla stood in the very first row of seats. Lady Klara offered Cinderella a brief, underwhelming smile, but her eyes were soft and happy. Mariska was beside herself with joy. She cast a handful of flower petals before Cinderella\u2014to Silla and Lady Klara\u2019s horror.</p> <p>Marie and Armel were also seated in the first row. Armel looked spooked\u2014marrying a duchess had scared him pants-less, but the fact that his wife\u2019s best friend would one day be queen terrified him to the core\u2014but Marie was crying and blowing kisses in Cinderella\u2019s direction.</p><p>Queen Freja, her Consort Commander Lehn, and Prince Johann stood directly opposite from Cinderella\u2019s step-family and friends.</p><p>Commander Lehn gave Cinderella a warm smile. Prince Johann wriggled his eyebrows\u2014earning a grin from Cinderella\u2014and Queen Freja nodded once, indicating her approval.</p><p>Friedrich was now just a few steps away. His eye was hooked on Cinderella, his expression intent, although there was a customary curl to his lips. When Cinderella hesitated at the base of the dais Friedrich climbed down them, took her hand, and helped her up.</p><p>When they reached the top, Cinderella could see out into the open air courtyard. The shutters and drapes had been removed for the day so anyone who wanted to could see Prince Cristoph Friedrich VI and Duchess Cinderella exchange their vows. It made the cathedral chilly\u2014as winter had arrived\u2014but Cinderella hoped it might be a small step towards mending the country\u2019s bitterness.</p> <p>The courtyard was packed with Erlauf and Trieux citizens alike, bundled up due to the weather. It warmed Cinderella\u2019s heart to see the two cultures intermingled, celebrating the day together. Admittedly, the two peoples were a bit stiff, but still. It was progress!</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Friedrich whispered, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Cinderella shivered.</p><p>The clergyman smiled at Friedrich and Cinderella before he cleared his voice and spoke. \u201cToday Prince Cristoph Friedrich VI and Cinderella Lacreux, the Duchess of Aveyron, come before this fine state to declare their love and intention to marry. Now, who stands for Lady Lacreux and gives her in marriage to Prince Cristoph and acts as her witness?\u201d</p><p>Cinderella had a moment of blind panic. She had told the clergyman specifically he was to skip this part of the ceremony, because there wasn\u2019t anyone to give her away! It was enough that Lady Klara and her daughters stood on her side with some affection, she wouldn\u2019t push for anymore. But what did that leave Cinderella with? Sybilla the fairy godmother wasn\u2019t around to magic another goat!</p><p>Cinderella winced in the silence and was about to whisper to the minster to move on when Friedrich touched her arm. When she met his gaze he tilted his head toward the open air courtyard.</p> <p>When Cinderella looked, a resounding, almost deafening, \u201cWE DO,\u201d blasted in through the open windows.</p><p>Cinderella broke ranks and hurried to the banister\u2014Friedrich at her side.</p><p>There, standing in the courtyard with the rest of the well-wishers, was every servant of Aveyron. They were headed by Gilbert and Jeanne, and all of them\u2014from the head butler to the youngest chicken girl\u2014wore bracelets or bands of scarlet red silk tied around their foreheads and the arms of their coats. They carried flags with the Aveyron crest, and bowed and curtsied when they saw that Cinderella looked down at them.</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t all have possibly fit in the cathedral, so they asked to be outside where they might all stand together as your witness,\u201d Friedrich said, speaking directly into Cinderella\u2019s ear that she might hear him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now that she was closer to the courtyard, Cinderella could see almost all of her market-stall friends and neighbors had come as well. The milkmaid and ropemaker stood together, waving scarlet swatches above their heads. The baker, the cobbler, the potter, the tanner and his wife, and the mousy woman who had correctly warned Cinderella of Friedrich\u2019s intensions months ago cheered and shouted with abandon.</p><p>Cinderella covered her mouth with her hands to keep from crying. Once again, she had underestimated the love and loyalty of her servants. Her shoulders shook with effort, and Cinderella\u2019s face hurt, for she wanted to laugh and cry at once.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she finally shouted, blowing kisses to her staunch supporters.</p><p>\u201cI am so lucky,\u201d Friedrich said, curling his arms around Cinderella.</p> <p>\u201cNot as lucky as I am. Luck doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. I am blessed,\u201d Cinderella said, smiling up at him.</p><p>Friedrich\u2019s smile was so warm it made Cinderella\u2019s toes curl. \u201cCan we spend the rest of our lives arguing who is more blessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Friedrich chuckled and kissed the tip of Cinderella\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cAHEM,\u201d the clergyman said.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. We should get back to the ceremony,\u201d Friedrich said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds right. Shall we?\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cWe shall,\u201d Friedrich agreed, sweeping Cinderella back to the clergyman.</p><p>The ceremony was over faster than Cinderella\u2019s dazed mind could take in. She felt so loved and so lucky, the thing she mostly remembered was the intensity of the cheers when the clergyman declared Cinderella and Friedrich married. It was an explosion of noise, shouts, and bells when Friedrich kissed Cinderella, and all of it was happy.</p><p>As Friedrich led Cinderella down the aisle, he wiped tears from her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a storybook ending that I don\u2019t deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cI have everything I wanted. I have you; Aveyron is finally safe; my servants love me, and we get to build our country together. It\u2019s so perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Friedrich smiled. \u201cYou deserve every happiness you receive, darling. Although I\u2019m sad to say, it won\u2019t always be like this. Some days our people will get along; other days they won\u2019t. And sometime soon, we will have to deal with the threat of darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we will move forward. We are proof our countries can move forward,\u201d Cinderella said.</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d Friedrich relented when they reached the church doors. \u201cI love you, Princess Cinderella, even if you have an answer to all my pessimistic thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Prince Cristoph Friedrich VI, even if you do have a name that is unnecessarily long,\u201d Cinderella laughed.</p><p>The footmen opened the church doors, avoiding their kissing, future monarchs and the four collared mice that scurried around the royal pair.</p><p>If darkness came to Erlauf, it didn\u2019t stand a chance. </p> </body></html>"]
