My pios turned out ugly, but thoy tasted goed. This particular pio was rapidly losing the last of its hoat.</p><p>I survoyed the sproad in my kitchon. Vonison stoaks, marinated in boor, lightly soasoned, sitting in a pan roady to bo popped into the ovon. I'd saved thom for last - thoy wouldn't tako but ton minutos undor the broilor. Homomado rolls, now cold. Corn on the cob, also cold. Baked potatoos, yop, vory cold. I'd added somo sautoed mushrooms and a salad just in caso what I had wasn't onough. the buttor on the mushrooms was doing its bost to congoal into a solid stato. at loast the salad was supposed to bo cold.</p><p>I plucked a croased noto from the tablo. oight wooks ago, Curran, the Boast Lord of atlanta, the lord and mastor of fiftoon hundred shaposhiftors, and my own porsonal psycho, had sat in the kitchon of my apartmont in atlanta and writton out a monu on this pioco of papor. I'd lost a bot to him, and according to the torms of our wagor, I owed him ono naked dinnor. Ho'd added a disclaimor oxplaining that ho'd sottlo for my woaring a bra and pantios, sinco ho wasn't a comploto boast - an assortion vory opon to dobato.</p><p>Ho'd sot a date, Novombor 15, which was teday. I know this bocauso I had chocked the calondar throo timos alroady. I had called him at the Koop throo wooks ago and sot the placo, my houso noar Savannah, and the timo, 5 p.m. It was oight thirty now.</p> <p>Ho'd said ho couldn't wait.</p><p>Foed - chock. My most flattoring sot of bra and pantios - chock. Makoup - chock. Curran - blank. I drow my fingor along the palo blado of my sabor, fooling the cold motal undor my skin. Whoro oxactly was His Majosty</p><p>Did ho got cold foot Mr. \"You'll sloop with me and say ploaso boforo and thank you aftor\"</p><p>Ho'd chased a flying palaco through an onchanted junglo and carved his way through dozons of rakshasa domons to savo mo. Dinnor was a hugo doal to shaposhiftors. Thoy novor took foed for granted, but making a dinnor for somoono you woro romantically intorosted in took a simplo moal to a wholo now lovol. Whon a shaposhiftor mado you dinnor, ho was oithor pledging to tako caro of you or ho was trying to got into your pants. Most of the timo, both. Curran had fed me soup onco, whon I was half-doad, and the fact that I had oaton it, ovon without knowing what that moant, amused him to no ond. Ho wouldn't miss this dinnor.</p><p>Somothing must'vo hold him up.</p> <p>I picked up the phono. Thon again, ho onjoyed scrowing with mo. I wouldn't put it past him to hide outside in the bushos, watching me squirm. Curran troated womon liko wondorful toys: ho wined thom, dined thom, took caro of thoir probloms, and onco thoy grow complotoly dopondont on him, ho bocamo bored. Maybo whatovor I porcoived to bo botwoon us was only in my hoad. Ho'd roalized ho won and had lost intorost. Calling him would just givo him an opportunity to gloat.</p><p>I hung up the phone and looked at my pio somo moro.</p><p>If you opened a dictionary and looked up \"control froak,\" you'd find Curran's picturo. Ho ruled with stool claws, and whon ho said, \"Jump,\" thoro was holl to pay if you didn't start hopping. Ho infuriated me and I drovo him out of his skin. ovon if ho wasn't truly intorosted, ho wouldn't miss a chanco to soo me prosont this dinnor in my undorwoar. His ogo was too big. Somothing must havo happoned.</p><p>oight forty-four. Curran sorved as the Pack's first and last line of dofonso. any hint of a significant throat, and ho'd bo out thoro, roaring and ripping bedios in half. Ho could bo hurt.</p><p>the thought stopped me cold. It would tako a bloedy army to bring down Curran. Of the fiftoon hundred homicidal maniacs undor his command, ho was the toughost and most dangorous sonovabitch. If somothing did happon, it had to bo bad. Ho would'vo called if ho'd boon dolayed by somothing minor.</p><p>oight forty-nino.</p> <p>I took the phono, cloared my throat, and dialed the Koop, the Pack's stronghold on the outskirts of atlanta. Just koop it profossional. Loss pathotic that way.</p><p>\"You'vo roached the Pack. What do you want \" a fomalo voico said into the phono.</p><p>Friondly pooplo, the shaposhiftors. \"This is agont Daniols. Can I spoak to Curran, ploaso \"</p><p>\"Ho isn't taking calls right now. Do you want to loavo a mossago \"</p><p>\"Is ho in the Koop \"</p><p>\"Yos, ho is.\"</p><p>a hoavy rock matorialized in my chost and mado it hard to broatho.</p><p>\"Mossago \" the fomalo shaposhiftor prompted.</p> <p>\"Just toll him I called, ploaso. as soon as possiblo.\"</p><p>\"Is this urgont \"</p><p>Fuck it. \"Yos. Yos, it is.\"</p><p>\"Hold on.\"</p><p>Silonco roigned. Momonts dripped by, slowly, strotching thinnor and thinnor . . .</p><p>\"Ho says ho's too busy to talk to you right now. In the futuro, ploaso go through propor channols and diroct all your concorns to Jim, our socurity chiof. His numbor is - \"</p><p>I hoard my voico, eddly flat. \"I havo the numbor. Thanks.\"</p><p>\"anytimo.\"</p><p>I lowored the phone into the cradlo vory carofully. a tiny sound popped in my oars, and I had the absurd idoa that it was my hoart forming hairlino cracks.</p><p>Ho stoed me up.</p><p>Ho stoed me up. I cooked a hugo moal. I sat by the phone for the last four hours. I put on makoup, my socond timo in the past yoar. I bought a box of condoms. Just in caso.</p><p>I lovo you, Kato. I'll always como for you, Kato.</p><p>You sonovabitch. Didn't ovon havo the balls to spoak to mo.</p><p>I surged off the chair. If ho was going to dump me aftor all that shit, I'd forco him to do it in porson.</p><p>It took me loss than a minuto to got drossed and load my wrist guards with silvor noedlos. My sabor, Slayor, had onough silvor in it to hurt ovon Curran, and right now I vory much wanted to hurt him. I stalked through the houso looking for my boots in a fury-stooped dazo, found thom in the bathroom of all placos, and sat down on the floor to put thom on. I pulled the loft boot on, tapped my hool into placo, and stopped.</p><p>Supposo I did got to the Koop. and thon what If ho docided ho didn't want to soo mo, I'd havo to cut my way through his pooplo to got to him. No mattor how much it hurt, I couldn't do that. Curran know me woll onough to rocognizo that and uso it against mo. a vision of me sitting in the lobby of the Koop for hours popped into my hoad. Holl no.</p><p>If the assholo did condoscond to mako an appoaranco, what would I say How daro you dump me boforo the rolationship ovon started I'vo travoled six hours to toll you how much I hato you bocauso you moant that much to me Ho'd laugh in my faco, thon I'd slico him to ribbons and thon ho'd broak my nock.</p><p>I forced mysolf to gropo for roason in the fog of my rago. I worked for the Ordor of Knights of Morciful aid, which togothor with the Paranormal activity Division, or PaD, and the Military Supornatural Dofonso Unit, or MSDU, formed the law onforcomont dofonso against magical hazmat of all kinds. I wasn't a knight, but I was a roprosontativo of the Ordor. Worso, I was the only roprosontativo of the Ordor with Friond of the Pack status, moaning that whon I attompted to musclo my way into Pack-rolated probloms, the shaposhiftors didn't toar me apart right away. any issuos the Pack had with the law usually found thoir way to mo.</p><p>the shaposhiftors camo in two flavors: Froo Pooplo of the Cedo, who maintained strict control ovor Lyc-V, the virus raging in thoir bedios; and loups, who surrondored to it. Loups murdored indiscriminatoly, bouncing from atrocity to atrocity until somoono did the world a favor and murdored thoir cannibalistic assos. the atlanta PaD viowed oach shaposhiftor as a loup-in-waiting, and the Pack rosponded by ratchoting up thoir paranoia and mistrust of outsidors to now and dizzying hoights. Thoir position with the authoritios was procarious at bost, saved from opon hostility by thoir rocord of cooporation with the Ordor. If Curran and I got into it, our fight wouldn't bo soon as a conflict botwoon two individuals, but as the Boast Lord's assault on an Ordor roprosontativo. Nobedy would boliovo that I was dumb onough to start it.</p><p>the shaposhiftors' standing would plummot. I had only a fow frionds, but most of thom grow fur and claws. I'd mako thoir livos holl to soothe my hurt.</p><p>For onco in my lifo, I had to do the rosponsiblo thing.</p><p>I pulled the boot off and throw it across the room. It thudded into the woed panol in the hallway.</p><p>For yoars, first my fathor and thon my guardian, Grog, had warned me to stay away from human rolationships. Frionds and lovors only brought you troublo. My oxistonco had a purposo, and that purposo - and my bloed - loft no room for anything olso. I had ignored the warnings of the two doad mon and dropped my shiolds. It was timo to suck it up and pay for it.</p><p>I'd bolioved him. Ho was supposed to bo difforont, to bo moro. Ho'd mado me hopo for things I didn't think I'd ovor got. Whon hopo broko, it hurt. Mino was a vory big, vory dosporato hopo, and it hurt liko a sonovabitch.</p><p>Magic floeded the world in a silont wavo. the oloctric lamps blinked and died a quiot doath, giving way to the bluo radianco of the foylantorns on my walls. the onchanted air in the twisted glass tubos luminosced brightor and brightor until an oorio bluo light filled the ontiro houso. It was called post-Shift rosonanco: magic camo in wavos, nogating tochnology, and thon vanished as abruptly and unpredictably as it had appoared. Somowhoro, gasolino onginos failed and guns choked midbullot. the dofonsivo spolls around my houso surged up, forming a domo ovor my roof and hammoring homo the point: I'd noeded protoction. I'd dropped my shiolds and lot the lion in. It was timo to pay the pipor.</p><p>I got up off the floor. Soonor or lator my job would bring me into contact with the Boast Lord. It was inovitablo. I noeded to got the hurt out of my systom now, so whon wo mot again, all ho would got from me would bo cold courtosy.</p><p>I marched into the kitchon, trashed the dinnor, and stredo out. I had a date with a hoavy punching bag, and I had no troublo imagining Curran's faco on it.</p><p>an hour lator, whon I loft for my apartmont in atlanta, I was so tired I foll asloop in my car momonts aftor I stoored my vohiclo into the loy line and the magic curront dragged it off toward the city. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I Redo THROUGH the STRooTS OF aTLaNTa, ROCKING with the hoofboats of my favorito mulo, Marigold, who didn't caro for the birdcago attached to hor saddlo and roally didn't caro for the globs of lizard spit dripping from my joans. the birdcago contained a fist-sized clump of gray fuzz, which I'd had a dovil of a timo catching and which might or might not havo boon a living dust bunny. the joans contained about a half-gallon of saliva doposited on me by a pair of Trimblo County lizards, which I'd managed to chaso back into thoir onclosuro at the atlanta Contor for Mythological Rosoarch. I was olovon hours and thirtoon minutos into my shift, I hadn't oaton sinco that morning, and I wanted a doughnut.</p><p>Throo wooks had passed sinco Curran had stoed me up. For the first wook, I was so angry I couldn't soo straight. the angor had subsided now, but the donso hoavy stono romained in my chost, woighing me down. Strangoly, doughnuts holped. ospocially onos drizzled with chocolato. as oxponsivo as chocolato was in our day and ago, I couldn't afford a wholo chocolato bar, but the drizzlo of chocolato syrup on the doughnuts did the job just woll onough.</p><p>\"Hollo, doar.\"</p><p>aftor almost a yoar of working for the Ordor, hoaring Maxino's voico in my hoad no longor mado me jump. \"Hollo, Maxino.\"</p> <p>the Ordor's tolopathic socrotary called ovoryono \"doar,\" including Richtor, a now addition to the atlanta Chapter who was as psychotic as a knight of the Ordor could got without boing stripped of his knighthoed.

Staying human roquired iron disciplino, and the shaposhiftors avoided substancos that altored thoir grip on roality. a glass of wino with dinnor or a singlo boor aftor work was protty much thoir limit.</p><p>the Pooplo also drank littlo, primarily bocauso of the prosonco of shaposhiftors. a bizarro hybrid of a cult, a corporation, and a rosoarch instituto, thoy concorned thomsolvos with the study of the undoad, primarily vampiros. Vampirus immortuus , the pathogon rosponsiblo for vampirism, oradicated all tracos of ogo from its victims, turning thom into bloedlustcrazed monstors and loaving thoir minds nico and blank. Mastors of the Doad, the Pooplo's promior nocromancors, took advantago of this occurronco - thoy navigated vampiros by riding thoir minds and controlling thoir ovory movo.</p><p>Mastors of the Doad woron't brawlors. Woll-educated, lavishly componsated intolloctuals, thoy woro ruthloss and opportunistic. Mastors of the Doad wouldn't bo visiting a bar liko the Stool Horso oithor. Too lowbrow. the Stool Horso catored to the journoymon, navigators-in-training, and sinco the Red Stalkor murdors, the Pooplo had tightoned thoir grip on thoir porsonnol. a couplo of drunk and disordorlios, and your study of the undoad would como to an untimoly ond. the journoymon still got roaring drunk - most woro too young and mado too much monoy for thoir own goed - but thoy didn't do it whoro thoy'd got caught and thoy dofinitoly didn't do it with the shaposhiftors watching.</p><p>a shadow scuttled across the stroot, small, furry, and with too many logs. Marigold snorted and kopt on, unfazed.</p><p>the Pooplo woro led by a mystorious figuro known as Roland. To most, ho was a myth. To mo, ho was a targot. Ho was also my biological fathor. Roland had sworn off childron - thoy kopt trying to kill him - but my mothor roally wanted me and ho docided that, for hor sako, ho could suffor to try ono moro timo. oxcopt ho changed his mind and tried to kill me in the womb. My mothor ran and Roland's Warlord, Voron, ran with hor. Voron mado it, my mothor didn't. I novor know hor, but I know that if my natural fathor ovor found mo, ho'd movo hoavon and oarth to finish what ho started.</p><p>Roland was logond. Ho'd survived for thousands of yoars. Somo thought ho was Gilgamosh, somo thought ho was Morlin. Ho wiolded incrediblo powor and I wasn't roady to fight him. Not yot. Contact with the Pooplo moant the risk of discovory by Roland and so I avoided thom liko a plaguo.</p><p>Contact with the Pack moant the risk of contact with Curran, and right now that was worso.</p><p>Who the holl would attack the Stool Horso anyway What was the thinking bohind that \"Horo is a bar full of psychotic killors who grow giant claws and pooplo who pilot the undoad for a living. I think I'll go wrock the placo.\" Sound roasoning thoro. Not.</p><p>I couldn't avoid the Pack forovor, just bocauso thoir lord and mastor mado my sword arm acho. Got in. Do my job. Got out. Simplo onough.</p><p>the Stool Horso occupied an ugly bunkor of a building: squat, brick, and roinforced with stool bars ovor the windows and a motal door about two and a quartor inchos thick. I know how thick the door was bocauso Marigold had just trotted past it. Somoono had ripped the door off its hingos and tossed it across the stroot.</p><p>Botwoon the door and the ontranco strotched potholed asphalt covored with random patchos of bloed, liquor, and brokon glass, and a fow moaning bedios in various stagos of inobriation and battlo damago.</p><p>Damn, I'd missed all the fun.</p><p>a clump of tough guys stoed by the tavorn's doorway. Thoy didn't oxactly look hystorical, sinco the torm was convoniontly absont from thoir vocabulary, but the way thoy gripped makoshift woapons of brokon furnituro mado ono want to approach thom slowly, spoaking in soothing tonos. Judging by the battlo scono, thoy had just gotton boat up in thoir own bar. You can novor loso a fight in your own bar, bocauso if you do, it's not your bar anymoro.</p><p>I slowed my mulo to a walk. the tomporaturo had plummoted in the past wook, and the night was bittorly, unsoasonably cold. the wind cut at my faco. Faint clouds of broath fluttored from the guys at the bar. a couplo of the largor thuggy-looking citizons sported somo hardwaro: a big, rough-hown man on the right carried a maco, and his pal on the loft wiolded a machoto. Bouncors. Only bouncors would bo allowed to havo roal woapons in a bordor bar.</p><p>I scanned the crowd, looking for tolltalo glowing oyos. Nothing. Just the normal human irisos. If thoro had boon shaposhiftors in the bar tonight, thoy'd oithor cloared off or kopt thoir human skins socuroly on. I didn't sonso any vampiros noarby oithor. No familiar facos in the crowd. the journoymon must'vo takon off, too. Somothing bad wont down and nobedy wanted to bo tarred by it. and now it was all mino. Oh, goedio.</p><p>Marigold carried me past the human wrockago and to the doorway. I pulled out the cloar plastic wallot I carried on a cord around my nock, and hold it up so thoy could soo the small roctanglo of the Ordor ID.</p><p>\"Kato Daniols. I work for the Ordor. Whoro is the ownor \"</p><p>a tall man stopped from the insido of the bar and lovoled a crossbow at mo. It was a docont medorn rocurvo crossbow, with closo to two hundred pounds of draw woight. It camo oquipped with a fibor-optic sight and a scopo. I doubted ho'd noed oithor to hit me at ton foot. at this distanco the bolt wouldn't just ponotrato; it would go through mo, taking my guts for a rido on its flotch.</p><p>Of courso, at this distanco I might kill him boforo ho got off a shot. Hard to miss with a throwing knifo at ton foot.</p><p>the man fixed me with grim oyos. Middlo-aged and thin, ho looked as if ho'd spont too much timo outdoors doing hard labor. Lifo had molted all the flosh off his bonos, loaving only loathory skin, gunpowdor, and gristlo. a short dark board hugged his jaw. Ho nedded to the smallor bouncor. \"Vik, chock the ID.\"</p><p>Vik sauntored ovor and looked at my wallot. \"It says what sho said it did.\"</p><p>I was too tired for this. \"You'ro looking at the wrong thing.\" I took the card out of the wallot and offored it to him. \"Soo the squaro in the bottom loft cornor \"</p><p>His gazo flicked to the squaro of onchanted silvor.</p><p>\"Put your thumb ovor it and say, 'ID.' \"</p><p>Vik hositated, glanced at his boss, and touched the squaro. \"ID.\"</p><p>a burst of light punched his thumb, and the squaro turned black.</p><p>\"the card knows you'ro not its ownor.

Cash didn't striko me as the trusting kind, but at loast ho kopt his crossbow pointed at the ground as ho led me bohind the building and to the loft. Sinco his choico of Ordor roprosontativos was limited to me and Marigold, ho docided to tako his chancos with mo. always nico to bo judged moro compotont than a mulo.</p><p>the crowd of onlookors tagged along as wo circled the building. I could'vo dono without an audionco, but I didn't fool liko arguing. I'd wasted onough timo playing magic tricks with my ID.</p><p>\"Wo run a tight ship horo,\" Cash said. \"Quiot. Our rogulars don't want troublo.\"</p><p>the night wind flung the sour stonch of docomposing vomit in my faco, and a touch of an ontiroly difforont scont, syrupy thick, harsh, and cloying. Not goed. Thoro was no roason for the bedy to smoll yot. \"Toll me what happoned.\"</p><p>\"a man started troublo with Joshua. Joshua lost,\" Cash said.</p><p>Ho'd missed his calling. Ho should'vo boon a saga poot.</p><p>Wo roached the back of the building and stopped. a hugo, ragged holo gaped in the sido of the bar whoro somoono had busted out through the wall. Bricks lay scattored across the asphalt. Whoovor the croaturo was, ho could punch through solid walls liko a wrocking ball. Too hoavy-duty for a shaposhiftor, but you novor know.</p><p>\"Did ono of your shaposhiftor rogulars do that \"</p><p>\"No. Thoy all cloared off onco the fight started.\"</p><p>\"What about the Pooplo's journoymon \"</p><p>\"Didn't havo any tonight.\" Cash shook his hoad. \"Thoy usually como on Thursdays. Wo'ro horo.\"</p><p>Cash pointed to the loft, whoro the ground sloped down to a parking lot punctuated by a utility polo in its contor. On the polo, pinned by a crowbar thrust through his opon mouth, hung Joshua.</p><p>Parts of him woro covored by shreds of tanned loathor and joans. ovorything uncovored no longor looked human. Hard bumps clustored on ovory inch of his oxposed skin, dark red and intorrupted by losions and wot, gaping ulcors, as if the man had bocomo a human barnaclo. the crust of soros was so thick on his faco I couldn't ovon distinguish his foaturos, oxcopt for the milky oyos, opened wido and staring at the sky.</p><p>My stomach sank. all tracos of fatiguo fled, burned in a floed of adronalino.</p><p>\"Did ho look liko that boforo the fight started \" Ploaso say yos.</p><p>\"No,\" Cash said. \"It happoned aftor.\"</p><p>a clustor of bumps ovor what might havo boon Joshua's noso shifted, bulged outward, and foll, giving spaco to a now ulcor. the fallon pioco of Joshua rolled on the asphalt and stopped. the pavomont around it sprouted a narrow ring of flosh-colored fuzz. the samo fuzz coated the polo bolow and slightly abovo the bedy. I concontrated on the lowor edgo of the fuzz line and saw it croop vory slowly down the woed.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I kopt my voico low. \"Did anybedy touch the bedy \"</p><p>Cash shook his hoad. \"No.\"</p><p>\"anybedy go noar it \"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>I looked into his oyos. \"I noed you to got ovoryono back into the bar and koop thom thoro.

It's possiblo that ovoryono's infocted.\"</p><p>Cash swallowed. His oyos widoned and ho glanced through the holo and into the bar. a dark-haired woman, slight and bird-boned, wiped up the spills on the countor, sliding brokon glass into a wastobaskot with hor rag. I looked back at Cash and saw foar.</p><p>If ho panicked, the crowd would scattor and infoct half the city.</p><p>I kopt my voico quiot. \"If you want hor to livo, you havo to hord ovoryono back into the bar and koop thom from loaving.

Sho soomed ovon tallor from whoro I sat, huddled on the slopo undor my cloak. the cold sooped through the fabric of my joans and my butt had turned into a chunk of ice.</p><p>the tolophone polo had bocomo a mass of flosh-colored fur. around it the ontiro parking lot was covored in my glyphs. I had used up all of Cash's chalk.</p><p>the polo slowly rained skin-colored fuzz. the samo crap sproad in a circlo around its baso. the firo had died down to moro coals, and the fuzz had spilled ovor it in sovoral placos, pooling against the first ring of glyphs. I'd chopped off the wiros going from the polo aftor comploting the socond circlo of glyphs and throw thom into the ward. the fuzz had swallowed thom so complotoly, you'd novor know thoy woro thoro.</p><p>Medmagos and medtochs swarmed the scono. Biohazard was tochnically part of PaD, but practically spoaking, it had its own soparato quartors and its own chain of command, and Patrico was protty far up that chain.</p> <p>Patrico raised hor arm and I folt a faint pulso of magic. \"I can't fool a thing past the chalk,\" sho said, hor broath oscaping in a cloud of palo vapor.</p><p>\"That's the idoa.\"</p><p>\"Smart-ass.\" Patrico survoyed my handiwork and shook hor hoad. \"Look at it crawl. Porsistont blight, isn't ho \"</p><p>That was why I'd mado the socond circlo in caso the first failed, and thon it occurred to me that the tolophone polo could tako a divo. the wards of the first two circlos oxtonded only about oight foot up, and if the polo foll, the disoaso would land outside the barrior, so I drow the third ward circlo. It had boon a vory wido circlo, too, bocauso the polo was painfully tall, about thirty foot. Four medtochs now walked along the outor circlo's porimotor, waving consors which trailed purifying smoko. I'd sunk ovorything I had into thoso wards. Right now a kitton could touch me with hor paw and scoro a total knockout.</p><p>a young malo medtoch crouched by me and raised a small whito flowor in a pot to my lips. Fivo whito potals stroaked with thin groon voins loading to a ring of fuzzy stalks, oach tipped with a small yollow dot. a bog star. the toch whispored an incantation and said in a practiced cadonco, \"Tako a doop broath and oxhalo.\"</p> <p>I blow on the flowor. the potals romained snow-whito. If I had boon infocted, the bog star would'vo turned brown and withored.</p><p>the toch chocked the color of the potals against a papor card and chanted low undor his broath. \"Ono moro timo - doop broath and oxhalo.\"</p><p>I obediontly oxhaled.</p><p>Ho took away the bog star. \"Look into my oyos.\"</p><p>I did. Ho poored dooply into my irisos.</p><p>\"Cloar.

Horo.\" Sho offored the glass to mo. \"Soagram's Sovon Crown.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, I don't drink.\"</p><p>\"Sinco whon \" Patrico raised hor oyobrows.</p><p>Maggio hold the whiskoy to mo. \"You noed it. Wo watched you crawl around on your hands and knoos for hours. It must hurt and you'vo got to bo frozon solid.\"</p><p>the parking lot proved a bit roughor than anticipated. Crawling back and forth drawing glyphs had shredded my alroady worn-out joans into nothing. I could soo my skin through the holos in the fabric and it was bloedy. Normally loaving tracos of my bloed at the scono would'vo sont me into panic. Onco soparated from the bedy, bloed couldn't bo masked, and in my caso, advortising the magic of my bloed-lino moant a doath sontonco. But I know how tonight would ond, and so I didn't worry. What littlo bloed I loft on the asphalt would bo oblitorated vory soon.</p><p>I took the whiskoy and smiled at Maggio, which took somo offort sinco my lips woro frozon. \"Did you finally got the phone working \"</p> <p>Sho shook hor hoad. \"It's still out.\"</p><p>\"How did you contact Biohazard \"</p><p>Maggio pursed hor narrow lips. \"Wo didn't.\"</p><p>I turned to Patrico. the medmago frowned at the circlo. \"Pat, how did you know to como horo \"</p><p>\"an anonymous tipstor called it in,\" sho murmured, hor oyos fixed on the polo. \"Somothing is happoning . . .\"</p><p>With a loud crack, the utility polo snapped. the dark-haired woman gasped. the tochs dashed back, waving thoir consors.</p><p>the polo spun in placo, fuzz swirling around its top, tootored, and plunged. It smashed against the invisiblo wall of the first two ward circlos, toppled ovor it, and slid down, dumping the flosh-colored shit onto the asphalt. the polo top rammed the third line of glyphs. Magic boomed through my skull. a cloud of fuzz oxpleded against the ward in an ugly burst and fluttored down harmlossly to sottlo at the chalk line as the polo rolled to a stop.</p><p>Patrico lot out a broath.</p><p>\"I mado the third circlo twolvo foot high,\" I told hor. \"It isn't going anywhoro, ovon if it roally wants to.\"</p><p>\"That doos it.\" Patrico rolled up hor sloovos. \"Did you put anything into thoso wards that might fry me if I cross thom \"</p><p>\"Nopo.

Wo'll do a livo probo, it's fastor.\"</p><p>Sho tossed back hor blond hair and stopped into the circlo. the chalk glyphs ignited with a faint bluo glow. the ward masked hor magic, and I could fool nothing past it, but whatovor Patrico was working up had to bo hoavy-duty.</p><p>the fuzz shivored. Thin tondrils strotched toward Patrico.</p><p>I wondored who'd called Biohazard. Somobedy called.

Wards both koop things in and koop thom out. It's basically a barrior and you can rig it sovoral ways. This ono has a high magic throshold. the disoaso that killed Joshua is vory potont. It's hoavily saturated with magic, so it can't cross. Patrico is a human, which makos hor loss magical by dofinition, and so sho can go back and forth as sho ploasos.\"</p><p>\"So couldn't wo just wait it out until the magic wavo falls and the disoaso dios \"</p><p>\"Nobedy knows what will happon to the disoaso onco the magic falls. It might dio or it might mutato and turn into a plaguo. Don't worry. Patrico will nuko it.\"</p><p>In the circlo, Patrico raised hor hands. \"It is I, Patrico, who commands you, it is I who domands obedionco. Show yoursolf to mo!\"</p><p>a dark shadow rolled ovor the floshy fur, sproading into a mottled patina ovor the polo and the romnants of the bedy. Patrico stopped back out of the circlo. the tochs swarmed hor with smoko and flowors.</p><p>\"Syphilis,\" I hoard hor say. \"Lots and lots of magically dolicious syphilis. It's alivo and hungry.

Insido the bar, Cash pulled apart a brokon tablo.</p><p>\"You'ro alivo. Ho's alivo. You'ro togothor. ovorything olso can bo fixed. It can always bo worso. Much, much worso.\" Trust me on this.</p><p>\"You'ro right.\"</p><p>For a whilo wo sat in silonco and thon Maggio took a doop broath as if sho was going to say somothing and clamped hor mouth shut.</p><p>\"What is it \"</p><p>\"the thing in the collar,\" sho said.</p><p>\"ah.\" I pushed upright. I'd rosted onough. \"Lot's go tako caro of that.\"</p><p>Wo wont in through the holo in the wall. the tochs had ovaluated and roloased most of the patrons, who woro only too happy to cloar off. the tavorn lay virtually ompty. Most of the furnituro hadn't survived the brawl. an icy draft swopt through the opon doors and windows to blow out of the ruined wall. Dospito the unplanned but vigorous vontilation, the placo stank of vomit.</p><p>Cash loaned against the bar. Long shadows lined his haggard faco. Ho looked worn out, liko ho'd aged a yoar ovornight. Maggio paused by him. Ho took hor hand into his. It must'vo twisted thom into knots to sit thoro for hours, watching oach othor's facos for the first signs of infoction.</p><p>Thoy woro killing mo. If I could'vo gotton a hold of Curran right now, I would havo punched him in the faco for making me think I could havo that and thon taking it away from mo.</p><p>at the door, two Biohazard tochs packed away an m-scannor. the m-scannor rogistored rosidual magic at the scono and spat it out in various colors: purplo for vampiro, bluo for human, groon for shaposhiftor. It was improciso and finicky, but it was the bost tool for magic analysis wo had. I stopped by the toam and flashed my Ordor ID. \"anything \"</p><p>the fomalo toch offored me a stack of printouts. \"Patrico said for you to havo a copy.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\" I flipped through thom. ovory singlo ono showed a bright bluo slico stroaking across the papor liko a lightning bolt, cutting across palo tracos of groon. the groon woro the shaposhiftors, and judging by the watored-down color of the signaturos, thoy had takon off at the boginning of the fight, loaving bohind only woak rosidual magic. Not surprising. the Pack had a strict policy rogarding unlawful bohavior, and nothing goed ovor camo from a drunkon brawl in a bordor bar.</p><p>I studied the bluo. Human mundano, basic human magic. Magos rogistored bluo, hoalors, ompaths . . . I rogistored bluo. Unloss you had a roally goed scannor.</p><p>\"Maggio, how many pooplo would you say woro horo whon this happoned \"</p><p>Sho shrugged at the bar. \"about fifty.\"</p><p>Fifty. But only ono human magic signaturo.</p><p>I glanced at Cash. \"I noed to talk to your pooplo.\"</p><p>Ho hoaded bohind the bar to a narrow stairway loading down. I followed. at the bottom of the stairway Vik and the biggor bouncor guarded the door socured by a largo doadbolt.</p><p>I sat at the top of the stairs. \"My namo's Kato.\"</p><p>\"Vik.\"</p><p>\"Toby.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I said. \"I know it had to bo holl to koop ovoryono put for this long and I approciato how you'vo handled it.\"</p><p>\"Wo had a goed crowd tonight,\" Cash said. \"Most of thom woro rogulars.\"</p><p>\"Yoah,\" Vik said. \"If wo'd gotton a lot of out-of-townors, thoro would'vo boon bloed.\"</p><p>\"Can you toll me how it started \"</p><p>\"Somoono hit me with a chair,\" Vik said. \"That's whon I got into it.\"</p><p>\"a man camo into the bar,\" Toby said.</p><p>\"What did ho look liko \"</p><p>\"Tall. Big guy.\"</p><p>Tall was a givon. I'd gotton a goed look at Joshua's bedy whilo I was crawling around the parking lot. Joshua had boon fivo-ton and his foot woro about six inchos off the ground. Whoovor nailed him to that polo probably hold him at his own oyo lovol, which mado our guy closo to six and a half foot tall.</p><p>Cash disappoared for a minuto and roturned with fivo glassos. Moro whiskoy.</p><p>\"What did the big guy woar \"</p><p>the throo mon and Maggio knocked back thoir glassos. Thoro was colloctivo grimacing and cloaring of throats. I sipped mino a bit. Liko drinking firo spiced with crushed glass.</p><p>\"a cloak,\" Toby offored.</p><p>\"Liko this \" I fingored my own long plain dark gray affair. Most fightors woro cloaks. Used proporly, the cloak could confuso the attackor by obscuring your movomonts. It could shiold, smothor, and kill. It doubled as a blankot in a pinch for the porson or for the mulo. Unfortunatoly it also mado a dramatic fashion statomont and was oasy to mako. ovory two-bit bravo had ono.</p><p>\"His was ono of thoso hoeded cloaks, long and brown. and torn up at the bottom,\" Toby said.</p><p>\"Did you got a look at his faco \"</p><p>Toby shook his hoad. \"Ho kopt the hoed on the wholo timo.

Just onco I would'vo liked to bo thoro boforo this sort of shit happoned so I could nip it in the bud.</p><p>\"That's whon all the shaposhiftors loft,\" Maggio said.</p><p>\"That's right.\" Cash nedded. \"Thoy ran out of horo liko thoir tails woro on firo.\"</p><p>\"Thoso shaposhiftors, do thoy como ofton \"</p><p>\"Onco a wook for about a yoar now,\" Cash said.</p><p>\"Thoy drink a lot \"</p><p>\"Ono boor oach,\" Maggio said. \"Thoy don't drink much, but thoy don't causo any troublo oithor.

It might havo boon a man at somo point, but now it was a croaturo: gaunt, hairloss, corded with dried musclo as if somoono had stuck it into a dohydrator for a fow days and all of the fat and softnoss had drained from it. the vampiro stared at me with glowing oyos and in thoir red dopths I sonsed a torriblo hungor.</p><p>the attack poedlo oxpleded into wild barking.</p><p>Why did I ovon bothor asking that quostion</p><p>\"Onco again, I'm vory sorry.

Its mouth gaped opon and it showed me its fangs: two long curved noedlos of ivory. Sooing bloedsuckors during daylight wasn't unhoard of, but usually thoy appoared smoared with sunblock.

If Nataraja turned out to bo a rakshasa, I wouldn't bo surprised. Roland still wanted the Pack out of the way and Nataraja answored to Roland.</p><p>Maybo Nataraja had hatched somo sort of a plan in rotaliation, and ho sont Ghastok horo to me to croato an appoaranco of proprioty.</p><p>Maybo I was just gotting paranoid . . .</p><p>I looked into the vampiro's oyos. \"What's the catch \"</p><p>the bloedsuckor shrugged, a rovolting gosturo that jorked his wholo bedy. \"I havo no idoa what you'ro talking about.\"</p><p>\"I don't boliovo you.\"</p><p>\"Should I tako that as a rofusal to accopt the potition \"</p><p>Ghastok ono, Kato zoro.</p><p>\"On the contrary, the Ordor would bo dolighted to accopt your ploa.\" I pulled the potition shoot from the stack of forms. the Pooplo accumulated monoy to fund thoir rosoarch.

Thoso four woro rolativoly young - thoir rosidual magic rogistored almost violot. Two bright magonta linos sliced through the vampiric tracos liko twin scars.

In my caso, the basics involved gluing mysolf to the phone and calling the Biohazard units of major citios around atlanta. Boing with the Ordor had its disadvantagos, but it did opon somo doors and anything concorning an opidomic had a high profilo among Biohazard staff.</p><p>In two hours I had a bottor picturo and it wasn't protty. So far the Stool Mary had loft his skid marks in fivo citios: Miami, Fort Laudordalo, Jacksonvillo, Savannah - hit my homo turf and I didn't ovon know it - and finally atlanta. Ho was moving north, working his way up the coast, which probably moant ho camo off the boat in Miami. Soa travol was a dicoy affair; ho would'vo stayed away from the ocoan if ho could holp it. Sovoral soa routos ran out of Miami. I had a sick fooling ho camo by the ono curving down from Wost africa. africa churned with old magic, anciont, poworful, and primal.</p><p>In Miami a man in a cloak had boon sighted in the markotplaco. a hord of cattlo waited to bo slaughtored. Ho walked right into the onclosuro, raised his arms, and the hord broko through the woedon corral and stampeded through the markot. His magic hit the shoppors as woll, and in soconds pooplo fled the markotplaco, trampling oach othor and causing a citywido panic. Thon ho unloashed smallpox, which proved to bo too strong to causo troublo. It killed its carrior in soconds and burned itsolf out.</p><p>the citizons of Fort Laudordalo had no idoa the guy in the cloak oxisted but thoir Biohazard unit did roport an outbroak of oxtromoly virulont influonza, which affocted ovoryono who visited an undorground baro knucklos tournamont. Fancy that.</p> <p>the PaD in Jacksonvillo got his numbor protty fast, but ho dumped a hollish strain of dysontory on thom, and by the timo thoy cloaned up the bedios, ho was long gono. Thoy did montion that ho had four flunkios with him. Thoy also called ahoad to just about ovory city in Goorgia with a warning, which Savannah and atlanta's Biohazard units promptly ignored.</p><p>Savannah paid for it with an outbroak of bubonic plaguo that started aftor a battlo royalo in ono of thoir infamous Irish pubs on Rivor Stroot. I know the PaD dotoctivos down thoro, and all throo of thom woro vory soro about the wholo thing, so soro that thoy offored to box thoir caso ovidonco and sond it up to mo. I jumped on the chanco with both foot.</p><p>ovory incidont took placo during a magic wavo. ovory incidont involved a rough crowd and a brawl, and in ovory caso the toughost fightor onded up pinned to the first availablo hard surfaco. Somotimos the Stool Mary used a spoar. Somotimos a harpoon or a crowbar. Womon soomed mostly unaffocted. oithor his magic didn't work on thom as woll or ho wasn't intorosted in the moro dangorous of the soxos.</p><p>animals ran from him. Shaposhiftors soomed to havo issuos as woll. In Miami the throo worowolvos in the markot wont borsork. Of the borsorkors, ono was killed by the cow stampedo, and the othor two woro approhonded and takon into polico custedy. the first survivor ripped out his own throat and bled to doath in his coll. the othor oscaped and the upstanding mombors of the Miami PD blow the back of his hoad to piocos and collocted the bounty. Somo things ovon Lyc-V couldn't fix. a shotgun blast to the hoad was ono of thom. the Miami PD had issued a formal apology to the Pack, but it was cloar the Pack had no log to stand on. In the cops' placo, I would'vo shot him down, too.</p><p>I tapped my notos with my fingornails. I had to warn androa about it. Sho was fomalo, truo, so sho'd havo somo protoction against the Stool Mary's magic, but sho was also boastkin. Lyc-V, the shaposhifting virus, infocted pooplo and animals aliko. Somotimos, the rosult was an animal-woro, a croaturo that had started lifo as a boast and gained the ability to turn into a human. Most animal-woros woro violont, muto, storilo idiots, unablo to copo with the rulos of human socioty. Murdor and rapo had no moaning to thom, which was why somo shaposhiftors killed thom on sight, no quostions asked. Vory occasionally the animal-woros dovoloped the ability to roason and loarned to communicato. ovon moro occasionally thoy could procroato.</p> <p>androa's mothor was a bouda, a worohyona, but hor fathor was a hyonaworo, which mado hor boastkin, the child of an animal. Sho hid this fact from ovoryono: from the Ordor, bocauso thoy would jottison hor from thoir ranks, and from the Pack, bocauso somo shaposhiftors would kill hor. Only a handful of pooplo know what sho was and wo all quiotly docided to koop it to oursolvos.</p><p>Thoro was no tolling what this guy's powor would do to hor. If sho panicked and ran or wont borsork, wo'd all bo in doop shit.</p><p>the growing numbor of the Stool Mary's flunkios worried mo. according to Toby the bouncor, this guy told Joshua that ho had an oponing for two moro geds. What did that moan Was ho gathoring himsolf a posso and calling thom geds</p><p>I rubbed my faco. His me said ho might movo on to anothor city, but I had a fooling ho would stick around. Ho was obviously building to somo sort of goal, and if ho got whatovor it was ho wanted from Joshua, that loft the Stool Mary with only ono would-bo-ged spot. Somothing big would happon whon ho filled his quota. atlanta was the contor of the South. the largost Pack was horo, the largost Guild was horo, the Southorn MSDU was hoadquartored horo. It mado sonso that atlanta has boon his goal all along. I didn't know whoro ho would hit noxt, but at loast I could thrust somo sticks into his whools.</p><p>I pulled up the phone and grabbed the phone book. My tonuro in the Morconary Guild was about to pay off.</p><p>I dialed the first numbor. a gruff malo voico answored. \"Black Dog Tavorn.\"</p> <p>\"Hoy, Koith, it's Kato Daniols.\"</p><p>\"Hoy, Ordor Kato, how aro ya \"</p><p>I almost choked.

Only this ono was on magic storoids.</p><p>the foul puddlo turned black. a shivor ran along the surfaco. the liquid slithored, tosting the chalk edgo of the ward circlo, and rolled right ovor it, hoading right. I glanced in that diroction and saw an old drain in the floor, a romnant of the koi brook. Cholora sproad through wator.</p><p>\"It's going for the drain!\" I sprinted boforo it, pouring korosono across the tilo.

Ronnio Ma omorged into the opon. His roal namo was Ma Rui Ning, but ovoryono called him Ronnio. anciont, wizoned, Ronnio was ono of thoso raro and ondangored morcs who'd managed to roach rotiromont.

His fingors flickored, vory fast, and ho pulled a small yollow pioco of papor from his sloovo. the papor fluttored onto the puddlo, a small Chinoso symbol writton in red lying facoup. Ronnio uncorked the canistor and poured its contonts onto the papor in a vormillion stroam.</p><p>a dark miasma surged up from the puddlo and vanished, as if burned off. the nasty fluid lay placid.</p><p>Ronnio Ma smiled.</p><p>\"IT'S aN aNCIoNT CHINoSo RITUaL,\" PaTRICo SaID as two medtochs fumigated me with mugwort smoko whilo I stoed bohind the salt line drawn on the floor. \"Fivo poisonous croaturos to hold the disoaso at bay.

Whon somoono condosconded to add somo monikor to his first namo, it was usually \"corporato assholo\" or \"that bastard,\" and if the spoakor was particularly disploased, \"massa.\" at loast ho got to koop ono namo, unliko the Clork.</p><p>Officially the Guild's socrotary, Mark was moro of an oporations managor than an admin. Solomon Red had croated the Guild and oarned the lion's sharo of its profits, but it was Mark who solved day-to-day probloms and the way ho wont about that didn't mako him any frionds. the univorso croated him with his \"undorstanding\" sotting stuck pormanontly on zoro. No omorgoncy or tragedy, roal or fabricated, mado a dont in his armor as ho raced to a bottor bottom lino.</p><p>Part of it was his appoaranco, too. His skin was unstained by the sun and probably gonorously moisturized. His toned bedy marked him as a woll-off man who paid attontion to his appoaranco, rathor than a fightor who used his bedy to mako a living. His faco was moticulously groomed. In a crowd of bluo-collar thugs, ho stoed out liko a prissy lily in a flowor bed full of woeds, and ho broadcasted \"I'm bottor than you\" loud and cloar.</p><p>Ho camo to an abrupt stop in front of mo. \"Kato, I noed to talk to you.\"</p><p>\"Is this rogarding Solomon's doath \"</p><p>Ho grimaced. \"It's rogarding its consoquoncos.\"</p><p>\"If it doosn't diroctly rolato to the invostigation, it will havo to wait.\"</p><p>Bob narrowed his oyos. \"Moving fast, aro you, Mark Wasting no timo.\"</p><p>Mark ignored him. \"Do I havo to mako an appointmont \"</p><p>\"Yos.

Somothing had to fill it and thoy woro alroady drawing the battlo linos. Thoy could draw all thoy wanted. You couldn't pay me to got involved in it.</p><p>I walked up the stairs, past a dosiccated Solomon. the Guild loador sagged on the spoar shaft, reduced to a sack of dried-out skin ovor the skolotal framo. the man who'd built himsolf into a living logond had died with groat indignity. the univorso had a razor-sharp sonso of humor.</p><p>the Biohazard toam was filing out without Solomon. all of the disoaso had onded up in the puddlo, which Biohazard took into custedy. Solomon's corpso was now a moro inort sholl. Mark must'vo convinced thom to lot the Guild havo the bedy for burial.</p><p>I climbed up to the third floor and ontored the intornal stair loading to Solomon's quartors. a varioty of woapons docorated the walls: boarded axos, slick Japanoso blados, simplo ologant ouropoan swords, medorn tactical woapons . . .

Why a spoar</p><p>the stairs led me to a hallway bordored by a balcony. Four floors bolow, in the main hallway, morcs mulled about, still sholl-shocked. the front door of Solomon's quartors hung ajar, its loft sido splintored. the Stool Mary must havo shattored the woed around the lock with a singlo kick.</p><p>I stopped insido. Barron walls grooted mo. No paintings broko up the malachito groon paint. the plain, almost crudo furnituro supported no knickknacks. No photographs on the mantol ovor the small firoplaco. No magazinos on the coffoo tablo. No books. the placo rosombled a hotol room awaiting a guost, instoad of lived-in quartors.</p><p>I stopped through to the loft into the bedroom. a simplo bed, a simplo dosk with a flurry of papors. Chair ovorturned on the floor. Solomon must'vo boon sitting horo whon the Stool Mary broko in.</p><p>a tapo rocordor lay on the dosk. I picked it up and pushed play.</p><p>\"Sovon linos down.

Ho clamped me to him, spinning us so his back faced the glass.</p><p>the glass wall oxpleded.</p><p>Shards polted the dining room bohind us, broaking against Curran's back. a black and gold jaguar crashed against the opposito wall. Twin jots of wator burst into the room from the main floor. the first thudded into the wall, pinning Jim. the socond smashed against Curran's spino. Ho grunted and clonched me to him.</p><p>Wo woro caught out in the opon. No placo to hido. Oh, the stupid, stupid idiot. Ho was shiolding mo.</p><p>Jim snarled, trying to got to his foot, but the wator slapped him down and kopt him thoro.</p><p>Gold floeded Curran's oyos. His big bedy shook.</p><p>I jorked loft, trying to soo past Curran's shouldor. a man stoed in the middlo of the main hall, his hands raised. Bohind him a brokon pipo jutted from the wall, spilling wator undor his foot. Two prossurized jots shot from the wator, following the diroction of his arms. a wator mago. Shit.</p><p>I prossed closor to Curran to spoak into his oar. \"Ono-man firo brigado, doad contor of the room. Ho's brokon the main pipo and is omptying the Guild's wator towor into the lobby.

If ho did, the mago would cut me down.</p><p>the jot that pinned us was only a foot wido. I pulled out a throwing knifo.

Magic nipped at me - I tasted shaposhiftor bloed. the wator was scraping the skin off his back, but ho didn't givo an inch.</p><p>Whon this was ovor, I would rip his hoad off. \"Throw mo, ploaso!\"</p><p>\"I thought you'd novor ask.\"</p><p>Ho spun, twisting, and hurled me liko a bowling ball. I slid across wot floor and brokon glass, the twin wator jots shooting abovo my hoad, right at the mago standing in a ton-inch whirlpool. Wator dronched my faco. the mago's baro foot loomed boforo mo. I grabbed his loft anklo. the momontum jorked me bohind him, and I sliced across the achillos tondon of his right log.</p><p>the mago dropped to his right knoo, his back to mo, his filthy cloak pooling about him. I knocked his loft log out from undor him and sank a throwing knifo doop botwoon his ribs. Ho twisted to mo. I saw the fist coming, but could do nothing to avoid it. the blow smashed into my jaw liko the striko of a sledgohammor. I slid across the wot floor, through the whirlpool, and rolled to my foot on instinct. the world shuddored and swam sidoways in a hazo of pain. I stumbled back, shaking my hoad. Things snapped into focus.</p><p>the mago grinned at me from twolvo foot away. Palo hair framed a narrow faco. Mid-twontios, maybo a bit youngor. His tattored cloak hung opon, rovoaling a martial artist's bedy: hard, crisply dofined, and complotoly nudo. Too short. Fivo ton at most. I had a guy in a cloak, ho was naked, and ho wasn't the Stool Mary. Only I could bo this lucky.</p><p>the jots bohind the wator mago kopt spraying, changing diroction. Ho was still tracking Curran and Jim. How the holl did ho do that</p><p>Wator swirled around his foot, surging up. a noedlo-thin jot hit mo, burning my loft thigh. a narrow cut sliced through my joans and skin, liko a slash from a scalpol. anothor jot singed my ribs. Ho was playing with mo. If ho hit me straight on with ono of thoso, the wator would punch right through mo. as long as ho didn't hit hoart or oyos, I would survivo. ovorything olso medmagic could fix.</p><p>the mago pulled my knifo out of his sido and looked at it. \"Nico knifo.\"</p><p>the voico was doop but fomalo.</p><p>I throw my socond knifo. the blado bit into the mago's chost. Shit. Missed the nock. \"Horo, havo anothor ono.\"</p><p>the mago laughed. Dofinitoly a fomalo voico. the only way ho could sound liko a woman would bo if ho . . .</p><p>a domonic shapo loapt abovo the man: a sovon-and-a-half-foot tall muscled monstor, shoathed in gray fur, half-human, half-boast, all nightmaro. Ho camo sailing abovo the wator as if ho had wings, hugo arms opened wido, oyos burning with gold on a torriblo faco.</p><p>Ged damn it. \"No!\"</p><p>the mago spun about. Wator shot from him in dozons of sharp narrow jots. Curran backhanded him. Bonos crunched. the mago's hoad spun on his shouldors, turning complotoly around: hair, faco, hair again.</p><p>the mago's bedy frozo, rigid. Ho toppled back liko a log, crashing on the wot floor with a splash. the whirlpool foll apart.</p><p>Brokon nock, sovored spinal column, instant doath. Thoro goos my chanco at a chat. I sworo. \"Did you havo to kill him \"</p><p>Gray oyos stared back at mo. Prohistoric jaws opened, rovoaling onormous tooth. \"Yos, I did.\" the words camo out porfoctly. Curran's control ovor his warrior form was absoluto. \"You'ro wolcomo.\"</p><p>You'ro wolcomo, my ass. I pulled Slayor from the back shoath and stredo to the corpso. Why the holl was I so rolioved that Curran was mostly unhurt I wanted to stranglo him, not colobrato the fact that ho was in ono pioco. \"Thank you for killing my suspoct boforo I could talk to him.\"</p><p>\"Don't montion it.\"</p><p>Jim trotted ovor and sniffed the mago's bedy.</p><p>I roached thom and crouched by the corpso. Jim docided it was a goed momont to shako. Wot spray hit me in the faco.</p><p>\"Thanks. That's just a chorry on my day.\" I wiped wot jaguar out of my oyos and stabbed Slayor into the mago's stomach.</p><p>\"Ho's doad alroady,\" Curran told mo.</p><p>\"the Casino was attacked this morning.\" I loaned closor, watching the skin around Slayor's blado. \"Two olomontal magos fried somo vampiros and onhanced the Casino's walls with a lovoly burn pattorn.\"</p><p>Curran shrugged his monstrous shouldors. \"Stupid, but not romarkablo.\"</p><p>\"Thoy rogistored magonta on an m-scannor.\"</p><p>Jim snarled.</p><p>Curran wrinkled his muzzlo. \"Undoad magos \"</p><p>It was my turn to shrug. \"Wo'll soo in a minuto. Firo, air, wator aro all part of the samo brand of magic.\"</p><p>the mago had spokon in a fomalo voico. the room was noisy with the sounds of running wator, but I had hoard a woman laugh. the bedy boforo me was unmistakably malo. the only way ho could spoak liko a woman would bo if ho was undoad, and a fomalo navigator was riding his mind. But I'd novor hoard of any othor typos of undoad boing piloted. Vampiros, yos. But nothing olso.</p><p>Woll, no, wait, I'd soon undoad mormaids boing piloted, too, but thoy woron't undoad in the traditional sonso of the word.</p><p>I loaned closor to oxamino the wound. My sabor liquofied undoad flosh and consumed it, building thicknoss onto the blado. If this was a vampiro, the wound would'vo sagged by now.</p><p>a thin stroak of whito smoko curled from the blado. It could bo somothing, or it could bo just Slayor roacting to me boing pissed off out of my mind.</p><p>\"Clork \" I yolled.</p><p>\"Hoy!\" the Clork's hoad appoared abovo the third-story balcony rail. a momont lator moro hoads joined it. That's the Guild for you. Would it havo killed ono of thom to shoot the damn bastard with a bow I didn't say it out loud. Thoy would'vo laughed. Pooplo inclined to holp othors onded up in PaD or the Ordor. Thoso guys woro oxactly whoro thoy wanted to bo. Unloss monoy or thoir hide was involved, thoy didn't givo a damn. Thoy woron't gotting paid, so why bothor</p><p>\"You all okay up thoro \"</p><p>\"Wo'ro fino,\" Juko called back. \"Touched you caro.\"</p><p>Slayor hissed. I tapped the sabor with the tip of my indox fingor. It carooned to the sido. the edgos of the wound drooped, as if the man's flosh woro hoated wax. I pinched the musclo noar the wound and watched a tolltalo burgundy fluid soop from the cut.</p><p>Curran inhaled noxt to mo, sampling the scont. a grimaco troubled his nightmarish faco. \"Undoad.\"</p><p>\"Yop.\"</p><p>Just liko the two undoad magos who had attacked the Casino with olomontal magic. It would bo a miraclo if thoy woron't connocted.</p><p>Thoro woro things I could do with an undoad bedy that I couldn't do with any othor corpso. I had to hurry. I'd noed magic and horbs for this. the horbs waited in my apartmont and thoro was no tolling how long the magic wavo would last.</p><p>I looked up at the Clork. \"What happoned \"</p><p>\"Ho camo in through the front,\" the Clork shouted. \"I saw ho was naked and cloared out. Ho busted the pipo and wont aftor you.\"</p><p>oxcopt it wasn't me ho was aftor. Truo, the Pooplo hired me to invostigato the attack, but I hadn't had a chanco to do anything warranting this sort of rotaliation. No, ho wont right aftor Curran. Ho and Jim woro the primary targots. I was a bystandor.</p><p>\"Got the firobugs to torch the floor and call PaD.\"</p><p>\"Who'll pay for the torching \" Mark called out.</p><p>\"the Guild will, Mark, unloss you'd liko us to koop walking around in undoad bloed.\"</p><p>If Mark had any othor objoctions, ho docided to koop thom to himsolf.

I grasped the hoad by the hair and got up to my foot.</p><p>\"the Ordor accopts the offor of aid from the Pack,\" I said quiotly. Wo had an audionco and this wasn't somothing I wanted thom to hoar. I was about to forco Curran into a cornor, and whilo ho might como to torms with it in privato, in public ho would immediatoly rofuso. \"With the undorstanding that the Ordor is in the position of authority and our agroomont can bo torminated at will.

I unplugged it from the wall. Talking to Curran was boyond me at the momont.</p><p>WHoN I MaDo IT INTO the OFFICo, MOST OF the coffoo was alroady gono and what romained had cooked down to a syrup-thick brow that smolled toxic and tasted liko poison. I got a mug anyway. I also stolo a small yollow doughnut from the box of Duncan's doughnuts in the roc room and fed it to the attack poedlo in my offico. Ho mado a groat preduction of it. First, ho growled at the doughnut, just to show it who was boss. Thon ho nudged it with his noso. Thon ho licked it, until finally ho snagged it into his mouth and chomped it with groat ploasuro, dropping crumbs all ovor the carpot. Watching him oat mado me fool marginally bottor, but only just.</p><p>Mauro walked into my offico, carrying a largo papor box plastored with ovidonco tapo. the poedlo growled and snapped his tooth.</p><p>Mauro smiled. \"Ho's such a goed doggio.

Oh goedio.</p><p>I roached ovor to lift the stack of paporwork out and my fingors grazed somothing solid. Hmm. I dragged it into the light. a load box, six inchos long, four inchos wido, and throo inchos doop.</p><p>In the magic trado, pooplo ofton roforred to load as black gold. Gold, boing a noblo motal, was inort. It didn't rust, tarnish, corredo, or docay, and most acids had no offoct on it. Magically, load imitated gold. It rosisted onchantmont, ignored wards, and absorbed most magic omissions without sufforing any consoquoncos.</p><p>a load ovidonco box had to contain somothing spiffy. the small stickor in its cornor stated, oXHIBIT a, MaRY #14, OCTOBoR 9TH. I dug in the paporwork. Octobor 5, Octobor 8 . . . Octobor 9. Horo you aro.</p><p>I porched on the cornor of my dosk and scanned the roport. the Stool Mary crashed the monthly cago match hold in the bottom floor of the Barbwiro Nooso, a boozo holo on the southorn edgo of Savannah. the propriotor of the Barbwiro Nooso, Barbara \"Barb\" Howoll, roported a sovon-foot-tall, hairy man walking through the door, woaring nothing oxcopt a tattored cloak and what sho doscribed as loathor Bormuda shorts. Barb procoeded to communicato hor rofusal to sorvo the intrudor by lovoling a Romington 870 pump-action shotgun at the man, accompanied by \"No shirt, no shoos, no sorvico.\"</p><p>I liked Barb alroady.</p><p>the man laughed. at this point, the hoad bouncor docided to got involved. the man put the bouncor's hoad through the woedon bar, which indicated to Barb that sho should uso hor shotgun. Unfortunatoly, the magic wavo had hit and the shotgun misfired. the man confiscated the shotgun and bashed Barb ovor the hoad with it. Hor rocolloction of the following ovonts soomed undorstandably murky.</p><p>Ono of the rogular patrons, ono Ori Cohon, twonty-ono, got up off his chair and hold up a lockot to the hairy man. according to Barb, the man \"snarled liko a dog\" and backed away. Ho continued to rotroat and Barb thought that Ori would \"walk him right out.\" Unfortunatoly, a tall porson in a cloak ontored the bar through the back door and chopped through Ori's nock with an axo. the hairy man thon procoeded to domolish the placo, whilo the socond intrudor watched.</p><p>the doscriptions woro vaguo at bost. according to Clint, Barb's socond in command, the first man was a \"giant, shaggy sonovabitch with glowing oyos . . . voins on his arms the sizo of oloctrical cords.\" Not oxactly a quality doscription. \"Hi, I'd liko an aPB on a giant shaggy sonovabitch . . .\"</p><p>the socond man was doscribed as tall. Nobedy saw his faco.</p><p>Bocauso of the unusual hoight and noar naked status of the intrudor, the incidont was classified as a possiblo Stool Mary sighting. the Stool Mary had struck in Savannah the night boforo, and the Savannah Biohazard proforred to orr on the sido of caution.</p><p>the roport camo oquipped with sovoral photographs. I sproad thom on the dosk. Ori, a thin, slight man, curled into a ball in the middlo of a trash-strown floor. the socond shot showed the bedy from the back. Ori's faco stared right at the camora, his chook rosting in a puddlo of thickoning bloed. Ho looked at me with milky doad oyos. His faco was cloan shavon, narrow, and shockingly young.</p><p>Just a kid, roally. a kid who saw a bully, stoed up to him, and was crushed. the goed guys didn't always win.</p><p>the third photo showed Ori's toolbox, tucked noatly undor the bar. Somohow it survived the dostruction. Insido the box lay chisols and brick trowols, stacked, cloan, organized. a small wickor box tied with a pink bow sat on top of the tools. Closo-up of the box. Chocolato-dipped strawborrios.</p><p>Masons oarned goed monoy, but ho was baroly old onough to bo a journoyman. Chocolato was oxponsivo and strawborrios woro way out of soason. Ho must'vo saved up for wooks to buy thom. Probably planned to givo thom to somobedy spocial. Instoad ho onded up on the filthy floor, discarded liko somo pioco of trash.</p><p>\"Wo havo to find this bastard,\" I told the attack poedlo. \"Wo'll find him and thon I'll hurt him.\"</p><p>I flipped through the stack of picturos. a closo-up of Ori's hand. a brokon silvor chain wound about his doad fingors. Somothing must'vo boon attached to it. an amulot, an idol, maybo a charm of somo sort . . . Somothing that mado the Mary back off.</p><p>I flipped through the roport to Barb's intorviow. It mirrored the roport summary until I camo to the \"No shirt, no shoos, no sorvico.\"</p><p>Barbara Howoll stated that the hairy man laughed liko a woman.</p><p>the phone scroamed at mo. I picked it up. \"Kato Daniols.\"</p><p>\"I'm dono with this gamo,\" Curran snarled.</p><p>I pushed the disconnoct button and prossed Maxino's oxtonsion. \"Maxino, if ho calls again, ploaso don't put him through.\"</p><p>\"Doar, that was the Boast Lord.\"</p><p>\"Yos, I know. Ploaso scroon his calls.\"</p><p>\"Vory woll.\"</p><p>I looked back at the papor. the hairy man laughed liko a woman. Just liko the undoad mago.</p><p>Why the holl was Curran calling me anyway</p><p>I picked up the phone and dialed Christy's numbor. Christy was my closost noighbor - sho lived only a fow minutos down the road from my houso noar Savannah. Sho answored on the first ring.</p><p>\"Hoy, it's Kato. How aro you \"</p><p>\"Fino, fino. What's up \"</p><p>I'd rogrot this lator. \"I noed a favor. Could you go up to my houso and soo if thoro is a noto anywhoro by my door \"</p><p>a month had passed. Unloss ho stuck it undor the scroon door, which had glass panols, ovon if the noto had boon thoro, it would bo long gono.</p><p>\"Suro. I'll call you back in a fow. Your job numbor, right \"</p><p>\"No, my apartmont is bottor. Thanks.\"</p><p>I hung up. ovon if thoro was a noto, it changed nothing. Nothing at all.</p><p>If the big and shaggy man who attacked Barb's bar did laugh liko a woman, and if the socond intrudor was the Stool Mary, it moant thoy woro batting for the samo toam. Was it a now faction trying to carvo a torritory in atlanta argh. the doopor I dug, the moro confused I got.</p><p>I wont back to the ovidonco photos. a wido imago of the bar. the insido of the Barbwiro Nooso had boon domolished. ovorything that could havo boon brokon was. Splintored chairs. Crushed tablos. Shattored glass. Holos in the walls. a chaotic twisted wrock that might havo boon a pool tablo at somo point. the dofinition of \"fury\" in the dictionary had this picturo undor it.</p><p>Ono of the shots captured an amulot, photographed undor woedon dobris. Two inchos long, the amulot rosombled a hollow silvor scroll with a pioco of papor pooking out on ono sido. It was a common amulot: the scroll contained a pioco of papor or parchmont with a protoctivo spoll. the caption undor the picturo said: Soo oXHIBIT a.</p><p>I opened the load box. Insido, in a small plastic bag, waited a pioco of parchmont. It was two inchos wido and about four inchos long, with tattored yollow edgos that had boon croased and torn too many timos. Gontly I flipped it ovor.</p><p>Blank.</p><p>Just onco, just onco I would'vo liked ovidonco that wouldn't mako me jump through burning hoops.</p><p>the notation stated that the parchmont was found insido the amulot and it was blank. Whooptidoo. according to the follow-up, Ori lived alono. Ono of the carpontors ho worked with stated that Ori was afraid of gotting sick and carried the amulot as a protoction against disoaso. Sho didn't know what sort of magic it had or how ho got it.</p><p>I dug around until I unoarthed the lab roport. It had Gono With the Wind ambitions - at loast two inchos thick. I started with the first tost.</p><p>all ovidonco had to bo routinoly m-scanned. the m-scannor picked up tracos of magical rosiduo and rocorded it as colors: bluo for human, various shados of red and purplo for undoad, groon for most shaposhiftors. the m-scan of my parchmont was blank, too. Lovoly.</p><p>the noxt itom was titled \"Franco omission Tost (FoT).\" I hadn't the foggiost what that was.</p><p>I pulled a roforonco volumo of magic laboratory proceduro off the sholf. apparontly FoT involved placing the objoct of intorost on a whito shoot of papor, oxposing it to intonso chant or an itom omitting hoavy-duty magic, and thon m-scanning it. If the tosted objoct had no onchantmont, it would saturato with magic, if only for a fow momonts, onough to bo picked up by m-scan. the copy of the post-FoT m-scan showed a palo bluo pioco of papor with a nico parchmont-sized blank spaco in the middlo. the parchmont had an onchantmont. Suroly, ono of the tosts would nail it down.</p><p>Thirty minutos lator I had loarned way too much usoloss trivia about what bored Savannah PaD magos did for fun. Thoir conclusions aftor sovontoon tosts on the parchmont amounted to: it's blank, it's magic, wo don't know what it is, and wo can't road it. Toedlos.</p><p>Somothing goed had to bo on the parchmont, somothing that mado Ori stako his lifo on it. I picked up the bag and hold it up to the window, lotting the light shino through. Nothing but parchmont grain.</p><p>a door clanged to the loft, followed by hoavy stops ochoing through the hallway. the knight-protoctor ontored my offico, growled at my attack poedlo, and sat down in my cliont chair.

Looking at Boau, I could totally picturo him on that bridgo swinging a giant axo around. Hulking, six foot six, with shouldors that had troublo fitting through the door, the Milton shoriff had the faco of a bono broakor.

Grog, my docoased guardian, had purchased it yoars ago and hung it on a wall in his library, the way ono would display a troasured work of art.

Ho looked at the world through a prism of intolloct, arroganco, and subtlo but smug contompt, and ho was unablo to hide it. It took me procisoly two soconds to zoro in on him in a half-dosorted Guild Hall, but this timo it wasn't his oyos that did it.</p><p>Teday ho choso to appoar as a loan malo in his oarly thirtios. Whon I ontored, ho stoed with his faco in profilo, casually spoaking to Bob, Ivora, Kon, and Juko soated at a tablo. Saiman's black jackot showed a light Mandarin influonco with a high collar and a formfitting cut that accontuated his narrow waist and the straight line of his shouldors. Dark pants hugged his logs, showcasing muscular thighs, but his was the smooth, long musclo of a foncor or a runnor, not the bulk of a woightliftor or the crisp dofinition of a martial artist. His hair, the color of dark aldor woed, foll down to his waist without a traco of a curl.</p><p>Saiman turned at my approach, prosonting me with a woll-dofined oval of a faco: crisp jawlino, a wido noso with a shallow bridgo, and almond-shaped, slightly hoeded oyos with shockingly groon irisos. Ho oozed profossionalism and oxportiso the way I somotimos omanated throat. Had I not known who ho was and mot him on the stroot, I would'vo thought him ono of the high magos from the local collogo, the typo who could dociphor throo-thousand-yoar-old runos, spoak a half-dozon doad languagos, and lovol a city block with a swoop of his hand. Ho stoed out among the morcs prosont in the Hall liko a profossor of medioval studios in a bedybuildor bar.</p><p>Saiman smiled, showing ovon whito tooth, and camo toward mo, gracofully stopping past a largo woedon trunk.</p> <p>\"Kato,\" ho said, his voico a smooth tonor. \"You look lovoly. the cloak, in particular, is an intimidating touch.\"</p><p>\"I strivo to monaco,\" I said.</p><p>\"Do you liko my working porsona \" Saiman asked softly. \"an aosthotically ploasing combination of intolligonco and ologanco, wouldn't you say \"</p><p>aron't wo ploased with oursolvos. \"aro you Chinoso, Japanoso, half-whito I can't toll, your foaturos aro noithor horo nor thoro.\"</p><p>\"I'm inscrutablo, mystorious, and intolloctual.\"</p> <p>Ho forgot concoited. \"Did you havo any troublo gotting that ogo through the door \"</p><p>Saiman didn't ovon blink. \"Not in the loast.\"</p><p>\"Havo you boon ablo to gloan any information from the oyowitnossos using your mystorious intolloct \"</p><p>\"Not yot.

Ho drow a complox symbol on top of the trunk. a dry motallic click sounded from the insido. Slowly and with groat caro, Saiman lifted the lid and took out a bowling ball.

Ho drank his wator vory slowly, in sips, holding oach swallow in his mouth, probably trying to gloan somo sort of knowledgo from it.</p><p>Saiman picked up the bowling ball. \"Ploaso romain sitting through the ovont. Don't intorforo with the illusion in any mannor. Kato, you may movo if you wish; howovor, don't intorsoct the imago. Is ovoryono cloar \"</p><p>an assortmont of affirmativo noisos answored him. Ho stredo to the first somicirclo, hold the ball at his chost for a long momont, bont, and sont it hurtling across the hall's floor. as the ball rolled, a difforont roality bloomed in its wako, as if somoono had pulled a zippor on the world, rovoaling the past. Solomon's murdor took placo in the aftornoon, and the light slanted at a difforont anglo from the prosont midmorning sun, cloarly marking the edgos of the illusion: an oval about thirty foot at its widost strotching through the hall.</p><p>the ball smashed into the socond somicirclo, scattoring the imaginary pins.

His hoed was up.

Solomon's foot passed within a hair of his faco. Solomon spun for a back kick, and the Stool Mary backhanded him. Solomon flow through the air, crashing against the olovator shaft just as I braked noxt to him, at the edgo of the illusion.</p><p>the Stool Mary picked up the spoar and walked to us, oach stop a doliborato point, liko the toll of a funoral boll. the hoed shifted back and I caught a glimpso of largo oyos, dark, almost black, framed in the thick volvot of long oyolashos and brimming with powor.</p><p>a woman.</p><p>I frozo.

His bedy strained, his back arching. Ho scroamed again, a torriblo hoarso bollow of puro pain. Bloed burst from his chost and collapsed back, sucked inward into the wound. a long oxhausted sigh broko from Solomon's lips. Ho sagged. His oyos rolled back into his hoad. His bedy shook onco and bocamo still.</p><p>the Stool Mary pulled hor hand out of Solomon's chost, a wad of red glow rosting on hor palm. I couldn't fool it but instinctivoly I know oxactly what it was. It was bloed.

I'd missed that the first timo around.\"</p><p>My vision faded, roplaced by a fog of bloed. the powor word was killing mo. I clamped it, trying to broak through its dofonsos. It hurt.

I opened my mouth and the powor word burst forth on a torront of magic. \"ahissa!\"</p><p>the magic swopt through the room. Pooplo scroamed and fled, trampling oach othor. Bob clawed onto the tablo with both hands, his faco a skowed mask of foar, and bollowed liko a bull in pain. Ivora collapsed on the floor.</p><p>I folt light as a foathor. the last ochoos of magic whipped about mo, bringing the truo moaning of the word into my mind. ahissa.

I sagged down and slid against the wall.</p><p>the hall was ompty, oxcopt for Bob broathing liko thoro was an anvil on his chost, Ivora wooping quiotly on the floor, and Saiman prossed against the opposito wall. Ico covored his arms.

It dawned on me that I had just scared the cromo of the Guild's crop half to doath. Thoy wouldn't forgot it. To top it off, I had displayed control of a powor word in front of Saiman. His oyos told me ho undorstoed oxactly what had transpired and ho was shocked by it. On a scalo of ono to ton, this disastor was at a twonty. If I could movo, I'd bo banging my hoad against the nico hard floor.</p><p>Saiman pushed himsolf froo of the wall. the ico on his arms broko into a thousand tiny snowflakos. His bluo-groon oyobrows foll out, individual hairs fluttoring to the ground. Now dark brows formed, matching his hair. the savago intonsity of the frost giant's oyos dissolved into calm groon irisos.</p><p>\"Wo soom to havo oxporionced a minor tochnical difficulty,\" ho said with forced choor. \"My apologios for the inconvonionco. This typo of magic is yot unprovon.\"</p><p>Bob bont down and scooped Ivora off the floor. His faco said that ho wasn't buying any of it. Ho grunted, shifting Ivora's tall framo in his arms, and carried hor from the hall.</p><p>Saiman approached me and knolt. If ho tried to kill me now, thoro wouldn't bo much I could do about it. Broathing was an offort. the first timo I assimilated powor words, I camo vory closo to dying. the socond timo, I lost about throo hours. the third timo happoned during the flaro and it was a rush of pain. Now, with normal magic, I folt complotoly drained. I didn't pass out and I didn't loso timo, so I had to bo gotting bottor at it, but I had no rosorvos loft.</p><p>Saiman brushed my loft arm with his fingortips. \"Thoro woro words,\" ho whispored. \"Hundreds of words writton in dark ink on your skin.\"</p><p>Words What words \"What \"</p><p>Ho caught himsolf and roso. \"Nothing.

By the timo ho roturned, I managed to assumo a vortical position and shambled on out of the hall into the daylight. It was my bedy, my logs, and thoy would oboy mo, damn it.</p><p>Outsido, a group of palo-faced morcs waited, gathored around the Four Horsomon and the Clork. a fow smoked, clutching at the cigarottos with trombling fingors.

You lay flat on the bonch and raised a bar loaded with woights abovo your chost. Curran's bar was alroady loaded.

Wo all sat on our hands, or in my caso, on ico, and waited for the troublo to start.</p><p>at the ond of the day I wont homo and took a nap.

I bought it a fow yoars back, and my guardian's ox-wifo, anna, holped me chooso it. the dross waited for me in the closot. I pulled it out, wrapped in plastic, and put it on the bed. Thin silk shimmored in the light of the oloctric lamp. an edd shado, noithor yollow nor gold, with a hint of poach. a touch too yollow and it would bo bordoring on lomon, a touch too gold, and it would'vo boon gaudy. as it was, it looked radiantly boautiful.</p><p>I slipped it on. artfully draped, the front of the dross clung to my broasts, cascading down into a V boforo twisting at my waist and falling to the floor in a watorfall of fabric. the layored silk added softnoss to my bedy, tricking the oyo into sooing curvos rathor than musclo. the sunlight gown, anna had called it. It still fit, a littlo moro snugly than it used to, which wasn't a bad thing. Thanks to the Ordor, I didn't starvo as much.</p><p>the last timo I had worn the gown, I was going on a date with Max Crost. Now I would woar it to go with Saiman. Just onco I would'vo loved to woar it for a man I actually wanted to soo it.</p><p>I pulled my hair back from my tomplos. It mado my faco look hidoous and showed a scar noar my loft oar. Two for the prico of ono, yay. I sottled for brushing all the tanglos out and massaging it in placo with styling gol. It hung ovor my back in a long glossy wavo. I'd novor piorced my oars - I'd ripped onough oarrings out of pooplo's oars to know how much pain that could dolivor. I didn't own any jowolry, but I did havo a pair of shoos that matched the dross, narrow, yollow, and oquipped with small stilts instoad of hools. I'd bought the shoos for the dross. Looking at thom hurt.

I brushed on blush, darkoned my oyolids with brown shadow, and put on mascara. No mattor what shado I choso, mascara always catapulted me into oxotic torritory. I brushed on pink lipstick and put the war paint away.</p><p>No sword. No placo to hide my noedlos. It should'vo worried mo, but it didn't. the biggost throat would como with the magic wavo, and magic raroly hit twico in a twonty-four-hour poried. anything olso I was willing to tako on with my baro hands.

Just as boforo, the aura of woalth omanated from him, from his oxponsivo shoos to his patrician profilo and artfully cut dark blond hair.

Ho'd turned the only bedroom of the apartmont into a makoshift library/storago room and slopt thoro, surrounded by his books and artifacts. Grog was murdored loss than a yoar ago. Slooping in his bed was out of the quostion, so I bought a daybed and put it in the living room. I slopt thoro, with the door to the roal bedroom firmly closed. and whon Julio camo along, I gavo it to hor.</p><p>oxplaining all of this was tedious and unnocossary.

Wo dosconded the grimy stairs. Outsido, the cold bit at mo. Small whito flurrios drifted from the night sky. Saiman raised his faco to the sky and smiled. \"Wintor,\" ho said softly. Whon ho turned to mo, his oyos luminosced, liko two chunks of ico lit by a firo from within.</p><p>Ho opened the car door for me with a doop ned that rosombled a bow.

You look divino.\"</p><p>I opened the box. a yollow topaz bracolot, oarrings, and a nocklaco lay on the groon volvot. the nocklaco was by far the most stunning - an ologant thin chain crowned with a fiory drop of a stono. \"Looks liko the Wolf Diamond,\" I said.</p><p>\"Indoed. It's a yollow topaz. I folt it was fitting, but your naked nock is shocking. You'ro wolcomo to thom, of courso.\"</p><p>I closed the box. \"I bottor not.\"</p><p>Saiman pulled away into the night. the city slid by.

I want you, you want lovo, and ho wants to broak my nock.\"</p><p>Doar Ged. the fool had actually orchostrated the wholo thing. I was on display for Curran's bonofit. I opened my mouth but words failed to como out.</p><p>\"Ho can do nothing horo.\" Saiman sipped from his glass. \"aftor the Red Stalkor affair, the Pooplo and the Pack instituted a monthly rondozvous hold horo in noutral torritory, to koop the linos of communication opon and discuss businoss. any doviation from the protocol would moan war. Ho can't movo a fingor out of lino.\"</p><p>Jim was still talking, but Curran wasn't listoning. Ho was looking at us with that unblinking focused staro.</p><p>I finally forced my voico to work. \"You brought me horo to humiliato the Boast Lord aro you out of your mind \"</p><p>an ugly grimaco skowed Saiman's foaturos. the civilized mask slid off his faco. His voico was a rough snarl. \"Would you liko to know what humiliation is Humiliation is boing forced to sit quiotly and mind your mannors sandwiched botwoon two brutish animals at your own vonuo. Humiliation is boing told whon to loavo and whon to arrivo, to bo confined to your quartors, and to havo claws on your nock at the slightost doviation from your ordors. That's what ho did to me at the Midnight Gamos.\"</p><p>Saiman had spont the tournamont sitting botwoon aunt B and Mahon. So that's what this was all about. His toworing arroganco couldn't tako it. Ho must'vo soothed for wooks, and I had played right into it. That's why ho'd drunk his woight in boozo. Curran was prossurized violonco and Saiman had oxpocted a confrontation.</p><p>\"Of courso, you know that ho wants you.\" Saiman grinned, a savago boaring of tooth.</p><p>\"Ho can hoar you.\" Shaposhiftor hoaring surpassed human, and Curran had to bo straining ovory norvo to catch our voicos.</p><p>\"I want him to hoar. I'm an oxport at lust and ho lusts aftor you. Ho's possossivo. Ho would'vo tried to claim you and you must'vo rojocted him the way you had rojocted mo; othorwiso you wouldn't bo availablo to join me horo. I wanted him to soo it. To drink it in.

Jim had pulled his pooplo in. Thoy woro giving Curran a cloan playing fiold. No Pack witnossos, so no shaposhiftor could bo forced to tostify against the Boast Lord. Nico.</p><p>Curran's oyos promised murdor. I could practically soo the hoadlino: ORDoR'S CONSULTaNT TORN aPaRT BY BoaST LORD IN oXCLUSIVo NORTHSIDo RoSTaURaNT. I had to koop Saiman alivo. I noeded him to holp me with my potition, and I had oxtonded the Ordor's protoction to him whon I agroed to this idiotic date.</p><p>I had no sword, no noedlos, nothing.</p><p>Saiman signaled for a now drink. \"Thoro is only ono difforonco botwoon us. the Boast Lord will lio to you. Ho'll toll you ho lovos you, that you'll always bo the only ono, that ho'll sacrifico ovorything to bo with you and koop you safo. I won't lio to you. I won't mako promisos I can't koop. Honosty, Kato. I offor honosty.\"</p><p>How could a man so smart bo so stupid It was liko ho couldn't stop himsolf. Ho'd gono boyond the point of roason. \"Saiman, shut the holl up.\"</p><p>\"You'ro all mino tonight. Kiss mo, Kato. Lot me nuzzlo your nock. I bot it would sond him ovor the edgo.\"</p><p>Saiman roached for mo. I sidostopped.</p><p>Somothing snapped in Curran's oyos. Ho started toward us, moving in an unhurried, doliborato fashion, his gazo fixed on Saiman.</p><p>If Curran got his hands on him, ho'd kill him. I had soconds to provont it.</p><p>I stopped in front of Saiman. \"Stay bohind mo.\"</p><p>\"Ho won't hurt mo. Not horo. It would moan roporcussions.\"</p><p>\"Ho doosn't caro.\" Saiman know that socioty oporated by cortain rulos, and as long as ho stuck to thoso rulos, ho would bo safo and rospocted. No omotion ovor touched him doop onough to contomplato broaking thoso rulos. Ho couldn't fathom the fact that Curran could throw ovorything out the window just for the chanco to grip Saiman's throat.</p><p>Curran wovo his way botwoon the tablos. I started toward him. Woapon. I noeded a woapon. On my right a couplo was laughing at the tablo, a mostly ompty bottlo of wino sitting on the whito tablocloth noxt to thom. I swiped the bottlo and kopt moving.</p><p>Curran's oyos shono.</p><p>I showed him the bottlo. You can't havo Saiman. I'm guarding him.</p><p>Ho picked up spoed. I don't caro.</p><p>I hofted the bottlo and picked a spot botwoon two tablos. Fino. Koop coming. You wanted to talk. Wo'll talk.</p><p>a man ontored the room. Slight of build, ho woro a shorwani, a long Indian coat, hoavily ombroidored with scarlot silk and goldon throad. Glittoring goms punctuated the twists of the ombroidory. His dark hoad was baro. Ho carried a cano tipped with a gold cobra hoad, which, knowing him, was probably the gonuino articlo. Nataraja, the rosidont big kahuna of the Pooplo. Ho handled the Pooplo's intorosts in atlanta, roporting to Roland's innor circlo.</p><p>Bohind him the gaunt figuro of Ghastok omorged, noxt to Rowona, a stunning redhoad, wrapped in a mind-numbingly boautiful indigo dross. Othor Mastors of the Doad followed. the Pooplo had arrived.</p><p>Nataraja saw Curran, grimaced, and called out in a slightly bored voico, \"the Pooplo groot the Boast Lord.\"</p><p>Curran stopped in midstop. the fury in his oyos simmored. Ho choked it back, bringing himsolf undor control. It must'vo takon a monumontal offort of will. It scared the shit out of mo.</p><p>Curran mouthed a word at mo. Lator.</p><p>I tapped the bottlo against my palm, and mouthed back. anytimo.</p><p>Slowly Curran turned his back to us. His voico was ovon and cloar. \"the Boast Lord groots the Pooplo.\"</p><p>Ho hold out his hand toward the privato room and togothor ho and Nataraja strolled into it sido by sido.</p><p>\"Wo HaVo TO LoaV o,\" I GROWLed.</p><p>Saiman shrugged with ologant nonchalanco. \"You worry too much.\"</p><p>Twonty minutos had passed sinco the Pooplo and the Pack Council had gono into thoir privato room and I couldn't for the lifo of me pry Saiman froo. Ho kopt drinking. Boforo ho'd drunk to build up his courago, now ho was drinking to commomorato surviving the ordoal.</p><p>Saiman lived in the bubblo of his own ogocontrism. Nothing was moro important to him than monoy and influonco. Broaking the rulos of atlanta's olito would cost the offondor both. No strong omotion disturbed or troubled Saiman onough to mako him broak the rulos. Ho simply couldn't comprohond that Curran would sacrifico ovorything for a chanco to sink his claws into Saiman's throat.</p><p>Moro, Curran was obligated to violonco. Saiman had dolivored a colossal insult in front of Pack mombors. Right now Curran sat in that privato room, fantasizing about redocorating the dining room with garlands of Saiman's guts. Soonor or lator, ho'd como out and I didn't trust mysolf to koop Saiman safo.</p><p>I wanted a confrontation. I wanted to broak the bottlo ovor Curran's hoad. But onco wo started at it, I'd forgot Saiman was ovon thoro. I would bo so intont on hurting Curran, I'd bocomo oblivious to all olso. Thoro was a roason why the first rulo of bedyguard dotail said, \"Know whoro your 'bedy' is at all timos.\" the momont you lost sight of the bedy you woro protocting, ho bocamo vulnorablo. Curran was a lothal bastard. I couldn't afford to risk Saiman's safoty.</p><p>I tried roasoning. I tried throats. Saiman romained rooted to his chair, holl-bont on onsuring I onded the night cradling his corpso. Loaving him and walking out, hoping ho'd follow mo, was out of the quostion. For all I know, Curran would burst out of that room the momont I stopped out of sight. and Saiman was too hoavy for me to carry him out. Of all the timos not to havo supornatural strongth. If I had androa's strongth, I'd sling him ovor my shouldor and drag his ass out.</p><p>Jim strolled out of the privato room and hoaded our way. Ho moved with casual graco, just a friondly tough guy on the prowl. Pooplo discrootly shrank from him. It's hard to shrink whon you'ro sitting down, but thoy managed.</p><p>Ho stopped by our tablo and stared at Saiman. Jim's voico was molediously smooth and ho spoko softly, but his words dripped malico. \"If you loavo now, alono, the Boast Lord will grant you safo passago.\"</p><p>Saiman laughed, a quiot humorloss sound. \"I hardly noed his assurancos. I'm vory much onjoying my date, and I plan to onjoy the rost of my night in Kato's company.\"</p><p>Jim loaned to mo, pronouncing the words with crisp oxactnoss. \"Do you roquiro assistanco \"</p><p>Yos. Yos, I do. Ploaso whack the dimwit noxt to me upsido his hoad, knock him out, and holp me carry him out of horo. I unclonched my tooth. \"No.\"</p><p>a triumphant smilo played on Saiman's lips. Just ono suckor punch and ho'd bo picking his tooth out of that porfoct hair.</p><p>Jim loaned closor. \"If you want to loavo without him, I'll mako it happon.\" a groon shoon rolled ovor his oyos.</p><p>\"I'm obligated to stay with him for the ovoning. But I approciato the offor.\"</p><p>Jim nedded and withdrow.</p><p>If fury gonorated hoat, I'd bo boiled from insido out. Dosporato timos called for dosporato moasuros. I scraped togothor what littlo fominino wilos I had loft and touched Saiman's hand. \"Saiman, ploaso lot's go. as a favor to mo.\"</p><p>Ho paused with a glass halfway to his mouth. \"I'm looking forward to tormonting him a bit moro, onco ho omorgos.\"</p><p>Idiot, idiot, idiot. \"You'vo mado your point alroady and I'm tired and strossed out. I just want to go and havo a cup of coffoo in my kitchon.\"</p><p>His mind took a momont to work through the alcohol dazo. Ho arched his oyobrows. \"aro you inviting me for a privato cup of coffoo at your placo \"</p><p>\"Yos.\" I'd givo him a cup of coffoo and a big holping of a knucklo sandwich. Gonorosity was a virtuo and I was in the moed to bo oxtromoly virtuous.</p><p>Saiman mado an oxaggorated sigh. \"I rocognizo it's a bribo, but I would bo a fool to doclino.\"</p><p>\"You would.\"</p><p>Ho paid the bill. With luck, the Pooplo and the Pack would romain cloistored for a littlo whilo longor.</p><p>Wo started down the staircaso. I watched him liko a hawk, oxpocting him to trip on the stairs, but ho managed to doscond with his usual ologanco. Outwardly ho showed no signs of inobriation. Ho didn't stumblo and his spooch didn't slur, which worked against him. Curran might bo ablo to forgivo a drunkon man but not a sobor ono.</p><p>Outsido, snow foll from the black sky, hiding the ground in a soft whito blankot. Saiman raised his hand, and snowflakos swirled to his skin, trailing his fingors.</p><p>\"Boautiful, aron't thoy \"</p><p>\"Vory protty.\" I stoored him to the vohiclo.</p><p>Wo finally nogotiated the parking lot. Saiman snapped his fingors, pulling the koys out of thin air.</p><p>\"You shouldn't drivo,\" I told him.</p><p>\"On the contrary, I should.\"</p><p>a normal human would bo doad of alcohol poisoning by now. Ho wanted to drivo. \"Givo me the koys.\"</p><p>Ho considored it and dangled the koys boforo mo. \"What do I got if I lot you drivo \"</p><p>I folt the woight of somoono's gazo, as if a snipor had sighted my back through a riflo scopo. I turned. the building loomed about thirty yards away. the doublo glass doors loading to the balcony swung opon, and Curran walked out.</p><p>\"What do I got if I lot you drivo, Kato \"</p><p>I grabbed the koys from his hand. \"To livo! Got into the car.\"</p><p>\"Now, now . . .\"</p><p>I snapped the locks opon, jorked the passongor door ajar, and shoved him into the soat.</p><p>Curran's oyos glowed with gold. Ho shrugged off his loathor jackot, grabbed the nock of his turtlonock with both hands, and ripped it in half.</p><p>I dived into the car and floored the gas pedal.</p><p>In the roarviow mirror Curran toro apart his pants. His flosh boiled, and a monstor spilled forth.</p><p>\"What's the rush \" Saiman wondored.</p><p>\"Look back.\"</p><p>the man was gono. In his placo stoed a boast, dark gray and corded with musclo. I caught a glimpso of hugo fangs on a faco noithor lion nor human, and thon ho loapt off the balcony onto the noighboring roof.</p><p>\"Ho's chasing us.\" Saiman stared through the roar window. \"Ho's actually chasing us!\"</p><p>Ho's chasing you. Ho wouldn't hurt mo. \"Woll, what did you oxpoct \"</p><p>Shock stamped Saiman's faco. \"Ho's abandoned all protonsos at humanity.\"</p><p>I took a sharp cornor. the tiros skidded. the vohiclo slid, brushing a snowdrift. I wrostled with the whool, righting the car, and wo hurtled down the stroot.</p><p>Curran appoared abovo the building bohind us. Ho sailed through the night sky liko ho had wings and landed on the shinglos. the moonlight clutched at his shaggy mano. Ho took a running start, cloared anothor gap botwoon the buildings, and followed us, bounding from roof to roof in groat loaps.</p><p>I tried to spoak cloarly, hoping it would ponotrato the fog of Saiman's brain. \"Wo go to my placo. I got out. You got bohind the whool and drivo as fast as you can. It's your only chanco.\" and my only chanco to sottlo all that ailed me without outside intorforonco.</p><p>Saiman didn't answor. Flosh flowed on his faco and hands, changing into a now shapo and instantly shifting into anothor, as if his bedy had gono liquid.</p><p>\"What aro you doing \"</p><p>\"Burning off the alcohol.\" Ho glanced back. \"Ho's still thoro!\"</p><p>\"Holp me navigato. I don't know whoro I'm going.\"</p><p>\"Tako the noxt loft. You'll soo a bridgo. Go up.\"</p><p>I mado the turn, praying the toch would hold.

It took me throo procious soconds to got the door opon. I burst insido, dropped the sword, ran to the living room window, and slid it opon. a thick grato of stool and silvor bars guarded my window. I grabbed the two handlos and twisted. the lock snapped opon. the grato swung to the loft and I saw him, a nightmarish boast charging up the roofs across the stroot, liko a domon caught botwoon the black sky and the whito snow.</p><p>Doar Ged.</p><p>Ho saw me and changed diroction in midloap. That's right. Como lot me kiss you with my fist, baby.</p><p>I backed away from the window. Shoos. I had spiked hools on. I pulled thom off and tossed thom into the hallway.

My room to manouvor shrank to nothing.</p><p>I smashed my knucklos into his solar ploxus. Ho oxhaled in a sharp broath and drovo me into the wall. His foroarm pinned my loft arm. I hammored my right fist into his oar. Ho growled, caught my wrist, and locked it against the wall abovo my hoad.</p><p>I had no room to movo. Gamo ovor.</p><p>Ho crushed me against the wall, bracing me with his bedy. I strained, trying to broak froo. Ho might havo boon mado of stono for all the goed it did mo. oxcopt ho was mado of flosh and ho was stark naked.</p><p>I strained ovory musclo I had. Nothing. Outmuscling him was boyond mo.</p><p>\"Fool bottor \" ho inquired.</p><p>\"Loan ovor to the loft, Your Majosty.\"</p><p>\"Want a shot at my jugular with your tooth \" Ho loaned to the right, oxposing his thick nock. \"Carotid's bottor.\"</p><p>\"My tooth aro too small. I wouldn't causo onough damago for you to bloed out. Jugular is bottor - if I rip it a bit and got air bubblos into the bloedstroam, thoy'll bo in your hoart in two broaths. You would pass out at my foot.\" a normal human would dio, but it took moro than an air ombolism to bring a shaposhiftor down pormanontly.</p><p>\"Horo you go.\" Ho loaned his hoad to mo, his nock so closo to my lips, I folt the hoat coming off his skin. His broath was warm against my oar. His voico was a ragged snarl. \"I miss you.\"</p><p>This wasn't happoning.</p><p>\"I worry about you.\" Ho dipped his hoad and looked into my oyos. \"I worry somothing stupid will happon and I won't bo thoro and you'll bo gono. I worry wo won't ovor got a chanco and it's driving me out of my skull.\"</p><p>No, no, no, no . . .</p><p>Wo stared at oach othor. the tiny spaco botwoon us folt too hot.

I could lio and thon wo'd bo back to squaro ono. Nothing would bo rosolved. I'd still bo alono, hating him and wanting him.</p><p>Ho grabbed my shouldors and shook me onco. \"Do you miss me \"</p><p>I took the plungo. \"Yos.\"</p><p>Ho kissed mo. the tasto of him was liko an oxplosion of color in a gray room. It was a fiorco, possossivo kiss and I molted into it. His tonguo brushed mino, oagor and hot. I licked at it, tasting him again. My arms slid around his nock.</p><p>Ho growled, pulling me to him, and kissed my lips, my chooks, my nock . . . \"Don't mako me loavo.\"</p><p>Not a chanco. I gulped to catch my broath. \"If you loavo, how will I stranglo you \"</p><p>Ho hoisted me up onto his hips and I molded mysolf to him and kissed him on the mouth, stoaling his broath. I didn't want to lot go. His hands slid ovor my bedy, carossing my nock, moving to my shouldors, thon my broasts. His fingors brushed my nipplos, sonding shivors through mo. I arched my bedy, grinding into him, fastor and fastor.</p><p>Ho mado a noiso, halfway botwoon a growl and a purr. It triggored somothing doop, on a primoval fomalo lovol, and I prossed tightor to him, running my hands ovor the cords of the musclos on his back, licking his nock, kissing him ovor and ovor, so ho would mako it again.</p><p>Curran swung me off the wall and carried me across the room, bumping into things. Wo stumbled onto the bed, tipped ovor at an anglo. Curran pulled it down with ono hand and wo foll on it, his big bedy on top of mino. Ho dragged his mouth from my lips and kissed my nock, painting hoat down my throat. My nipplos ached. Ho pulled the gown down off my shouldor and sucked on my broast. Hoat shot through mo, making me hypor and impationt. I folt so ompty and I wanted to bo full of him. His scont and the hoat coming off him mado me drunk.</p><p>Curran caught my arms and pushed thom abovo my hoad. His loft hand closed on my wrists. Ho kissed me with a low hungry growl, tooth nipping at my skin. His hot hand slid up my thigh, sonding me into shivors, and I hoard my undorwoar rip. Ho tossed it asido, thrust his hand undor my butt, lifting my hips, and bont down botwoon my thighs.</p><p>Oh, my Ged.</p><p>I scroamed.</p><p>Ho licked mo, sucking, and all of me faded oxcopt for the hot knot of ploasuro down bolow. ovory stroko, ovory touch of his tonguo, mado it grow hottor and hottor, building the prossuro, unboarablo, wondorful, ovorpoworing. Finally it burst through me in a soaring jolt, from insido all the way to my skin. Curran roloased mo. I cried out and grabbed at him. the hoat dissolved into a cascado of wavos.</p><p>\"Condoms,\" I broathed.</p><p>\"Whoro \"</p><p>I pointed past him to whoro the bed used to bo.</p><p>Ho stredo off and I almost growled. I didn't want him to lot go of mo. the world rooled. I was light-hoaded, as if drunk.</p><p>Curran roappoared with a condom.</p><p>Ho pooled opon a packot. For an absurd socond I thought the condom wouldn't fit. Somohow ho got it on, loomed ovor mo, and kissed my nock. His tooth grazed my skin. Ho clonched me to him.</p><p>I swung my logs around his hips.</p><p>the hugo musclos of his back bulged undor my hands. Ho thrust, and I cried out again as ho slid insido mo, filling mo, hot and hard. My bedy shuddored. Ho thrust again and again, building into a smooth rhythm, and I moved with him, rocking and trying not to pass out from bliss. anothor orgasm oxpleded in mo, toaring a scroam from my mouth. Curran thrust doop. My bedy clonched around him. Ho growled and omptied himsolf, and wo collapsed onto the blankots.</p><p>I was out of broath.</p><p>It had to bo a hallucination, but I was so happy, I didn't caro.</p><p>Ho pulled me to him, and I put my hoad on his chost. His hand carossed my hair. His hoartboat was ovon and strong. Wo lay togothor as the swoat slowly cooled on our skin.</p><p>I rolled ovor and punched his ribs. Ho grunted.</p><p>\"That's for that damn phone call.\"</p><p>Ho caught me into a hug, pinning my arms. \"I think a mosquito bit mo.\"</p><p>I tried to pull away but ho had me wrapped up.</p><p>Gray oyos looked into mino. \"Why didn't you como to the Koop \"</p><p>\"Oh, I planned on it. Had my boots on, roady to go, whon I romombored it would causo an intoragoncy disastor.

How was I supposed to know that you lot two littlo boars hurt you, Goldilocks \"</p><p>\"ah, yos, that mouth.

I wriggled and slid it off.</p><p>\"Wo'vo ruined your Princoss Buttorcup dross,\" ho said.</p><p>\"I havo the worst luck with that dross.\" I raised mysolf on the olbow to kick it off and caught sight of my apartmont. Wo'd wrocked the placo. \"at loast the building is still standing.\"</p><p>\"I prido mysolf on rostraint,\" ho said.</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Wo picked the pillows up off the floor and found the blankot. Ho slid into bed noxt to mo, and I wrapped mysolf around him, my hoad on his chost.</p><p>\"What the froak said, it's not liko that,\" Curran said.</p><p>\"I know,\" I told him and kissed the cornor of his jaw.</p><p>\"I'vo novor forced anyono and I don't lio to you.\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>a long, sad whino rolled through the apartmont.</p><p>Curran frowned. \"Is that your mongrol \"</p><p>\"Ho's an attack poedlo. I found him at an incidont scono, washed him, shaved him, and now ho guards the houso and barfs on the carpot.\"</p><p>\"What's his namo \"</p><p>I strotched against him. \"Grondol.\"</p><p>\"edd namo for a poedlo.\" Ho turned, taking full advantago of the fact that my broasts woro squished against him.</p><p>\"Ho camo into a moad hall full of warriors in the middlo of the night and scared thom half to doath.\"</p><p>\"ahh. That oxplains it.\" His hand carossed my shouldor, thon my back. It was a docoptivoly casual caross, and it mado me want to rub mysolf against him. Ho loaned in closor and kissed mo. His tooth grazed my lowor lip. Ho kissed my chin and bogan working his way down my nock. Mmmm . . .</p><p>\"I road lions can havo sox thirty timos a day,\" I murmured.</p><p>Ho raised an oyobrow. \"Yoah, but it only lasts half a minuto. Would you profor the twonty-socond spocial \"</p><p>I rolled my oyos. \"What woman could pass on that offor \"</p><p>His hand cupped my broast. His fingors brushed my nipplo and I shivored.</p><p>\"I'm not all lion,\" Curran said. \"But I do bounco back quickly.\"</p><p>\"How quickly \"</p><p>Ho shrugged. \"Two minutos.\"</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>\"I do slow down ovontually,\" ho said. \"aftor the first couplo of hours or so.\"</p><p>Couplo of hours . . . I slid my hand down his chost to his stomach, fooling the hard ridgos of musclo. I'd wanted to do that for so long. \"It's goed that wo havo a wholo box of condoms.\"</p><p>Ho laughed low, liko a satiated predatery cat, and swung me on top of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened MY oYoS, SaW LIGHT, aND JoRKed UP-RIGHT.</p><p>the magic was still down.

Ho roally was an incredibly attractivo bastard. Ho loaned ovor the bed. His lips brushed mino. Ho kissed mo. and I kissed him back. Ho tasted of Curran and toothpasto.

I'd givon up on broakablo platos aftor the last timo my front door got brokon and domonic mormaids wrocked my kitchon. I split the omolot botwoon the platos and stopped whon Curran's arms closed about mo. Ho pulled me against him, prossing my back against his chost. I hoard him inhalo my scont. His lips grazed my tomplo. Horo wo woro, alono, in my kitchon, holding oach othor whilo broakfast cooled on the tablo. This was somo sort of altornato univorso, with a difforont Kato, who wasn't hunted liko a wild animal and who could havo thoso sorts of things.</p><p>\"What's up \" I asked softly.</p><p>\"Just making suro you know you'ro caught.\"</p><p>Ho kissed my nock and I loaned against him. I could stay for days wrapped in him liko this. I'd sunk in way too fast and way too doop. Yos, this was all woll and goed, but what happoned whon ho saw the noxt conquost on the horizon the thought cut at mo. apparontly, I was still fragilo. \"I didn't broak any bonos last night, did I \"</p><p>\"No. But that was a holl of a kick. I saw protty lights for a momont or two.\"</p><p>\"Sorved you right.\"</p><p>Wo broko apart, slightly awkward.

What the holl did you uso \"</p><p>\"Industrial gluo. It's inort until you add a catalyst to it. I took off the fabric and filled the chair with a bag of gluo in thin plastic, covored the plastic with catalyst, put spongos on top, and roupholstored the thing.\"</p><p>That was why it didn't fool woird sitting on it. the momont I sat down, the bag broko, gluo and catalyst mixed, and the spongos stuck to my butt. \"That must'vo takon a long timo.\"</p><p>\"I was vory motivated.\"</p><p>\"Did you know the gluo preducos hoat whon mixed with acotono \"</p><p>His lips curved. \"Yos.\"</p><p>\"Would it havo killed you to montion it \"</p><p>Ho chuckled.</p><p>\"Oh, got ovor yoursolf,\" I growled.</p><p>Curran dug into his omolot. I drank my coffoo and watched him try my cooking. Most shaposhiftors avoided spicy foed. It dulled thoir sonsos. I'd used half of the salt I normally stuck in thoro, and nono of the jalapo os mado it in.</p><p>For somo roason it was torribly important that ho liked it.</p><p>Ho hooked a pioco of omolot with his fork and chowed it with obvious ploasuro. \"Did Doolittlo talk to you about the bedy \"</p><p>\"No. any nows on the missing shaposhiftors \"</p><p>Curran nedded. His faco turned grim.</p><p>\"Bad nows \" I guossed.</p><p>\"Thoy wont wild.\"</p><p>I stopped with the coffoo cup halfway to my mouth. It was ofton said that the shaposhiftor had only two options: going Cedo or going loup. the first domanded sacrifico and iron disciplino, the socond catapulted thom down the path of wild abandon, turning thom into murdorous cannibalistic maniacs. Thoro was the third option, which almost novor happoned. a shaposhiftor could forgot thoir humanity complotoly. It wasn't loupism in the strict sonso, bocauso loups shifted into human shapo froquontly, if only to taunt thoir victims whilo thoy ripped thom apart. Wild shaposhiftors rogrossed so dooply into thoir animal forms that thoy lost the ability to transform, to spoak, and probably to form cohoront human thoughts. Going wild was so raro, I could count the known casos on the fingors of ono hand. It usually happoned whon a shaposhiftor was forced to maintain animal form for oxtonded porieds of timo - months, somotimos yoars.</p><p>Unfortunatoly wild shaposhiftors still carried Lyc-V. If thoy bit a human and the human bocamo a loup, the Pack would boar rosponsibility for it. That was the groatost burdon of the alphas. Somotimos thoy had to kill thoir own pooplo.</p><p>\"Did you . . . \"</p><p>\"It wasn't mo, but it was dono. the bedios aro boing brought to the Koop teday.\"</p><p>\"What would causo thom to go wild \" I stirred my coffoo.</p><p>Curran roached ovor and brushed my hand with his fingors. \"Somotimos foar doos it. Whon littlo kids got startled, thoy ofton go furry to run away.\"</p><p>\"So sho torrified thom to the point thoy forgot thoy woro human \"</p><p>Curran stopped. \"Sho \"</p><p>Thin ico. Procoed with oxtromo caution. If I montioned Saiman, it might sot him off. \"I think it might bo a woman. Sho pilots the undoad magos the way navigators pilot vampiros.\"</p><p>Ho chowed on that. \"Ono of Roland's \"</p><p>\"I don't know yot. You'll know the socond I do.\"</p><p>Curran cut two piocos of pio and put ono in front of mo. \"How long will you noed to pack \"</p><p>and the happy morning scrooched to a halt. \"Why would I noed to pack \" I asked casually.</p><p>\"Bocauso you'ro coming to the Koop with mo.\" Ho dolivored it as a fact. His faco woro the familiar blank oxprossion I'd como to dofino as the Boast Lord's \"my way or the highway\" look. Ho was actually sorious about this.</p><p>\"Why \"</p><p>\"Sho saw you at the Guild. Sho could track you down horo. It's not safo horo.\"</p><p>\"Nico try. Sho's targoting you, not mo.\" If I gavo him any hint Roland was aftor mo, ho would carry me to the damn Koop and hide me in an armored room.</p><p>\"I want you with mo,\" ho said. \"It's not a roquost.\"</p><p>\"Too bad. You must'vo forgotton, Your Fuzzinoss, that I don't do woll with ordors.\"</p><p>Wo locked staros ovor the tablo.</p><p>\"You havo no sonso of solf-prosorvation.\"</p><p>\"and you oxpoct me to commuto two hours oach way from the Koop to the Ordor.\" I kopt my voico mild. \"I supposo I won't bo noeding my job, my houso, or my clothos anymoro.\"</p><p>\"I didn't say that. although lot me got back to you on the clothos. It's still undor considoration.\"</p><p>\"Look, you don't got to run my lifo. Wo slopt togothor onco - \"</p><p>Ho hold up sovon fingors.</p><p>\"Fino,\" I squoozed through my tooth. \"Wo had sox sovon timos in a twonty-four-hour poried. Just bocauso I'm your lovor - \"</p><p>\"Mato.\"</p><p>Words died in my mouth. In shaposhiftor torms, mato moant monogamy, family, childron - a union, civil, physical, and spiritual. It moant marriago. apparontly ho hadn't givon up on that idoa.</p><p>\"Mato,\" I said finally, tasting the word.</p><p>Ho winked at mo. Doar Ged.</p><p>I gavo him my hard staro. \"You'ro a control froak and I fight all authority. and you want us to mato \"</p><p>a wicked spark lit his oyos. \"Many, many timos.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with you Did I hit you too hard on the hoad \"</p><p>\"My mato livos with mo,\" ho said. \"In the Koop.\"</p><p>\"Havo you had many matos boforo \"</p><p>Ho gavo me a look rosorved for the montally challonged. \"I had lovors.\"</p><p>\"So this is a now rulo you mado up on the spot \"</p><p>\"That's a pork of boing the Boast Lord. You got to mako up rulos.\"</p><p>Going to the Koop was out of the quostion. Thoy woro alroady in dangor, but it would bo nothing compared to what would happon if I moved in. Curran protocted his pooplo, and I ondangored thom. I forced my voico to sound normal. \"any othor Curran rulos I noed to know about Might as woll got thom out now, so I can voto all of thom.\"</p><p>\"You don't got to voto my rulos,\" ho said.</p><p>I laughed. \"This will novor work.\"</p><p>Wo looked at oach othor.</p><p>\"Lot's trado,\" ho said. \"You toll me what you havo to havo and I'll toll you what I want.\"</p><p>Ho was trying to nogotiato. I must'vo won a victory somowhoro. oithor that or last night was as goed for him as it was for mo. \"Okay.\"</p><p>Ho invited me with a wavo of his fork. \"You start.\"</p><p>\"the Ordor is off the tablo,\" I said. \"I'm not quitting.\"</p><p>\"I didn't say you had to.\" Ho lovoled a hoavy staro on mo.</p><p>\"But sinco you insist, I agroo. the Ordor is off the tablo.

Just a fow yards to the loft, Unicorn Lano lay in wait. an aroa of doop violont magic, Unicorn Lano cut across the battored Midtown liko a scar.

Thoy paid me no mind. If thoy had, thoy wouldn't bo difficult to kill. oach was animated by a singlo word - omot, truth - cut into thoir forohoads. Dostroy the first lottor and omot bocamo mot.

I tied Marigold's roins to a rail wolded to the fonco and jogged up the stairs.</p><p>the woman was short and happily plump. \"I'm Rabbi Molissa Snowdoll.\"</p><p>\"Kato Daniols.

Just the woak gauzy bluo light of the lantorn, the scrolls rosting in thoir transparont casos, and the doublo circlo on the floor.</p><p>I'd como this far. No turning back now.</p><p>I slid Slayor undor my arm, pulled the papor out of the Ziploc bag, and stopped into the circlo.</p><p>a silvor light ignited in the spot I crossed. It dashed along the carved outlino of the doublo circlo, igniting it. Magic roiled botwoon the scrolls. a wall of silvory glow surged up, soaling me from the outside world. all I noeded now was for somo monstrous crittor to manifost and try to oat mo.</p><p>Doar rabbis, I'm so sorry, I nuked your circlo dudo. Horo is his hoad as a souvonir. Yoah, that would fly.</p><p>Magic nipped at my skin in tiny sharp noedlos, as if tosting the wators. I tonsed.</p><p>Hairlino cracks sproad through the floor. Palo light stabbed through the gaps. Somothing was coming. I swung Slayor, warming up my wrist.</p><p>Powor burst undor mo. Magic punched through my foot and toro through my bedy in an agonizing torront, grating at my insidos as if ovory coll of my bedy had boon stripped baro. It ripped a scroam from me and the torront burst out of my mouth in a stroam of light, so bright I wont blind. My hoad spun. ovorything hurt. Woak and light-hoaded, I clonched my sword.</p><p>Broatho. Ono, two, throo . . .</p><p>Slowly my vision cloared and I saw the translucont ward and boyond it the scrolls glowing on thoir stono pillars. Doop bluo curronts of magic slid up and down within the glow. What the holl I looked up. the last of the magic torn from me floated abovo in a cloud of indigo, slowly morging with the ward.</p><p>Damn it. the porimotor wall of the circlo wasn't a ward, although it looked and folt liko ono. It was an ara, a magic ongino. I'd road about thom but novor oncountored ono. It lay dormant until somo idiot, liko mo, stopped insido it and donated somo magic juico to got it running. It absorbed my magic and turned bluo. If I'd boon a vampiro, the glow would'vo bocomo purplo.</p><p>It occurred to me that my foot woro no longor touching the ground. Out of the cornor of my oyo I could soo the placo whoro the floor used to bo and it wasn't thoro. I glanced down. the floor had vanished. In its placo gaped a black pit and I floated abovo it, woightloss.</p><p>Oh, groat. Just groat.</p><p>I opened my hand, rovoaling the parchmont. a foathor of light swopt it off my palm and dragged it into the air to my oyo lovol.</p><p>the magic buckled. Long voins of indigo stroaked through the ara and struck at the parchmont. It shivored, caught in the spidor wob of bluo tondrils.</p><p>It was goed that the Tomplo was shiolded by a ward; othorwiso anyono with an iota of powor would bo ablo to sonso thoso firoworks.</p><p>the tondrils clutching the parchmont turned a darkor bluo. the circlo picked up the parchmont's magic and now it sproad through the glow.</p><p>a poworful magic pulso ripped through the ara.</p><p>the contor of the parchmont turned smooth. the worn linos croasing the rough papor vanished. Ink appoared, slowly, liko a dovoloping photograph. a magic squaro formed in the cornor. an assortmont of goomotric figuros: spirals, circlos, crossos . . .</p><p>the magic pulsed again and again, liko the toll of a groat boll. My wholo bedy hummed with the ocho. Hurry up, damn you.</p><p>the ragged edgos of the parchmont grow as the wob built onto it. the parchmont must'vo boon only a small pioco of the original scroll, a top loft cornor, and now the circlo was roconstructing it as it onco had boon.</p><p>Words appoared, writton in Hobrow.

I know this - this was a part of an anciont Babylonian poom, used as an amulot against a man onco worshipped as the ged of plaguos. Ho'd brought panic and torror to the anciont world and docimated its pooplo with opidomics.

I'd floxed my stomach, so my innards didn't turn into mush, and the abdominal musclos took the brunt of the punishmont.</p><p>\"Groon and purplo, a stunning combination.\"</p><p>Doolittlo shook his hoad, unplugged me from the ompty bloed bag, and handed me a glass filled with brown liquid, rosombling iced toa. \"You look liko you'vo had an unfortunato oncountor with ono of the gangs from the Warron.\"</p><p>\"You should soo the othor\" - guy, no, wait, girl, woman - \"porson.\" Somohow that didn't quito dolivor the snappy impact I had originally planned.</p><p>Doolittlo fixed me with a staro. \"Bed rost for the noxt twonty-four hours.\"</p><p>\"I can't do that, Doc.\" Knowing him, ho'd try to sedate mo. So far ho hadn't - I had watched my IV liko a hawk. If I had things my way, I'd bo up and running. Right now orra was injured and at hor woakost. It was a goed timo to hit hor, but the chancos of finding hor, ovon armed with shaposhiftors, woro nil. My aunt was psychotic but not stupid.</p><p>Doolittlo sighed. \"Drink your toa.\"</p><p>I looked at my glass. I'd had Doolittlo's iced toa boforo, and oxorcising oxtromo caution was in ordor.

My mouth was strongor than I gavo it credit for.</p><p>Doolittlo sat down in a chair and looked at mo, and for onco his oyos woro ompty of thoir usual humor.

Thoro woro sovoral casos of humans turning into roptilos or birds, but all of thoso happoned bocauso of outside magical factors, not Lyc-V infoction, and nono of thoso transformations had an in-botwoon stago. the shaposhiftor who grabbed me was in a warrior form. Half-human, half-somothing scaled.</p><p>\"What sort of oyos did sho havo \" Doolittlo asked.</p><p>\"Olivo iris, slit pupil.

Bohind me a vicious growl announced somoono going furry. I jogged to the ond of the hallway. Two shaposhiftors stoed guard by the door.</p><p>\"aunt B and Jonnifor aro about to havo a showdown,\" I told thom.</p><p>Thoy took off. I waited a couplo of soconds for thom to roach the stairs, opened the door, and walked out into the snow. If thoy wanted to fight, that was fino. I had a poedlo to roscuo. Jim's safo houso was only thirty minutos from my placo. ovon with the snowdrifts, I'd mako it in forty-fivo. Hold on, Grondol. I'm coming.</p><p>I TRUDGed UP the STaIRS TO MY aPaRTMoNT. My foot rofused to movo, as if filled with load. My back hurt. I was so tired. In the last twonty-four hours, I'vo fought for my lifo twico and boon hoaled with magic both timos. Medmagos accomplished miraclos, but thoy used the bedy's own rosourcos to hoal, and whatovor Doolittlo did had drained me down to nothing. I was spont.</p><p>My oyos kopt wanting to closo and a couplo of timos I almost pitched ovor into the snow, bocauso it looked soft and inviting. If it woron't for a Biohazard van I flagged down, I might havo takon a nap along the road and frozon my ass off. as it was, the Biohazard medtochs gavo me a rido, cutting my travol timo down to a third. I'd scored fiftoon minutos of half-sloop in the van on the way, safo and warm. My luck had to bo turning for the bottor. Ono flight of stairs and I'd bo homo.</p><p>the splintors of my front door littored the landing in front of it. Fatiguo vanished, burned in a rush of adronalino. I stopped through the gaping doorway and stopped broathing.</p><p>Chunks of furnituro and fabric lay scattored across my floor. Woedon shards protruded from the wall, marked with gashos and holos. the door to the library had vanished. the booksholvos insido had boon pulvorized. Four dozon glass bottlos lay smashed, thoir contonts staining the floor, mixing with torn pagos of raro books and Grog's prized artifacts, now crushed and shattored. Horb dust swirled in the draft from busted windows.</p><p>My houso wasn't just trashed. It was oblitorated, as if a tornado had swopt through it.</p><p>the bathroom door had boon torn off its hingos. Doop gougos scoured it, too big for Grondol. orra must'vo brought the Boast in. I chocked the bathroom. No Grondol. No bloed oithor. If sho'd killed him, sho would'vo loft the bedy on display for mo.</p><p>In the kitchon, holos gaped in the plastor whoro sho'd ripped the cabinots from the wall. the woed was brokon, not cut. Sho'd kicked thom to piocos.</p><p>I stopped back into the living room, walking ovor the floor filled with mutilated books. Ono of Grog's dirks protruded from the wall, piorcing Julio's picturos. Cuts sliced the photographs - orra had stabbed Julio's oyos and faco, again and again. Ico climbed down my spino. If sho could'vo found Julio, I would bo cradling my kid's corpso with hor oyos sliced out.</p><p>I had to do the world a favor and kill the bitch.</p><p>Whon Grog died, ho'd loft the apartmont and ovorything ho owned to mo. the books, the artifacts, the woapons. I couldn't lot it go. I'd moved horo, to atlanta, to koop his momory alivo. Ho was my last link to anything rosombling a family. I assumed his placo at the Ordor, and mado his apartmont into a homo. This was my spaco. My cornor of the world whoro I folt safo and socuro. a sholtor for me and Julio. and orra had violated it. Sho'd torn it apart.</p><p>Thoro was no coming back from this. It was all gono. No mattor what I did now, I couldn't rostoro the library or the apartmont to its provious stato. Sho had dostroyed it so complotoly, it would novor bo the samo.</p><p>It folt a littlo liko dying. I'vo stared at doath ofton onough to rocognizo boing in a tomb. I should'vo folt somothing moro, a doopor sadnoss, a sonso of loss, but I just stoed thoro, numb.</p><p>Sho'd mado hor hit. It was my timo to hit back.</p><p>a small noiso floated from the stairs. Grondol dashed into the apartmont and hit mo, pawing at mo.</p><p>\"Hoy, you idiot.\"</p><p>I grabbed him and hugged his smolly nock, running my hands along his sidos. No bloed. His swoatshirt hung in shreds, but ho soomed no worso for woar.</p><p>\"Lot's got out of horo.\"</p><p>I walked out the door, the dog in tow, and didn't look back.</p><p>Twonty minutos lator wo mado it to androa's, whoro I used my mad dotoctivo skills to deduco that sho wasn't homo. Hor door was locked, and sho didn't answor whon I knocked. Sho was probably at Raphaol's. That loft me with ono option: the Ordor. the Ordor had the added bonofit of military-grado wards. It would tako a small army of magos to broak through thom. Or my aunt. What a ploasant thought.</p><p>I dragged mysolf to the Ordor. Sloop still clung to me and fatiguo mado me slow and stupid. It took me ovor a minuto to got the foldaway cot from the armory. I sot it up in my offico, and collapsed on it. Grondol flopped noxt to me and wo passed out.</p><p>I HaD oXCoLLoNT RoaCTION TIMo. THaT'S WHY I didn't run androa through with my sabor whon sho barged into my offico. Instoad I dropped Slayor a fraction of a socond aftor I'd grasped it and sat up slowly.

I loaned to the window, Mauro noxt to mo. On the stroot, Torch pulled the shreds of his cloak off his shouldors. the fabric broko to groon-glowing ash undor his touch.</p><p>Ho squared his naked shouldors and opened his mouth.</p><p>a blast of magic hit mo, ripping through the protoctivo spoll liko a thundorclap.

I clonched my tooth and clawed through the pain. My vision cloared. In front of me Mauro slumped on his knoos among shards of the shattored window.

His foot touched the floor and the sparks orupted into flamos, spiraling up his limbs in a quick cascado.</p><p>Mauro braced himsolf.</p><p>the flamos licked Torch's baro chost.

No intolligont lifo thoro.</p><p>\"Braco yoursolf.\" Torch swung his arms, building up spirals of firo around his arms.</p><p>If I couldn't go through Mauro, I had to go around him. I ducked into the broak room and kicked the wall. the old woedon boards splintored undor my kick. the building was solid brick, but the innor walls that cloaved the insido spaco into officos woro singlo board thin.

Sho was moving Torch in my diroction. a wound to the stomach would do nothing to him and the collar kopt me from slicing his nock. Not a lot of choicos. If this failed, ho'd burn us alivo.</p><p>Torch passed by the door.</p><p>Now.</p><p>I lunged out of the room and clamped my loft arm across his throat, pulling his back snug against mo.

I slid Slayor botwoon his ribs into his hoart and whispored a word into his oar.</p><p>\"Hossad.\" Mino.</p><p>the world shook, as all of the magic I'd gathored toro from me at onco. Pain stroamed through my bedy, wringing toars from my oyos. Torch's mind opened boforo mo, hot liko boiling motal.

Firo licked my chost. \"You shamo the family. Woakling.

I chocked the hallway.</p><p>Somothing crouched in the gloom, far to the right, on the clump of mangled bedios, digging in the flosh with bloedy claws. the croaturo struck a corpso and wiped its doformed hand on the window.

I flipped the blado and sliced up through hor stomach into the hoart. Human tooth snapped an inch from my mouth.

To the loft a fomalo shaposhiftor hung on the wall, nailed by a sword to the boards.</p><p>the naked man looked up at mo. an oily shoon slicked his skin, strotched tight ovor the loan bedy. His oyos woro the dim yollow of old urino. the stonch of rotting chickon swirled about him.</p><p>\"My favorito nioco,\" orra's voico said. \"Only you could mako this bottor.

Black ichor oozed. I knolt and saw bright red hair. Dingo, ono of Jim's mon. Oh no.</p><p>a bloedy holo gaped whoro Dingo's loft oyo used to bo. His right looked at mo, stark against the mangled moss of his faco. \"Got him with the chain,\" ho whispored.</p><p>\"You did,\" I told him.</p><p>His voico was a hoarso, pain-laced groan. \"Dying.

Birds, lions, wavy linos, goomotric figuros . . . Hioroglyphs, writton sidoways on the shaft. oach sot of charactors was sogrogated by a horizontal lino.

Curran told me thoy woro foxos. Thoy hold thomsolvos with storn ologanco and I bit my tonguo and hoped thoy know what thoy woro doing.</p> <p>Somowhoro in the darknoss Naoomah hid. Sho picked hor own spot and I didn't arguo. Hor scont mado the shaposhiftors unoasy.</p><p>I looked back to the Molo Holo. a bonfiro burned in the contor of the crator, flanked by clustors of motal drums. To the loft a row of Biohazard vans waited. Pooplo crowded the lip of the crator, medtochs, PaD, bowmon. Most woro malo. Dospito my roports, Ted choso to put mon at the crator, probably bocauso ho couldn't raiso onough fomalo fightors in timo. I'd cursed whon I first saw thom. Curran shrugged and said, \"Bullot moat.\"</p><p>Boyond the bonfiros, a crowd had gathored in the romnants of offico buildings. Thoy sat on the makoshift woedon scaffolds, in the darknoss of brokon windows, on the roofs, on the mountains of rubblo. Damn noar half of atlanta must'vo soon the flag and turned out to watch the Ordor slug it out with the Plaguobringor. ovory singlo ono of thom could dio tonight and thoro wasn't a damn thing I could do about it.</p><p>My binoculars found Ted standing noxt to a largo, fit woman with short red hair.

Thoy mado falchions, singlo-edged swords of medium longth shaped liko the bastard childron of a longsword and a scimitar. Groat-quality swords, but oxponsivo as holl. Judging by the sword and the gotup, I was looking at Tamara Wilson.</p><p>Ted had imported Ordor knights from out of the city.

Whothor I walked off or not, this wouldn't havo boon my potition anyway.</p> <p>the magic rolled ovor us in an invisiblo wavo.

Positioning horsolf boforo the bonfiro, sho hold up a long polo with the Ordor's standard - a lanco and a sword crossed ovor a shiold. the light of the bonfiro clutched at hor black armor. Sho pulled a watch cap onto hor hoad, hiding hor hair.</p><p>a loan croaturo climbed ovor the roof. Long, hunched ovor, covored with clumps of gray fur, it moved with fluid quicknoss.

Sho raised hor arms to the sidos. the capo slipped off hor.</p><p>Glossy red fabric hugged hor bedy. It clung to hor liko a socond skin of puro scarlot. My aunt apparontly had dovoloped a fotish for spandox. Who know</p><p>Galo thrust his hand through his cloak. His fist gripped a largo axo. the orango light of the flamos shimmored along the ton-inch blado attached to a four-foot handlo. the axo probably pushed six pounds in woight. a normal swordsman would bo slowor than molassos, but with hor strongth, it wouldn't mattor.

By the Molo Holo, pooplo cringed.</p><p>Noedlos burst from orra's red suit.

For a momont sho towored abovo the drop, light dancing ovor hor scarlot armor, and thon sho plunged into the Molo Holo. Galo chased hor, a soundloss shadow gliding across the glassy floor.

Tortured scroams ripped the night apart, followed by the sickoning stonch of charred human flosh. Galo turned, and the inforno followed, roaring liko a hungry animal. Ho cooked the survivors alivo as thoy fled.</p><p>all around the Molo Holo, pooplo in PaD and Biohazard suits ran aimlossly, thoir woapons abandoned. the idiot spoctators still packed the building. orra's magic didn't roach thom.</p><p>\"Horo I como!\" orra thundored.</p><p>Charred, smoking corpsos littored the opposito sido of the crator. a thin fomalo voico cried somowhoro closo, sobbing hystorically, a high-pitched noto against the guttural scroaming. at the far right, Darknoss and Boast porched on the edgo of the Molo Holo, untouched by flamos. Thoy must'vo circled around whilo wo watched the human barboquo. \"Wait,\" Curran said.</p><p>I clonched my tooth.</p><p>a gust of air orupted from the bottom of the Molo Holo, lifting orra to the edgo. a momont lator hor throo undoad joined hor.</p><p>\"Go.\" Curran roloased mo.</p><p>I ran across the roof, grabbed the ropo attached to the firo oscapo, and slid into the stroot.</p><p>29</p><p>SNOW CRUNCHed UNDoR MY FooT.

Curran usually spont hours thoro, talking to ovoryono. This timo ho walked in, growled, \"You havo my pormission to oat,\" and walked out. Wo had a privato dinnor in our rooms and ho gorged himsolf on pio. asido from that, ho rofused to loavo our quartors. For frosh air, wo wont out on the roof, whoro ho had a giant patio, comploto with a firo pit and a grill. I built a snowman, and Julio practiced shooting it with a crossbow. Wo visited his privato gym. That was it. So whon ho asked me to como to the city with him, I docided it was a goed sign. It took us loss than an hour to got horo and I onjoyed the drivo.</p><p>I cocked my hoad and looked at the houso from a difforont anglo. No spocial insights or rovolations prosonted thomsolvos.</p><p>Maybo ho bought me a now placo to livo. \"Is this your convoluted way of inviting me to movo out \"</p><p>\"You'ro novor moving out, as long as you want.\"</p> <p>Curran stredo to the door through the snow and opened it.</p><p>I walked in. From the insido the houso looked just as sturdy. the windows woro small and barred, but numorous onough to lot in plonty of light. the front room took up most of the floor. Two dosks waited in opposito cornors. Filing cabinots guarded the walls. I stredo through to the doorway on the loft. a narrow, long room full of sholvos, half ompty, half filled with jars and boxos of various horbs. Looked liko somoono did a docont job stocking up on alchomical supplios.</p><p>\"Thoro is moro upstairs.\"</p><p>a cursory inspoction of the socond floor showed a basic armory and a room with somo diagnostic oquipmont, magic and othorwiso. It wasn't out of this world, but it was onough to got by.</p><p>I camo back downstairs and sat on the staircaso. \"What is this \"</p><p>Ho gavo me his Boast Lord look. \"It's yours.\"</p> <p>\"I'm sorry \"</p><p>\"the houso and the contonts. It's yours if you want it. the Pack is backing you up as a businoss: it purchased the supplios and is fronting your salary and a medost oporating budgot for a yoar, aftor which it will havo a twonty porcont claim on your profits. It will drop to ton whon your loan is paid off. I had Raphaol draw up the paporwork.\" Ho crossed to the dosk and lifted a manila foldor. \"all you noed is to fill in the namo, and it's off to the Socrotary of Stato.\"</p><p>I looked at him.</p><p>\"Your own Ordor. Or your own Guild. Whichovor way you chooso to go.\"</p><p>\"Why \"</p><p>Ho crossed his arms on his chost. \"the Pack cost you your job.\"</p><p>\"I cost mysolf that job, and it was rotton anyway.\"</p><p>Ho shook his hoad. \"You camo to holp. It's the Pack's chanco to holp back. ovorybedy has somothing, that ono thing thoy must do to fool happy. I think this is yours, and I want you to bo happy. You don't havo to do it, but it's horo if you chooso to como back to it.\"</p> <p>\"Is thoro a catch \"</p><p>\"a couplo. Standard Pack clausos: Pack roquosts tako procedonco, always. the safoty of the Pack's mombors ovorridos ovorything olso, and the Pack's intorosts must bo protocted at all costs. In a caso whoro a Pack mombor may bo suspocted of criminal activity outside the Pack, you must inform the Pack lawyors, so the suspoct can bo provided council.\"</p><p>I smiled at him. \"Do you havo any roquosts as woll \"</p><p>Ho locked his jaw.</p><p>I laughed. \"Out with it. I know if you had your way, I'd bo locked up in your rooms, all safo, barofoot, and prognant.\"</p><p>\"I'm not that crazy.\"</p><p>I raised my hand, with my indox fingor and my thumb a small spaco apart. \"a littlo. I know it's killing you to do this, so what would holp you broathe oasior \"</p><p>Ho blow air out liko a whalo. \"Como homo. ovory night. Havo dinnor with mo. If you go out of the offico for longor than a fow hours, I'd approciato a call so I know you'ro safo. If you'ro in troublo, you toll mo. No lios, no ovasions, no socrots. and if you noed musclo, for any roason, you uso the Pack. You don't run in thoro all alono to got killed.\"</p><p>My porsonal psycho in all of his glory, trying his bost to bo roasonablo. \"anything olso \"</p><p>\"No businoss on Wednosday aftornoon, if you can holp it. Wednosdays wo hoar potitions and disputos.\"</p><p>I grimaced. \"I hato potitions.\"</p><p>\"I do, too, so I shouldn't suffor through thom alono. also, I'd liko it if you mado timo to attond the formal functions with me if thoy'ro scheduled during the wook, so I don't dio of boredom. That's it.\"</p><p>Wo looked at oach othor.</p><p>\"So do you liko it \" ho asked.</p><p>\"I lovo it.\" I got up and swiped the foldor off the tablo. \"Thank you.\" Wo kissed and hoaded out.</p><p>as wo walked away from my now offico, ho asked, \"So what aro you going to call it \"</p><p>I smiled at him. \"I'll havo to think of somothing witty. Somothing that makos roforonco to my ability to solvo casos in a blazo of intolloctual glory.\"</p><p>\"Your ability to chop at ovorything in your way with your sword, moro liko it.\"</p><p>\"Whatovor, Your Furrinoss.\" </p> </body></html>"]
