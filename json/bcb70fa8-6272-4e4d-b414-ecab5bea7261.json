What makes them cry? Smile? What allows them to love? These are the questions I\u2019ve asked myself for nearly the last twenty-one years.</p><p>What makes people feel?</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what produces emotion and I\u2019m supposed to be writing a paper on human emotion for my Sociology class. I\u2019ve been camped out on a bench in the center of the campus quad, studying the interaction of nearly the entire student body that goes to the University of Wyoming, and I still don\u2019t understand.</p> <p>What is it? Why do they hold hands? Kiss? Laugh? What the hell is making them look like there are rainbows and sunshine everywhere?</p><p>It is a warm fall day and leaves are fluttering across the dry grass. The branches are bare and the air is laced with rain. My jacket is balled up on the bench beside me and ear buds are stuffed into my ears. \u201cWonderwall\u201d by Oasis plays through the speakers, the lyrics trying to surface an emotion buried deep inside me, but, like usual, it\u2019s just a spark that quickly fades.</p><p>I jot some notes about a couple making out on the steps in the front entrance of the main office, which is a large brick building that has a historical look to it. Their hands are all over each other, feeling every inch of one another\u2019s skin, like they want each other more than anything. I don\u2019t get it. I never have. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve never been able to feel any emotion. Sadness, happiness, love; they are all just words to me. They have no more meaning or importance than the shoes on my feet.</p><p>When I was younger, I never thought much about it. I moved through my life like a robot, and I was fine, but lately, at least for the last few days, questions are surfacing. Maybe it is the fact that Professor Fremont, my Sociology professor, has been on a human emotion kick lately. Most of his lectures relate to the drive behind emotion. Perhaps his words have finally stuck the pin into my thoughts.</p><p>Why have I never felt anything? Am I broken? Crazy? Or are there just some people who go through life like me\u2014peacefully disconnected?</p> <p>I scribble the thought down, shut my notebook, and get to my feet, deciding to call it quits for the day. I gather my things into my bag and head across the campus toward my parked car. I used to live in the dorm, but it\u2019s the start of my Senior year and I made the decision to move out on my own. I\u2019m sure it was a huge favor to the person in line to share a dorm with me. I tend to frighten people with my internal impassiveness. I was the same way in high school. Most of my life, I was the outcast weirdo with no friends. It made sense. I mean, how can I make friends when I can\u2019t smile, laugh, or even relate to people?</p><p>As I pull my car keys out from my pocket, a nagging feeling overcomes me, like I forgot something on the bench. I glance over my shoulder, squinting against the faint stream of sunlight flowing through the air. The bench is empty. My eyes sweep through the crowd and I get the impression that someone is watching me, but everyone seems to be engulfed in their own business.</p><p>Burying the impression, I turn back around and step off the curb. That\u2019s when the heat hits me, like a kick to the stomach. I hunch over and my keys fall to the ground. It hurts, like fire\u2019s melting my skin and scorching my hands, however my skin looks as pale and smooth as it always has. I try to straighten back up, forcing my shoulders upward, but something stabs into the back of my neck. I reach around and feel the warmth of my skin scorching against my trembling fingers. There is something else there, though\u2014something invisible, possessing my body, as if hot liquid spills through my veins and pools inside my heart.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe\u2014can\u2019t stand. My knees buckle and I collapse to the ground, the rocks dig through my jeans, into my skin, and my palms split open as I press them into the ground to hold my weight up. Every bone in my body feels like it is cracking open from the emotional pressure. Every hurtful word, every sad moment, every lonely second I\u2019ve ever experienced pours through me like a rampant river and submerges my body, drowning me in my own tears. My fingers shake as I touch my wet cheeks.</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. Shocked. Terrified. Because, for the first time in my life, I\u2019m crying.</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>Three months later...</p><p>I feel alive as I follow him down the slender hallway, bordered by maroon walls and lit up by antique lanterns. The way he moves with slow, confident strides is hypnotic. My heart knocks inside my chest, excited and nervous. My pulse speeds up when he glances over his shoulder at me. He is gorgeous; dark-brown tousled hair, broad shoulders, bright green eyes. I\u2019m helpless as my legs carry me toward him. Even though I don\u2019t know who he is, it feels like I do. I just can\u2019t place from where.</p><p>Music plays from within the building and vibrates against the walls. There is heat in the air and it makes my skin damp beneath the short leather dress I\u2019m wearing. It\u2019s strange because I never wear dresses, but I never walk down empty hallways chasing strangers, either.</p><p>He turns to face me, walking backwards, and his tongue slips out of his mouth to wet his full lips. I swear to God, I almost die as the urge to lean forward and bite his lip rushes through my body. I\u2019ve never felt this way before. I\u2019ve never felt much of anything, until now.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d he asks, pausing at the door at the end of the hallway.</p><p>I nod eagerly, even though I have no idea what he wants me to do. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>An unhurried smile curves across his lips and the muscles of his arms flex as he shoves open the door. Inside is a small room, with blood-red walls and floors the color of ash. There\u2019s a dresser in the corner, a room divider against the back wall, along with a metal-framed bed.</p><p>I press my lips together and cross my arms over my chest, wondering if I\u2019m getting in over my head.</p> <p>He motions for me to step in as he holds the door open. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>I enter, fiddling with the bottom of my dress and struggling to keep my balance in my high-heeled boots. \u201cAre you sure they won\u2019t find us here?\u201d I ask, turning in a circle to examine the room.</p><p>He closes the door and turns around to face me with his hands behind his back. He studies me intensely and it makes me squirm. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not like I thought you\u2019d be,\u201d he says, taking a step forward. \u201cYet, at the same time you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d I take a step back, trying to blink away from his gaze, but I am trapped by feelings I can\u2019t control.</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense.\u201d He takes another step and then another. I match his moves until my back brushes the wall. He places a hand on each side of my head, pinning me between his arms and leans forward until there is hardly any space between our lips, our bodies are aligned. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>I can smell the faint scent of his cologne and feel the heat emitting from his body. \u201cAre you sure we shouldn\u2019t be running? They won\u2019t stop until they find me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with his eyes focused on me. Up close, I can see little specks of blue inside the green and the largeness of his pupils. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. I promise I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Conflicted with whether or not I believe him, I swallow hard. \u201cAre you sure, because...\u201d</p><p>He places a finger across my lips. \u201cShh... When I promise something, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and my eyelids flutter from the feel of his skin on my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d His finger trails down the front of my neck to my chest and I shiver as he inches closer, closing his eyes.</p><p>The first touch of his lips brings an uproar of heat to my skin that surges down my neck and my chest before hitting me straight in the stomach and coiling downward, causing me to let out an embarrassing moan. I start to recoil, but he only seems more eager to kiss me as his tongue slips deep inside my mouth.</p><p>The taste of him is familiar and comforting, yet full of danger, want, and need. I feel the back of my neck grow hot with a fire that rips through my body as a hunger possesses me. My head races a million miles a minute with thoughts of getting closer to him. I clutch onto his arms, digging my nails into his skin, drawing a line of blood as I press my body against his. What the hell is happening to me? I\u2019ve never felt this way before. I need to breathe\u2014I need to run... God, but I want to stay.</p><p>His hands wander down my body; across my breast to the bottom of my dress. As his fingers graze my bare thigh, he sucks on my tongue and pulls me closer. Gripping my legs, he scoops me up and urges them around his waist. The feel of him pressed up against me makes the fire burn hotter. I\u2019m burning up. I swear I'm literally on fire.</p><p>He groans against my mouth, biting at my bottom lip as his hands roam upward beneath my dress and cup my ass. My legs constrict in response and tighten around his hips. His muscles tighten, but his tongue continues to explore my mouth, entangling with my tongue, tasting me, turning me on in ways I don\u2019t understand. God, I want to understand, though. So badly.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d he breathes as his lips kiss a path down my jawline to my neck, where he sucks on my skin, nearly driving me crazy.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d I ask as my fingers tangle through his soft hair and my head falls back.</p><p>He shakes his head, pulling away for just a second, and his eyes are glazed over. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what he means, but as his fingers move between my legs, I forget about everything. The spark of his touch causes me to suck in a sharp breath. My chest heaves as I shut my eyes and dig my fingernails into his shoulder blades as more intense emotions emerge. I slide my hands underneath his shirt, feeling the lines of his muscles and the smoothness of his skin.</p><p>He laughs against my lips and then his tongue slips back inside my mouth, but it feels different. His lips... they don\u2019t feel the same and there is something on them that feels like cold metal.</p><p>I open my eyes and my breath catches in my throat. He\u2019s changed into someone else. His brown hair is now blond with blue tips and a silver ring is looped through his bottom lip. His eyes are bright blue, like the sky, and his skin is as pale as snow.</p><p>\u201cWho are you...\u201d I breathe, but I think I know.</p><p>The stranger stays silent and leans forward to kiss me. I wonder if there is something wrong with me as his tongue encourages my lips apart and I only clutch onto his lean arms, instead of pulling away. His skin is like ice and he tastes different and exciting. My body feels like it\u2019s going to explode from the torridness. His hands grip my waist, his nails digging into my skin as he draws me closer, crushing my body against his, and my skin beads with sweat. He mutters my name, threading his fingers through my hair and tugging at the roots until my head is tipped back. Then, his mouth moves for my neck. His teeth gently nick at my skin and it stings a little, but feels amazingly good at the same time; like some kind of euphoric venom dancing threw my veins.</p><p>As his hands search my body, the warmth of his touch gradually decreases. Instead of heat, I feel cold. His hands wander up the front of my dress, his palms gliding against the leather until he is cupping my breasts. I let out a moan, but numbness consumes me. And the cold. Why am I so cold?</p><p>My eyes snap open. Towering behind him is a figure wearing a black cloak with the hood pulled over its head. The eyes are yellow and flash fiercely as it steps forward with its bony hand stretched outward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jerk away from the guy\u2019s arms and lower my feet to the ground. \u201cOh my God,\u201d I stutter with my eyes locked on the monster.</p><p>His brows knit. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Before I can respond, the monster unhitches its jaw and opens its mouth. My scream echoes through the room as its ice-cold breath suffocates both of us and we fall to the floor\u2014</p><p>The lyrics of \u201cCloser\u201d by Nine Inch Nails fill my head. I rub my eyes and blink the tiredness away as I hit the off button on the alarm. The cold and the heat still linger in my body, just like they do every damn morning because I can\u2019t shake that dream. I wrap my blanket around myself with the prickle gnawing at the back of my neck, pumping fear through my body that I can\u2019t shake. My emotions are still so new and I have a hard time controlling them; especially, when my dreams get me so riled up. I have no idea how to cope.</p> <p>Ever since the crying incident a few of months ago, my life has altered in more ways than one. Everyday there\u2019s a new experience, whether it\u2019s as simple as finding something amusing or crying for hours over the loss of my childhood and adolescence\u2014the regret of endless lonely days.</p><p>It is early in the morning and the pink afterglow of the sunrise paints the mountains. I climb out of bed, get dressed in a pair of black jeans and a red tee, and fasten my long brown hair into a ponytail. I take a good look in the mirror at my violet eyes, pale skin, and long legs. Whenever I look at my reflection, I can spot something hidden in my eyes; like a secret, but it could just be the alarming shade of violet just throwing me off.</p><p>After I lace up my black boots, I grab my keys and head for the front door. I have to pick up a few things from my grandparent\u2019s house. I moved in with them when I was one, after my parents died in a car accident. After I graduated, I moved out without saying a word. I\u2019m not even sure why I did it, only that at the time it seemed like it was something I was supposed to do.</p><p>I\u2019ve barely spoke to them over the last few years, but yesterday they called me up threatening to throw some of my things away, so I figure I\u2019ll head over and get them before my classes start. Besides, the sooner I get it done, the sooner I\u2019ll never have to talk to my grandparents again, which will make us all happy.</p><p>It\u2019s ridiculously cold in Laramie. The roads are frozen with salt sprinkled across them and icicles hang from the trees. There are snowmen decorating the yards, ice glazing the rain gutters and branches, and the roofs of the houses are piled with snow.</p> <p>When I arrive at my grandparents\u2019 two-story, redbrick house my insides wind into knots as every memory attached to the place surfaces. My grandparents are the coldest people I know and have always been dead-set on ignoring me as much as possible. It didn\u2019t really bother me when I was younger, since I couldn\u2019t experience things like pain and anguish, but now, I fucking despise them. It\u2019s an overpowering feeling, which is why I hate coming here. The feeling owns me, makes me say things I normally wouldn\u2019t, and turns me into a different person\u2014a bitter person.</p><p>I climb out of the car, zipping my coat up as I walk toward the side door. Right as I reach the bottom of the porch, the door swings open and a guy steps out. He is tall, solidly built and has his hood pulled over his head with the front of his jacket zipped up to his chin. He also wears sunglasses, so he\u2019s nearly covered up. At first, I think robber, but he seems too serene and confident. He stares at me for a moment with his feet planted on the top step. He seems stunned that I\u2019m here\u2014at my own house\u2500 when it should be the other way around.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say with a small wave as I step up onto the bottom stair. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, and with one swift spring of his toes, he grabs onto the railing and launches himself over it. He lands gracefully on the ice and then hikes down the driveway, kicking up snow from the ground.</p><p>I scratch at the back of my neck as the prickle starts to manifest, but it wilts before an emotion can develop. I glance at my hands as a tingling sensation fizzles across my skin and then my gaze lifts back to the guy who is rounding the fence line. As he nears the end of the yard he turns his head and looks at me. A magnetic current courses through me and I almost run to him. As soon as the feeling hits me, he looks away and vanishes around the corner. The sensation dissolves and I\u2019m left both confused and kind of empty.</p><p>Shaking my head, I tug open the door and step into the kitchen. Sophia, my grandmother, is standing over the stove tending to the hissing pans as the smell of bacon fills the air. My grandfather, Marco, is reading a newspaper at the table. They both seem uncomfortable, fidgety, but that\u2019s nothing new. They\u2019ve been that way for as long as I can remember.</p> <p>Marco peers over the newspaper at me and his black, oval glasses slide down the brim of his slightly crooked nose. He is a reserved man who likes to avoid confrontation at all cost. \u201cGood morning, Gemma,\u201d he mumbles with a subtle nod.</p><p>It\u2019s the same conversation we\u2019ve had since I was eight: a polite hello and an eager good-bye; as if we were nothing more than acquaintances. It takes a lot, but I manage to strain a smile. \u201cGood morning, Marco.\u201d I point over my shoulder. \u201cWho was that person that just walked out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Sophia replies and at the same time Marco responds, \u201cThe paper boy.\u201d</p><p>I skim back and forth between them as I question their honesty. \u201cThe paper boy? Wasn\u2019t he about my age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour stuff\u2019s boxed up in the room upstairs,\u201d Sophia says, ignoring me. The bacon sizzles as she taps her high heels on the tile floor. She is wearing a floral dress with a white apron tied over it and her auburn hair is twisted in a bun. She is a very proper person; always neatly dressed and the house is always clean.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Shaking my head, I walk across the kitchen toward the doorway. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go get it and be out of your hair then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d she says curtly and resumes cooking.</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I disappear into the foyer and hurry up the stairs to my old room. This has always been the extent of our relationship: she says how much she dislikes me being around and I try my best to ignore her. It was easier to deal with when I couldn\u2019t get pissed off, but now it takes a lot of control not to scream at her.</p> <p>The once tan walls of my room have been painted a bright red, the shelf in the corner is stripped of my music collection, and the dresser drawers are open and empty. I walk over to the stack of boxes near the foot of the bed and I run my finger along the label. Memories stab at my brain like sharp nails.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Lonely.</p><p>Hopeless.</p><p>I\u2019m broken inside.</p><p>\u201cGemma\u2019s junk,\u201d I read the label out loud. \u201cI guess it\u2019s probably true... none of this stuff ever really meant anything to me.\u201d I wish it did, though. I wish I had a connection to something\u2014anything.</p><p>Sighing, I backtrack to the door and peer out into the hallway, making sure no one is there, before shutting the door. Kneeling down beside my bed, I reach underneath it and run my fingers along the bottom of the mattress until I find the papers. Fumbling with the tape, I peel off the photo. It\u2019s ripped in half, faded, and frayed, but from what I can tell, it\u2019s a picture of a woman with flowing, long, brown hair, blue irises, and a snow-white complexion. I once found it while cleaning under the stairway and kept it because I believe it\u2019s my mother. I\u2019ve hidden it under my bed because if Sophia found it, she would have taken it away. She hates it when I bring up my parents. The only thing I know about them is that my mother\u2019s name was Jocelyn and I only know that because it\u2019s on my birth certificate, which doesn\u2019t list my father\u2019s name and Sophia refuses to give me an explanation as to why.</p><p>I haven\u2019t looked at the photo since I\u2019ve been able to feel. It\u2019s strange, the idea that it could be her. It makes my chest compress and I forget how to breathe. As tears threaten to spill out, I quickly get to my feet and tuck the picture into my back pocket. Sucking in a deep breath and forcing back the tears, I pick up a box and carry it down the stairs.</p><p>Marco is no longer in the kitchen and Sophia is taking off her apron. \u201cAre you all right carrying those out by yourself? Marco\u2019s back has been bothering him again.\u201d</p><p>I nod as I observe a silver-framed photo of Marco and Sophia hanging on the wall next to the kitchen table. They are standing on the shore of a lake. Marco has his hand in front of his face, shielding his eyes from the sunlight and Sophia is to the side of him, smiling. On her collarbone I can see a hint of tattoo. The picture always confuses me because Sophia doesn\u2019t seem like someone who would have a tattoo. She also doesn\u2019t seem like someone who would have children of her own, either. Yet, she my mother\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if we could talk about that thing I mentioned last week,\u201d I ask, shifting the box onto my hip, hoping she doesn\u2019t notice that I\u2019m lying. \u201cIt\u2019s for a history paper I\u2019m working on. I kind of need to know a thing or two about my parents.\u201d</p><p>Sophia turns away from the stove. \u201cI thought I told you not to bring them up\u2014that I didn\u2019t want to talk about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I kind of need you to.\u201d I set the box down on the table. Actually, I don\u2019t. I just want to know for myself. \u201cOtherwise, I might fail and I\u2019m so close to being finished, the last thing I want to do is fall behind schedule for graduation.\u201d</p><p>She turns off the stove and narrows her eyes at me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We are not going to talk about your parents. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask, battling my anger. \u201cWhat scares you so much about the idea?\u201d</p><p>With her hands on her hips, Sophia storms toward me, her high heels clicking forcefully against the tile. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s easy for me to talk about my daughter\u2019s death? Do you like to make me hurt?\u201d</p><p>I hold my chin high, refusing to cower back. \u201cNo, but it feels like I should know something about her. About both my parents. In fact, you should have told me about them a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Her skin turns a ghostly white and lines form around her eyes as she gives me a harsh look. \u201cWe will not talk about this ever again. Do you understand?\u201d She hurries out of the kitchen and, seconds later, I hear her bedroom door shut.</p><p>Tears sting at my eyes, but I force them back. I won\u2019t let the sadness win. I\u2019m tougher than that. I\u2019ve lived without the knowledge of my parents for twenty-one years for hell sakes.</p><p>Opening the back door, I step outside. Even though a blizzard has blown in, it feels warmer than in the house.</p><p>By the time I pull up to the campus, I\u2019m late for Calculus and there\u2019s a test today. My grade is already nearing the seventy percent mark, so I can\u2019t miss it. Swinging the car door open, I hop out into the snowfall. Deciding to leave the boxes in the trunk, I rush across the campus yard, the snow crunching under my sneakers. I keep my eyes on my watch, watching the minutes tick down. I speed up to a run, but then pause when I approach the salted sidewalk as the prickling sensation stabs at my neck.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>I wait for an emotion to rise and take me over, wondering how complex it will be, but a few seconds go by and I feel nothing, so I force my feet to move and step up onto the curb. As my shoe touches the ground, my skin heats and my gaze zeroes in on a guy walking toward me from across the parking lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m almost certain I\u2019ve seen him before, but can\u2019t place from where. My neck tingles again, little pin prickles, like the day my tears were unleashed for the very first time. I\u2019m flooded with a desire to chase him down, rip off his clothes, bite on his neck, and do all the dirty things I\u2019ve been dreaming about. I might have acted on the impulse, too, but a snowball smacks me in the face and diverts my gaze from him.</p><p>I wipe the snow from my cheek and glare at the thrower. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me standing here?\u201d</p><p>A heavyset guy with a beanie on surrenders his hands in front of him as he backs toward the entrance of the campus. \u201cSorry, I was aiming for him.\u201d He nods his head to my right at a lanky guy with a hoodie pulled over his head.</p><p>I pluck chunks of snow out of my hair as I rush toward the entrance doors and catch up with the guy I\u2019ve been having dirty thoughts about right as he swings the door open. He steps to the side and holds it open for me, like a true gentleman. I bite my bottom lip to keep my irrational, lust-filled emotions contained, and walk in; my heart hitting the inside of my chest. Keep moving forward. Don\u2019t stop. My thoughts are weaker than my feet and I halt, peering up at him.</p> <p>My heart stops as recognition takes over. I know him. Well, too. A faint spark is flickering deep inside my memories, but I don\u2019t understand how. All I know is that I can\u2019t breathe. Or maybe, I am breathing for the very first time. Maybe this is what it is like to feel alive.</p><p>Then it hits me. He\u2019s the guy from my dream. He\u2019s even more gorgeous in person; tousled, dark brown hair and the greenest eyes I\u2019ve ever seen. His long limbs are carved with muscles, and confidence radiates off him from the way he stands to the look in his eyes. He wears a black hoodie and dark jeans that hang low on his hips. I can\u2019t seem to take my eyes of the patch of skin that shows when he raises his hand to run his fingers through his hair, making his shirt ride up a little.</p><p>When our gazes collide, I\u2019m shocked by a zap of electricity that fires through my body. The size of my eyes amplify as the feeling expands, coiling into my stomach and burning between my thighs. A gasp escapes my lips as my body quivers from the rush. I\u2019ve felt this before, many times in my dreams, but, God dammit, it feels so much better in real-life.</p><p>A look of intrigue and fascination masks his face as he watches me, like he\u2019s waiting for something momentous to happen.</p><p>Does he know me? Does he dream about me, like I dream about him? How can any of this be possible?</p> <p>I extend my hand toward his chest and slide my palm up the front of his shirt; needing to touch him, be close to him. His heart thuds underneath my palm, matching the erratic beat of mine and his eyes widen, his gaze flicking to my lips and for a brief, but earth-shattering moment, he looks like he might kiss me.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d I ask as my fingers brush the top of his collar and electricity rips from my fingertips to my toes.</p><p>Suddenly his expression slips into a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but did I give you permission to put your hands on me?\u201d He sidesteps around me and lets the heavy metal door slam into my elbow.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d I rub at the pain on my arm as every ounce of my elation cracks, shatters, and falls to the floor. \u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d</p><p>He shoots me a harsh look and my mouth drops open. \u201cNext time, hold the damn door open for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Fucking asshole. It\u2019s amazing how one second I feel like I\u2019m in an eternal state of ecstasy and the next I\u2019m boiling in a pot full of rage, all because this sexy stranger opened that delicious-looking mouth of his.</p> <p>He turns his back on me and strolls down the hall without a glance back; leaving me angry, irritated, and totally turned on.</p><p>Yep, there is definitely something wrong with my head.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>For the rest of the day, I try to make sense of what happened in the entryway with Mr. Sexy Douche Bag. I shouldn\u2019t have just reached out and groped him that way, but his reaction was still surprising. Maybe he\u2019s just naturally a jerk, but why have I dreamt about him? Plus, there is that strange electric connection. None of it makes sense.</p><p>The next morning, after a very rough night of nightmares, I head off to Astronomy, relieved I can finally relax. I love learning about the stars. Even back in high school, during my emotionally detached days, I would stare up at the night sky and appreciate the beauty of each one; how they seem to be separate but whole. The first time I ever experienced happiness was when I had been lying in bed one night, staring out my window at the stars shining harmoniously. The prickle showed up and I smiled as the warmth of happiness swelled inside me. Ever since then, I\u2019ve felt this strange bond with the night sky, like somehow I\u2019m connected to it.</p><p>The classroom is empty when I enter. Taking a seat at the back corner desk on the upper row, I set my book on the table and take a pen out from my bag. Although I don\u2019t have any future plans for my life, I hope that one day I can do something with the stars. I\u2019m working on a General Studies degree because nothing seems to fit right. Whenever I look forward and try to envision my future, all I see is light.</p><p>The winter semester has barely started; there are a few extra students who show up and some who drop out over the first few weeks. I notice a girl I\u2019ve never seen before around campus walk into the classroom. Her golden-brown hair is twisted up in a clip that matches the shade of her pink sweater. Her eyes are a fierce green, traced with brown liner and there\u2019s something familiar about her.</p><p>She smiles at me as she takes the seat in front of me and sets her purse onto the desk. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Aislin Avery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma Lucas.\u201d I feel strange because people rarely talk to me. Around sophomore year, I started to believe that perhaps I was invisible and that people couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cIs it your first day in this class?\u201d</p><p>She nods and tucks a strand of hair behind her ear as she begins rummaging around in her purse. \u201cI just transferred to UW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a senior?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cWhat year are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a senior too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d she says, retrieving some lip-gloss from her bag. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet a fellow soon-to-be graduate.\u201d She turns around and directs her attention to her phone.</p><p>I stare out the window and watch the snowflakes drift down from the sky as people begin to wander into the classroom. There is a little yellow light flickering near a cluster of leafless bushes, like a lightning bug spazzing out. The longer I stare at it, the more it blends into the snow and fades away.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>I click the cap of the pen off as my thoughts drift to the guy I ran into yesterday. For most of my life, I\u2019ve never thought of guys as anything more than people, figures that filled up the school hallways and ran over me like I was nonexistent. And in my past that was fine. I never felt sad, lonely, or depressed. It was as if I was an object that filled up space, moved without cause, and served no purpose. Things changed when I started to feel emotions. It isn\u2019t like I want every single guy I come across, but I do have a very vivid imagination that is fed by my loneliness. If I had actual friends, then maybe my dreams and thoughts would tone down a little.</p><p>As I put the cap back on the pen, my hand begins to tremble and my gaze automatically dashes toward the doorway. My jaw drops. The guy from yesterday is walking inside. He moves like a cat with measured stretches of his long limbs and every muscle in his body flexes underneath his grey Henley and jeans. His hooded eyes are fastened on me as he climbs up the steps toward me and my fingers nearly strangle the life out of the pen in anticipation.</p><p>Is the strange, electric heat going to appear again?</p><p>He veers down the aisle in front of me, then flings his gaze off me and drops down into the seat beside Aislin. \u201cDid you get your schedule all worked out?\" he asks, reclining back in the chair and biting at a pen.</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d Aislin grabs a small paper from her purse, places it on the desk in front of her and runs her hands along it to smooth out the wrinkles. \u201cThe office people were kind of jerks.\u201d</p><p>He looks over his shoulder as he tips back the chair and the two front legs disconnect from the floor. He arches his eyebrows at me, probably because I\u2019m staring at him with my mouth hanging agape. There\u2019s probably even some drool on my chin.</p><p>I discretely wipe my chin with the sleeve of my jacket, relaxing when it feels dry.</p><p>Aislin revolves around in her seat and beams a grin at me. \u201cGemma, this is my brother Alex.\u201d</p><p>I extend my hand out to him, wondering what it\u2019s going to feel like to touch him and if it will strike up the spark again. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow as his gaze cuts to my hand and then back to my face. He lowers the chair legs back to the ground and shrugs me off as he faces his sister. \u201cSo how much unpacking do you have left?\u201d</p><p>My fingers grip around the pen until my knuckles turn white and it takes every ounce of energy not to stab him in the back of the neck. Thankfully, Professor Sterling enters the classroom and begins his lecture on sky charting. The interruption calms me down.</p><p>I jot down a few notes, but my concentration keeps straying to Alex. He is leaning back in his chair with his arms tucked behind his head and his eyes are half open. His shirt is riding up and his rock hard abs are peeking out. I rest my chin in my hand and focus on the lines of his muscles, his luscious lips, his firm jawline. Every now and again, he bites down on his bottom lip and I picture myself sucking it into my mouth, biting down on it and then sucking it into my mouth again. I imagine my hands touching every inch of his body, feeling how hard he is.</p><p>I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying how hot the mental picture makes my body feel when he unexpectedly tilts his head toward me. Our gazes collide and a fire crackles inside me, flaming passionately; full of a need I can\u2019t quite grasp. Then he glares and the fire goes poof, fizzles, and I feel put out; extinguished to nothing more than a thin trail of smoke. He quickly looks away and everything goes back to normal.</p><p>As class continues, the silence of the electricity is maddening. In a twisted way, I want to feel it because it feels good, but does it really exist? Just as the thought crosses my mind that maybe I have imagined it, a sharp spark nips at my lips. It is gentle at first, barely a tingle, but it grows stronger as it streams down my neck and my skin, causing a vibration deep inside me. I flex my hands and cross my legs trying to suffocate the tingling between my thighs.</p><p>Alex\u2019s jaw is taut as he stares ahead at the front of the classroom where Professor Sterling is yammering about something that is probably important, but all I can concentrate on is the untamed desire I feel. I want to do things to him, like jump over the desk and peel his clothes off.</p><p>Alex jerks his fingers through his hair and cocks his head to the side to capture my eye. His expression is a mixture of emotions: fear, anger, longing; they mirror my own perfectly. It\u2019s becoming harder than hell to keep my hands to myself. I finally have to tuck them between my legs before I end up reaching out and touching him.</p><p>Seconds later, Alex breaks our gaze and redirects his attention to the front of the classroom, clicking his pen over and over again through the rest of the lecture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the end of class, Professor Sterling assigns everyone to a group to work on a project and my group gets assigned to create a presentation about Gamma-ray bursts. I hate when he does this. I thought after high school that it\u2019d be over, but there are always a few Professors who think it\u2019s beneficial to aid each other in projects. Worst of all, he pairs me with Alex and Aislin, which has to be fate slapping me across the face. Hopefully, I can keep my Goddamn hands to myself, but at the moment the idea doesn\u2019t seem plausible.</p><p>I gather my stuff and put my books into my bag before swinging it over my shoulder. Trying not to look at Alex, I start down the stairs, but his shoulder rams into me as he exits the aisle. I trip sideways, slamming my hip into one of the corners of a desk. Something inside my skull pops and images deluge my brain like little pieces of glass.</p><p>Alex and I are in front of a glistening lake, crisp with blue ice and encircled by frosted trees. Death is in the air and the sky is opaque and ominous. Snowflakes twirl around us and the temperature is well below freezing.</p><p>\u201cIt will be alright,\u201d Alex whispers to me, his breath clouding out in front of him. His lips are purple from the cold and there are dark circles under his green eyes. Shavings of ice have formed on his eyelashes and drops of snow stick to his hair. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. I promise I\u2019ll save you no matter what.\u201d</p> <p>Tipping my chin up, I grip onto his strong arms, like it\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll see him. \u201cBut what about you? Who will save you?\u201d</p><p>He sweeps my hair out of my face and kisses me with so much passion it nearly melts the snow. He sucks on my tongue, his hands straying around to my backside as he pulls my body against his. They linger there momentarily before he draws back. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re okay, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Alex,\u201d I start to protest, but a large group of hooded figures charge from the forest and my words are sucked away by the wind.</p><p>The beat of their march shakes the world as they head for us. Ice topples from the trees and hits the ground. Alex pulls me against him as flames blaze through my body and then all I see is light.</p><p>I blink back to the Astronomy classroom right as my legs give out and I fall toward the floor, but Alex\u2019s arm encircles my waist and he catches me before I hit. I freeze, stunned, feeling the heat and the intensity caressing my skin, causing more confusion.</p> <p>Well, what the hell was that? A dream? In the middle of the day? Awake?</p><p>\u201cI do know you,\u201d I say as I stare up at him and this time it isn\u2019t a question.</p><p>His hands tighten around the small of my back and for a moment he holds me, frozen, as people pass by, heading down the stairs and looking at us like we\u2019re crazy. He\u2019s breathing fiercely, his chest rising and falling, as he stares at me with confliction in his eyes; his pupils round and large, and his lips are parted.</p><p>Foggy images fill my head. \u201cI think I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d Aislin\u2019s voice rises over the moment. \u201cWe need to get to our next class.\u201d</p><p>He blinks and then wrenches his hands away from my back, giving me very little time to get my footing. He glares at me, his eyes pooled with hatred, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s directed at me. Then he trots down the stairs with his sister at his side.</p> <p>I watch him leave, very aware that he never denied that I know him.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I'm suffering from delusions; that my stability has snapped like a broken rubber band, and my ability to grasp reality is gone. I\u2019ve been really into psychology lately, doing a lot of research about it for class and for personal interest. It\u2019s an interesting thing, the human mind. There are so many different mental illnesses that can control a person, make them think a certain way, do specific things, see things that aren\u2019t real. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and delirium are just a few and, in some cases, there is very little the person can do about it. I wonder if any of those apply to me.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on a bench out in the cold with a scarf wrapped around my neck, fingerless gloves on and a hot cup of coffee in my hands. I\u2019ve called Sophia six times in the last two days and left her three voicemails. In each one I beg her to tell me about my parents. Please. Pretty please. I deserve it. However, each call is unanswered and the silence is more infuriating than the cold-hearted refusal she usually gives me.</p><p>The campus is busy for how early it is, lots of people going to and from class. As I try to analyze what is going on in each passerby\u2019s head, I notice a person lurking near the alleyway between the main office and the building next to it. He... she... it seems to be watching me. There are shadows obscuring its identity, but it looks unnaturally disproportioned and misshapen. There\u2019s also some kind of greyish smoke lacing out of its mouth and a hood blocks its eyes, but I swear there is a faint glimmer of yellow radiating from them. As the realization of what it could be strikes me across the face, I feel a spark flare inside me.</p><p>\u201cDo you always sit outside in the cold and freeze your ass off?\u201d The sound and feeling of Alex\u2019s presence encases my body.</p><p>I peer up at him. \u201cUmm...\u201d My gaze darts back to the alley, but the figure is gone. Again, I question my sanity. I tip my chin up, angling my neck to look up at Alex. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me with an annoyed look on his face, but there is also a trace of discomfort in the way he stands; like he\u2019s trying to relax, but can\u2019t quite get there. His hair is tucked under the hood of a heavy coat, black boots cover his feet and there is a tiny tear on the knee of his jeans.</p> <p>He glances over his shoulder where I thought I\u2019d seen the figure, and then levels his gaze back on me. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little bit cold to be sitting out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold,\u201d I lie and take a sip of my coffee, basking in the heat of the hot liquid as it spills down my throat.</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at me and there is doubt in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cold, huh? Then, why are your lips purple?\u201d</p><p>I touch my numb finger to my even number lips. \u201cI was actually working on an assignment for sociology.\u201d Another lie.</p><p>He looks around at the snowy campus yard and heavy traffic by the stairs. His forehead creases as he looks back at me and tucks his bottom lip up between his teeth, biting on it. \u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>I fold my hands on my lap. \u201cOkay....\u201d</p><p>He peeks over his shoulder again and then vigilantly lowers himself beside me on the bench. \u201cYou said you thought you knew me? Why?\u201d</p><p>I scroll over his green eyes, his full lips, and his knee that is only inches away from mine. It\u2019s unnerving, yet, comforting, which makes absolutely no sense. Half of me is attracted to him, like metal to a magnet, while the other half is repelled by him, like oil and water. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about how you look that seems familiar.\u201d My third lie in the last minute. I\u2019m on a roll.</p><p>\u201cFamiliar how?\u201d he questions with intrigue. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t remember you at all and you don\u2019t look familiar. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d remember you with that weird eye color of yours.\u201d</p><p>Irritated beyond belief, I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. There\u2019s just something about your face... like I saw it in a dream.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicker to my lips and then a condescending look masks his face. \u201cIn your dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, things that you see when you shut your eyes at night,\u201d I say cynically, still infuriated that he\u2019s taken a jab at my eye color.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cI know what dreams are, but what you\u2019re saying sounds an awful lot like a pick up line a guy would use on a girl.\u201d</p><p>I reach for my coffee cup balanced on the bench beside me. \u201cI\u2019m not coming on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re not,\u201d he says smugly. \u201cJust like you weren\u2019t when you felt me up in the doorway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not now and I wasn\u2019t then. I was just...\u201d My temper shoots heat through my body that is almost as intense as the electric feeling. If he keeps it up, I\u2019m probably going to explode and do God knows what. I haven\u2019t yet reached that level of emotion, the kind where you lose control to the point that you do and say things that you regret. \u201cYou just look familiar to me. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you look like a love sick girl. Sorry to break it to you, but you\u2019re not my type so you might as well get it out of your head that anything will ever happen between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am or how I feel, so don\u2019t make assumptions.\u201d</p><p>Discounting me, he gets to his feet and dusts the snow off the back of his jeans as my jaw practically hits the snow on the ground. \u201cSee you in class Jenna.\u201d He struts off across the campus yard with arrogance exuding from him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gemma!\u201d I shout, like it actually matters to him.</p><p>He glances back with a smug smile on his lips and I wonder if he\u2019s intentionally been trying to burrow his way underneath my skin. If so, it\u2019s working. I jump to my feet and trample through the snow back to the car, my skin simmering against the wind. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m more furious about. That he called me a lovesick girl. Or, that he said he isn\u2019t interested.</p><p>The only thing I do know is that I\u2019ve never been this livid in my entire life.</p><p>On Friday, I have a study date with Alex and Aislin in the library so we can put the project together. I\u2019ve seen a lot of them over the last few days. In fact, they seem to pop up everywhere. Aislin is polite and Alex is... well, I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a word for what he is. One minute he\u2019s fine\u2014quiet, in his own little world\u2014and the next he\u2019s making a smartass remark about me; from the color of my eyes, to my lustful fascination with him (his words, not mine). He is one of the most contradictory people I\u2019ve ever met and that is saying a lot since I can barely contain my own, newly present, emotions.</p><p>When I show up to the library, they\u2019re sitting at a table in the far back corner. Alex is messing with a compass and has a contemplative look on his face as he twists the knob on the top. Aislin sits next to him and is engulfed with whatever is on the screen of her phone.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Bakerly.\u201d I wave at the elderly librarian behind the counter. I work part-time at the library, which is a nice job, since I love books, especially science-fiction novels. Give me a story with a witch, vampire, faerie, or anything that isn\u2019t human and I am good to go.</p><p>She pushes her finger against the brim of her nose and nudges her overly large glasses up. Then she raises her hand to reciprocate my wave and looks back to the computer screen.</p><p>I drop down in the seat across from Alex and Aislin and let my bag fall to the floor. The wind has been blowing outside and my cheeks are anesthetized from the cold. I unwind my scarf from my neck and slip off my gloves, aware that Alex is watching me attentively.</p><p>\u201cAm I particularly fascinating today?\u201d I glance up at him with my lips pressed together.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing another long sleeve grey Henley that shows the outline of his muscular arms and his hair is disheveled like it always is. I\u2019ve learned over the last few days that it\u2019s his trademark look and it is a nice one, but I always have the compulsion to run my fingers through it. He sets the gold-plated compass down on the table and for the briefest second it looks like it\u2019s orbed by a golden light, but by the time I blink, it\u2019s gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He folds his arms and leans over with a displeased expression, but amusement dances in his eyes. \u201cNot really. Only that you have a candy wrapper stuck in your hair. How about you? Anything particularly fascinating about me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I comb my fingers through my hair until I find the plastic wrapper. Balling it up, I stuff it into my pocket, and then drape my coat over the back of my chair.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d He smirks. \u201cIn fact, you look a little flushed by my presence.\u201d</p><p>Just keep calm. Keep calm. \u201cThat\u2019s from the cold outside.\u201d I cup my hands onto my iced cheeks to defrost them.</p> <p>\u201cSure it is.\u201d He enjoys this\u2014getting under my skin.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Aislin gasps. \u201cGemma, you\u2019re frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got about halfway here and then had to go back to the car because I forgot my phone,\u201d I explain, rubbing my hands together to thaw them. \u201cI think it\u2019s only like two degrees outside.\u201d</p><p>Alex measures me up with his head cocked to the side. \u201cYou were supposed to be here fifteen minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drive slow when it\u2019s snowing.\u201d I reach inside my pocket to silence an incoming call as my phone begins to ring. \u201cI don\u2019t have four-wheel drive.\u201d</p> <p>He glances over his shoulder at the window where snowflakes flutter down from the clouded sky. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely bad,\u201d I retort, irritated that he\u2019s wiggling his way under my skin again. It\u2019s as if I have no power over my emotions when it comes to him and I\u2019ve only known him for a week. How will things progress the longer I know him? \u201cI could barely see.\u201d</p><p>He scrutinizes me. \u201cThen maybe, you should have stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to have stayed home,\u201d I quip. \u201cIn the warmth, reading a good book, but you guys insisted we had to do this here.\u201d</p><p>His gaze bores into me as he nibbles on his lip. Last night, in my dreams, I\u2019d bitten on that lip several times, along with the blonde stranger\u2019s. \u201cActually, that was Aislin who insisted. I was perfectly content at the idea of everyone working on this on their own and that way we wouldn\u2019t have to see each other.\u201d</p><p>My lungs are twitching to release the scream building up inside them. \u201cAre you always this much of an asshole or do you just save it for me?\u201d</p> <p>He leans over the table more and our lips are so close they almost touch. His breath is hot against my skin and there is a challenge in his green eyes, as if he\u2019s daring me to argue with him. \u201cI save all of it just for you.\u201d</p><p>Aislin snaps her cell phone shut. \u201cOkay, I hate to break up your little moment, but I have to go.\u201d She collects her coat and purse off the back of her chair as she stands up. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency at the... restaurant where I work and I need to go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of emergency?\u201d Alex questions as he slumps back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs and slips her arms through the sleeves of a fur-trimmed coat. She flips her hair out from beneath the collar and hitches the handle of her purse over her shoulder. \u201cI just got a text saying that they need me to come in as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Alex looks unconvinced. \u201cBullshit. You\u2019re bailing so you can go out with that dude you met last week.\u201d</p><p>Aislin points her finger at him. \u201cBe nice while I\u2019m gone. I mean it. And get some stuff done. You\u2019ve been slacking and letting Gemma and I pick up your workload.\u201d She waves at me. \u201cSee you later, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>I give her a small wave as she walks toward the exit, pressing buttons on her phone. Alex and I watch her until she disappears out the doors.</p><p>When he looks at me again, he seems nervous. His posture\u2019s stiff and he keeps fidgeting with his sleeves; pushing them up and then tugging them back down. \u201cSo, I guess it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d I mutter as electricity caresses my skin.</p><p>Silence stacks around us and I begin to fidget. Each tick of the clock, thump of a book being put on the shelf and each whisper only add to the awkwardness.</p><p>Alex begins tapping his pen on the table as if he thinks he\u2019s a drummer. He\u2019s eyeballing the corner of the library where a tall, blond girl, wearing a short skirt is browsing through a row of books. As she bends over to search the bottom shelf, Alex slants his head to the side to get a better view of her ass.</p><p>So that\u2019s his type.</p><p>The longer I contemplate her being Alex\u2019s type, the more infuriated I grow. The cause behind the manifestation of these feelings is unknown, which makes the situation that much more frustrating. Every time he taps that damn pen, the potency of the sparks surges. They no longer feel like soft kisses, but like little bites from a thousand gnats.</p><p>\u201cCan you cut the tapping out?\u201d I ask him, releasing my death grip from the chair. I put my elbows on the desk and press my fingertips to my temples. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting my head.\u201d</p><p>He tears his gaze away from the blond and the corners of his lips quirk. \u201cProbably not. In fact, it\u2019s very important that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I slouch back in my chair and blow out a frustrated breath. \u201cWhy are you such an asshole to me? Did I do something to you that I don\u2019t know about, besides touching you without permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what, then? So I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>I pierce my fingernails into my palms as the prickle jabs at my neck and blots my vision with red. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs as he drags his teeth along the top of the pen and his tongue slips out from his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe story of my life,\u201d I mumble, breathing through the last of my rage. The feeling has passed. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so complicated in your life?\u201d He tosses the pen on the table and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cYou seem like you have it easy, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely know me,\u201d I say. \u201cSo don\u2019t make assumptions about me. For all you know, I could be a recovering crack addict, struggling to keep my sobriety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He doubts.</p><p>I scowl at him. \u201cNo, but the point is that I could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re not.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou know, you could always try to explain the complexity of your life to me, so I don\u2019t have to make assumptions. Maybe it\u2019ll turn out that I\u2019m a really great listener.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m flabbergasted. \u201cYou seriously want to hear about my problems? You want me to pour my heart and soul out to you? Be my best friend?\u201d</p><p>He winces at something I\u2019ve said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why are we even talking about this?\u201d My fingers seek my jacket on the back of the chair and I prepare to make a dramatic exit. \u201cI think that day on the bench you made it pretty clear that you didn\u2019t like me and that you don't want to get to know me.\u201d</p><p>He meticulously watches me for a moment, then his eyes sweep around the room like he\u2019s about to do something wrong. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. I promise I won\u2019t be a jerk anymore.\u201d He checks over his shoulder again and then reduces the volume of his voice until it\u2019s low and husky. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll be really nice to you. And I mean \u2500 really, really nice.\u201d</p><p>I remain calm on the outside, but on the inside, I\u2019m a violent storm of emotions. Some are fueled by rage and others by the sexiness of his Goddamn voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you suddenly going to be nice to me? When all you\u2019ve done is be rude and insult me. What\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I ever insult you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday, in class, you said that my eyes were,\u201d I make air quotes, \u201c\u2018Weird\u2019 and that they throw your concentration off whenever you have to look at them. That was the second time you\u2019ve taken a jab at them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that as a bad thing,\u201d he says with a nonchalant shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re just distracting because they\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet,\u201d I finish with my eyes fastened on him.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was going to go with different.\u201d There\u2019s a tiny indication of a smile on his lips. \u201cBut, violet works. It\u2019s not a bad thing, though. Different is good. It\u2019s normal that\u2019s overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time we met, you let the door slam me in the elbow,\u201d I remind him, lowering my voice as Mrs. Bakerly glares at me from behind the counter. Shit. The last thing I need is to lose my job. I fold my arms on top of the table, lean my weight on them, and incline my body forward. \u201cAnd, you got mad at me because I...\u201d</p><p>The smile that breaks through his face is so radiant that his eyes sparkle under the lights. \u201cBecause you touched me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my tongue in my mouth trying to contain my aggravation. \u201cIt still didn\u2019t mean you had to be rude to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He appears genuinely sincere. \u201cAnd, I\u2019m sorry about that. I was having a rough morning.\u201d</p><p>I evaluate him. Can he feel the electricity, too? Because I sure as hell can. He seems content, calm, and perfectly in control with his shoulders relaxed and his eyes soft. \u201cIt hurt when the door hit my elbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looks around the room again, paying extra attention to the door where a few people are wandering in.</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting someone?\u201d I ask, craning my neck to look around at the door and the shelves. \u201cOr are you looking for an escape route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on if you\u2019re planning to try and attack me again,\u201d he quips, his lips teasing upward. \u201cLike when we first met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t try to attack you,\u201d I protest, narrowing my eyes at him. \u201cI just put my hands on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout permission,\u201d he points out with that damn cocky smirk on his face. \u201cTell me, do you always do that with people you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always let doors slam on people that you don\u2019t know?\u201d It\u2019s like we\u2019re running around in circles, bantering and bickering like an old couple. I need to leave and put a stop to it, but it\u2019s the most interaction I\u2019ve had with another human being and, despite the negativity, I\u2019m kind of enjoying myself.</p><p>\u201cAgain, you touched me without permission,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat did you expect to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, you\u2019re so right.\u201d I hold up my hand, showing him my palm. \u201cYou see this scar right here.\u201d I trace my finger along a faint white scar and let sarcasm drip through my voice. \u201cI put my hand on this guy once and he cut my hand open, but I guess it was okay because I put my hands on him without permission.\u201d A total bullshit lie, but I\u2019m trying to make a point.</p><p>He leans back in his chair, positioning his fist in front of his mouth to conceal a smile. \u201cSounds like the perfect punishment.\u201d He reads through my bullshit lie like an open book.</p><p>I roll my eyes and let my hand fall onto the table. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for touching you. I just... I don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re attracted to me,\u201d he states with overconfidence. \u201cBut, don\u2019t worry, you aren\u2019t the first.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and melodramatically move my hand toward my bag as if what he said is the most absurd thing ever. I decide then that I will leave and prove a point; that despite the fact that he is telling the truth, I don\u2019t have to listen to him.</p><p>Quickly rising from the chair, he reaches over the table and seizes my wrist. Bringing my hand to the table, he traps it there beneath his. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not much of a people person, so sometimes I say things that come off as...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you being an asshole.\u201d I\u2019m angry, irritated, as well as extremely hot and bothered by his touch.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it.\u201d He smiles, but then it fades into a frown. \u201cBut, if you\u2019ll let me, I swear to God, I\u2019ll be nice. In fact, I promise I will.\u201d</p><p>I stare at his hand on my arm and his fingers cup around my wrist. \u201cPeople make empty promises all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never promise anything unless I mean it.\u201d He loosens his grip and shifts the position of his hand so it\u2019s extended over the table. \u201cSo, I\u2019m promising you that I\u2019ll be nice.\u201d</p><p>I mull it over and then put my hand in his, feeling as though I\u2019m betraying my self-worth, but it\u2019s worth it just to get some peace for the rest of my time here. As soon as our skin comes into contact, it\u2019s like my mind has been sucked into a pressurized bottle and my brain torrents with vivid images.</p><p>Alex presses his hand to mine and there is a river of blood streaming down his forearm. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll never let anything happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForever?\u201d I ask, my hand trembling against his as warm blood spills down my arm.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI promise.\u201d He leans over the small box situated between us and the candles burn luminously from inside the dirt cave. \u201cAnd I never promise anything unless I mean it.\u201d</p><p>As I look into his eyes, I only see truth and when he kisses me, pressing his lips to mine, devouring me, tasting me and feeling me with his free hand; I know that he\u2019s all I want.</p><p>I gasp, jerking my hand away as my heart squeezes inside my chest. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>He calmly draws his hand away and rests it on the table. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d I take a deep breath, my pulse frantically pounding against the outpouring of adrenaline in my body. I search his eyes, looking for a sign that he experienced the same thing. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He reaches toward a stack of books on the table. \u201cMaybe we should get to work.\u201d</p><p>What is happening to me? These things... these images... what are they? I press down everything I\u2019m feeling, the perplexity, fear, the longing, and I nod.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you one more question?\u201d he asks as I flick the cap off my pen.</p><p>I nod, distracted by my thoughts. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you really get the scar?\u201d</p><p>I stare down at the thin line running across my palm. \u201cI have no idea... I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem alarmed by my answer, instead, he appears satisfied. He begins highlighting notes with a bright yellow marker and I do the same. Finally, after searching through an entire stack of books and finding nothing, I decide to go look for more in the Astronomy Section and see if I can find anything on Gamma-ray burst. Alex doesn\u2019t ask where I\u2019m going because he\u2019s caught up in flirting with Blondie.</p><p>I\u2019m squatting down searching the slim selection of books on the bottom row, when someone walks up behind me. Electricity gyrates through me and I know its Alex.</p> <p>\u201cFinding anything useful?\u201d Alex asks, flopping down on the floor next to me with his back up against the shelf. \u201cBecause the stack on the table Aislin dug up is practically useless.\u201d</p><p>I slide a book out from the shelf and shake my head. \u201cThe selection here\u2019s crap. We might have to go to the library across town.\u201d I turn around and sit down on the floor. \u201cThey have a better selection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could just bail on the project all together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you even in the class?\u201d I open the book, turn around, and sit down on the floor. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the subject. It\u2019s not even required.\u201d</p><p>His grins. \u201cAn easy A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy,\u201d I assure him as I skim through the chapter titles. \u201cTake this project, which is turning out to be a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you taking the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just love the stars, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s it?\u201d he questions with assumption in his tone.</p><p>I try to stay calm, but the fact that he\u2019s assuming stuff about me makes me uneasy. What if he knows about my weird connection with the stars\u2014how would he know? \u201cNo, that\u2019s it. Just a love for them.\u201d</p><p>His lips part and there's a strange look on his face as he leans in. \u201cI think I need to...\u201d The blond-haired girl comes strutting up the aisle, swinging her hips, and he trails.</p><p>\u201cWell, looks like you have a stalker,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>A smile takes over his face. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>My fingers drift to the back of my neck, which is free from the prickle and any new emotions. \u201cI can one-hundred percent assure you that I\u2019m not jealous.\u201d</p><p>He finds me perplexing as he studies me, but then the blond girl stops in front of us, and all his attention goes to her and her cleavage bursting from her top.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to give you my number,\u201d she says and holds out a torn piece of notebook paper with a number scribbled on it.</p><p>Alex reads it over and the girl waits with her bottom lip in her teeth and her arms crossed. When he doesn\u2019t say anything, she asks, \u201cSo you\u2019re going to call me, right?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes scale up her body to her face. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and then shoots me a dirty look before walking away. When she disappears around the corner of the aisle, Alex balls up the paper and chucks it into the shelves across from us. I give him a funny look and he simply shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just told her you would call.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs again and then absorbs himself in a book. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not glad I just threw that away,\u201d he says without looking up.</p><p>I run my finger down the page, trying to act uninterested, but there\u2019s no use trying to deny it. He laughs softly under his breath and then silence settles between us as we read through pages and pages of book after book. Somehow Alex begins to shift toward me and I don\u2019t notice until there\u2019s only a whisper of air between our bodies. I should ask him to scoot over, but I don\u2019t really want to.</p><p>He scoots over more until his shoulder magnetizes to mine. I freeze as my skin ignites and combusts like a flare, sending my body into a shuddering fit. Alex stiffens, but doesn\u2019t move. I slant my head toward him our eyes locked.</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time there was a princess,\u201d a small boy smiles as he walks through the grass with a little girl. \u201cAnd she was the most beautiful princess in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she smart?\u201d the girl asks, spinning in circles with her hands out to the side.</p><p>\u201cShe was the smartest girl in the world,\u201d the boy says and grabs her hand to stop her from spinning. \u201cAnd the strongest, but she didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>I blink the image of the children away, move back from Alex, and inhale sharply. What is that? And why has it only ever happened with Alex?</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Alex\u2019s eyes examine me over like he\u2019s hunting for broken pieces hidden inside me. \u201cYou look pale.\u201d</p><p>I allow my hair to create a veil between us as my head tips forward. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just have a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I nod, turn the page, and lean to the side to get away from the sweltering heat.</p><p>Alex releases out a slow breath, then tosses the book on the shelf and gets to his feet. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to bail out early.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him. \u201cOkay.\u201d Yes, gorgeous, beautiful guy, bail out. Bail out now. Run away from me before you find out just how crazy I am.</p><p>He starts to walk away, but dithers at the end of the aisle. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He leaves me alone with a stack of books. I sit there reading through them, trying to pretend like I\u2019m fine. That nothing is wrong. That I\u2019m completely normal. But I\u2019m only lying to myself. Things are far from normal\u2014they aren\u2019t even close.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Lofty trees enclose around me. It\u2019s dark. The moon is an orb that makes the mountains look like rolling shadows and the snow is a sheet of crystal. A light radiates brightly in the distance as I hike through the forest, heading deeper into the trees, moving for it, my mind begging me to get closer.</p><p>As I step through the last of the bushes and out into the open, the light glows resolutely, like the stars above my head. I want to touch it\u2013need to touch it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d a deep voice that I know very well rises over my shoulder.</p><p>I turn around to face it. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s resting against a tree with his arms folded and he\u2019s dressed in dark jeans and a long-sleeve, black shirt. The radiance of the moon illuminates his face, making his eyes sparkle. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing out in the middle of the woods at night,\u201d I reply. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t scream trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>An amused smile tugs at his lips as he stands up straight. \u201cI followed you out here.\u201d He walks toward me, narrowing the gap between us. \u201cI thought I told you to wait inside the house.\u201d</p><p>I glance behind me at the light in the center of the snow, which has faded into a weak glimmer. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Right as I say it, the light suffocates out.</p><p>Alex stops inches away from me and the warmth of his breath brushes my chilled cheeks. \u201cGemma, you shouldn\u2019t be wandering around out in the woods by yourself. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He leans in a little as he says it and our lips almost touch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a forest,\u201d I say, breathless, and then joke, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure all the bears are in hibernation.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a soft laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d He places a hand on my upper arm and lets out a sigh. \u201cWe should go back to the house.\u201d</p><p>I move forward and graze my lips across his. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>The connection of our mouths causes a zap of static to erupt and I let out a soft moan. His body tenses, but his warm tongue willingly enters my mouth. He tastes like mint and it melts me on the inside as his hands slip up the sides of my neck to my cheeks and then up to my hair. He pulls at the roots, tipping my head back so he can search my mouth more thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he murmurs against my lips as his hands slide around to my back and he pulls me closer. \u201cSo fucking good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His words make me want to rip his clothes off.

One steps forward, while the others open their mouths. The pale glow of the moon lights up the swirls and lines of their breaths as it fogs and laces around us like smoke. I duck to the ground as a cloud of it heads toward my face and envelops my body. An arctic chill sucks the breath from my lungs as I sink into the snow, no longer in control of my body.</p><p>I\u2019m so cold and I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The last thing I see is Alex\u2019s body sinking lifelessly into the snow, then screeches envelop around me as a blanket of ice encircles my body, crushing my skin into my bones.</p> <p>I\u2019m dying, being smothered by the cold, and Alex is already dead.</p><p>I open my mouth and with every ounce of pain I\u2019m feeling, I force out a scream that cuts through the night like a jagged blade.</p><p>I bolt upright in my bed, screaming at the top of my lungs and clutching at my blanket. Sweat drips from my forehead and trickles down my neck as my heart threatens to leap out of my chest. My gaze zips forward at a barrage of blinking eyes surrounding my room. They\u2019re everywhere, so blinding I can\u2019t tell where they\u2019re coming from. The air is cold and I can feel a breeze engulfing my body.</p><p>I jump up, flailing my arms as I trip toward the door, but by the time I reach it, the yellow eyes are gone. All that\u2019s there is the emptiness of my room and the darkness outside. I hurry over to the window, daring a peek at the parking lot outside. Most of the parking spots are filled and the lights on the carports are on. I can\u2019t see anything; no yellow eyes... no monsters...</p><p>I flip the lights on and press my hand to my heart as I slide to the floor. I feel defeated and alone as I take in my limited surroundings; the single nightstand with a simple lamp and my empty bed where no one else has ever been.</p><p>Empty. It\u2019s the one word that sums up my life.</p> <p>Gripping on to the last of my will, I push myself to my feet. I need to try and get some answers; maybe then things will be a little easier. Heading out to the kitchen, I turn on the coffeemaker and then drop down at the computer desk in the corner of the dining room and open my laptop. I type in \u2018realistic, reoccurring dreams.\u2019 Links about physics pop up.</p><p>Even though it seems crazy, I click on a link and begin to read the article. \u201cReoccurring and very vivid dreams may be the window into future events that are going to happen. Or, some people believe that it may be a surfacing memory that a person has repressed as a coping mechanism.\u201d</p><p>Are my dreams either of these things? Have they happened and I just can\u2019t remember? Or are they going to happen? Sighing, I shut down the computer and get dressed in jeans and a black t-shirt. I pull on a coat, slip on my boots and then pour coffee into a stainless steel mug before heading out the door; feeling exhausted and emotionally drained.</p><p>I\u2019ve been dreaming about the monsters for two months and I\u2019m worn out. I just want a break from the images, and the feelings they manifest. It would be nice to maybe get an explanation, too.</p><p>I feel hung over and it\u2019s my busy day, too; three classes and work. I\u2019m sitting in Astronomy, half-alive with my eyes shut, an elbow propped against the table with my head resting against my palm. I\u2019m just about to fall asleep when someone drops down in the chair beside me. The zap of electricity hits me at almost the same time the person sits and I jump in my seat as my eyes fly open.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d Alex sets his book on top of the desk and smiles. \u201cI thought I\u2019d sit by you today, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>I check over my shoulder, making sure there is no one behind me that he might be talking to. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows dip together as he shoves up the sleeves of his black shirt. \u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p> <p>I sigh, sitting up straighter. \u201cBecause I thought your nice-guy act would be an exclusive, one-time event.\u201d</p><p>He seals his lips together, stifling a laugh. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not. Besides, Aislin isn\u2019t here today and usually I cheat off her, so I thought I\u2019d cheat off you instead.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as a smile slips through. \u201cWhatever. You know the quizzes in this class aren\u2019t multiple choice. There are questions that you have to answer in your own words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just change a few words. No biggie.\u201d He raises his hips to take out his phone from his pocket as it begins ringing with \u201cSave me\u201d by Unwritten Law as the ring tone. He checks the screen and then presses the side button until it shuts off before returning it to his pocket. \u201cSo how\u2019s your day going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I guess.\u201d He\u2019s being normal and it\u2019s weird. Maybe he suffers from a mental illness too, because he is about as bi-polar as I am.</p><p>\u201cYou seem unsure.\u201d He slants his head toward me, grinning. \u201cI thought that was a pretty simple question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I say, unzipping my jacket as the heat amid us intensifies. \u201cI\u2019m just a little out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d</p><p>It becomes quiet and I find myself wishing we\u2019d go back to arguing, just so I don\u2019t have to endure the silence.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t class supposed to start like five minutes ago?\u201d Twisting his wrist, he glances at his watch.</p><p>Kinking my neck, I confirm the time on the wall clock behind me. \u201cYeah, but Professor Sterling is generally fashionably late.\u201d</p><p>Alex stares at the doorway as he deliberates something. \u201cI say, if he\u2019s not here in five minutes, we skip out and go do something else. I need a break anyway. We could go on a short-lived road trip.\u201d</p><p>I start opening my notebook, but pause. \u201cYou want to skip out on class? With me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, his gaze situating on me. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d</p><p>I shrug coolly, but, on the inside, I\u2019m a nervous wreck. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be with me.\u201d</p><p>He looks a little bit guilty. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound so bad. Think about it. You, me, coffee and an endless amount of road.\u201d</p><p>I attempt to read him, but he\u2019s a book full of blank pages. \u201cWhere would we go?\u201d</p><p>He holds my gaze forcefully. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>The possibilities are infinite and my mind begins to conjure up all kinds of ideas. \u201cHow about the beach? I\u2019ve always wondered what the ocean looks like and how the sand would feel between my toes.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his lips together, thoughtfully. \u201cIt feels nice.\u201d A dark smile breaks through. \u201cEspecially, when you\u2019re at a nudist beach and you can be completely naked.\u201d</p><p>Something heats from inside, like I\u2019m beginning to get embarrassed, so I say the only thing I can think of. \u201cYeah, but what happens when sand gets lodged in uncomfortable places.\u201d</p><p>He snorts a laugh and smiles. It\u2019s a real smile, too. One that doesn\u2019t convey heaviness beneath it. \u201cGood point.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSo you\u2019ve really never been to the ocean?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve never left Wyoming. At least, I don\u2019t think I have. I might have when I was a baby and still lived with my parents, before they died, but I...\u201d I realize I\u2019m rambling.</p><p>The guilt in his eyes magnifies. \u201cWhat happened to your parents?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders stiffen as the heaviness of the topic falls against my chest and crushes the oxygen out of me. I can barely breathe\u2014barely think. \u201cThey died in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he looks down at his watch again. \u201cWho did you live with while you were growing up?\u201d</p><p>I reply with as minimal disdain as possible. \u201cMy grandparents.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a hint of compassion on his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t like them?\u201d</p><p>I focus on the front of the classroom, wishing he\u2019d stop talking about the subject because it feels like a knife being plunged into my heart. \u201cNo, they\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>He examines my face with disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I brought it up.\u201d</p><p>I open my book and fan through the pages to distract myself from the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes explore my face, my eyes, my hands; like he\u2019s trying to unravel my thoughts. Eventually, he relaxes and his mouth curves upward into a playful smile. \u201cShould we go?\u201d</p><p>Outside the window is a layer of white snow, covering the grass and parking lot. It looks like a winter-wonderland out of some fairy tale; a kingdom made of ice and snowflakes. \u201cYou seriously want to go on a road trip with me?\u201d</p><p>He verifies it with a nod. \u201cI seriously want to go on a road trip with you.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds inside my chest, enthusiastic and willing. There\u2019s a pause. We turn heads, lock eyes, then start to rise to our feet, but Professor Sterling chooses that moment to come whisking in with a handful of tests.</p><p>Alex\u2019s mouth curves into a lopsided grin. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to take a rain check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Sighing, I lower back into the chair.</p><p>Professor Sterling has a briefcase in his hand, as well as the tests, and he sets everything on the podium in front of the classroom. He looks a little off today; his suit is wrinkled, his face is unshaved and his hair is a little shaggy. He appears grungy as if he\u2019s travelled back through time to the 90\u2019s. He stares at the whiteboard for the longest time, with his arms crossed and his chin propped on his fist. When he turns around, his eyes scan the classroom. It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s even looking at us; more like he\u2019s looking through us, as if we are nothing more than transparent statues.</p><p>\u201cToday, I\u2019m going to tell you a little story.\u201d He walks up to the board and picks up a marker. The tip squeaks as he draws several lines across the board and then puts the cap on, before returning the marker to its place on the tray. \u201cAbout a fallen star.\u201d</p><p>I exchange a glance with Alex and he smiles, elevating his eyebrows. \u201cI think someone\u2019s had a little bit too much to drink today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he drinks,\u201d I say, staring at the picture on the board. It\u2019s drawn in blue with lines that shoot out from the end of a very sloppily drawn star.</p><p>Alex leans over the desk toward me. \u201cTrust me; he does. I smelt it on his breath one day.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but pick up my pen and take notes anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Professor Sterling paces the front of the classroom with his hands behind his back. \u201cThere\u2019s a legend that a very long time ago a meteorite fell from the sky and landed up in the mountains that surround this valley.\u201d</p><p>People in the classroom glance around at one another and an eerie calm sets in, as if we all agree that he\u2019s snapped. I\u2019m going to give him the benefit of the doubt, however, since I know what it is like to potentially be crazy. Plus, there is something about what he\u2019s saying that strikes a nerve and a vibration of a memory whispers a story I can\u2019t remember the words to.</p><p>He strolls behind the podium and I swear his gaze loiters on me as he takes in everyone. He picks up a marker and climbs up in the stool behind the podium. \u201cAlthough, some believe that it wasn\u2019t a meteorite, but an actual fallen star.\u201d</p><p>A hand shoots up in the air and Professor Sterling points the marker at the culprit; a straggly built guy that has very bad acne. \u201cYes, Philman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Philip,\u201d the guy corrects and slouches forward as he flips the page of his notebook. \u201cAnd if a star actually hit earth, we\u2019d all be dead,\u201d</p><p>Professor Sterling shakes his head as he hops off the stool. \u201cNot if it was a piece of a star. Sometimes, when stars get spinning beyond their normal acceleration speed, pieces break off. Some may be large while others are as tiny as my finger.\u201d He strolls up to the board and scribbles jagged lines across the star, making it look like it\u2019s broken.</p><p>\u201cBut, if it hit, wouldn\u2019t we all know about it?\u201d a girl from the front row calls out as she fans through the pages of her textbook.</p><p>He readdresses his attention back to the class, facing us as he throws the marker onto his desk. \u201cNot if someone hid it before it was discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who would do that?\u201d the girl responds and picks up her pen to take notes.</p> <p>The grin on Professor Sterling\u2019s face is haunting and sends a chill up my spine. \u201cSomeone who wanted a lot of power.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m engrossed in the irrationality of the story. Fallen stars. Power hungry people. It\u2019s the making of an interesting novel.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, he\u2019s high, too.\u201d The feel of Alex\u2019s breath steals my focus.</p><p>I look away from Professor Sterling to Alex and am stunned by how close he is. \u201cI think he\u2019s just telling a legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He smiles as he reaches over and tucks a strand of my hair behind my ear. He slides his finger down my cheekbone and jawline before moving it away. There\u2019s a slight tremble to his hand, but he plays it off with a cocky smile. \u201cOr maybe, he\u2019s just high or drunk.\u201d</p><p>Touch me again. Please touch me again. I\u2019ve never been touched like that before, except in my own imagination. I\u2019m hypnotized. Petrified. Controlled. I can\u2019t look away from him, even when he reclines back in his chair and concentrates on the front of the classroom while chewing on the end of his pen. I forget about paying attention. I forget about everything for a moment.</p> <p>We don\u2019t talk for the rest of class, but halfway through Professor Sterling\u2019s lecture, Alex moves his leg toward me, inching it closer until his knee is resting against mine. The contact is mind-blowing, amazing, and mystifying. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s done it on purpose or if he is just getting comfortable. Either way, I\u2019m glad.</p><p>I\u2019m glad about a lot of things at that moment.</p><p>Alex leaves in a hurry when class is over, barely uttering two words to me. I try not to take it personally since the guy is more up and down than I am, but it does bother me. How he\u2019d been acting during class was great and fun and I\u2019ve wanted both of those things in my life for a while. He takes those things with him the moment he exits the door, though.</p><p>I head around the back of the school where my car is parked. I usually park out front, but it was overly crowded today. The snow is coming down hard and I can barely make out the outline of the cars. With my chin tucked down and my hood pulled over my head, I fight my way to where I guess my car is parked.</p><p>As I near the back row of the parking lot, I\u2019m overtaken with the strangest feeling that someone is following me. I shift my bag up my arm, telling myself I\u2019m overreacting, but then I hear a whisper. It\u2019s feeble at first; however, it grows noisier and more coherent.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d A hand grabs my arm and I\u2019m basked in the warmest rays of sunshine that have ever touched the earth. It\u2019s magical and makes me feel powerful.</p><p>As a warm sensation sails across my skin, my legs give out and I crumple to the ground, hitting the ice hard. As I shoot upright, I don\u2019t feel pain, but I\u2019m off-balance. With my hands out to the side of me, I squint through the flurry of snow. In the distance, there\u2019s a figure; lofty, with wide-ranging shoulders. It looks an awful lot like the figure I\u2019ve seen in the alleyway near the front entrance; the one with the glowing yellow eyes. Shit.</p><p>I move to run, but a thick fog swims out from behind a car and heads toward me. It\u2019s tinged black, like ashy smoke, and it gyrates around me, starting at my feet and working its way to my head. It mixes with the snow that floats up from the ground. I can\u2019t see a damn thing, except for the eyes moving toward me.</p> <p>It can\u2019t be real. Things like this only exist in dreams, but, as the temperature plummets, and my skin turns a gruesome shade of blue, I make a decision.</p><p>It\u2019s time to run like hell.</p><p>I drop my bag and whirl around, preparing to run, but I slam into something rock solid. I swiftly back up with my hands out in front of me and panting for air. Through the fog, Alex surfaces, and relief washes over me. He puts his fingers up to his lips, urging me to be quiet as he takes my hand. There\u2019s no spark of electricity from the contact this time, and I feel hollow. It feels strange and unnatural, but as he pulls me to the left, I run with him, trusting him completely.</p><p>As we near the cars, I glance over my shoulder and search for the monster. The fog has divided and I have a clear view of it. It\u2019s more terrifying to look at in real-life. It is excessively tall with rotting skin and purple and black veins. There are bits and pieces of flesh missing, revealing bones and muscles. A black cloak drapes down its body to the icy ground. The fog that conceals the parking lot is streaming from out of its mouth and it makes a hollow noise with each breath. It\u2019s terrifying and the fear sears the image of it into my mind like a tattoo I\u2019ll never be able to get rid of.</p><p>Alex jerks me around a car and we hunker down behind its side. Fog dances around us and the wintry air is like needles to my skin. I begin to shiver and chatter uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to find us,\u201d I say through chattering teeth as I turn to face him.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond and he looks a little out of it.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d I whisper, waving my hand in front of his face. \u201cWe should run. Those things... They... they\u2019ll kill us both.\u201d</p><p>He seems unaffected, stoic and immobile. I wave my hand in front of his face again, but he doesn\u2019t blink. What the hell is wrong with him?</p><p>I\u2019m about to pinch him to snap him out of his trance when a deafening shriek cripples the air. I jump to my feet as the monster steps out from in front of the car. I spin toward Alex to shout at him to run, but he isn\u2019t there. I reel back around, but the monster has vanished, too. It\u2019s all gone; the fear, the need to get away. Everything transfers back into place; the fog lifts and my body warms up.</p><p>There\u2019s a swishing sound and then I\u2019m being pulled back. I\u2019m no longer standing, but lying alone in the middle of the parking lot; my face pressed against the ice, and my cheekbone feels swollen and bruised. I sit up and cup my cheek. There isn\u2019t a single speck of fog in sight, no monsters, no Alex. Everything is just as it should be.</p><p>Except for my head.</p><p>It\u2019s like I zoned off in the middle of the day while I was walking and fell down. I\u2019m pretty certain that I\u2019m going to have a bruise. Letting out a massive breath of air, I search between the cars in the parking lot and behind a nearby tree, just to make sure. All seems right in the world. My skin has turned to its normal shade of pale and the memories of what just happened are already drifting away.</p><p>How many damn times is this going to happen to me? Maybe it\u2019s time to see someone and get my head checked out.</p><p>I scoop up my bag, dust off the snow and watch the cars back out of their parking spaces. I\u2019m losing it. I\u2019m really going crazy. Either that, or someone is seriously messing with my head.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>For the next couple of days, Alex doesn\u2019t show up to class and I don\u2019t see him in the halls. I try not to think about it too much, but it\u2019s all my mind goes to. While I wait it out, my nightmares become cleverer. The scenery starts altering to darker places, like cemeteries and gothic clubs. One even takes place in a yard full of bones. The sequence of events never changes, though. I\u2019ll be with Alex, or sometimes with the blond stranger, and BAM, the monsters will show up, we\u2019ll suffer and ultimately die.</p><p>For a faltering instant, I consider telling Marco and Sophia about what is going on\u2014trying to seek help\u2014but then, I realize that will only add to my insanity. So I keep my mouth shut, letting my nightmares haunt me, own me, consume my nights and leave me wishing for a friend or someone I can talk to about them.</p><p>I\u2019m working in the library this morning. It\u2019s a quiet day and I find myself missing the busy work of putting books away and checking books in and out to distract me from my thoughts of monsters, heavy make out sessions and the realization that I might be lonely for the rest of my life. As I place a worn book onto the top row of a shelf with my feet propped on the bottom and my arm stretched as far as it will go, I hear someone move up beside me.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d Alex is leaning against the shelf with his hands in his pockets. He has on a black-fitted t-shirt again, a pair of faded jeans, black boots and there are flakes of snow in his brown hair. He looks like he\u2019s trying to be relaxed, but can\u2019t quite get there; his posture\u2019s a little stiff. \u201cYou look like you do.\u201d</p><p>Every emotion I\u2019ve ever felt crashes through me and throws off my equilibrium, like I\u2019ve been tossed onto a tilt-a-whirl driven by crack. \u201cI\u2019m good, but thanks.\u201d My shoe clips the corner of a cart as I retreat back and I almost fall on my ass.</p><p>Alex\u2019s fingers press roughly into my hips as he grabs ahold of me and stops me from falling. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to notice that you have a knack for falling, especially when you\u2019re around me.\u201d</p><p>I back away from him, my entire body searing from his touch. \u201cThat\u2019s a clever observation, but I\u2019m always this way.\u201d</p><p>He presses his hand to his heart, feigning offense. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not just me?\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh escapes my mouth that sounds a lot like a dying goat. \u201cNope, sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pause, analyzing how I should approach my much needed question. \u201cHey, this is going to sound weird, but you didn\u2019t happen to... um... by chance were you out back a few days ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut back? Of the campus?\u201d he asks and I nod. \u201cNah, I\u2019ve never been out there. Why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel my already crumbling world break into even more pieces. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.

I\u2019m in shock, embarrassed and completely enthralled by the sound of the words coming out of his mouth. I need to say something, to break the unnerving silence that has overtaken us, but all I can do is stand there and gawk at him. He starts to squirm more and more the longer the silence goes on and his smile dissipates. Finally, I bail and start up the aisle, pushing the cart along with me, concentrating on the squeaking of the wheels to deflect my concentration from him and to give him an out to run like hell from weirdo girl.</p><p>I catch a flash of yellow from my peripheral vision, but this has been happening intermittently since my delusion with the monster in the parking lot and the light always fades when I turn my head. So I ignore it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually glad I ran into you.\u201d Alex comes up behind me again, scaring me half to death and making me drop the book I\u2019m holding. He quickly scoops it up and gives it back to me. \u201cI was supposed to be coming by to see if you could meet up at my house later tonight.\u201d</p><p>I take the book from his hand. My voice comes out sharp as I ask, \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>He snorts a laugh. \u201cRelax, I don\u2019t bite or anything. I just wanted to know if you can because Aislin wants to finish up the project tonight. In fact, I think her head is going to explode if we don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I slide the book on the shelf, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone for a few days.\u201d</p><p>A lazy grin creeps up on his face. \u201cYou noticed.\u201d</p><p>I scale up his rock-solid body and I detect a squirm on his part, which secretly pleases me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to notice when you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>His smile expands. \u201cAre you coming on to me?\u201d He moves his arm so it\u2019s on the shelf beside my head and his voice drops to a deep whisper as he leans toward me. \u201cBecause if you are, I\u2019m going to have to warn you that you shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s dangerous\u2014I\u2019m dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I arch my eyebrows as I put a book on the shelf without taking my eyes off him. \u201cNow, that sounds like a come-on line.\u201d</p><p>He bites at his lip as his smile practically takes over his face and he widens the space between us by stepping back. \u201cWhat do you say? Can you come over later to work on the project?\u201d</p> <p>I stretch my arm behind my back, feeling around for a book on the cart. \u201cYeah, that works for me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound disappointed,\u201d he muses with a grin. \u201cIs it because of the project or because you\u2019d be around me?\u201d</p><p>I pick up a book and read the number on the binding, pretending to be indifferent even though I have a rabble of butterflies in my stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s neither. I\u2019m just tired today. I haven\u2019t been sleeping very well.\u201d I put the book on the shelf and turn around, only to notice that he\u2019s diminished the space between us again.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He slants forward and places a hand on the shelf, so the crook of his arm is beside my head.</p><p>\u201cBad dreams,\u201d I say and sigh when he frowns. \u201cI sound like a little kid, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo, but what are the dreams about?\u201d</p><p>Monsters. Death. You and your sexiness. \u201cJust stuff... things... You know what, it\u2019s not important. They\u2019re just dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would help to talk about it. Holding stuff in only makes things harder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you, like a psych major or something?\u201d I joke.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNo, I\u2019m undecided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat year are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA senior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little late to be undecided,\u201d I say, wondering if he\u2019s lying. I retrieve another book off the cart, astonished that he can detour me from my worries. He\u2019s made me feel better and normal; my thoughts less heavy. That is all I want from life; a clear head and direction. \u201cDon\u2019t people generally declare majors around their sophomore year?\u201d</p><p>He edges to the side as a guy ambles up the aisle, whistling an off-key tune. \u201cWhat are you majoring in?\u201d</p><p>I scoot the book into its correct place on the shelf. \u201cGeneral Studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that about the same as undecided?\u201d he accuses and captures my gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying I can\u2019t make up my mind, so I\u2019ll just have a vague major to get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d I mumble, deflated. He\u2019s struck a touchy subject. My future. My indecision. The fact that I never can envision myself doing anything.</p><p>His gaze flicks to my lips and he inhales slowly. \u201cIf you ever need to talk, you can come to me.\u201d</p><p>I eye him over. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs serious as I was when I said we should skip out on Astronomy and go for a road trip.\u201d A leisurely smile unfolds across his face and he sticks out his hand. \u201cHere, give me your phone.\u201d</p><p>Confused beyond belief, I take my phone out of my pocket and give it to him. He swipes his finger across the screen to unlock it, pushes some buttons and then hands it back to me, brushing his finger along the inside of my wrist. Even though it\u2019s probably accidental, my heart and mind connect in a lively dance that nearly sends my knees buckling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Gemma.\u201d He winks at me before he reels on his heels and vanishes around the corner. I feel a tug inside my chest and for a second it feels like he\u2019s ripped my heart out and taken it with him. I feel disconnected as I read the notes section of my phone:</p><p>24432 Monarch Road Apt 34</p><p>Meet Aislin and me there at 9:00 pm tonight so we can finish the project.</p><p>I put my phone back into my pocket and begin putting books on the shelf, letting the puzzlement, anticipation, and sheer loathing entwine inside me, like a tethered knot, until they form one single coherent emotion.</p><p>Numbness.</p><p>I remain numb the rest of the day; oblivious to anything except my work task. If someone approaches me with a question, I answer with as few words as possible. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve died or traveled back in time to when I was unemotional and withdrawn; my body still moving, but my soul and spirit disconnected from each other.</p><p>The feeling lingers during the entire drive to Alex\u2019s place, which is in a nice area where all the buildings have a similar, newly-built look to them. His apartment is located at the farthest corner building, on the upper floor. It\u2019s snowing hard and by the time he opens the door, my hands and lips are numb, like my heart.</p><p>Except suddenly, it isn\u2019t.</p><p>The sight of him launches my body into a fit and a massive volume of emotions surge through me, toward my heart, like they are racing. I\u2019m just not sure which one will get there first: anger, passion, sadness...</p><p>Lust.</p><p>Alex has a serious case of bed-head, but it looks so sexy and touchable. He also doesn\u2019t have a shirt on and his jeans hang low on his hips. His flawless skin is stretched over his solid, tight muscles and a black circle, trimmed by a golden ring of flames, is tattooed on his ribcage. As he raises his arms to brace his hands on the doorway, my gaze skims lower, my breath clouding out in front of my face.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to come in?\u201d he asks, pleased that I\u2019m ogling him. \u201cOr, just stand there and enjoy the view.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God, oh hell almighty. I\u2019ve never experienced mortification, but I\u2019m verging toward it at this moment; not quite there, but close. \u201cI wasn\u2019t enjoying the view,\u201d I lie and not very well.</p><p>He rolls his eyes, then moves back and I walk inside, stomping snow off my boots before I step onto the carpet. He shuts the door behind me, picks up a plaid shirt off the back of the sofa, slips his arms through the sleeves and does up the buttons; covering up those wonderful abs of his. \u201cAislin\u2019s not here yet.\u201d</p><p>I nod, glancing around at the bare white walls, the empty counters in the kitchen and the two chairs that surround the small, square table in the corner. There are boxes near the back of the room, a coffee table in the center, and a hallway leading to somewhere. That\u2019s it. His house is about as vacant as my old bedroom, which is sad.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you moved in?\u201d I ask, feeling the awkwardness filtering the air.</p><p>He shrugs as he heads for the refrigerator in the kitchen. \u201cA few weeks ago or so.\u201d</p><p>I unzip my jacket and wander around gawking at the labels on the boxes: dishes, bedroom stuff. \u201cWeapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hobby.\u201d</p><p>A hobby for what? \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting hobby... why haven\u2019t you unpacked yet?\u201d</p><p>He takes two cans of soda out of the fridge and kicks the door shut. \u201cI\u2019m used to living out of boxes.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the living room, he offers me a soda as I aim a questioning look at him. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>He sits down on the couch as he flicks the tab of the can. \u201cWhen I was younger, my dad moved us around a lot, so it became easier to keep things packed. It\u2019s part of life now, I guess. Honestly, I\u2019d have no idea what to do with stuff all over the house.\u201d</p><p>I nod as I tap my finger at the tab, internally cringing at the silence that settles in. \u201cWhen\u2019s Aislin going to be here?\u201d</p><p>He kicks his bare feet up on the table. \u201cHer boss made her work late. She called me about thirty minutes ago and said she was going to be like an hour late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I take a sip of my soda, unable to think of a single word to say to him, but I\u2019ve never been much of a conversational wizard, only on rare occasions.</p><p>\u201cYou can sit down.\u201d He pats the spot next to him on the couch. \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>What if I want him to bite me? I blink the thought away, set my leather jacket on the back of the kitchen chair and join him on the sofa. The electricity scorches my skin, dispersing through my body and blood roars in my ears. I press the ice-cold soda can to my forehead, feeling like I\u2019m on the verge of passing out.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d Alex tips his head back and takes a sip of his drink with his eyes on me the entire time. He moves the can away from his lips and observes me with curiosity. \u201cI have some Tylenol in the cupboard.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it your nightmares? Are they keeping you up at night?\u201d There\u2019s laughter in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYou know I really wish I wouldn\u2019t have told you that.\u201d I grimace and swallow a large mouthful of soda.</p><p>He sets his can down on the table. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019m just trying to get you to smile. You don\u2019t do that a lot.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, flipping the tab until it snaps off. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that at twenty-one years old, people shouldn\u2019t have nightmares? It seems like I should be passed that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shakes his head, takes the broken tab from my hand and discards it on the table. \u201cNah, nightmares and dreams last forever. It\u2019s part of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cDo you have them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave nightmares?\u201d he asks with a quirk of his lips. \u201cNot really, but I\u2019m completely dead inside so nothing scares me.\u201d</p><p>I analyze his expression. It\u2019s one of passivity and gives no detection on whether or not he is joking.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious,\u201d he says with a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve been forever, hence the reason why I\u2019m a douche bag and rarely feel bad.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s the most perplexing person I\u2019ve ever met, besides myself. \u201cYou\u2019re not being a douche right now. In fact, you haven\u2019t been much of one the last few times I\u2019ve been around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, give me some time. It takes me a while to warm up.\u201d He is unreadable; there\u2019s an indifferent expression on his face, his mouth sits in a straight line, his eyes give nothing away. \u201cI have this theory.\u201d He changes the subject as he scoots to the side, relocating closer to me on the couch. \u201cAbout you.\u201d</p><p>I force down the massive lump in my throat. \u201cWhat kind of theory? Or do I not want to know?\u201d</p><p>The cocky gleam revisits his eyes and he stretches his arm along the back of the chair so it lies beside my head. \u201cThe kind where I think you\u2019re extremely innocent.\u201d</p> <p>That is the last thing I expected to come out of his mouth. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell these things,\u201d he says as his fingers tangle through my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>And Mr. Sexy Douche Bag returns. I withdraw my head away from his hand as the jolt of electricity webs my thoughts. \u201cJust because you think something doesn\u2019t mean you have to say it out loud.\u201d</p><p>He grins haughtily and reaches for my hair again. \u201cThe simple fact that you can\u2019t even deny it, tells me I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d I start to get to my feet, but his fingers spread over my thigh and he forces me down, kind of roughly.</p><p>He rotates to the side on his hip and his body conforms over me. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you mad.\u201d He kneads my thigh with his fingertips, causing an effervescent feeling to coil up between my thighs. I cross my legs to suppress a shudder as my head hits the armrest of the sofa. \u201cOnly to get to know you a little better.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m conflicted between slapping his hand away and letting his fingers sneak up my leg further. \u201cYou said you warm up.\u201d I can\u2019t take my eyes off his hand on my leg.</p><p>His eyebrows knit and his hand stops traveling upward. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo being a douche.\u201d I smack his hand off my leg, even though it nearly kills me. Then I place my hands on his chest, noting the racing of his heart, and push him away from me so I can sit up. \u201cBut there was no warming up. You went from hot to cold in about two seconds.\u201d</p><p>He looks down at his hand as he flexes his fingers, appearing befuddled. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re nothing like what I expected.\u201d He elevates his chin and meets my eyes. \u201cThe first time I saw you, I expected you to be quiet and less... feisty.\u201d</p><p>Was that a compliment? My lips part to question, but his phone starts playing \u201cMad World\u201d by Evergreen Terrace and my words drift off as he answers it, gets to his feet and heads down the hallway. I grab my coat, slip my arms through the sleeves, and zip it up. It\u2019s definitely time to go. Assignment or not, it\u2019s not a good thing to be here. He drives me crazy, in both really bad and really good ways, and it is emotionally unhealthy.</p><p>As I open the door, a below-zero breeze carries into the house, blustering snowflakes across the floor and against my cheeks. There\u2019s a snowstorm blowing in as usual. Tucking my lips underneath the collar of my coat, I start to step out.</p><p>\u201cGemma, wait,\u201d Alex calls out. I pause with one foot over the threshold, waiting for... something. \u201cI want you to go somewhere with me.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head toward him and lower the collar away from my face. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s slipped a pair of boots on, but the laces are still undone. \u201cI\u2019ll knock it off. You just get me all riled up for some reason.\u201d He lowers himself onto the edge of the coffee table and kicks his boot up on his knee to tie up the laces. \u201cBut I promise I\u2019ll be Mr. Nice Guy the entire time.\u201d He pauses, setting his foot back down on the ground and amusement sparkles in his eyes. \u201cI cross my heart and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>An image presses up at the back of my mind and pops in my head like a burnt out light bulb.</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die,\u201d someone whispers.</p><p>A little girl with long brown hair spins circles in a field with her arms out. \u201cStick a needle in your eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick a needle in both eyes,\u201d the voice answers with laughter.</p><p>I flinch and then for no reason whatsoever say, \u201cStick a needle in your eye?\u201d</p><p>I half expect him to return my question with the same response as in the memory, but all he does is stand up and nod. He grabs his coat off a hook in the wall and then moves past me, steps outside and gestures at me to follow.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aislin?\u201d I ask as he locks up the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually going to meet us at the place.\u201d He puts the house key in his pocket, turns for the stairway, and zips up his jacket as snowflakes stick to his brown hair. \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be getting any of our project done.\u201d</p><p>I trot down the stairs after him, holding onto the railing. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He reaches the bottom of the stairway, dusts the snow out of his hair, and glances over his shoulder at me. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to a party.\u201d</p><p>I slam to a stop, slip on a patch of ice, and smack my elbow on the railing as I try to catch myself. Alex\u2019s hands snap out and his fingers enfold around my waist, saving me from a very painful fall. The sparks attempt to fire up against my skin, but the air is freezing and the sensation is muffled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very accident prone.\u201d He releases me and tugs his hood over his head. \u201cYou need to relax. It\u2019s just a party and we\u2019re not even going there to join in. We just need to pick something up.\u201d</p><p>I follow him down the sidewalk, hiding my hands in my sleeves to keep them warm. \u201cThen, why are you bringing me with you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs as he swerves to the left and heads toward the carport. \u201cI find you entertaining to be around. You say things normal people wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d I frown and he shakes his head, smiling, as he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing so stop pouting.\u201d</p><p>It almost sounds like a compliment. Stunned, I shove all my reservations aside and follow him, drawn by an impulse that I have no control over, as if I\u2019m a puppet. Or a lovesick girl. Either one isn\u2019t that flattering.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Alex drives a 1969 cherry-red Camaro with black leather on the inside. It\u2019s the sexiest car I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on and I\u2019m not even a car person. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit, but it kind of turns me on a little or maybe it\u2019s him driving the car that is getting my insides throbbing. That way sounds a lot better.</p><p>He drives fast, which is extremely dangerous for how icy the roads are, but, for some unknown reason, I trust him; somehow I know that he\u2019ll never let anything hurt me. I keep my seatbelt buckled, though, listening to the engine purr as I watch the curves of the road.</p><p>It\u2019s getting late, the sky is black, the snow is thick, and the headlights light up the way. The inside of the car smells like cologne and there is a hint of a lilac sent. I realize there are pressed flowers hanging from the rearview mirror. I reach up and spin them around, glancing over the browned edges and the crisp stems.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t picture you as a flower person,\u201d I tease, releasing the flowers and rotating in the seat to face him, drawing my knee up with me.</p><p>He has one hand resting comfortably on top of the steering wheel and the other is on the shifter. \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d He flashes me a grin as he slows down for a very sharp corner. \u201cSomeone gave them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl someone?\u201d I request casually as I shuffle through his playlist on the iPod.</p><p>He nods and I feel my heart sink in my chest, ram against the inside of my stomach, and rile up the motion of my blood. \u201cYeah, she gave them to me quite a while ago.\u201d</p><p>I feel like an idiot. This whole time I\u2019ve been drooling over him and I never bothered to ask if he has a girlfriend. \u201cOh, sorry. It doesn\u2019t seem so bad then. To have them, I mean; especially if she means something to you.\u201d</p><p>He twists the string, securing the flowers to the mirror, his eyes glazing over as if he\u2019s floating back into a memory. \u201cI should probably take them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did you break up with the girl?\u201d Could I be any more obvious?</p><p>He releases a breath trapped in his chest and wraps his fingers around the shifter. \u201dNo, she died; quite a while ago.\u201d</p><p>Me and my excessive questions. Dammit. The sorrow in his eyes makes me feel like an asshole. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wouldn\u2019t have brought it up if I\u2014\u201d</p><p>As his fingers brush just above my kneecap, the sound of my voice withers. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was a long time ago and I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound like it. In fact, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen any real, raw emotion from him. He looks lost, ripped apart from the inside, broken, beaten and guilty. I wonder what happened to this girl, but I don\u2019t dare press any more than I already have. His hand leaves my leg and I decide to end the conversation, before I say anything else stupid.</p><p>The party is in a cabin that\u2019s located in the middle of the mountains. The car gets stuck in the snow three times during the drive up as the road becomes packed with more snow, narrowing the roads. It\u2019s pitch black by the time we park in front of the cabin; the sky is so gloomy there isn\u2019t a single speckle of starlight.</p><p>The red interior lights of the cabin highlight the shoveled pathway that leads to the front porch and the red glow makes the snow look like it\u2019s soaked with blood. There is music blasting from the inside that has an entrancing, sexy beat and the deep bass rattles the windows. There are people making out on the steps, the mixing of their breath swirling in the cold air as their hands wander and grope at each other. What am I about to walk into? An orgy?</p><p>Alex turns the headlights off, removes the keys from the ignition, then opens the car door and steps outside. He tucks the keys into his pocket and lowers his head to peer in at me. \u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I glance warily at the porch and then at the trees beside it, recollecting my dream. \u201cWhat kind of party is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind where you have to take off your clothes just to get in,\u201d he says and my expression falls. He shakes his head, grinning. \u201cRelax, Gemma. It\u2019s just a party. I promise you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Another promise. I climb out of the car and meet him around the front. Walking side-by-side, we head up the pathway to the house. None of the people kissing and feeling each other up notice us as we pass by them and step into the warmth of the house. I begin to take a breath, when the smell of smoke, alcohol and sweat consumes my nostrils. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The place is crammed with people taking shots and sipping beers.

Some of the things they\u2019re doing are making my cheeks heat with excessive blood flow.</p><p>My body tenses as Alex\u2019s breath touches my ear and his hand grazes the small of my back. \u201cRelax, I promised you\u2019d be okay and I never break a promise. Remember?\u201d</p><p>My shoulder jolts upward from the nearness of him as I nod. \u201cI\u2019d be a little bit more comfortable if I knew why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He leans over my shoulder and I tilt my head to the side to meet his eyes. My depth perception is off and I almost end up kissing him. \u201cI just have to pick something up.\u201d He threads his fingers through mine and pulls me toward the crowd.</p> <p>I can\u2019t stop staring at our interlocked fingers, even as stray elbows and shoulders slam into my ribs and sides. No one\u2019s ever held my hand. Ever. In fact, I\u2019ve never even been hugged, that I know of.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink anything offered to you,\u201d Alex calls out over the music as a woman dressed in a short black dress whisks by us with a tray of green Jell-O shots.</p><p>Nodding, I coordinate with his steps, staying as close to him as possible. As we approach a hallway my gaze falls on a woman dancing by herself in the corner. She has a margarita glass in her hand and is spilling her drink everywhere as she shimmies her hips to the music. As her head tips back, her hair moves and each strand forms a head. It looks like she has snakes in her hair; like she\u2019s Medusa. My eyes widen as one of the snakes hisses in my direction and I gasp. Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Alex\u2019s voice rises over my thoughts as he squeezes my hand.</p><p>I blink and her hair doesn't look like snakes anymore, but long, black locks of hair. I divert my concentration to Alex.</p> <p>He\u2019s watching me inquisitively. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, suddenly aware that nothing can help me escape the hallucinations, nightmares and daydreams. They\u2019re going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Or until I finally go off the deep end and get locked up.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes are locked on me as he backs the rest of the way to the hallway, leading me along with him and, again, I feel safe. I walk with him, step-by-step, maneuvering through the people effortlessly, and I\u2019m temporarily put into a state of euphoria. He doesn\u2019t look away until we reach the end and he opens a door, pulling me inside after him before shutting the door. It\u2019s quiet. And mellow. And normal.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are they smoking out there?\u201d I inquire as I examine the small room. There is a queen-size bed, covered with a black comforter, and the walls are red just like the lighting flowing from the ceiling and everywhere else in the house.</p><p>Alex starts opening the drawers of one of the dressers and digging through them. \u201cWho knows? Maybe Peyote.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s being serious or not. \u201cI thought I saw something weird.\u201d</p> <p>His chin tips up and there\u2019s an inquisitive look on his face. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and my hands fall to my side and I sit down on the bed. The springs creak below my weight. \u201cA woman with snakes for hair.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a soft laugh as he shuts the drawer. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as you don\u2019t see anyone with fangs, we\u2019re fine. Or a guy with a snake tattoo on his neck. If you see someone with that, then we\u2019d need to run.\u201d</p><p>Did he inhale some of the peyote? \u201cUm... what?\u201d</p><p>He winks at me and dimples appear as he smiles. \u201cRelax, he\u2019s not supposed to be here, even though it\u2019s his house.\u201d He shucks off his coat before he places his hand on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen if he was here?\u201d I wonder as he runs his fingers along the wall.</p><p>Drawing his elbow back, he raises his fist beside his head. \u201cThen, he\u2019d probably try to kill me.\u201d With one swift swing, he hammers his hand through the wall. Sheetrock crumbles, breaking off and falling to the floor as I jump to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I hiss. \u201cYou just punched a hole into someone\u2019s wall!\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his hand and dusts bits of debris off his knuckles. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>I kick a large chunk of wall out of the way and step up beside him. \u201cBut, what about snake tattoo guy?\u201d</p><p>Standing on his toes, he snakes his arm into the hole. \u201cI already told you he isn\u2019t supposed to be here. Besides, he may try to kill me, but it doesn\u2019t mean he can.\u201d He draws his arm back and there\u2019s something silver clutched in his hands.</p><p>I move forward and lean over to get a better look. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He quickly stuffs it into his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and step back. \u201cYou drag me up to a party where people are smoking peyote and there\u2019s a guy that may want to kill you. You punch a hole in the wall and take out something, but I shouldn\u2019t worry about it?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me musingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t drag you out here. You came of your own freewill.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to argue, but he\u2019s right. \u201cFine, you\u2019re right. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>His gaze never wavers from me. \u201cDo you want to go? Or do you want to stay here a little longer... with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Why can\u2019t I answer that question?</p><p>His eyes flicker to the bed and then settle back on me. The starvation in his eyes both pulls me and pushes me away. I\u2019m afraid, yet curious of what will happen and where the night will take me if I dare to do something out of the norm. \u201cWe could hang out here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about snake tattoo guy?\u201d My voice squeaks and I clear my throat. \u201cWhat if he shows up and tries to kick your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, he can try,\u201d he says with a grin and reduces the already limited space between us. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean he can.\u201d</p><p>The defensive wall I\u2019ve built around myself slowly crumbles. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows arch in surprise. \u201cOkay? You want to stay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, I want to stay.\u201d</p><p>Again, he glances at that damn bed. What is he thinking? I sure as hell know what I\u2019m thinking and it requires a lot of time on that bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get us something to drink.\u201d He speaks slowly as he steps back. \u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said not to drink anything offered to me?\u201d</p><p>His lips quirk as he opens the door. \u201cThat excludes me.\u201d Before I can respond, he walks out and shuts the door.</p><p>I collapse on the bed, letting out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019ve been holding. What am I doing here with a guy I barely know? I have a feeling the night is only going to result in trouble, yet, I don\u2019t seem to give a shit.</p><p>I roll on my back and stare up at the cracks in the ceiling. I start counting each one as my nerves begin to short-circuit through my blood, taking each limb over and ultimately my heart. The prickle stabs at the back of my neck and I feel out of control and helpless, then I feel nothing. A numbing sensation takes me over and my body starts to sink into the mattress. Immobility consumes each nerve. I\u2019m paralyzed and as the images form in front of my face, all I can do is watch as my spirit detaches from my body. I float away into the ceiling and, seconds later, darkness immerses me.</p><p>When my feet touch the ground again, I\u2019m standing in the middle of a field. The night sky is covered with stars and there are crickets chirping from the grass. The air smells like lilacs and the warm breeze caresses my cheeks. A feeling of peace has overtaken me and I stroll through the grass with no direct destination.</p><p>If I had one wish in my life, I\u2019d wish that I could stay and feel this way forever. Content and weightless with no worry or sorrow of the past. No confusion about life or how I feel. It\u2019s right then that I realize just how lonely and discontent I am. How empty I feel even though I\u2019m a bundle of emotions. I\u2019ve never lived, never loved, never done anything.</p><p>Moments later the feeling is stolen away with a gust of wind. I turn around and the tall grass hisses at my legs. In the distance of the land, two figures surface. One is tall and the other is very short. They are holding hands and step slowly as if they are savoring the moments of their journey.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d the tall figure says. It\u2019s one of the loveliest voices I've ever heard from a woman; not too high or too low. She wears a dress and her long hair dances in the wind. I wonder what she looks like, but as she gets closer, I realize her face is obscured and distorted with a haze.</p><p>The shorter figure\u2019s face is also distorted, but I see that she has a skip to her walk, like she is happy to be here. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, honey,\u201d replies the woman, swaying her arms and giving the little girl a swing. \u201cAnd you should be. There is a lot to be excited about right now.\u201d</p><p>I watch them with fascination. Who are they? Deep down it feels like I know the answer, but my mind can\u2019t quite connect it together, like it\u2019s missing a piece of the puzzle.</p><p>I remain motionless in the field as they near me. I start to lift my hand to wave at them when they get close enough, but they walk by me as if I\u2019m nonexistent, as if I\u2019m a ghost. Maybe I\u2019ve died back on the bed in the cabin and this is the afterlife?</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I call out, trailing after them.</p><p>Neither of them flinches nor makes any move that tells me they heard me as they continue on with their conversation. I speed up and chase after them. They stop beside a large oak tree that stretches to the dark sky. The moonlight glimmers across their faces and the only details I can make out about them are that they have long hair and fair complexions.</p><p>\u201cHere we go. This spot is perfect.\u201d The woman raises her hand to the sky and points at the stars. \u201cSee that one right there?\u201d</p><p>The little girl\u2019s head tilts up. \u201cYeah, I see it, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s yours,\u201d the mother tells her. \u201cThat spot right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to you,\u201d the mother continues, sadness filling her voice. I wonder if my own mother ever talked to me like this when I was a baby. Did she love me? Did she want to make me happy? I only had a year with her and I can\u2019t remember a single aspect or detail, nothing.</p><p>\u201cFor forever?\u201d the girl asks, spinning in a circle with her arms out and her head tipped back as she basks in the moment.</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies sadly and picks up the girl.</p><p>The girl throws her arms around her mother and they hug each other as if nothing else in the world matters. It\u2019s a feeling I will never understand. I shut my eyes, no longer able to bear something I wish I had, but know I never will. I may be able to feel now, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can travel through the past and have moments like these with my mother. I know this. Somehow I know that my life will be short, that I\u2019ll be very lonely, and that when it all ends, I\u2019ll only have myself.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>When I open my eyes, I\u2019m lying on my back on the bed at the cabin, no longer staring at the ceiling, but at Alex\u2019s worried face above me. My arms rest lifelessly out to my side and, for a moment, I can\u2019t move. When Alex places his hand on my cheek, the connection launches a zap to my heart and brings my body back to life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gasp for air as my lungs expand and I urgently reach for my eyes to wipe away the tears that are streaming down my cheeks. Alex leans back, giving me room. My body aches in objection as I sit up, blinking my burning eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him, but I can feel him watching me. \u201cI think I should go home,\u201d I say, smearing away the last of my tears onto the sleeve of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d He leans forward and tips his head, moving into my line of vision. His eyes scan my face. \u201cYou\u2019re really crying.\u201d</p><p>I swing my legs off the bed, attempting to stand, but my muscles are taut and I fall right back down. \u201cPeople cry all the time. It\u2019s part of life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but usually people cry when they\u2019re upset or when something horrible happens to them.\u201d His eyes roam to the window and he stares at the silhouettes of the trees. \u201cDid something horrible or sad happen to you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but it feels like I\u2019m lying as vague memories press at my mind. Even though I\u2019ve never been able to feel it until now, my life hasn\u2019t been a walk in the park. I basically raised myself since I could walk, cooking dinner for myself by the age of six when I could read the instructions to the microwave dinners. I walked myself to the bus stop in the below zero weather. I sat in my room countless times, staring at the wall and wondering what I was supposed to do with myself because everything felt pointless. There isn\u2019t a single picture of me because no one has ever wanted one enough to take it. I\u2019m told all the time that I\u2019m not wanted. Is all this considered horrible?</p><p>He smoothes my hair out of my eyes, tensing as our skin comes into contact. \u201cYou blacked out. It took me forever to wake you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie and try to get to my feet again, but my legs give out again and I collapse back onto the bed, giving up.</p><p>His tense expression alleviates and his voice is soft, begging. \u201cGemma, there\u2019s obviously something bothering you, so just tell me what it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called life.\u201d I meet his eyes. \u201cNow, would you please take me home? I feel sick.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cYou were fine when I left the room. What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>I was fine when he left, and then I wasn\u2019t. Just like when I was working at the library. Then he showed up and then left, leaving me numb. A realization clicks inside my head: what if it is him that is making me feel this way, or the absence of him anyway? \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>His expression shifts as he looks at me like I\u2019m crazy, making me feel small and insignificant. \u201cI\u2019m Alex.\u201d He speaks to me like I\u2019m a moron.</p><p>I kneel up on the bed, trying to gain some confidence against his overbearing gaze. \u201cI know what your name is, but what I\u2019m wondering is, who you are as a person?\u201d</p><p>His eyes never leave me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like a game to him. A fucking mind game. \u201cBecause ever since I met you, things in my life have gotten a little... weird.\u201d</p><p>He chews on his lip, unflustered. \u201cWeird how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, let\u2019s just go.\u201d I start to get up, but his fingers snag my elbow and he yanks me back down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere until you tell me why you were crying.\u201d He rolls on his hip, forces me on my back, and traps me beneath him.</p><p>Longing swells through my body and I bite my lip hard to suppress a moan. \u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he transfers his weight so that my legs are confined underneath him and our bodies touch strategically, chest-to-chest, leg-to-leg. \u201cFight all you want, you can\u2019t do anything about it. I\u2019m the one in control here.\u201d He pauses as I scowl and our chests brush as we breathe in sync. \u201cNow, please, will you just calm down and tell me why you\u2019re flipping out? I thought I was doing well with the whole douche bag thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were.\u201d I swallow hard from the feel of his breath stroking against my cheeks and the way my nipples brush against his chest every time I take a breath. I\u2019ve never been this physically close to anyone and my mind is racing with anxiety, anger and a craving to touch him everywhere. It\u2019s too much. I\u2019m going into an emotional overload and it feels like I\u2019m going to combust. I try to wiggle my arms between us, but he seizes my arms and lures them above my head.</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d I need help, but I\u2019m shit-out-of-luck. The music is so loud and it even muffles the noise in the room. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>He forces my arms together and holds them in one of his very large hands. \u201cNot until you tell me why you\u2019re flipping out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause physical contact freaks me out,\u201d I lie, arching my body into his in a lame attempt to force him off me.</p><p>He moves his body upward out of my reach, but still keeps a hand on my arms. \u201cI can tell when you\u2019re lying by the way you\u2019re biting your lip.\u201d He lets his weight descend back toward me. \u201cJust like I can tell when you\u2019re pissed off by the way your jaw tenses.\u201d His body is back on me and I lay immobile beneath him as he continues with his voice softer. \u201cJust like I can tell when I\u2019m embarrassing you because your cheeks turn pink.\u201d His face lowers towards mine and I notice for the first time that he has a faint scar just below his eye. His breath is hot against my ear and neck; my eyes uncontrollably shut as he whispers, \u201cOr how I can tell when you\u2019re getting turned on by the way you get distracted and how your body shudders.\u201d</p><p>The insinuation of his words encloses around me and my body shudders, just like he\u2019s accused. Something snaps inside me. I break. Splinter apart. Pieces are now missing. I raise my head and surprise him as I touch my lips against his. I push past the forceful amount of electricity slashing through me and instead of kissing him, I suck his bottom lip into my mouth.</p><p>Then I bite down hard.</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure what the point is. Whether I\u2019m pissed off or so turned on that I\u2019ve lost the capability to rationalize my actions. I rest my head back on the mattress and wait for him to hop off and call me a freak.</p><p>Instead, he stares at me as his tongue slips out from his mouth and wets his lips. \u201cFuck, you drew blood.\u201d</p><p>Before I can even begin to be embarrassed, he lets out a deep growl and seconds later his lips come down on mine. Holy fucking hell. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. It\u2019s all gone; the worry, the sadness, the emptiness. I can barely breathe as his tongue slips inside my mouth and entangles with mine. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, but I go with it and allow his tongue to search my mouth. My skin feels like it\u2019s melting, but in a good way. As I lift my hips up, pressing our bodies together, the heat spirals out of control. I want to be closer\u2014need to be closer\u2014but it doesn\u2019t seem possible, since he\u2019s lying on top of me.</p><p>His hand is still holding my arms and he tightens his grip as his other hand slides down my body to my hip. He digs his fingers into my skin as he moves his legs so that mine are free. Seconds later, I have them fastened in a vice-grip around his waist. His body tenses and his breath catches in his throat. Drawing away, he looks into my eyes and I think he\u2019s going to say something insulting, but then he lets out another low growl that sends vibrations all over my skin and he crushes his lips into mine again. The innocent kiss suddenly turns reckless as his hand slips underneath my shirt and he cups my breast. I\u2019ve never felt this kind of ecstasy before. It\u2019s intoxicating. Overwhelming. Complete. I finally understand what the big deal is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this for forever,\u201d he murmurs, which doesn\u2019t make much sense.</p><p>But I don\u2019t really care at the moment</p><p>I writhe my hips up against him, feeling his hardness between my legs. My head becomes foggier as he kisses and feels me all over. I want to rip his shirt off, feel his skin and feel the passion, the spark, the connection. As every ounce of my self-control withers, I wiggle my hands out of his. Maneuvering them between us, I begin to fumble with the buttons of his shirt. When I reach the last one, he catches my hand and stops me.</p><p>He removes his lips from mine, props up on his arm and peers down at me. His lips are swollen and his eyes are glazed over like he barely understands what is going on. \u201cWe should slow down,\u201d he pants, looking conflicted.</p><p>I instantly frown. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Looking torn, he glances down at my hand trapped in his and then back at me. \u201cBecause we should.\u201d He loosens his grip and frees my hand. Like a magnet, my fingers move for the last button and I flick it undone.</p><p>As my fingers graze his stomach, his lips seal against mine. His tongue urges my mouth apart and when it enters mine, the warmth nearly swallows me. Pressing my hands flat onto his stomach, I feel the rhythm of his breathing, the rise and fall of his chest, the warmth of his skin.</p><p>I begin writhing my hips against his again, letting go as he moves his lips away from my mouth and start trailing kissing down my neck. Each one is soft, but full of desire. I want more\u2014need more. I\u2019m confused by my thoughts and what my body wants. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been starving for years, nearly dying of hunger, and his kisses are finally satisfying the ever-growing starvation.</p><p>As he approaches my collarbone and takes a nip at my skin, I delve my fingers into his shoulder blades. With one last buck of my hips, something explodes inside me and, for a second, I\u2019m free from the world I\u2019ve never felt I belonged in. There is no pain, no loneliness, no fear. Everything I\u2019m feeling at the moment is real.</p><p>Apparently, the light bulb above our heads has the same idea. It flickers and then glass shatters everywhere. I wince as sharp, hot fragments of glass land on my skin.</p><p>I freeze. Alex freezes. Time seems to freeze. Alex shifts his weight and the next thing I know he\u2019s climbing off me, leaving me in the dark surrounded by hot glass that is sharper than the mortification I feel at the moment.</p><p>He flips a lamp on, but I don\u2019t dare look at him as I sit up, plucking the pieces of glass off me. He walks around in front of me and begins picking glass out of my hair without saying a word. The silence says more than words ever could.</p><p>\u201cSo that was...\u201d He drops a piece of glass onto the floor and then runs his hand down his arm, brushing some off his sleeve. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>I angle my neck back to look up at him. His hair is a mess, his lips puffy, and he looks perplexed. And lost. And, well, a little horrified. I feel suddenly ashamed. I\u2019ve never felt like this before and I don\u2019t quite understand it.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably go.\u201d His eyes travel above my head to the ceiling.</p><p>I tip my head back, tracking his gaze to the broken light fixture that is making a low buzzing noise. \u201cHow do you think it happened?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, flicking a piece of glass off his sleeve. \u201cFaulty wiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that stuff cause light bulbs to explode?\u201d</p><p>He avoids looking at me and his tone is clipped. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not an electrician.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath as I stand up. Running my hand down the front of my jeans, I clear the remaining glass off and then depart for the door. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m overwhelmed. Baffled. There are thoughts in my head that need resolution, but I don\u2019t know how to seek it. Tears pool in the corners of my eyes as I hurry for the door and out into the crowded hall. There are even more people littering the room than when we arrived and even more smoke filtering the air. I hold my breath and tuck in my elbows as I begin to squeeze through the sweaty bodies that smell like salt and alcohol.</p><p>Fingers wrap around my upper arm and I\u2019m jerked back as a current of heat charges through my body. Alex guides me back toward the mellower end of the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says it so softly that I\u2019m not sure I heard it correctly.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cSorry for what?\u201d The list of reasons is endless.</p> <p>Releasing my arm, he rakes his hand through his messy hair, making it stick up more than it usually does. \u201cI just... I don\u2019t know. Panicking, I guess. But I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you.\u201d It\u2019s physically paining him to say it. His hand falls to his side and he hesitates. \u201cBut, that can\u2019t happen again. We have to... we have to be friends. Just friends.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like a copout line. I cross my arms, trying to protect myself from the feelings of humiliation eating away at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know we were that.\u201d</p><p>He huffs out a breath as his head falls back. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make this difficult, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I expand my hands out to the side of me, nearly hitting a woman as she whisks by. \u201dI\u2019m not doing anything, except being honest. I don\u2019t know you. You don\u2019t know me, at least, not very well.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head back up and there is a frown puckering at his brow. \u201cBut, I do.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head, fighting to stay composed. \u201cHow come\u2014\u201d The music switches to an upbeat rhythm that pounds through the speakers and asphyxiates my tone. People start going wild, banging their heads and gyrating their bodies against each other. I inch closer to Alex, even though the heat and the disgusted look on his face is ripping my heart into a thousand pieces of nothingness. \u201cHow come you\u2019re fine one second and then suddenly, completely offish? I don\u2019t get you. At all. And it\u2019s like you do it on purpose. Like you...\u201d I trail off as he stares at me, biting at his lip, seeming amused. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he grins. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d There\u2019s a pause and he stares at my mouth. \u201cI just realized that I\u2019m going to have my hands full.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what it is; the stifling heat or the wounding of my pride, but I suddenly lift my hand to hit him. He starts to smile, but then all humor leaves his face as his gaze dashes over my shoulder. He quickly grabs my arm and tugs me down the hall toward the bedroom door. Pressing his hands to my back, he shoves me forward. I trip over my feet and land on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d I sit up as he slams the door and spins around.</p><p>He puts his finger to his lips, shushing me, then he races over to the window. Peering outside, he reaches into his pocket and draws out a small pocketknife. He flips the blade open and turns to me with the sharp end aimed at my heart.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you stole out of the wall?\u201d I inch away from him with my hands out in front of me.</p> <p>He glances at the knife, then lowers it to his side and shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d His boots thud against the floor as he paces with his fists clenched. \u201cRemember that snake-tattoo guy I was telling you about? Well, he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes on the knife in his hand. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d He spins toward the window and flings it open. A nippy breeze howls at my ears and snowflakes encircle around me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to climb out the window.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to jump out the window and into the snowy forest. I\u2019ve hated the forest ever since my dream. I\u2019m already too close now. Shaking my head, I kneel up and back away across the bed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just walk out the door and meet you at the car? He\u2019s not after me?\u201d</p><p>He turns to me and there\u2019s a cautious look in his eyes. \u201cWell actually he kind of is.\u201d</p><p>I climb off the bed and stand up on the other side to maintain some distance between us. \u201cHow am I a part of this?\u201d</p><p>He sticks out his hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter right now. You need to come with me\u2014we need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I arch my eyebrows at his hand. \u201cNot until you tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Letting out a frustrated sigh, he rounds the bed in quick, determined strides, so I have little time to react. Before I know it, he\u2019s right in front of me. \u201cThat\u2019s a really long story that I don\u2019t have time to explain at the moment.\u201d He laces his fingers through mine and hauls me toward the open window. \u201cI just need to get you out of here. I should never have brought you here.\u201d</p><p>I remove my hand from his and glance out the window at the forest that stretches aimlessly into the night. \u201cThen why did you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze interlocks with mine. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to stay away from you for some Goddamn, annoying reason.\u201d</p><p>Uncertain how to react, I seal my lips and climb up onto the windowsill. Swinging my leg out, I glance back at him. \u201cYou\u2019re coming, too, right?\u201d</p><p>He nods, but his gaze darts to the door as it swings open. I catch a glimpse of yellow that flickers as a cape flaps and then I\u2019m being shoved out the window. Luckily, we are on the first floor, and the fall is short. I land in the snow bank and sink into it. Falling onto my hands and knees, I dig my nails into the snow and claw my way forward, dragging my legs out of the snow bank. Rolling onto my back, I stare up at the window I\u2019ve just fallen out of. It is freezing and dark, and there are shadows moving all over inside the house. I can see two figures in the room, fighting against each other, swinging their fists and there\u2019s a lot of loud banging. I push to my feet and back away, undecided. Should I run? Or wait? As I turn toward the car, I hear a soft thud and I spin around. Alex has jumped out the window and is running for me. Within a beat, he\u2019s grabbing my hand and then we are running like hell around the house. His skin is cold and his body blurs against the darkness. I struggle to keep up, my legs stretching to their maximum length. I\u2019m moving so quickly that I run into him as he stops and it\u2019s like colliding with a wall made of ice.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I stagger to the right as he begins to move again, detouring around a fence and then heading toward the trees. My legs fight to keep up with him as he picks up the pace. I can barely see anything; the sharp features of his face and the solid outline of his body blends with the dark. \u201cWe\u2019re seriously not going in there, are we?\u201d</p><p>As we reach a small opening where the trees break apart from one another, he stops and glances from left to right. Then he releases my hand and turns in a circle, looking lost as he takes in the trees. His hair is crisped with frost and the way he moves his legs, without quite bending his knees is strange.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I breathe and the cold stings my lungs. \u201cDid you get injured? You look like you\u2019re walking funny.\u201d</p><p>He remains silent as he hikes toward the trees, crossing his legs with each step. He no longer has the knife in his hand and there\u2019s something off about him\u2014he is too quiet.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d I hiss and chase after him, keeping my head low to the ground because the branches of the trees clip my head. \u201cWhat are we running from?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me from over his shoulder and the moonlight reflects in his eyes. His pupils look hollow as if every last speck of emotion has been emptied. He smiles and it\u2019s like looking at a ghost. Something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>I shuffle backwards with my hands poised out to the side. The ground is slippery and snow keeps falling from the branches of the trees and down the collar of my coat. Alex doesn\u2019t utter a word to me, he only observes me. The recollection of a memory runs over me like a truck and my knees almost give out. I\u2019ve dreamt about this place before. I was in the trees, it was dark, and the moon was bright. I brace a hand against a tree and squint through the dark. Through the darkness, a dim flicker of light surfaces. I want to run, but my legs are bound to the ground by my fear.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d I demand. \u201cAnd who are you really?\u201d</p><p>He folds his arms across his chest and stares at me, unresponsive. His stare is weighted and overpowering. My body longs to be near him, but the rage inside my head keeps me put.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d I shout and the sound echoes for miles and snow shivers from the bare branches of the trees. My body shakes from the wrath inside me. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going to happen? Is that why you brought me out here? Because you want it to happen?!\u201d</p><p>Again he\u2019s silent, like a mummy with their lips stitched shut. The shadows of the branches cast across his face and the wind howls around us. I pry my hand away from the tree and force my feet to move. I know what is going to happen and I need to get out of here, with or without him. In a slow, lethargic movement, I rotate around and drag my feet through the deep snow. The sky is a sheet of black and my bearings are mixed up from the cold that possesses my limbs. I\u2019m lost. I glance over my shoulder and Alex is gone. He has bailed on me; left me out here in the dark. I\u2019m not sure if that is a good thing or a frightening one.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I curse as I circle around a tree, hunching over as I try to track my footsteps back to the cabin. The light glimmers in the distance, beckoning me to come closer and I keep winding around the trees, trying to get back to the cabin, but all that seems to happen is I grow nearer to the light. It is getting colder and the moonlight is fading behind the clouds.</p><p>I halt at the sight of lofty shadows emerging from the trees. They\u2019re just a hallucination, like in the parking lot. It has to be. However, as the figures surfaces move closer, the fear that races through my body and rams into my gut and chest is very real.</p><p>\u201cGemma, what are you doing out here?\u201d Alex winds around the last of the trees and steps out into the open. The remaining stream of moonlight casts across his face and his eyes look normal again, not empty. There are scratches on his face, his jacket is torn, and his hair is disheveled. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you run to the car?\u201d</p><p>My gaze drifts to the knife in his hand. There\u2019s blood on his knuckles and on the blade. \u201cYou took me out here.\u201d</p><p>He stops a distance away and his eyebrows dip together. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He\u2019s close enough now that I can see a thin river of blood streaming down his wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding?\u201d I dare a step closer to him.</p><p>His shoulder moves forward and he examines the blood pouring out of his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live, but we have to get you out of here.\u201d He offers me his uninjured hand, but I don\u2019t take it. \u201cWould you just come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I look over my shoulder, noting that the light in the distance has vanished. \u201cI can\u2019t... I don\u2019t...\u201d Confusion is overwhelming me. I want to run to where the light disappeared. I want to run away from Alex. I want to run away with Alex. I have no idea what to do. I\u2019m pretty sure I am the most confused human being that has ever lived. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGemma!\u201d Alex\u2019s angry voice cuts through the night like a knife to flesh.</p><p>Goosebumps dot my skin and my heart thrashes against my chest. I can feel my ribs about to crack, unable to endure such a heavy emotion. I back away, the snow crunching below my shoes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d The voice is softer and more soothing than Alex\u2019s, yet when I turn around it is Alex standing behind me. Only he isn\u2019t injured and he doesn\u2019t have a knife. His skin looks paler, like the snow and his eyes like coals. My eyes glide back and forth. There is an Alex on each side of me, both waiting for me to take their hand.</p><p>The inevitable has finally come. I\u2019ve snapped, fallen off the cliff called reality and submerged into the darkness where imaginary things walk, talk and are real to me, but no one else. It seems like everything is moving in slow motion and I\u2019m linked to each aspect that surrounds me; the expanding of the icicles as the temperature descends, the sounds of branches snapping, the inhale and exhale of Alex\u2019s breath.</p> <p>\u201cGemma.\u201d The injured Alex takes a cautious step forward. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to it. It\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>I whip my head back and forth between them. \u201cListen to it? It\u2019s you. I don\u2019t...\u201d I tug my hands through my hair and yank out the roots as I try to sort through what\u2019s happening. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy.\u201d His feet move gradually and carry him closer to me, while the other just stands there. \u201cThat thing is... well, it\u2019s a mirage, kind of like a trick of the eye. It doesn\u2019t really exist. I promise.\u201d With each step, he leaves a trail of blood in the snow, which makes him seem realer than the other. He bleeds, has veins and a pumping heart. I know because I can suddenly hear it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to it.\u201d The mirage-in-question purrs. \u201cYou need to come with me.\u201d His voice sounds controlled and his face flickers, fading in and out. Shock waves through me and I stumble backward away from him. He isn\u2019t real. He\u2019s a ghost, unruffled and transparent. \u201cDon\u2019t run. If you do, you\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps in the other direction and I do the exact opposite. I run like hell toward the injured Alex. Before I know it my hand is in his and we are running away from the mirage.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201d A branch snags my cheek and splits open my skin. I cup it as warm blood pools out of my skin.</p><p>He shakes his head, the blood from his arm dripping onto me, the liquid warm against my skin. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later...\u201d His words are sucked away by the sound of the wind.</p><p>As the heaviness of the cold presses down on my body, I realize I know what\u2019s going to happen because I\u2019ve dreamt about it only days ago.</p><p>The ground begins to quake as tall figures march through the trees. Their eyes glow across the snow and icicles begin to crisp the trees that surround us. Fog snakes through the trunks, coiling and spiraling, heading in our direction. Alex speeds up, moving at a pace I\u2019m not capable of keeping.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d I choke against the cold as my feet slip out from under me. His hand glides up my arm and he helps me get my balance before I fall. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He practically lifts me up and carries me, my feet leaving the ground. Moments later, we break out from the trees and into the yard of the cabin. My feet touch the ground again and I\u2019m moving on my own. The car isn\u2019t too far off and Aislin stands beside the driver\u2019s side, bundled up in a coat and hat, her arms crossed and her eyes narrowed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d She moves away from the car and stomps toward us, tightening the scarf around her neck. \u201cBringing her up here.\u201d</p><p>Alex sprints toward her with me in tow as the people on the porch of the cabin watch us. \u201cNow\u2019s not the time for lectures.\u201d Alex doesn\u2019t slow down, nearly running over her, and she has to jump out of his way.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d She rushes after us with worry written all over her face.</p><p>Alex slams to a halt when we reach his car. \u201cGemma\u2019s seeing mirages.\u201d</p><p>Aislin\u2019s head whips in my direction. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>Before I can respond, Alex interrupts, \u201cAnd they\u2019ve found her.\u201d He pats his pockets and then takes out his keys.</p><p>The color drains from Aislin\u2019s face and beneath the cast of the porch light, her skin looks green. \u201cThe Death Walkers? How?\u201d</p><p>My insides weave into knots like they are made of thorns that want to tear at my insides. \u201cDeath Walkers?\u201d</p> <p>Alex swings his car door open, dives in over the console and reaches toward the glove compartment. \u201cYeah, big, tall creatures that look like the walking dead.\u201d He takes something out, slams the console shut, and jumps out of the car.</p><p>My heart stills as his words echo in my head. I glance at the trees, the people on the porch, and then back at Alex. \u201cAnd have glowing eyes?\u201d</p><p>Alex and Aislin freeze and they look at me as if I\u2019m nuts. Maybe I am. Perhaps this is another dream and I\u2019m going to wake up at any moment. \u201cHow do you... never mind. You can explain later.\u201d He turns to Aislin. \u201cYou gotta transport us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransport?\u201d I ask at the same time Aislin says, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s fingers close around my upper arm and his eyes stay on Aislin. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no way in hell we\u2019re going to out run them.\u201d</p><p>I lurch my shoulder forward, trying to wiggle my arm free from his grip, but his fingertips dig deeper into the fabric of my coat. \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Someone better start explaining or I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, you\u2019ll what?\u201d Alex waits with a condescending look on his face.</p><p>Furious, I lift my knee and move my foot toward his shin. He dodges out of my way and then drags me around to the passenger side. Aislin chases after us as she retrieves a purple object from her pocket. \u201cI only have the amethyst with me. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s powerful enough to take all three of us anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it work.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice is piercing as he yanks open the door. \u201cWe need to...\u201d His eyes widen as they zone in on the trees behind us.</p><p>I track his gaze and every last hope for my sanity evaporates. Frost webs along the fence that encloses the cabin and moves in contours and patterns across the ground toward our feet. The frozen air intoxicates my lungs and bites my skin. A screech rattles the air and hundreds of yellow eyes flash through the forest. I can hear Alex and Aislin talking... something about getting out of here and transporting again, but I can\u2019t focus on anything but the glowing eyes. The other Alex is standing out in the middle with them, as if he\u2019s on their side.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out there?\u201d I ask as Alex steers me by the shoulders toward the open door. Aislin has climbed into the backseat from the driver\u2019s side and has a crystal and a black candle on the center console. He gently pushes my head down with his hand and shoves me into the front seat. I fall in and bang my head on the roof as he slams the door shut. I sit up as he hurries around the car, climbs into the car and slams the door.</p><p>He hammers his fist against the lock on the door. \u201cLock your door,\u201d he commands and I obey without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cA mirage.\u201d Aislin leans over the console and stares out the window at the Alex marching with the cloaked monsters. He looks almost the same, but not quite solid. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s one, then that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means we need to get the hell out of here,\u201d Alex cuts her off as he slips the keys into the ignition. He turns it and pumps the gas pedal. \u201cSo get your spell going.\u201d</p><p>Aislin kneels up on the back seat with the black candle in front of her and a chunk of amethyst in her hand. She flicks the lighter, lights the wick, and begins to mutter incoherently underneath her breath. What is she doing? Black Magic?</p><p>\u201cI have to get out of here,\u201d I sputter as the engine revs up and then dies. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The monsters are getting closer. The ground is trembling against their steps; the trees and house shudder. Screams from inside flow to the outside as ice rushes across the ground and swallows the house. The people inside ram their bodies against the ice chunk that had once been their home. They\u2019re trapped.</p><p>\u201cWe have to help them,\u201d I mutter in horror as their bodies are crushed and blood splatters the ice. It\u2019s like watching a horror movie, only it\u2019s real and it chokes at my throat. My lungs... they don\u2019t want to work anymore. \u201cOh my God... we have to... we have to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Alex ignores me and punches his fist against the steering wheel when the car refuses to start. There\u2019s still blood flowing from his arm, but it has slowed to a trickle. \u201cGod dammit, Aislin, get us the hell out of here. The cold has frozen the fucking engine.\u201d</p><p>The windows frost over and I can\u2019t see the house. Fog swirls through the vents of the heater and fills up the car. The temperature bottoming below freezing. I can\u2019t feel my fingers or my lips. As the monsters near the car, I panic. I know how this will end if I don\u2019t get away. They\u2019ll kill me. I\u2019ve seen it every night for the last few months.</p><p>I reach for the handle of the door, but Alex grabs my elbow. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Now, move.\u201d I wrench my arm and scoot closer to the door, but his strength overpowers me and he hauls me back by the arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I have to get away from them... They\u2019ll\u2014I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Alex lugs me over the console and just about knocks the candle over. I kick my legs and twist my midsection, trying to get away from his grip, but his fingers delve into my hips. He picks me up as if I weigh nothing and sets me on his lap so I\u2019m straddling him. \u201cIf you get out of this car you\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I stay in this car, they\u2019ll kill me!\u201d I clamp my hands down on his shoulders and push back until my back presses against the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen a thousand times. And they\u2019re going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Shock masks his face. \u201cYou know what those things are?\u201d</p><p>I crook to the side and try to duck under his arm, but he lowers it, barricading me in. \u201cThis is not the first time I\u2019ve seen them... And would you please let me go. I\u2019m not going to sit around in the Goddamn car and wait for them to come and freeze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a Goddamn death wish or something?\u201d he breathes fiercely in my ear as his arms snake around my waist. \u201cDo yourself a favor. Shut the hell up and listen to me.\u201d</p><p>I raise my arm to slap him across the face, but he grabs my hand and clasps it in his own. \u201cPlease, let me go.\u201d I\u2019m starting to cry and I don\u2019t understand why. Yes, I\u2019m scared and cold, but there\u2019s also something else there I can\u2019t quite decipher; almost like I\u2019m suddenly aware that I\u2019m about to lose any future I have. That it will all end and the possibilities I haven\u2019t yet gotten to experience will forever remain unknown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The temperature continues to plummet as layers of ice build over the car and the roof begins to concave under the pressure. Cloaked creatures are everywhere, their eyes flickering as aggressively as the flame of the candle. Their capes flap in the wind and create a canopy over the car. The temperature drops beyond cold. Death is in the air.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I breathe, shaking my hand, which has tinted purple. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>Alex encloses his hands around mine and brings them an instant relief from the cold. \u201cTry to relax, okay? Aislin will have us out of here in just a second.\u201d There\u2019s sincerity in his eyes which I\u2019ve never seen before and the electricity connects me to him, forcing me to submit to him.</p><p>Aislin is doing some kind of voodoo witch thing with the candle and the amethyst and it\u2019s creating a cloud of violet smoke. The smoke slips into my lungs and burns like a fatal toxin.</p> <p>I cough and my head falls into Alex\u2019s shoulder \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d I whisper, clutching onto his arms.</p><p>\u201cJust stay calm,\u201d Alex lulls as his hand runs up and down my back. Sedation takes over my mind and I slip into a state of exhaustion caused from the chill that has tugged my body close to a state of hypothermia. Or maybe I\u2019m dying. Death. It seems right, like all the pieces of a puzzle have finally been connected. \u201cI promise everything will be okay. Just trust me.\u201d</p><p>And I do, because at the moment he\u2019s all I have. So despite the fact that I\u2019ve seen two of him and that he keeps talking about mirages, Death Walkers and transporting, I close my eyes and fall against him as my body is rendered motionless by the cold.</p><p>The car gives an abrupt jerk to the side as one of the creatures charges into it. Fog swarms beneath the crevasses of the doors and windows and ice glazes my skin and stings my lungs. I want to sleep. Forever. Yeah, that doesn\u2019t sound so bad.</p><p>\u201cStay awake.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice sounds so far away. I crack my eyes open and he hugs me against his chest and kisses my forehead. The gesture brings warmth, but is rapidly erased as the car rocks again \u201cAislin, hurry up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPer is calx ego lux lucis via,\u201d Aislin whispers from the backseat. The fire lights up against her face and her amplified eyes.</p><p>The ice that has built around the car begins to fracture and chip away. I can see the mirage Alex, watching me from outside, his face becoming clearer with each fragment of ice that breaks off. There\u2019s something in his eyes that tells me I\u2019ll see him again many more times and that he\u2019ll bring me harm, perhaps even kill me one day. And looking at him feels I\u2019m finally looking into my future and instead of life, I see him and, in him, I see my death.</p><p>A purple glow erupts through the car and the windows implode. Glass flies everywhere and Alex\u2019s arm comes up over my head to protect me. I let out a scream as a thick darkness weaves into my body and steals every aspect of myself away and again, I\u2019m left feeling numb.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cWhat if we were to die tomorrow?\u201d I\u2019m lying on my back in a grassy field staring up at the night sky with my hand out to the side of me. \u201cWould you be happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could die right now and I\u2019d be happy.\u201d Alex rolls on his side and props himself up on his elbow.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a line,\u201d I say, but my insides flutter. \u201cYou seriously can\u2019t come up with anything better than that?\u201d</p><p>He laughs gently as he eyes my lips. \u201cOh yeah, is that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely so.\u201d I wet my lips in anticipation.</p><p>Grinning, he positions his body closer to me. Pivoting onto his hip, he flips on top of me and covers his body over mine. The hardness of his chest presses against me. With each inhale and exhale, I grow more anxious at what\u2019s about to happen. Because I know that something amazing is about to happen.</p><p>\u201cGemma, I\u2019m happier right now than I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he whispers. \u201cEven if we\u2019re being hunted.\u201d</p><p>The moonlight mirrors in his eyes and a pale light rings around the pupils. I want him, more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything. So I let myself have him. Grabbing onto the front of his shirt, I crush his lips onto mine and seal us together.</p><p>I pull away to whisper, \u201cMe too.\u201d Then I fasten my legs around him firmly and he presses down in response. With each breath, my nipples stroke against his chest, and trigger warmth between my legs. My fingers drift down the front of his chest and underneath his shirt. He follows my lead, his palm gliding down the front of me, and then his fingers sneak up the front of my shirt. While his one hand tangles in my hair, his other hand cups my breast and his thumb grazes across my nipple. A fire ignites through my body, but it isn\u2019t satisfying the hunger inside. I need to be closer to him. Desperately.</p><p>Moving my body back, I sit up, forcing him to give me room. Grabbing the bottom of my shirt, I yank it over my head and chuck it over into the grass. I shake my hair out and my bare chest heaves as he deliberately takes me in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d His eyes are glossed over like he\u2019s high. \u201cYou know we\u2019re not supposed to be doing this.\u201d</p><p>I kneel up in front of him, vulnerable, knowing he can shoot me down. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care about any of it anymore. Let me die, but let me die happy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes scroll up my stomach, to my chest, and conclusively reside on my eyes. He reaches behind his head and tugs his own shirt off. His chest is solid and his stomach is lined with muscles. I want to touch him, more than anything. We move for each other like magnets and, as our bare chests collide, passion crazes every single part of me. I\u2019m happy. Blissfully, mind-numbingly happy.</p><p>And in the end, that is all that matters.</p><p>A light flashes and is echoed by an explosion inside my head. My vision resurfaces and my face is inches away from the floor. My nose smacks against the hard wood and my bones pop. I moan as pain erupts through my nose and jaw.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit.\u201d I roll over to my back, clutching my nose and staring up at a red ceiling. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>Flipping onto my stomach, I push up to my feet. The room is small, the walls are red, and there\u2019s a leather sectional sofa in the corner. Bookshelves line the room, along with windows, but curtains block the view outside. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re very much awake.\u201d A hand comes down on my shoulder and a surge of electricity spirals down my arm. I reel around, swinging my hand and slap the hand from my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d Alex stands only a foot away from me. There are cuts on his face and on his arm. The front of his shirt is torn and there is glass in his hair.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Aislin is behind him, observing me from over his shoulder. Her face is streaked with lines of mascara like she\u2019s been crying and some of the ends of her hair have been singed.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Alex says when I don\u2019t respond. He exchanges a look with Aislin and then moves toward me. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m conquered with the compulsion to throw my arms around him and I step toward him, but the feeling dissipates. The memories of what happened rematerialize\u2014the madness, the mirage, the monsters\u2014and I back up with my hands out in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you need to get the hell away from me.\u201d A sharp pain throbs to the surface of my left rib and I hunch over moaning. \u201cSomething hurts.\u201d Alex moves for me and my hand shoots up. \"Stay away from me. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d He pauses, waiting for me to settle down. I take a deep breath and keep my eyes targeted on him as he makes the rest of the journey toward me. \u201cYou need to hold still. You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly aware that blood is dripping down the back of my hand. I lift up the edge of my coat and see a small piece of glass sticking out of my ribs. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles under his breath. \u201cYeah, but I think you\u2019re going to be okay. In fact, you seem subdued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel subdued.\u201d Like if my emotions are malfunctioning. I straighten my shoulders, even though the pain is crippling, and compel what little irritation is left inside me to show itself. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to be okay? Seriously. Because my mind is racing so fast, I can\u2019t even grasp what just happened.\u201d I throw one of my hands in the air. \u201cI mean, what was all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d Alex insists and then turns to Aislin. \u201cYou better go find Laylen and see if he has a first aid kit or something... Although, I\u2019m still trying to figure out why you transported us here at all. Seriously, out of all the places to go, you brought us here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d Aislin\u2019s cheeks go pink as she tucks her chin down and lets her hair veil her face. \u201cAnd you should be grateful I got us out of there before...\u201d She glances at me, then trails off and hurries for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll go find Laylen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Laylen?\u201d I wince as the fragment of glass shifts.</p><p>Alex motions his hand to the sofa as he tears off the corner of his shirt. \u201cGo sit down so I can look at it.\u201d</p><p>I disregard the pain and the blood running down the back of my hand. \u201cNot until you tell me where we are and how the hell we got here. What was all that back there? Because right now, I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019ve got to be dreaming, yet it all seems so real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the most important thing right now,\u201d Alex interrupts with a disapproving shake of his head. \u201cConsidering you have a piece of glass sticking out of your rib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a giant cut on your arm.\u201d I point my finger at his sliced open forearm. \u201cYet, all you seem to be concerned with is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and my concern for you is what caused all this,\u201d he mutters. As my eyebrows furrow, he sighs. \u201cLook, go sit down and I\u2019ll try to explain everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re you, though? What if you\u2019re that mirage thing I saw back there?\u201d</p><p>He wraps the torn piece of shirt around the cut on his arm. \u201cYou really think I am?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard and glance around the room, at the bookcases, the old books that look ancient and the window that is concealed by a curtain. What\u2019s out there? \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to think. Seconds ago I was in the forest and Aislin was doing all that weird witchy stuff with that crystal and candle. Now I\u2019m in some person\u2019s house I just\u2014I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>He studies me as he presses his lips together and pops his bruised knuckles. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re nothing like what I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u201d I ask quizzically. \u201cYou always say things like that. They make no sense to me, just like a lot of the stuff you say.\u201d</p><p>My response seems to entertain him. He smiles softly as his fingers drift toward my cheek. I flinch as his thumb grazes across my cheekbone and my tender skin is kissed by an eruption of sparks. He draws his hand back, which has some blood on it, and he wipes it off on the side of his jeans.</p><p>He inhales and then his sturdy chest puffs out as he lets out a slow breath. \u201cYou feel that right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod my head, knowing exactly what he means, even though he didn\u2019t say it\u2014the sparks. \u201cYeah... I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s how you know I\u2019m real. You won\u2019t feel that with the mirage.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. While I was holding the counterfeit's hand, I felt nothing but hollowness and that\u2019s why I sensed something was off.</p><p>He knows things, about me\u2014I know he does\u2014and I need the answers more than I need air. \u201cYou know things about me?\u201d I ask. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He rubs his tense jaw and shuts his eyes. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I force the lump in my throat down. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His eyes open and it\u2019s like staring into my own, the amount of pain is infinite. \u201cSit down and I\u2019ll try to explain. Even though, it\u2019s going to be nearly fucking impossible.\u201d</p><p>Desperate to understand what secrets he has locked away inside, I settle on the couch, and let my questions pour out of me. \u201cOkay, so how did we get here? And what were those things back there? Those... Death Walkers? And how do you know about them...\u201d I trail off.</p><p>Alex is staring at me with eyes as big as golf balls. \u201cAre you going to give me a chance to talk? Or do you want to just keep going with the questions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, but they\u2019ve been piling up at a very rapid rate,\u201d I say and he stifles a smile. \u201cBut, I\u2019ll try to calm down and get them out one by one.\u201d</p><p>He stares off into empty space, lost in thought. \u201cTake off your coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh... Why?\u201d</p><p>Desire burns in his eyes. \u201cYou have to take your coat off if you want me to get the glass out of your side.</p><p>My thoughts coast back to when I had the orgasm while we were on the bed. It was the most incredible feeling I\u2019ve experienced yet and I wonder how much better it would be if we were closer, touching, bare skin to bare...</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice jerks me out of my thoughts.</p> <p>I blink at him and then carefully slip my arms out of my sleeves, easing my coat off. \u201cGod, it hurts.\u201d</p><p>Alex chucks his coat off, rolls up the sleeves of his black thermal shirt, and stretches his arm toward me, his fingers moving for my side.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d My muscles tense as his hand nears me.</p><p>His hand freezes as I lean away from him and then he shakes his head. \u201cWould you relax? I have to actually get close to you in order to look at that.\u201d He points a finger at my wounded side.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I\u2019m just nervous, considering...\u201d Where do I start with that?</p><p>He understands, nodding. \u201cI get it, but I promise I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I nod, put my hands on my lap, and kink my elbow out of the way so he can get a full view of my rib and the glass wedged in the skin like a splinter. He gradually lifts the bottom of my shirt and there\u2019s a notable shake to his fingers as he inspects the area.</p><p>I suppress the gasp wanting to flee my lips as his fingers search each bump of my ribs and every spot of my skin. After what seems like an eternity, he pulls his hand back.</p> <p>His eyes are amplified and his breathing speeds up. \u201cShit, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? How bad is it?\u201d I crane my neck and peel my shirt away from my skin to get a look at the injury myself. It doesn\u2019t look that bad; narrow and not that long. There\u2019s some blood dripping out, but not a significant amount.</p><p>Alex stares at me with a serious expression, then his mouth curves into a grin and laughter escapes his lips. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that bad at all. The piece of glass is small, and you\u2019re barely bleeding. I should be able to get it out and stitch it up without any problems.\u201d He glances at the door. \u201cJust as soon as Aislin gets in here with the first-aid kit.\u201d</p><p>I tug down my shirt and swat his arm with my hand. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny. You had me worried I was seriously hurt.\u201d</p><p>He glances at where I touched him and then back at my face. \u201cActually, it was funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even know how to do stitches?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr is that something else you\u2019re making up?\u201d</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow. \u201cWhat else am I making up?\u201d</p><p>I motion my arm at the room with flourish. \u201cUm, the fact that we\u2019re here says how much you\u2019ve made up.\u201d</p><p>He props his foot up on his knee and leans back on the couch. \u201cActually, I never made anything up. I just didn\u2019t tell you things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmission of the truth is just as bad as making shit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays me!\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other with defiance; each of us refusing to look away and let the other win.</p><p>\u201cBesides.\u201d I adjust back on the sofa, moving carefully and cradling my side with my arm. \u201cHow do I know you haven\u2019t been lying? I\u2019ve known you for like a few weeks. For all I know your name isn\u2019t even Alex.\u201d I reach over and pinch his leg. His knee jerks and his foot falls to the floor. \u201cAnd, are you even real? I saw another one of you for hell sakes.\u201d I take a deep breath, staring forward as I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t anymore... what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He slants forward, catches my gaze and it nearly penetrates me. \u201cBack at the cabin, when everything was happening, you said you knew the Death Walkers were going to kill you... how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, you\u2019d think I was insane,\u201d I say and let my head flop onto the back of the sofa. \u201cI even think it\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>I feel him move and then he\u2019s above me, one of his elbows propped on each side of my head. He edges his face close and the fervor of his breath dampens my skin.</p><p>\u201cI can completely and utterly assure you that nothing you say is going to make me question your sanity,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI promise you, I\u2019ve seen and heard it all.\u201d</p><p>I carefully consider what he says and then surrender to my doubts, knowing it can\u2019t get much worse than it is. \u201cI dreamt about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dreamt about them?\u201d he questions.</p><p>I nod my head and our foreheads clip. \u201cA lot actually. For the last few months or so.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his weight and puts a gap between our faces, but not our bodies. \u201cAnd what happened in these dreams?\u201d</p><p>Heat rushes to my cheeks as I blush. \u201cStuff... I don\u2019t know. It went a little different each time, but it always ended the same.\u201d</p><p>He scans my face with a curious expression. \u201cWhy do you look embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and force my gaze to remain on his eyes and not his lips. \u201cI\u2019m just hot.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together and then adjusts back in his seat, giving me some room.</p><p>I release a breath that was imprisoned inside my lungs, tuck my hair behind my ears, and stare at my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, you know, because this all seems real, but my mind\u2019s screaming at me that it\u2019s not possible. That there\u2019s no way I could be sitting here when moments ago I was in your frozen car surrounded by...\u201d I peer up at him as I lower my hands to my lap. \u201cWhat did you call them? Death Walkers?\u201d</p><p>He nods and grabs hold of one of my hands. \u201cWhy did you look at your hands just now?\u201d</p><p>I push myself to look past the surging current his touch brings. \u201cBecause, in my dreams, they always turn blue, like I have frostbite or something.\u201d</p><p>He frees my hand and I return it to my lap. \u201cThat\u2019s because it is frostbite. Those things you saw, the Death Walkers, control the temperature of the air and since they favor the cold, they drop it rapidly wherever they are.\u201d</p><p>My eyes sting with impending tears. \u201cThis is all so much.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to say something, but a loud thump from inside the house startles us both. We jump closer to each other as if we can\u2019t help it. Before I can work up a wince from the static, he has his pocketknife out and the blade flipped open.</p><p>\u201cWhose house are we at?\u201d I whisper, not taking my eyes off the knife. It\u2019s miniature and caked with dry flakes of blood.</p><p>He shakes his head, breaks his attention from the door, and sets the knife on a small square table next to the couch. \u201cLaylen\u2019s. He\u2019s a friend of Aislin\u2019s... and mine.\u201d He reaches behind him and pulls back the curtain. \u201cHe lives in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Outside the window, dusk is advancing and casts a pinkish glow across the bronze sand that stretches for miles. I kneel up toward the window to get a closer look. \u201cThis can\u2019t be real. None of this can.\u201d</p><p>He lets the curtain fall closed. \u201cWell it is. Trust me.\u201d He places a hand on top of my chest. At first, I think he is trying to feel me up which seems inappropriate, considering the circumstances. \u201cAll of it is. You. Me. Everything.\u201d</p><p>I inhale through my nose to maintain steady breathing. \u201cLike monsters that freeze everything, or are you talking about other stuff?\u201d</p><p>He moves his hand away and blows out a stressed breath. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a lot of things. Monsters are just the beginning of it and the rest is even more confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore confusing? I can\u2019t even fathom how that can be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, it is,\u201d he mutters. \u201cWay, way fucking confusing... and complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get complicated,\u201d I say, thinking about my emotions and wondering if it has anything to do with what is going on. Although, I can\u2019t connect it, it seems plausible. \u201cBut, what I don\u2019t get is how we got here.\u201d</p><p>He assesses me briefly, then turns sideways and slides his leg up on the sofa so his knee is pressing against mine. \u201cAislin transported us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard you guys say that a lot, but what I don\u2019t get is how. One minute we are all trapped in the car and the next I\u2019m falling on the floor.\u201d I omit the dirty dream I had about him for various reasons; one being, I don\u2019t want my cheeks to turn red again.</p><p>He dithers. \u201cShe used a form of Wicca magic.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh, but stop when I notice how solemn he looks. \u201cYou\u2019re being serious? Because witches and magic aren\u2019t supposed to be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t, huh?\u201d he asks with a cock of his eyebrow. \u201cThen, why don\u2019t you explain how we got here?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not real. Maybe it\u2019s a delusional world brought on by the trauma of those things\u2014those Death Walker things that are trying to kill me. Or maybe this is just another mirage and this entire house is fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight,\u201d he says, frustrated. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you believe in something like the Death Walkers, who, by the way, are demons, but you don\u2019t believe in magic or witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d I correct him. \u201cI said that witches weren\u2019t supposed to be real, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I think the idea is unrealistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re extremely confusing, you know that?\u201d he points out. \u201cAnd calm. How can you be so calm in this kind of situation?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m ridiculously calm and it is very unfitting for the situation. Most people would be running like hell to get away, or balled up in a corner banging their head on the wall; trying to force the madness out of their brains. \u201cI have... issues... with fear... I mean, part of my brain is telling me that this is all just one big crazy delusion I\u2019ve conjured up, but the other part is noting how very real everything feels. I\u2019ve had some trouble in the past determining what\u2019s real, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes scan me from head to toe and my skin electrifies like magic. Like witch magic. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What kind of trouble? Did something happen that I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know about anything?\u201d I inquire with suspicion. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you anything.\u201d</p><p>He situates a hand on my cheek and I shiver from the sparkling it causes inside me. \u201cI know more than you think.\u201d</p><p>I freeze as the electricity sings through my veins and crashes into my heart. My lungs swell from the pressure and the position of the glass alters. The pain causes me to moan, but the tingling sensation in my lower abdomen causes me to gasp. It\u2019s the strangest noise that has ever passed my lips.</p> <p>Alex must have thought so, too, because his eyes enlarge. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I slant my head back from his hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just shocked because you can feel it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can feel it.\u201d He sighs back in the chair. \u201cHow can I not?\u201d He trails off, his voice softening. \u201cBut, I\u2019m not supposed to... I\u2019m breaking so many Goddamn rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rules?\u201d I probe. \u201cYou know, you speak in riddles sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He rakes his fingers roughly through his hair and pieces stick up in every direction. I have the urge to put them back in place, but the pained expression on his face warns me that it\u2019s best not to touch him. I tuck my hands underneath my legs to keep them restrained. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to explain to you how important you are? It\u2019s fucking impossible.\u201d He stares at his scraped up hands, turning them over as he examines them.</p> <p>\u201cHow important I am?\u201d I scan the room, even though it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s talking to me, and aim an incredulous look at him. \u201cI think you\u2019re getting me mixed up with someone else because, trust me, there\u2019s nothing important about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how wrong you are.\u201d He sucks in a slow breath and then raises his chin up to look at me. The intensity in his eyes makes me shrink back. \u201cYou\u2019re the most im\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found one.\u201d Aislin races into the room with a proud look on her face. She\u2019s carrying a first-aid kit and her hair has been pulled back into a bun. She\u2019s also taken off her coat and boots.</p><p>Alex instantly springs to his feet like he\u2019s guilty of some heinous crime. \u201cIt took you long enough. Jesus, what the hell were you doing?\u201d He joins her in the middle of the room, frowning. \u201cYou seriously cleaned up? God, Gemma\u2019s bleeding out here and you go wash up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, but they either don\u2019t hear me or don\u2019t care what I have to say.</p><p>\u201cI had glass in my hair.\u201d She shoves the first-aid kit at him. \u201cAnd it took me a second to find Laylen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure it did.\u201d There\u2019s insinuation in his tone. \u201cJust like it always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Alex. It\u2019s not like that between us anymore and you know it.\u201d She flips her hair from her shoulder and then puts her hands on her hips. \u201cAnd, just so you know, Laylen\u2019s going to stay away until...\u201d She glances at me, then leans closer to Alex as she lowers her voice.</p><p>I can\u2019t hear what they are saying. I hunch over, leaning forward to listen, but all I gather is something about \u201cstaying away\u201d and \u201cblood.\u201d I give up and rest back against the couch with my arm draped over my stomach. I\u2019m tired so I shut my eyes and let the numbness of approaching sleep consume me. It seems like I should be terrified out of my mind and I guess I am, in a sense. If Death Walkers or some other strange creature came running in, I would run, but I also feel empty. Not like how I had before I could feel. It feels like I\u2019ve emptied all my worries. I\u2019m no longer in this madness alone. Alex is here. And Aislin. And I guess this Laylen guy--whoever he is\u2014is here, too. I\u2019m not just roaming around the world solo, seeing bizarre things and otherworldly creatures. They can see them too. So, whether they are real or not, it\u2019s a relief to know that I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s crazy.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but Stephan\u2019s going to be pissed,\u201d I hear Aislin say and then footsteps head toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping?\u201d Alex\u2019s voice drifts over me and I crack open my eyelids. He stands above me with the first-aid kit tucked under his arm. There are worry lines around his eyes and across his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Stephan?\u201d</p><p>He sets the first-aid kit on the table, flips the latches open and lifts up the lid. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father.\u201d That isn\u2019t what I expected. I sit up and scoot to the edge of the sofa. \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally.\u201d He nods, then snatches a throw pillow from the recliner nearby and places it on the sofa beside me. \u201cLay down so I can get that piece of glass out of you and I\u2019ll try to explain what I know while I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike why the Death Walkers haunt my dreams? And why you think I\u2019m so important? And also, why I saw another one of you more than once?\u201d</p><p>He freezes. \u201cYou saw the mirage more than once?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cBut I thought I blacked out or something and it was just a dream. Now, though, I\u2019m second guessing that thought. I\u2019m second guessing all my original thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably a wise idea.\u201d He rummages around in the kit and takes out square pieces of gauze and some Band-Aids. \u201cIt might help you believe what I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d His hand stills as his eyes wander up to me. \u201cAre you scared yet?\u201d</p><p>I analyze my emotions; confusion, inquisitiveness and eagerness are flowing inside me, causing chaos. Fear is absent, though. \u201cI think I\u2019m good. Although, I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>He scratches his head like it\u2019s the weirdest response he\u2019s ever heard. \u201cAlright then, lie down and I\u2019ll do my best to eliminate some of the confusion.\u201d</p><p>I lie down on the sofa and situate my head on the pillow with my arms resting at my sides. \u201cIs a mirage like a doppelganger?\u201d</p><p>He gapes at me with a needle in his hand. \u201cHow do you know what a doppelganger is?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI read a lot.\u201d</p><p>His hand falls to the side and he almost stabs himself with the needle. \u201cAgain, you surprise me.\u201d He pauses with a look of contemplation. \u201cGemma, were you always like this? Growing up, I mean? Or were you... different?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to answer that question yet, but the simple fact that he\u2019s asked it leads me to believe he knows things about me and my past. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>Sighing with frustration, he bends over so he\u2019s hovering over me. \u201cOkay, try to hold as still as possible while I do this.\u201d</p><p>I fix my eyes on the ceiling, trying to think of something else besides the glass lodged in my side and the fact that he\u2019s about to tug it out. All that I can think of, though, is that the red ceiling reminds me of blood and I\u2019m very aware of every jerking movement. I flop my arm over my face, seal my eyes shut, and inhale through the pain. It\u2019s easier than I expected, but, for some reason, I have a hunch that what lies ahead is going to be more painful.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to pass out on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head from side to side, but my ribs are on fire. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s all over.\u201d He sounds choked so I open my eyes. In his palm is a long, but thin piece of glass. \u201cThis little thing right here is what was in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d I pick it up and turn it over in my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s so small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, but it was in pretty deep.\u201d He takes the glass from me and tosses it into the first aid kit. Then he grabs a cotton ball, unscrews the lid of the rubbing alcohol bottle and douses the cotton ball with it. \u201cGemma, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this.\u201d He presses the cotton ball onto the open wound on my rib. It feels like someone has dumped gasoline on my skin and lit a match. My skin is blazing with a fire that\u2019s invisible to the naked eye. I squeeze my eyes shut, bite down on my lip, and try not to scream bloody murder.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d He removes the cotton ball from my skin, which is soaked with my blood, and discards it into the kit. \u201cI just thought it would be better if I caught you off-guard. That way, you wouldn\u2019t anticipate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t... God that hurt.\u201d I complain and my voice cracks.</p><p>\u201cNow, I just have to stitch it up.\u201d He pauses and I open my eyes to see what he\u2019s doing. His gaze is aimed at my side, but not the one that is split open; the opposite one that is free of gaping holes.</p><p>I start to sit up. \u201cIs there another one?\u201d</p><p>He flattens his palm against my stomach and settles his gaze on my face. \u201cDon\u2019t move until I get it fixed up.\u201d He shifts his body, then jerks his hand away and flexes his fingers as if my touch has burned him. \u201cAnyway, the cut isn\u2019t very big, so it shouldn\u2019t take me that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d I ask, lying back down. \u201cYou seem out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His voice comes out sharp and he quickly clears his throat. He takes out a spool of string and begins unwinding it around his hand.</p><p>The atmosphere between us has been killed by awkwardness and discomfort, which doesn\u2019t make sense. Moments ago, I felt fine with him.</p><p>\u201cSo... are you going to explain to me why you think I\u2019m so important?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah, give me a second.\u201d He refuses to look at me and snips the end of the string with a pair of scissors. \u201cBut you have to promise me two things first... The first is that you have to promise that you\u2019ll try to keep an open mind about what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that seems easy enough,\u201d I assure him with confidence. \u201cWhat\u2019s the second thing?\u201d</p><p>He drops the scissors into the kit. \u201cThat you\u2019ll let me finish talking before you start freaking out.\u201d</p><p>A chill slithers up my spine and I shiver. \u201cHow do you know I\u2019ll freak out?\u201d</p><p>He squints his eyes as he raises the needle and loops the piece of clear string through the end. \u201cBecause any sane person would freak out at what I\u2019m about to tell them; even someone like you who seems to welcome the crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t welcome it,\u201d I state. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to react sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He stations the needle just above my ribcage. \u201cI know, but this might push you over the edge, so I need you to try your hardest to keep it together. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but deep down, I know that it can end up out of my hands if the prickle makes a grand appearance. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d His hand dips toward my exposed stomach and I recoil because I absolutely hate needles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure where to begin.\u201d He rubs his hand across his face and his concentration sidetracks to stitching me up. \u201cHold still,\u201d he instructs and I hold my breath as he guides the needle through my skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somebody kill me and put me out of my misery. It hurts like hell, but I know if I move, it\u2019ll only increase the pain. \u201cJesus, that hurts.\u201d I breathe through gritted teeth as I stab my fingernails into the leather fabric of the sofa. Tears fill my eyes and one slips down my cheek as I pant violently. \u201cSo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he apologizes before making another stitch. He kneels back and gives me a moment to catch my breath. \u201cYou gonna make it?\u201d</p><p>I bob my head up and down and look at him through my watery vision. \u201cYeah, go on. And start talking to me. It\u2019ll distract me.\u201d</p><p>He sketches his finger down my cheek and wipes away a tear. He rubs his finger and thumb together as he stares at the teardrop, then his face twists with bewilderment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a tear,\u201d I remark, equally as bewildered.</p><p>He nods and wipes his hand on his jeans. \u201cI know.\u201d He applies another stitch, weaving through my skin and it shoots the pain through all of my limbs. \u201cDo you remember that fallen star story Professor Sterling told, the day I finally decided to sit by you in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where you teased me about going on a road trip?\u201d I attempt to smile, but it\u2019s too much work.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem amused as he twines the needle through my skin again and the he positions his other hand on my stomach. All of my attentiveness channels to his fingers. On my skin. My eyelids flutter as my body bows up. The warmth. The hum. It even numbs out the pain a little. I want him to move them across my body, touch me in places I\u2019ve never been touched before.</p><p>\u201cGemma?\u201d His hoarse voice brings me back to reality.</p> <p>I blink dazedly at him and realize I\u2019ve bowed my body up against his hand. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me with his forehead creased, then his neck twitches and he clears his throat. \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>I lower my body, shake my head, and admit, \u201cUmm... no.\u201d</p><p>He presses on my stomach and directs my untamed body back down. \u201cI asked if you remembered the secret group that hid the star.\u201d</p><p>My brain is hazy and I can\u2019t form intelligible thoughts. \u201cYeah... I remember the story vaguely, but I have no idea why you\u2019re bringing up something we talked about in Astronomy class. It was just a story.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. It was based on fact, although, Professor Sterling didn\u2019t know that. In fact, he didn\u2019t know a lot about what he was talking about that day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make it sound like he was possessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t take it anymore. I prop up on my elbows, causing us to smack heads. \u201cBy what, a ghost?\u201d I press the heel of my hand to my throbbing head.</p><p>He rubs the spot on his forehead where mine smacked. \u201cNot a ghost... a mirage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, there\u2019s another Professor Sterling?\u201d I gape at him unfathomably. \u201cLike there\u2019s another you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one is actually us.\u201d He places his hand on my shoulder and gives me a gentle push back to lie down. \u201cNow lie back down so I can finish the stitch. You\u2019re already going to have a wicked scar. Let\u2019s not make it worse.\u201d</p><p>I lie back on the couch, rest my head on the pillow and put my arms to the side of me. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t you, then what are they?\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cForeseers.\u201d</p> <p>I fold my shirt up a little more because blood is starting to seep out of the wound again. \u201cLike psychics?\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cYou know what Foreseers are?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders rise and fall as I shrug. \u201cI read about it once. They can see into the future or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat definition is really vague,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to them than seeing the future. They can create images that aren\u2019t real\u2014make people see things that aren\u2019t real. It\u2019s kind of like a game to some of them.\u201d</p><p>I gulp, taking it all in. \u201cYou think one\u2019s been messing with me?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI do, ever since Professor Sterling showed up and wasn\u2019t quite himself.\u201d</p><p>I rewind through everything that\u2019s happened and remember how that day Alex had been particularly nice to me. \u201cIs that why you did it? Why you were being nice and asked me to go on a road trip with you.\u201d</p><p>He twists the lid onto the rubbing alcohol. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not why. I\u2019m not even supposed to be nice to you.\u201d He makes an oh-shit face as he says it.</p><p>I pierce him with a stern look. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that.\u201d He moves closer to me. \u201cYou remember how he mentioned there was a power hungry group that might have hid the star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say group,\u201d I clarify. \u201cHe said person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he should have said group.\u201d He quickly makes another stitch. It happens so fast, my body barely registers the pain. \u201cThe secret group is called Custodis de Vita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Custodis what?\u201d I begin to sit up again out of instinct and he puts his hand on my waist to restrain me.</p><p>\u201cThe Custodis de Vita,\u201d he repeats as his fingers enfold around my skin. I want him to move them lower and see how it feels. I seriously have a screwed up head. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret group that\u2019s not necessarily power hungry, but doesn\u2019t want power to fall into the wrong hands.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too hard to focus on what he\u2019s saying while he touches me. I lift his hand off my stomach and breathe freely. \u201cSo much better.\u201d</p><p>He glances at his hand inquisitively and returns his line of gaze back to me. \u201cCare to share what that was about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that word? Like Latin or something?\u201d I evade the question.</p><p>He stares at me intensely with his head slanted down. It blocks out the light and his pupils are massive, taking over his eyes. \u201cYeah, it means Keepers of Life, but for short, we call ourselves The Keepers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeepers of Life.\u201d The words feel foul leaving my lips. \u201cIt sounds like a cult.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle flees his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s not, though. We actually protect the world from dangerous things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I study his expression; unyielding and full of truth. \u201cSo you belong to this Keepers group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Aislin. And...\u201d He covers his mouth with his hand and coughs into it. \u201cMarco and Sophia.\u201d</p><p>I lay inert, letting his words sink into my body, like a disease. The dots are starting to connect and images of things I\u2019ve never remembered before stab unruly at the back of my mind; Sophia sharpening a sword, Marco talking on the phone about a battle.</p><p>\u201cSo, what you\u2019re telling me is that Marco and Sophia, the people who\u2019ve raised me since I was one, belong to some secret group that protects the world from evil?\u201d It sounds unbelievable, just like every other damn aspect of my life. Saving the world from evil and demons and vampires... God, what if there really are vampires? \u201cAnd that you know them?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer, but through his silence, I have my answer. It\u2019s like a piece of the puzzle has been jammed into place. \u201cHoly shit, you were there that day, weren\u2019t you? That day I went to get my boxes.\u201d I start to sit up, but I feel pain from the stitches and I immediately fall back. \u201cYou were that guy in those sunglasses, the one who wouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>The quietness stretches on forever. I can\u2019t believe this\u2014I shouldn\u2019t believe it. Yet, I do, which only makes the situation more of a maze.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d He applies another stitch through the cut and cocks his head to the side, measuring me up with a powerful gaze that melts at my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re lying,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cThat you\u2019re full of shit and messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable,\u201d he admits. \u201cI get it. I really do. But, it\u2019s the truth, despite the fact that it sounds absurd.\u201d The needle snags my skin and my hand instinctively flies toward the pain. Alex grabs my hand before I get ahold of the stitches. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t touch it,\u201d he cautions and I can feel his pulse hammering through his fingertips. He\u2019s nervous. Or scared. And I\u2019m ... I don\u2019t know, because there isn\u2019t anything there yet. Confused, yes, but, other than that, I haven\u2019t linked to an emotion yet.</p><p>I pull my hand away from his as distrust claims my body. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t anyone mentioned this to me before? All those years I lived with Marco and Sophia\u2014those weeks I knew you\u2014why not just say something?\"</p><p>\u201cYou think we could just come up to you and say \u2018Hey, I work for this secret group that fights evil?\u2019 Yeah, that goes over really well with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have said something... less intense, but something like \u2018Hey, I have a secret life you might not want to know about.\u2019\u201d</p><p>His eyes are heated. \u201cWould you have wanted to know about it though? If I\u2019d said something like that to you.\"</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say without contemplation, which more or less means it\u2019s the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t like being in the dark about stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d he mumbles and then lets out a discouraged sigh as the needle snakes through my skin. \u201cBut back to the story because it really will explain a lot more for you.\u201d He pauses and I wait, pondering where the hell he\u2019s going with this. He takes a deep breath and concentrates on his hand as he makes yet another stitch. \u201cThat star I was telling you about had a lot of power. That\u2019s why we... the Keepers, went and got it in the first place. If it fell into the wrong hands, then...\u201d He trails off.</p><p>\"Then what?\u201d I press. I feel it coming, the calm before the storm. Whatever he is going to say will break me apart and I\u2019ll be left stitching myself back together.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNothing. Let me try this again. Those Foreseers I was talking about, well one of them made a prediction that a fallen star was going to prevent the end of the world from happening.\u201d He picks up the scissors and trims the end of the string off.</p><p>The stab at the back of my neck is dull, but detectable. \u201cThe end of the world.\u201d</p><p>He chucks the scissors back into the kit, takes out a roll of tape and some gauze. \u201cWhen I say \u2018end of the world,\u2019 what I mean is there\u2019s this portal that\u2019s supposed to open sometime... although, no one knows exactly when.\u201d</p><p>I stare expressionlessly at him. \u201cA portal? Like a deep hole will open up and swallow up the world? Or, all hell will rain down? Or, zombies will walk out and take over the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d He arranges the gauze over the stitches and secures it with tape. Then he puts everything back in the kit and shuts the lid. \u201cI\u2019m all done with the stitches, so you can sit up if you want. Just be careful, though. If you move too fast, you might rip them open.\u201d</p><p>I tug my shirt down and gradually sit up. My side feels strangely tight and my head is full of thoughtless nonsense.</p><p>Alex sits down on the sofa next to me, drapes an arm behind my head and relaxes his knee against mine. A spasm of heat coils up my inner thigh and my knee jerks upward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I ask as I stared down at our knees. \u201cThat electricity I feel whenever I\u2019m around you? What is it? Does it have anything to do with this?\u201d</p><p>He plays with my hair, twisting a strand around his finger. \u201cI have no idea what causes it. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I shoot him a look. \u201cYou have no idea what it is? At all. Or, are you just omitting the truth, as you so nicely put it.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his tongue to keep from smiling at me as he releases my hair. \u201cNope. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it until you came along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, me neither,\u201d I mutter, combing my fingers through my hair to smooth it back into place. \u201cUntil the first time I met you at the school... that day you let the door slam in my face... but even when I ran into you at Marco and Sophia\u2019s house, I felt something.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a guilty face, but then he seems surprised. \u201cReally? That was the first time you felt it? Ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why do you look so surprised?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou just said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re different,\u201d he says and I frown. He kicks his boots up on the table and crosses his legs. \u201cI\u2019ll get to why, but give me a minute. I have to finish explaining the portal story, because it\u2019s kind of like background information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo you... but back to the portal because you need to kind of understand that part before I go anywhere else with it.\u201d He pauses and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s holding his breath. \u201cIf it opens up, it'll let millions of Death Walkers out and you\u2019ve seen what they can do, so I\u2019m sure you can guess how that would end the world.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on the arm of the sofa and bring my knee up onto the couch as colorful images flash through my mind, little pieces of memories clipping together, forming a story.</p><p>The ground is an ice-rink, the buildings are tall statues, and the sky ripples with clouds that shower down a heavy snowstorm. In the distance, there is light\u2014fire\u2014and when it mixes with the snow, there is nothing but chaos.</p><p>\u201cBy ice,\u201d I whisper as the images shatter into pieces and dissolve.</p><p>His phone beeps and he glances at the screen. \u201cExactly.\u201d He scrolls through his screen and hammers his fingers against a few buttons, seeming preoccupied, yet he continues on with his story. \u201cThere\u2019s this guy named Demetrius, who\u2019s the leader of all the Death Walkers, and he wants this portal to open. Basically, the fallen star is the only thing that has enough power to keep the portal from opening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have the star?\u201d I wonder and then raise my hands in front of me. \u201cAnd, I\u2019m only asking that question out of curiosity. I\u2019m still not sure if I one-hundred percent believe what you\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze rises from his phone and there is a look in his eyes that I don\u2019t like. \u201cYeah, we still have it. We kept it hidden so Demetrius couldn\u2019t find it. For the first few years after the Keepers found it, we had a Shifter transfer the star\u2019s energy into different objects to keep its location a constant secret.\u201d He stops. \u201cDo I need to slow down? You look lost.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cKind of lost. Kind of overwhelmed. But you can go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but a warning, the next part is going to be very hard for you to hear.\u201d He glances down at his hands, and then turns them over, so his palms are facing the floor, and he looks vexed. \u201cJust try to stay calm, okay?\u201d</p><p>It feels like thorns have veined their way through my stomach and are poking at my insides. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>He sucks in a deep breath and takes my hand in his. He traces his finger along the scar on my palm gently and it makes me feel a little bit better at the moment. \u201cAn accident happened a few years after we found the star. Theron, the Shifter I told you about, was attacked by Demetrius while in possession of the object that was holding the star\u2019s energy and, during a moment of panic, he accidently placed the power into a... woman.\u201d</p><p>My heart thumps inside my chest, like a drum, beating louder and louder. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. The energy didn\u2019t end up in her.\u201d His hand tightens around mine. \u201cShe was pregnant when it happened and it ended up going into her unborn child.\u201d</p><p>My heart thumps and thumps and I can barely hear the stale calmness in my voice. \u201cThen, what happened to the baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe lived, but the star\u2019s energy is still trapped inside her. For some reason\u2014and no one knows for sure, because no one has ever come across anything like it before\u2014no Shifter could transfer it out of her.\u201d He presses his lips together as my heart roars inside my chest. \u201cA few years after it happened, the mother died, but not because of the star.\u201d He watches me attentively. \u201cShe was a Keeper and her name was Jocelyn.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops, but I still can\u2019t hear a sound.</p><p>Jocelyn was my mother.</p><p>And suddenly I understand what has been wrong with me for the last twenty-one years. I\u2019m not crazy.</p><p>I am the star.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what to do with this information. My brain is in overdrive, racing with different solutions trying to make it so it can\u2019t be possible, but it all comes down to a list of things.</p><p>The dreams.</p><p>The monsters.</p><p>The mirages.</p><p>The weird images always popping up in my brain.</p><p>The detachment from the world.</p><p>My lack of emotions.</p><p>They all seem unreal and so does a star\u2019s energy being inside me. Put them together and they make sense. I come to the conclusion that he\u2019s telling the truth and I do what anyone would have done.</p><p>I run away from the painful truth because it\u2019s just too much to take.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>My legs carry me across the room, my lungs fight against the ache from the stitches. I make it to the door before his long arms wrap around my waist. He\u2019s careful not to touch my stitches as he strengthens his hold and drags me backwards.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me!\u201d I shout as I throw all my weight forward, but he\u2019s stronger than the average person. He puts no effort into his movements as he picks me up until my feet are off the floor and then carries me back to the couch. He sets me down and when I try to get right back up, he thrusts his hand out and shoves me back down.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he orders. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tear those stitches open.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaves as I breathe furiously. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It wouldn\u2019t hurt any more than what\u2019s happening on the inside.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with sympathy. \u201cI understand you\u2019re probably upset, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset,\u201d I cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m content, which is frightening, because I know what you said is the truth and I don\u2019t want it to be. I wanted it to be something else; something that can be cured with a pill or something.\u201d</p><p>He looks helpless, eyes wide and his lips still. The clock ticks back and forth, back and forth. I don\u2019t know what to say or what to do with myself. My entire life, I\u2019ve had a star\u2019s energy inside me. A fucking piece of a star. I\u2019m probably not even human.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d I ask. My voice sounds detached.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Alex asks, looking at me bewilderedly as he sinks down on the couch beside me. He places a hand on the back of the couch, rotates sideways and traps me in place. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t be human,\u201d I say, my eyebrows knitting. \u201cI mean, nothing about me has really been human, has it? And having a star inside me... That can\u2019t be human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re human,\u201d he assures me and takes my hand in his. He grazes his finger across the inside of my wrist. A few months ago I would have felt nothing, but now it brings me a little comfort in the sea of absurdity I\u2019ve been thrown into. \u201cYou\u2019re just a human with a lot of power.\u201d</p><p>I can feel that power through his touch and it\u2019s making me nauseous. I ease my hand away from his, but he grabs ahold of it again and guides me closer until I\u2019m pretty much sitting on his lap.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know this all sounds crazy,\u201d he begins with a look of determination as he puts his hands domineeringly on my hips. He lifts me up and sets me down on his lap, so my legs are on either side of him. \u201cAnd I understand that you\u2019re probably scared shitless, but there\u2019s more stuff I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes roll to the ceiling as I fight back the tears. \u201cHow can there be more... I don\u2019t think I can take anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. You\u2019re a lot tougher than you know,\u201d he says and I lower my head to see if he\u2019s being serious. His gaze never wavers as I study him. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. If you don\u2019t want to hear it\u2014if you want to be left in the dark for the rest of your life\u2014then you need to tell me. If you want me to stop, then I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been left in the dark for most of my life.\u201d It isn\u2019t really a question, but he nods anyway. I take a deep breath and whisper, \u201cTell me then.\u201d</p><p>He nods, gripping onto my hips like he thinks I\u2019m going to try and flee again. \u201cThe Keepers lucked out because Demetrius never discovered the location of the star\u2019s power, but when you were born, a Foreseer told Stephan that if your emotions weren\u2019t controlled, then the power of the star would weaken and eventually die, along with the world. So, to stop that from happening, Stephan made the decision for you to go live with Marco and Sophia in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was I when I went to live with them?\u201d I utter softly. \u201cBecause I was told one, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if maybe I was a little older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were one,\u201d he replies in a flat tone. \u201cAnd they were under strict orders to make sure you stayed unemotional.\u201d</p><p>I hit an eerie calm\u2014an \u2019unemotional\u2019 calm. I was made to be this way\u2014to be dead inside. To live a life of solitude. All those mind-numbing years alone, without a friend, never speaking unless a question was directed to me. It was all done on purpose? A lump builds in my throat, blocking my airway. I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d he says with concern. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a sharp breath and force the lump down. \u201cHow did they do it? How did Marco and Sophia make me unemotional?\u201d</p><p>His eyes wander over my shoulder. \u201cI was always told that it was because they gave you as little physical contact as possible. Isolation. If someone doesn\u2019t ever know happiness, sadness, or love, then how can they ever feel it? Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d I lean to the side and he stares down at the floor behind me. \u201cYou can\u2019t even look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying, Gemma.\u201d He looks at me guardedly. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I know, which isn\u2019t everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d I assert, fighting down my anger; fearing if I release it, the consequences will be irreversible, especially if I end up punching him. I start to get up, but his arms wind tighter as he wrestles me down onto his lap and crushes my chest against his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go wandering off,\u201d he says sternly. \u201cNot until we figure out what\u2019s going on... why the Death Walkers are on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d I\u2019m enraged. Furious. Pissed off beyond comprehension. I dig my fingers into his shoulders, hard.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit as he picks me up and flips us to the side so he is lying on top of me. He gathers my arms together in one of his hands and pins them up above my head. I\u2019m trapped beneath him and the scorching heat is unbearable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too irrationally right now,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to calm down, take a few deep breaths and think before you do anything.\u201d</p> <p>I bend my back up and press my chest against his. \u201cI\u2019m thinking as rationally as anyone would in this situation. And there\u2019s all this... stuff in my body and head and I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>He lowers himself and I feel the hardness of his body bear down on me. \u201cCalm down. You\u2019re going to tear open your stitches... Just calm down.\u201d</p><p>I lie there, panting, and so does he. With each rise and fall of our lungs, our chests collide. I become calmer, which doesn\u2019t seem possible. Yet, it is; my erratic breathing is slowing down, my heart steadying.</p><p>He loosens up too, and isn\u2019t so tense anymore. \u201cNow, if I let you go, will you promise to stay here and talk? No running off?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and nod, but deep down I know I have no control over what I do at the moment. My emotions do.</p> <p>He lets go of me and pushes himself up. Then he grabs my hand and aides me as I sit up next to him. It grows quiet as he turns his head and looks over his shoulder at his back. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re fucking ruthless. You clawed through my shirt and cut the skin.\u201d He turns so I can see his back. Sure enough, I\u2019ve managed to tear his shirt and his exposed skin is split open and bleeding.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize, but there is very little sincerity in my tone.</p><p>He turns around and there\u2019s fire in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d He clears his throat and then I clear mine.</p><p>\u201cSo, why did I start to feel, then?\u201d I pull my legs up on the couch and tuck them under me. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really want to know. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can really figure that out. I guess Marco and Sophia noticed some changes in you over the last few months or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey barely talk to me. How did they notice changes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess you started asking questions about your parents and stuff. You even seemed sad at times.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s why Sophia has been upset. That\u2019s why she won\u2019t tell me anything, but it didn\u2019t make it better. It made it worse. I feel a flicker of hatred in that moment; it's small, but there, and eager to flame bright. \u201cAnd how do you play a part in this? I mean, you were at Marco and Sophia\u2019s house that morning, and then, suddenly you were at my school. I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t there just to learn.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a breath. \u201cAislin and I enrolled in school to try and figure out what was going on with you. We were supposed to keep our distance and just observe, but that didn\u2019t work out very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those the rules you broke?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s just one among a very long list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not supposed to be near me?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and his gaze sweeps all over me, like he\u2019s memorizing me before he bails. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>I think about us on the bed and just how close we\u2019ve gotten. I pluck at a stray string on the throw pillow. \u201cYou broke that rule more than once.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he mutters and then lets out a sigh. \u201cLook, I know you probably have a ton more questions, but I really need to get ahold of Stephan and figure out what\u2019s going on. The Death Walkers\u2014I don\u2019t know how they discovered you\u2014and we need to find that out before they track us down again.\u201d</p><p>I want to believe that when he says \u2018us,\u2019 he actually means us, but, for some reason, I feel like I\u2019m the exclusion. Deep down, I know I\u2019m alone in this, just like I\u2019ve been my entire life. In the end, I\u2019m the only person I can count on for anything.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>The house is enormous; an overly large living room, a large dining area and a very long hallway that has a lot of shut doors. I wonder what is behind those doors; if they are normal rooms or torture chambers or something.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else I need to tell you,\u201d he says as he comes to a stop in front of one of the shut doors. He turns to me and there\u2019s uneasiness in his demeanor.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cLet me guess, unless you kill me right now, the world will explode.\u201d What can I say? I\u2019m tired.</p><p>He confines a smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad your sense of humor hasn\u2019t left you,\u201d he says and I pull an intolerant face. \u201cRelax; it\u2019s not about you this time. It\u2019s about Laylen, the guy who lives here.\u201d He points up and down the hallway. Then, he crosses his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s not human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not human, then what is he?\u201d</p><p>He scratches the back of his neck as he mutters, \u201cA vampire.\u201d</p><p>I stare blankly at him. He has to be joking. There is no way vampires can really exist. Can they?</p><p>He steps toward me cautiously with his hands at his sides. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking... I can see it written across your face. That there\u2019s no way vampires are real, but they\u2019re about as real as Death Walkers and you\u2019ve seen those with your own eyes.\u201d</p><p>My eyes drift to the end of the hall. Light spills through the glass just above the door and creates misshapen reflections across the floor and walls. I could run away and pretend that this madness never existed. That the last few hours are a dream, which they easily could be, but I\u2019ve seen too much; know too much. There is no way I can go back into the dark again and live my life just as it was. I\u2019ve changed. Everything has changed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about running again, are you?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just thinking about stuff.\u201d I glance back at him. \u201cDoes he bite?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s jaw clamps down. It takes him a moment to answer. \u201cNo, since he was a Keeper before he changed, things work a little differently... He\u2019s more in control of his blood lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood lust?\u201d I\u2019ve read about vampires, seen them portrayed on television shows. Some of them are depicted as sexy and their blood lust even sexier. I wonder if this Laylen guy\u2019s blood lust\u2014should it ever emerge\u2014will be sexy and feel good? I\u2019m probably wondering too many things about the subject. I cover my mouth and cough to clear my throat. \u201cAnd what about vampires that aren\u2019t Keepers to begin with? What are they like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope you don\u2019t ever have to find out,\u201d Alex says, then turns the doorknob and shoves the door open.</p><p>The room is bigger than the one we just left, but there\u2019s a lack of windows. The dark red walls are bordered by bookshelves and there is a long, mahogany table in the middle of the room with eight antique spindle-back chairs around it.</p><p>Aislin is in one of the end chairs, texting on her cell phone. When she sees us, she jumps to her feet and meets us in the center of the room. \u201cOh, good. I was just about to come get you. Did you get everything taken care of?\u201d</p><p>Alex looks at me and then back at Aislin; I can sense something is up. \u201cYeah, I guess. Well, as much as I could.\u201d</p><p>Aislin sighs, patting her phone against the palm of her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t get ahold of Stephan. It goes straight to his voicemail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d Alex mumbles, staring at the spot on the floor in front of his feet with his eyebrows dipped. \u201cDid you try Marco and Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they didn\u2019t answer, either.\u201d Aislin checks her cell phone screen. \u201cSomething\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to get ahold of Marco and Sophia?\u201d I intervene.</p><p>\u201cBecause they might know where Stephan is,\u201d Alex replies uncomfortably. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty close\u2014Sophia, Marco and my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet I\u2019ve never met you before,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich seems a little bizarre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsolation,\u201d Alex counters placidly. \u201cThey wanted as little familiarity as possible around you.\u201d</p><p>I just stare at him. There are no words. No coherent sentences that can explain how he can talk so casually about something so significant, at least to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he wonders. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so...\u201d I rack my brain for the right word. \u201cNonchalant about stuff. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re emotional about a lot of things, which is weird since a few months ago you couldn\u2019t even smile,\u201d he retorts, inching toward me. \u201cYou want to share any insight to that?\u201d</p><p>I stand tall, posture straight, and my feet firmly planted to the floor. \u201cCare to share why you\u2019re so calm? Why you can talk about my painful past as if it\u2019s a piece of dirt on your shoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share anything with just anyone,\u201d he says, again calm, and my hand itches to slap him.</p><p>\u201cAnd vice versa.\u201d I clench my hands into fists and hide them behind my back, attempting to keep my own cool.</p><p>\u201cBut yours is important to share.\u201d He takes another step, diminishing more space between us.</p><p>I match his move and get right in his face. A floodgate opens, releasing a waterfall of emotions that severely want to wipe away the last hour or so. \u201cIn order for me to want to tell you anything, I have to trust you and, right now, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blacken and his voice lowers as he leans in. \u201cYou trusted me pretty damn well back at the cabin.\u201d</p><p>My hand starts to rise, to either hit him or shove him\u2014I\u2019m not exactly sure. I never find out, though because Aislin steps up and mediates.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should try calling them again?\u201d she suggests. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d</p><p>Without taking his eyes off me, Alex nods. \u201cYeah, go ahead and try.\u201d He pauses and Aislin begins pressing buttons on her phone. \u201cDo you know if Marco and Sophia were going somewhere? Like on a vacation or something.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so stunned, I can\u2019t blink. \u201cYou do realize that I barely talked to them when I lived with them. After I moved out, we\u2019ve talked on the phone maybe, like, three times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were over there that day I ran into you.\u201d His hand digs around in the pocket of his jeans for his phone. \u201cDid they say anything then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they said to get my shit out of my room,\u201d I state with bitterness seeping thickly from my throat as I gather loose strands of my hair and put them back into place. \u201cAnd to never ask questions about my parents again. I\u2019m guessing that neither of those things screamed that they were planning a vacation anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, this isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d Alex huffs an aggravated breath and puts the receiver up to his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s important. Your life, the world\u2019s life, depends on it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I know it\u2019s not.\u201d Carefully lifting my arms up, I take the elastic out of my hair and refasten it so my hair is in a secure ponytail. \u201cI was being serious, Alex. The extent of our relationship makes sense to me now since I know,\u201d I gesture my hand in front of me and heave a breath, \u201ceverything.\u201d</p><p>He clicks the end button and stares wordlessly at me. I hold his gaze, unwavering, until the fiery connection becomes too much, then I look away and focus on a small piece of artwork on the wall. It\u2019s splattered with blues and reds and there is a grey, stone castle in the background that has a familiar look to it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m just pissed off about... all the bullshit.\u201d</p><p>I hear Aislin\u2019s breath catch and Alex shakes his head, looking at her. \u201cWhat? You knew she was like this when we enrolled in college, it was the reason why we enrolled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d she glances at me with wide eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s so bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I can hear you, right?\u201d I shake my head and turn for the door. \u201cI need some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>As my hand wraps around the doorknob, Alex\u2019s fingers encircle my elbow. He hauls me backwards until my back is against his chest. \u201cNo wandering off alone.\u201d His arm snakes around my waist, while the other pins my arms against my chest.</p><p>My breathing comes out in silent gasps. \u201cIs that another rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf mine? Yes. It\u2019s called the rule of not getting yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>I slant my head back to look him in the eyes. \u201cI just need some fresh air. This is a lot to take in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo wandering off by yourself,\u201d he repeats, his gaze skimming to my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child,\u201d I remind him. \u201cNow, if I want to step outside for two Goddamn minutes, I will.\u201d I take a deep breath and then force my arms forward, hoping he\u2019ll yield because there is no way I\u2019m getting away by myself; he is just too strong.</p><p>His arms unstiffen and I move out of his hold; his hands sliding down my arms and along the back of my shirt as I step away.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d he says softly as he releases the hem of my shirt.</p><p>Without looking back, I hurry to the door before he changes his mind and decides to make it difficult. Once I\u2019m out in the hall, I free a tension-filled breath that I\u2019ve been suppressing for the last few hours as I head for the front door. I\u2019m not sure what my initial plans are other than to get away from Alex and Aislin\u2019s bluntness. They have a way of making me feel like I\u2019m not real, like I\u2019m a magical sword, instead of a human. It\u2019s not my fault that I\u2019m harboring a star inside me.</p><p>When I\u2019m outside, I know I\u2019m not going to run away. Besides the obvious fact that I\u2019m surrounded my limitless desert, and I have no idea which direction will take me home, I\u2019m also scared. I don\u2019t want to die like I have in my dreams countless times. Alex and Aislin seem to know stuff that may help me stay alive and I want more answers about my past, my future and who I am. I want to know more.</p> <p>I sit on the front porch as I take in the events of the last few hours. I have a cut on my side, blood on my shirt and a star inside my body. I glance over my hands and arms, then up each leg. I don\u2019t look different or anything, but I feel different. That\u2019s a given. Each day I feel different because each day I change inside\u2014I grow emotionally. Sighing, I try to relax and clear my head. The desert air is intoxicatingly warm and the grey sky is ornamented with a few stars. I probably could stay here forever; and pretend nothing exists, besides me and the night sky.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s peaceful out here, right?\u201d a deep, sultry voice drifts over my shoulder.</p><p>My muscles tense at the unacquainted person\u2019s arrival. I rotate my body and scan up his very long legs, his firm chest, all the way to his eyes, which are ocean blue and entrancing to look at. I\u2019ve seen those eyes before; I\u2019ve seen and felt all of him before. He\u2019s the blond stranger that makes a frequent appearance in my dreams.</p><p>His features are more striking in person and he reminds me of a singer in a punk rock band. The tips of his blond hair are dyed blue and sweep across his forehead and down across his ears. A silver ring threads his deep red bottom lip. He has on a black t-shirt, black jeans and black combat boots. Greek-like symbols are tattooed on his forearm, inked in black with thick lines.</p><p>He smiles softly as his gaze lands on my eyes. \u201cYou know, the last time I saw you, you were maybe four-years-old.\u201d He glances down at my chest making all the feelings from my dreams surface and steam across my skin. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up a lot.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my feet with my eyes on him. He\u2019s taller in person because I\u2019m not very short myself and he makes me feel downright diminutive. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI take it you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d He sticks out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Laylen.\u201d</p><p>My expression falls and my eyes expand as I step down a couple of stairs, undecided if I should stay or flee. Am I afraid of him? Or curious? \u201cLaylen, as in the owner of this house?\u201d</p> <p>He lets his hand fall to his side. \u201cAwe, I take it, you do remember me, at least, through what Alex has told you.\u201d He says Alex\u2019s name with such disdain that there has to be some bad history between them.</p><p>I feel bad because he clearly knows me and I can\u2019t recall a single detail about him besides my dirty dreams, which never happened. Or have they? I\u2019m beginning to wonder about my dreams and their insightfulness.</p><p>I decide I\u2019m not afraid of him and step back up onto the stair above. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t remember you. I just recognized the name because Alex and Aislin told me the owner of this house was named Laylen.\u201d</p><p>He moves down so he\u2019s on the step right in front of me and I have to kink my neck just to see his eyes. Up close, I note the sadness in them, deep pathways that show the scars conjoined with his heart. I want to hug him, which is strange because I\u2019m not a hugger, but he looks so sad. \u201cAnd they told you I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>He waits. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d I\u2019m uncertain what he\u2019s waiting for me to say so I stick out my hand cordially. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He snorts a laugh and it makes me laugh, too. It\u2019s the most bizarre moment in a long sequence of bizarre moments because it\u2019s normal. I don\u2019t even know him, besides the fact that he has a very warm tongue and slightly cold skin, but those facts are solely based on my dreams.</p><p>Smiling, he shakes my hand and his skin is like frost on a window. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to meet you, Gemma, or should I say, meet you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know me?\u201d I wonder. \u201cIs it because of the Keeper connection?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders lift as he shrugs. \u201cYes and no. We also knew each other when we were young, but it might have been too long ago for you to remember.\u201d</p><p>I search my brain for a memory of a blond hair, blue-eyed boy, but there\u2019s nothing except darkness. But that\u2019s a common occurrence whenever I try to remember something from my early past. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t. I wish I did.\u201d He seems doubtful. And miserable. It breaks my heart to see. There\u2019s no way an evil vampire could carry so much misery in them. \u201cAnd I mean that.\u201d</p><p>We smile again and then he squeezes my hand. Why are we still holding hands? It\u2019s odd, yet, I don\u2019t pull away. I just continue to stand there and grasp onto his long fingers that feel like popsicles. It\u2019s mind-boggling, but it makes sense to my body because I want to cling onto him in any way I can. I\u2019m attracted to him. Obviously. I understand that much, but there is also something else; something stronger and compelling.</p><p>\u201cYou want to sit down and talk?\u201d he asks, looking me in the eyes and I nod.</p><p>We release hands and take a seat on the steps next to each other. He leans against the railing and I recline back on my elbows, feeling a sense of comfort. The porch light radiates into the night and casts shadows across the stairs. We gaze at the desert, listening to the crickets chirp. I can make out the constellation of Cassiopeia up in the sky and a revelation hits me. Is that where my fascination with stars comes from? Maybe I subconsciously knew about the star inside me? Perhaps, I knew that a piece of me belongs up in the sky?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Laylen finally breaks the silence and there\u2019s acrimony in his tone. \u201cHow\u2019s life been with Marco and Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been okay, I guess,\u201d I mutter and fix my gaze on him. \u201cBy your tone, I\u2019m guessing, you\u2019re not a fan of them.\u201d</p><p>He laughs as he stares up at the stars. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Keepers in general.\u201d</p><p>I take in his profile; the slight crook in his nose and the firmness of his jawline. \u201cHow come?\u201d I crack a smile. \u201cWell, besides the obvious fact that they\u2019re liars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they are,\u201d he agrees, encountering my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m guessing Alex hasn\u2019t told you my story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStory?\u201d A bug lands on my arm and I swat at it and then wipe my hand on my jeans.</p><p>\u201cThe one where I was kicked out of the Keepers circle because I was turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey kicked you out because you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d I\u2019m astounded. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t seem evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d he questions with a penetrating look. \u201cBecause a lot of people sure think the opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I disagree. \u201cAlex even told me that you have your blood lust under control.\u201d The word lust sounds funny leaving my mouth. He seems to think so too, because he can\u2019t seem to take his eyes off my lips.</p><p>\u201cAlex is just telling you that to impress you,\u201d he says, sucking his lip ring into his mouth. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I say, but it sounds like a lie. \u201cYou don\u2019t like Alex because he\u2019s a Keeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the other way around,\u201d he answers. \u201cAlex doesn\u2019t like me because of what I am and I choose to return the feeling.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip and drum my fingers on my knee. \u201cYeah, Alex seems like he can be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn asshole,\u201d Laylen says and grins when I look at him, but it\u2019s a plastic smile. A fa\u00e7ade to cover up his real feelings.</p><p>\u201cI was going to use the term douche bag,\u201d I clarify. \u201cBut yeah, asshole works too... Why is he like that? He told me it was because he was moody.\u201d</p><p>Laylen shakes his head disagreeing. \u201cIt\u2019s because of his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s put it in Alex\u2019s head since we were kids that you have to be unattached and unemotional in order to be a good Keeper,\u201d he says and then mutters, \u201cLike he would even know himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like Stephan?\u201d I ask. \u201cIsn\u2019t he a Keeper?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cBeing a Keeper doesn\u2019t mean anything, Gemma, regardless of what Alex tells you. You\u2019ll be able to determine for yourself what you think of Stephan when you meet him, but I\u2019m guessing you won\u2019t like him. Most people don\u2019t.\u201d He leans back on his elbow. \u201cAnd just because Keepers claim to protect the world, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re good people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence encircles us along with the warm air as I try to sort through the colossal volume of information I\u2019ve received. While I dither in my thoughts, Laylen keeps tracing his tongue along his teeth and biting on his lip ring.</p><p>Finally, curiosity gets the best of me. \u201cWhat makes you a vampire exactly?\u201d</p><p>He bites at his lip ring again, making these sucking sounds that drive my body into a fitful frenzy and I have to sit on my hands to stop myself from touching him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>What is the correct way to ask someone how they are considered a creature of the night? The living undead? A bloodthirsty monster? Albeit, a sexy, undead monster. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of books about vampires,\u201d I start. \u201cBut nothing factual. So I don\u2019t know what to believe about vampires and the things they do.\u201d</p> <p>He rubs his hand along his jaw thoughtfully. \u201cYou want to know what makes me a monster? Whether I bite? If I\u2019m a killer, or if I drink blood? If I can run at an inhuman speed or if I have super-human strength?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like such a stupid question when you put it that way.\u201d My lips quirk. \u201cBut, I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to ask, minus the whole killer thing. Because I don\u2019t think that.\u201d</p><p>He elevates an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that I\u2019m a killer?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not putting out the whole \u2018I\u2019m-a-demon-and-I\u2019m-going-to-kill-you\u2019 vibe, so I\u2019m guessing no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the first to not pass that judgment on me.\u201d He crosses his lean arms and observes me, and it only makes me feel more in tune with him. He isn\u2019t going to hurt me. I can feel it in every bone of my body and through the way the sensation of heat unites rhythmically with my pulse. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he says definitively. \u201cI\u2019m not a killer. I\u2019ve never killed anyone; at least, that I know of.\u201d</p> <p>A strange answer, but one I decide to tiptoe around, for now. \u201cBut other vampires are?\u201d</p><p>He nods with his eyes secured on me as if I\u2019m the most fascinating creature in the world. \u201cOther vampires are a lot like what you\u2019ve read and I\u2019m not talking about the ones who drink blood by killing animals. These ones like to kill people; they get a thrill from it.\u201d</p><p>A chill crawls down my spine as the image of splattered blood paints the inside of my brain. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. If people are dying because their blood was drained, wouldn\u2019t the news mention it? Wouldn\u2019t everyone in the whole world know vampires exist?\u201d</p><p>He uncrosses his arms, swings them over the railing, and pulls himself up so he\u2019s sitting up straight. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever noticed that a lot of people turn their heads away from the things they don\u2019t want to see? Besides, people are excellent at keeping secrets from one another. If the right people don\u2019t want the world to know that vampires exist, then they won\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight people, as in the Keepers?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou\u2019re catching on quick.\u201d</p> <p>I cup my hand on the side of my head. \u201cI\u2019m surprised I can think at all. It\u2019s been an overwhelming day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet it has.\u201d His gaze roams to the front door and the light reflects in his eyes. \u201cDo you want to go inside and lie down? You could take a nap or something.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still stuck on the fact that he\u2019s a vampire. \u201cDo you sleep?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with an amused glimmer in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re still on that, huh?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and relax my arms on my knees. \u201cI\u2019ve always been into the supernatural and now I have a real vampire right in front of me. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be off it.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, I smile back and there\u2019s that link, bonding us together again. \u201cI\u2019m immortal.\u201d He traces his long finger along the tattoo on his forearm.</p><p>I scoot closer. \u201cSo you can\u2019t die?\u201d</p><p>He lowers his arms from the railing. \u201cNope, not unless I\u2019m staked through the heart or decapitated.\u201d I scrunch my nose and he laughs. \u201cAm I freaking you out yet?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNope. You\u2019ll probably figure out really soon that I can take in the crazy quite well.\u201d</p><p>He brings his knee up and places his foot on the step between us and overlaps his fingers around his knee. \u201cI\u2019m also stronger than the average person and I have fangs.\u201d</p><p>His teeth are flat, white, and smooth. \u201cYou have fangs? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re retractable,\u201d he says and slides his tongue along his lips. \u201cAnd I only bring them out when I want to.\u201d</p><p>I think about my dream and how he bit me. Curiosity sparks inside me. \u201cAnd when do you want to?\u201d</p><p>His body goes rigid. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you don\u2019t have to find out.\u201d</p><p>I want to find out, though. In fact, I crave it, like a dying plant craves water. Not because I want him to drink my blood and kill me, but because I want to see if it feels the same as it did in my dream; intoxicating and potent. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d</p><p>He bites back a smile and shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a curious thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He analyzes me with a tilt of his head and then his eyes shade to a dark blue. \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>I nod because curiosity is spilling through my veins like a drug. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lingers on me for a brief second longer and then he glances at the door before scooting closer to me. He tucks a strand of my hair out of my face and then traces a line below my eye. \u201cShut your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thrown off a little by his touch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He draws back his hand, sucks his bottom lip into his mouth and his lip ring slips between his teeth. \u201cShut your eyes and I\u2019ll show you what I can do.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the desert and then at the house. Do I trust him? Even though I hardly know him, I do trust him, but I don\u2019t understand why. Leaning back against the step, I inhale a breath of the warm air and then let my eyelids slip shut.</p><p>There is no movement, no softness of his voice, and no sounds of a dying animal he might be devouring. I almost open my eyes to see if he\u2019s left, but then I feel him shift closer and the temperature of my body begins to dwindle as his body hovers over mine, barely touching, yet each one of my nerves attach to him.</p><p>\u201cI feel guilty doing this to you,\u201d he whispers against my neck. \u201cI feel guilty doing it to anyone really, but you have this really curious, na\u00efve look in your eyes that makes it really hard to say no.\u201d I feel his lips brush my neck, soft and moist, and the sensation seeps down into my skin, spilling into my body like liquid ecstasy. Under no control of my own, I fall back against the steps. An arm quickly winds around my waist, his hand cups the back of my head and he holds me up. I want to open my eyes and look at him, but my eyelids are sealed shut.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this thing,\u201d his lips graze my collar bone and warmth centers to my heart and stills it, \u201cthat not all vampires can do that\u2019s called venenatorum osculum.\u201d The way the words roll off his tongue sounds sexy. It makes my thighs tingle and my body arch up against his chest. \u201cI can manipulate things inside you.\u201d He kisses the hollow of my neck and my entire body stills; paralyzed with a yearning for him to fill the massive hole in my heart, which seems to have enlarged severely over the last few seconds.</p><p>\u201cI can put feelings in there; make you feel things you never knew existed,\u201d he whispers and his mouth lingers above my chest. I want it on my chest. I want him on me. I want so much at the moment. His voice lowers and grows ragged. \u201cOr I can take it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t take it away,\u201d I nearly beg as he pulls the collar of my shirt aside. I curl my toes preparing for whatever he\u2019s going to do, hoping it will fill up the void inside me.</p><p>But then I feel him tense, his fingers and mouth move away from me, along with his body. My eyes open as he guides me upright. He isn\u2019t looking at me, but at the front door, which is wide open and Alex is standing just outside of it.</p><p>He looks pissed. Well, pissed is kind of an understatement. He looks infuriated; his face red, his fists clenched, his eyes dark and his arms crossed so tightly in front of his chest that the lines of his muscles are showing. \u201cAre you two having fun out here?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s one of those moments where I know it\u2019s best to lie. \u201cNot really. We were just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know what you were doing.\u201d He jogs down a few steps and Laylen rises to his feet. \u201cHaving fun teaching her about vampirism? I guess you two skipped right past the introductions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, we already know each other.\u201d Laylen is a little taller than Alex and his legs and arms are lankier. \u201cAnd maybe, if you would have explained it to her, then I wouldn\u2019t have had to. She doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why that is.\u201d Alex shuffles forward and I can feel the tension in the air like a viral disease; I feel bad for putting it there. \u201cShe\u2019s not supposed to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew I was a vampire,\u201d Laylen points out. \u201cAnd she had questions, so I answered them.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s fists tighten and his jaw twitches. \u201cMore like showed her and broke a ton of rules.\u201d</p><p>Laylen leans forward and anger flashes across his face, which is mixed with pain and anguish. \u201cThose are the Keepers\u2019 rules and, since I\u2019m not a Keeper anymore, I don\u2019t have to follow them.\u201d</p><p>Alex grits his teeth and Laylen steps around him, his long legs skipping over a few steps as he heads for the house. I remain on the steps, unsure of what to do. Should I follow Laylen? Go inside? Stay here?</p><p>I start to move for the house when Alex turns and looks at me, or looks through me anyway.</p><p>\u201cGo inside,\u201d he says quietly and even though I\u2019m not a fan of his bossiness, I obey because it looks like he\u2019ll crumble if I so much as utter a word.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>No one speaks as we make our way down the hall. Alex lollygags at the rear and Laylen towers in front. Alex is clearly irritated about the incident he walked into on the porch. I\u2019m still unsure what happened. Now that I\u2019ve gotten some space from Laylen, I realize how foggy my head had been when I was close to him. Not to mention, how much my hormones are bonding with my thoughts. Is that what Laylen can do? Make me horny?</p><p>Laylen heads into the room I left earlier. I\u2019m about to walk in when Alex grabs my sleeve. He doesn\u2019t give me time to turn around as he drags me back down the hall and around the corner into a foyer with black tile floors and a mirror hanging on the wall. There is also a small table that has pictures of Laylen and Aislin together at various different places. Are they a couple?</p><p>Alex steers me around by the shoulders so I\u2019m facing him and then he backs me up against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I protest as I step forward.</p><p>His hands come down on the wall and he restricts me between his arms. \u201cI was going to ask you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong,\u201d I state as his hands slide down the wall and stop just above my shoulders. \u201cJust talking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do know what he was doing to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to do it.\u201d</p><p>He arcs an eyebrow and bends his elbows so he can move in closer and it galvanizes my body. \u201cYou asked him to manipulate your feelings? Considering what you\u2019ve went through, I would assume that\u2019d be the last thing you\u2019d ever want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to see what a vampire could do. It isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201d I pause. \u201cAnd why does it bother you so much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He locks his elbows to give us distance. \u201cLook, you\u2019re new to this whole aspect of life and I don\u2019t want your curiosity to get you into trouble. Because it can. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that... trust me.\u201d I lean forward, lessening the space between our faces. \u201cYet, I know nothing about you. How can I trust someone I don\u2019t know? I mean, I\u2019ve known Laylen for like twenty minutes and I already feel like I know more about him than I do about you and I\u2019ve known you for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>He isn\u2019t intimidated by my take-charge attitude. He welcomes it, moving in even closer so our foreheads are converging. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. I\u2019ve told you things about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do I know any of that\u2019s true?\u201d I ask. \u201cAfter everything, after the sheer fact that you were around me for days upon days acting like everything was normal. Being able to act like that and omit the truth can only come from practice.\u201d</p><p>He pushes back from the wall and shakes his head. \u201cBelieve whatever you want, Gemma. See how far it gets you.\u201d</p> <p>With that, he leaves and I have no idea what he means. I have no idea what anything means anymore. I\u2019m a mess. A giant, erratic, emotionally driven mess that is supposed to save the world.</p><p>It turns out that Alex and Aislin still can\u2019t get ahold of anyone, so there is a heavy amount of friction in the room. I sit at the table and watch Alex pace the floor with his hands crossed behind his back. He does it for so long I think he is going to wear a whole in the floor.</p><p>Aislin is in the end chair messing around with her phone while Laylen searches the bookshelves as a way to busy himself. I think there may have once been something going on between Laylen and Aislin because they haven\u2019t once looked each other in the eye.</p><p>Aislin drops her cell phone on the table and slumps back in the chair. \u201cMaybe we should just go looking for them.\u201d</p><p>Alex halts and unfolds his hands from his back. \u201cThat\u2019s easier said than done, Aislin, since we have no idea where to look for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to help.\u201d She frowns and scoops up her phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you guys ever consider that maybe they don\u2019t want you to get ahold of them?\u201d Laylen slides a book onto the shelf and walks over to the table. He hasn\u2019t spoken in an extent amount of time and his voice seems to make Aislin and Alex edgy, but I like the sound of his voice. He grips at the back of the chair next to mine. \u201cThat maybe they\u2019re hiding from you.\u201d</p><p>Alex shoves up his sleeves and tosses his phone aside. \u201cWhy the fuck would they be hiding from us?\u201d</p><p>Laylen lets go of the chair and stands upright. \u201cYou tell me. I\u2019ve been out of the loop for a few years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, there\u2019s an underlying meaning,\u201d Alex retorts, striding to the table, \u201cwritten all over your face.\u201d</p><p>Laylen crosses his arms and so does Alex. They stare at each other like two dogs ready to rip each other\u2019s throats apart. Aislin and I trade an uneasy glance, but we\u2019re both afraid to intervene.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what I think?\u201d Stretching his long legs, Laylen makes a path around the table toward Alex. \u201cThat it\u2019s not just a coincidence that Stephan, Marco, and Sophia are all unreachable when hell breaks loose. I mean, for all we know, they could be working with Demetrius and the Death Walkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI thought the Keepers were good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, just ignore him.\u201d Alex prowls toward Laylen with a cocky sway in his walk. They\u2019re closing in on each other and their chests are heaving with their rage. \u201cHe\u2019s full of shit.\u201d</p> <p>As the two of them reach each other, I scoot the chair back from the table and stand up. \u201cAll of you are strangers to me, so I\u2019m not sure who or what to believe.\u201d</p><p>Laylen cinches his lips together, holding back a grin as he looks at me. \u201cSmart girl.\u201d</p><p>I want to say thank you, but the look on Alex\u2019s face shuts me up. His eyes are flaring and his fists are balled so firmly his knuckles are chalk white. It\u2019s like he thinks I\u2019m supposed to straight up trust him. For the last few weeks, I\u2019ve thought he was just a normal guy, who I happened to share some electrical bond with, and I thought that was because I was going insane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m confused and I don\u2019t want to trust anyone at this point.\u201d I lower myself into the chair. He keeps his eyes on me and it makes me want to cower under the table. There is too much power and control in those eyes; it melts my inhibitions.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go back to Laramie and check up on things,\u201d Aislin speaks and cuts through the tension in the air. \u201cThere might be something back at the house that could help us figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Alex asks, tearing his gaze away from me and focusing on her. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re taking Gemma back to Wyoming. You saw how many Death Walkers showed up at the cabin. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going back? Wait. Why? I have a home there and a...\u201d I stop because what else do I have there? A bed. Classes. Emptiness. Nothingness. Pieces of meaningless memories that are more weightless than dust.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back when the Death Walkers know where you are.\u201d His brow arches upward. \u201cDoes that upset you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admit, \u201cbut where am I going to live? And what about my stuff?\u201d</p><p>Alex puts his hand to his neck and pops his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s a question only Stephan can answer because, right now, I have no fucking clue what the hell\u2019s going on or what the next move is. No one prepared us for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrepared you for a Death Walker invasion,\u201d I joke and then choose to keep quiet after Alex\u2019s gives me a death glare.</p><p>\u201cI think sometimes, your moods get a little confused,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause a lot of them don\u2019t fit the situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but at least I have an excuse,\u201d I retaliate. \u201cYou\u2019re just moody for unknown reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he has reasons.\u201d Laylen slaps Alex\u2019s shoulder roughly and Alex winces. \u201cHe just won\u2019t admit them.\u201d</p><p>Alex glares at Laylen\u2019s hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d</p><p>Laylen steps back, shaking his head. \u201cYes, it is. All this,\u201d his eyes flit to me, \u201cis about wanting what you can\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Alex raises his fist and targets it at Laylen\u2019s jaw. Laylen does nothing but stand there, embracing it, as if he wants to feel the pain. I start to jump from my chair, but Aislin beats me to the punch, literally. She\u2019s in between them before Alex can sling his fist forward.</p><p>She thrusts her hands out to the side of her and pushes both of them back. \u201cStop fighting. Fighting has never done any of us any good. In fact, it\u2019s the main reason why we haven\u2019t talked to each other in the last few years.\u201d She looks at Alex, then at Laylen, and then her hands fall to her sides. \u201cNow, we need to focus on the problem and come up with a plan.\u201d Her shoulders rise and fall as she lets out a deep breath. \u201cWhat we could do is leave Gemma with Laylen while you and I go back to Laramie and see what\u2019s up. Check their houses, see if anyone is there or if anything gives us a clue to where the hell they disappeared to.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes narrow at her. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m leaving Gemma alone with him.\u201d</p><p>Laylen laughs, but it was underlined with hurt. \u201cAm I not even considered a person anymore?\u201d Alex doesn\u2019t respond and Laylen shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thought,\u201d I chime in. \u201cIt\u2019s my life, so I think I should have some say in this. And I say I\u2019m comfortable with staying here alone with him.\u201d</p><p>Alex snorts a sharp, derisive laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are. I got a full view of how comfortable you two are with each other when I walked out onto the porch.\u201d</p><p>Aislin\u2019s forehead furrows and she looks at Laylen for an explanation. \u201cWait, what happened out on the porch?\u201d</p><p>Laylen looks guilty and starts to open his mouth, but Alex cuts him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Alex pulls out a chair to sit down. He looks tired; there are bags under his eyes and they\u2019re bloodshot. Positioning his elbows on the table, he lowers his head into his hands, looking defeated. \u201cAislin, how quickly can you get us to Laramie and back?\u201d</p><p>She poises her chin up as she rounds the table and collects her phone. \u201cAs quick as you need me to. You know that. I\u2019m good to go if there are only two people. It\u2019s when there are too many that things get complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll leave Gemma here.\u201d Alex raises his head and stabs a finger in Laylen\u2019s direction. \u201cBut if anything happens to her, it\u2019s on you.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and sits down at the table. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to her. As much as you hate me, you know I\u2019m perfectly capable of fighting off some Death Walkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in large numbers,\u201d Alex says. \u201cNo one\u2019s capable of that unless they have the Sword of Immortality, and no one\u2019s seen it for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go back into the library and grab my candle and crystal first,\u201d Aislin announces as she heads for the door. \u201cThen we can go. The sooner we get out, the sooner all this will be over. I don\u2019t like not knowing what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m a very structured person.\u201d</p><p>Laylen and Alex trade a glance and there is laughter in their eyes. For a second, they look like friends.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s you,\u201d Laylen comments sarcastically as he turns a chair backwards and sits down in it; letting his lanky arms dangle over the top. \u201cMiss Organized and Structured.\u201d</p><p>She turns around. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be mean!\u201d</p><p>Alex is tracing his finger along his palm absentmindedly. \u201cHe\u2019s not being mean. He\u2019s just stating a fact everyone knows.\u201d His eyes flicker in my direction. \u201cEven Gemma probably has caught on to how disorganized you are.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head because I don\u2019t know enough about her to pass that judgment. \u201cI don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should,\u201d Alex says. Aislin whisks forward and smacks him on the back of the head. His shoulders constrict and move upward. \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t the only one who said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were the first one in my reach.\u201d She rolls her shoulders back to straighten her posture. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to go get my Wicca stuff so I can use my awesome magic gift\u2014which none of you have\u2014to take us back to Wyoming.\u201d She starts toward the exit, but slams to a stop and smacks her hand against her forehead. \u201cShit! Shit. Shit. Shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m starting to realize that maybe I\u2019m not as crazy as I\u2019ve always thought. Maybe everyone is crazy. Maybe crazy is actually normal.</p><p>Laylen nibbles on his lip ring as he works to restrain a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She turns around and pouts out her lip. \u201cThe Death Walkers\u2019 ice ruined my crystal. We were lucky we even made it here.\u201d She makes her way back to an empty chair. \u201cThis sucks. Now what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>It gets so quiet I can hear everyone\u2019s hearts beating. Thump, thump, thump, thump. They sound like tiny drums.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of a crystal was it?\u201d Laylen inquires. \u201cThe gold-leaf one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the one made of amethyst.\u201d She props her elbow on the table and lets her chin fall into her hand.</p><p>\u201cThe Vectum Crystal?\u201d Laylen asks and she bobs her head up and down. Laylen hooks his finger over his shoulder and points at the window. \u201cThere\u2019s this place in Vegas\u2014Adessa\u2019s Herbs and Spices.\u201d</p><p>Alex cracks his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that Las Vegas probably isn\u2019t the greatest place to go. There are all kinds of dark creatures there. Vampires. Werewolves. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>My eyes amplify as I stare out the window at the twinkling lights in the distance. They have to be the city\u2019s lights. \u201cThere\u2019s Werewolves?\u201d</p> <p>Alex points at Laylen with a bored look in his face. \u201cThere\u2019re vampires. Of course there are werewolves.\u201d</p><p>I shake the image of a dog howling at the moon out of my head. \u201cDo they bite?\u201d</p><p>Laylen lets out a soft laugh as he twirls a set of keys he\u2019s taken out of his pocket around his finger. \u201cYou sure are fascinated with biting.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flush because I really am. There\u2019s something about getting bitten that enthralls my emotions and I want to experience it in real life.</p><p>Daggers shoot from Alex\u2019s eyes as he glares at Laylen and then his attention centers back to me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they do. All that matters is that you\u2019re safe and sound here, far away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m really safe and sound anywhere,\u201d I say. \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you have like a box of weapons to protect me or something?\u201d</p> <p>He struggles not to laugh at me. \u201cWeapons or not, it\u2019s too dangerous. If an inhuman\u2014and maybe even human\u2014creature gets close to you, they\u2019re going to want to get closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBecause they will,\u201d he responds. \u201cYou have this... thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay here with her,\u201d Laylen proposes as he leans back in the chair and places his hands behind his head. \u201cOr, I\u2019ll stay with her and you take Aislin. There\u2019s a ton of solutions, so stop getting your panties in a bunch.\u201d</p><p>Alex stares impassively at him. \u201cI\u2019m not getting my panties in a bunch. I\u2019m being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful about what exactly?\u201d Laylen wonders. \u201cGemma getting hurt, or you hurting Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aislin and I say simultaneously.</p><p>Aislin glances at me and then at Alex. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet him explain it to you,\u201d Laylen says with an accusing tone.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain.\u201d He shoves his chair back from the table and rises to his feet. \u201cYou promise we\u2019ll just go straight there and straight back. No stops or anything.\u201d</p><p>Laylen stares at him incredulously with his hands spread out to the side of him. \u201cAre you kidding me? Where else do you think I\u2019ll take us? McDonald\u2019s? Walmart? Oh wait, I do need to make a quick stop by the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh, but it quickly dissipates at the fury blazing in Alex\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou think this is funny? Do you think getting killed is funny?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cBut what he said was.\u201d</p><p>Aislin grimaces and drops her head down on the table. \u201cCan we just get going already?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s hands wring the back of the chair. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the Death Walkers, Gemma. They\u2019ll kill you if they get the chance.\u201d</p><p>Fear capes the humor inside me. He\u2019s right. It isn\u2019t funny. The prickle lets me know that I need to get things in check and take things seriously. It soothes me with each stab. \u201cI know that. And I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t laugh at inappropriate things again.\u201d</p><p>He is stunned by my apology. \u201cWell, good.\u201d</p><p>After a lot of arguing, a decision is finally made. We would all go to Vegas with the stipulation that I will stay in the car and there will be no stops except to get the crystal. Including cemeteries and Walmart.</p><p>I have blood all over my clothes and Aislin insists I need to change before we leave. She informs me that she has clothes stashed in the house. We go into a room with a white four-post bed covered with tons of fluffy pillows. There is an oversized armoire in the corner and Aislin marches up to it and throws the doors open.</p><p>\u201cThe only problem is you\u2019re about five inches taller than me.\u201d She taps her finger against her chin as she evaluates the selection of clothes hanging up. \u201cBut I guess we\u2019ll just have to make something work.\u201d</p><p>I take a seat on the bed. \u201cDo you come here a lot? You must if you have your own room.\u201d</p><p>She pulls out a pink T-shirt and tosses it on the bed. \u201cYeah, this house actually used to belong to Laylen\u2019s parents and we used to come up here to take a break from everything.\u201d She throws a glittery scarf onto the bed. \u201cThings change, though.\u201d She sighs, staring down at a pair of jeans in her hands. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been up here in a really long time.\u201d</p><p>She starts delving through the clothes again. Shirts, jeans, skirts, and dresses begin to form a pile on the bed beside me. The room smells fruity and it matches the frilly theme of the bed. There are photos all over the walls, so I get up and amble around to look at them. I find photos fascinating because they capture a moment of emotion, whether it\u2019s fake or real.</p><p>Some of the photos are of Laylen and Aislin and there are others just of Laylen. There\u2019s one taped to the dresser mirror of Laylen standing out in the desert with his arm wrapped around Aislin. Alex is next to Laylen and there is an attractive blonde girl cuddled up against him. They\u2019re smiling. Happy. It makes my heart hurt. Have I ever been happy? I search through my limited memories and come up hollow.</p><p>\u201cThat was taken a couple of years ago,\u201d Aislin remarks as she wiggles a hanger out of the sleeves of a sweater.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I was about eighteen.\u201d She balls up a shirt and tosses it back into the armoire. \u201cSo, like, five years ago.\u201d</p><p>I do the math. \u201cThat would make you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three.\u201d She interrupts as she chucks a skirt onto the bed. \u201cAnd Alex is twenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he seems to hate school,\u201d I note. \u201cHe\u2019s old.\u201d</p><p>Aislin laughs as she hooks the hanger back on the bar. \u201cHe\u2019s not that old, Gemma. Only a few years older than you.\u201d</p><p>I pick up a handmade ceramic heart that\u2019s on the dresser and turn it over in my hand. Her room is so different from mine, decorated and full of items associated with memories. \u201cHow about Laylen? How old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he would\u2019ve been twenty-five, but after he got... um...\u201d She trails off as tears pool in her eyes. She\u2019s hurting thinking about the past, something I understand. It\u2019s right then that I realize Aislin isn\u2019t a bad person. She\u2019s nice and has a lot of emotion in her, just like me. \u201cBut, yeah, he\u2019s stuck at twenty-two now.\u201d She dabs the tears away with her fingertips, chucks a white lacy shirt onto the bed, then comes over and stares down at the pile of clothes with her hands on her hips. \u201cNow, see if any of these will fit those long legs of yours.\u201d</p><p>Nothing fits. All the pants are too short and all the shirts are baggy in the chest area. I flop back on the bed, wearing a pink shirt that shows off my stomach and jeans that barely reach the lower region of my ankles. \u201cI think I might have to just wear my clothes.\u201d I drape my arm over my head.</p><p>She picks up my shirt that has blood on it and discards it in a hamper in the corner. \u201cNo way. You did hear Alex when he said vampires could be there. He wasn\u2019t kidding and they\u2019re not like Laylen. They\u2019ll bite you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s that word again. Bite. \u201cOkay, then what do you suggest?\u201d I peek out from underneath my arm. \u201cBecause I look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>She glances around her room and when her eyes land on a trunk at the foot of the bed, her face lights up and she claps her hands. \u201cOh my God. I have the perfect outfit.\u201d She kneels down in front of it, flips the latches, and raises the lid. \u201cI have no idea why I didn\u2019t think of this before.\u201d She sticks her head in and begins digging around. I sit up as she shuts the lid. She springs to her toes and extends her arm in my direction. \u201cHere you go. One outfit that will fit not only those long limbs of yours, but it\u2019ll also help you blend in.\u201d</p><p>I take the piece of fabric from her hand and hold it up in front of me. It\u2019s a strapless, black leather dress with a lace-up section on the back. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>She twists her golden brown hair up as she makes her way over to the porcelain vanity. \u201cI had a friend who wore it for Halloween one year and she left it here.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingernail down the red ribbon on the back and twist it around my finger. \u201cIt\u2019s a Halloween costume? For what? A slut?\u201d</p><p>Aislin opens a drawer and takes out a compact and a makeup brush. \u201cShe was supposed to be a sexy witch, but she did end up looking more like a slut.\u201d</p><p>I unravel my finger from the ribbon. \u201cAnd now you want me to wear it?\u201d</p><p>She clicks open the compact. \u201cTrust me; you\u2019ll be thanking me when we get to Vegas. It\u2019ll help you blend in.\u201d She begins powdering her nose.</p><p>I glance down at the leather dress in my hand. \u201cThis will help me blend in?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get there. In Vegas, anything and everything exists. Walk around looking normal and you\u2019re the one that stands out.\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet and head for the door, grabbing my boots on the way out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>She turns in the chair and points to the right. \u201cThird door to your right.\u201d I start to leave and she calls out, \u201cOh yeah, and Gemma, wear your hair down. You have such pretty hair.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I leave her to primp and go into the bathroom, fully aware that I\u2019m going to look ridiculous. I might not know much about myself, but I know enough to comprehend that a tight, leather dress isn\u2019t going to look good on me do to my lack of curves.</p><p>I carefully slip out of the shirt and jeans and then step into the dress. I shimmy it over my hips and then have to take off my bra because the dress is made to go all-la-natural. I lace up the back the best that I can, but it\u2019s loose. Then, I slip on my boots before yanking the elastic out of my hair and letting it fall down to my shoulders. I\u2019m not used to wearing such a limited amount of clothing; I feel naked and ridiculous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I splash some cold water on my face in a pathetic attempt to bring myself out of this dream because vampires, witches and secret groups who save the world aren\u2019t supposed to exist.</p><p>But after I pat my face dry and open my eyes, the same navy blue walls of Laylen\u2019s bathroom still surround me. I glance into the mirror hanging above the sink and sigh at the sight of my freakish violet eyes that collide against the glass; like my hair does with my pasty complexion. Add the gothic dress, as well as the boots, and I look like a character straight out of the Addam\u2019s Family.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the door. \u201cGemma, are you ready to go?\u201d Aislin asks.</p><p>I blink one last time at my reflection, then turn away from it, throw open the door and step out. Alex and Laylen are with Aislin, standing next to a table decorated with a vase of wilting flowers. Aislin has changed into a simple grey dress with matching flats and her hair is pinned up. Laylen has the same outfit on; black jeans, a black tee and black boots; it\u2019s a hell of a lot of black. Alex has changed into dark jeans, a long-sleeved, fitted, black shirt and there are leather bands on his wrists.</p> <p>I give an animated swing of my arm. \u201cAll right, throw in a hand that walks around and a creepy Victorian house, and I\u2019m good to go.\u201d</p><p>All three of them look at me at the same time and then they go quiet as they stare at me.</p><p>Great, I look sillier than I originally thought. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke. About the Addam\u2019s Family,\u201d I say, tugging at the hem of the dress. \u201cI should change, right?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Aislin shakes her head, while Laylen coughs into his hand. \u201cNo, you look great.\u201d She walks up to me as she digs through her purse. \u201cYou just need this.\u201d She draws her hand from her purse and moves a black pencil toward my face. I wince as she traces a line around each eye and then steps back, putting the lid back on the eyeliner.</p><p>\u201cShe kind of looks like one,\u201d she says with a tilt of her head as she studies me. \u201cYou know that?\u201d</p> <p>Alex steps up beside her with his eyes fixed on me. There\u2019s a raw animalistic look in them that makes the blood rush to my cheeks. \u201cShe does, which is good. Maybe they\u2019ll leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>I rearrange the top of my dress higher because it\u2019s slipping down. \u201cLook like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Black Angel.\u201d Aislin tosses the eyeliner back in her purse and zips it up. \u201cThey\u2019re really pretty, but really dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that like a Fallen Angel?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re hypnotic and powerful. They have this way about them that draws people to them and if you get too close to one, they can possess your mind.\u201d</p><p>I gape at her. \u201cPossess your mind and make you do what?\u201d</p> <p>Alex steps forward. \u201cWhatever they want, which is why we have to be careful and stay away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there a lot where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Alex wavers. \u201cIt all depends on the Wicca store. If there\u2019s black magic there, then yes, a Black Angel might be there or maybe even something worse. And it\u2019s good you\u2019re dressed up like that.\u201d His eyes scroll up my body. \u201cMaybe everyone will try not to get too close to you. And we can keep your identity hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the Death Walkers?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr from Demetrius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom everyone.\u201d He moves nearer and blows out a breath. \u201cNo one can know who you are, Gemma. If the wrong person finds out who you are\u2014what you are\u2014then word will get back to Demetrius. Or they might try to use the power for themselves.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou\u2019re very valuable.\u201d</p><p>Valuable to whom? I let out an uneasy breath and tug at the top of my dress again, wondering what I\u2019m getting into. \u201cI can\u2019t get the ribbon to fasten very tightly. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to fall down.\u201d</p><p>Alex makes a circular motion with his finger. \u201cTurn around and I\u2019ll tie it.\u201d</p><p>I obey and hold my breath as he steps up behind me. Sweeping my hair to the side, he hooks his fingers through the bottom cross of the ribbon and gives it a gentle tug as Aislin and Laylen wander down the hallway toward the front door.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t utter a word as he deliberately traces his finger to the next section. I suck in a breath as he pulls on that one too and his breath hits the back of my neck. I try to remain calm as he fastens the next one by pulling it so securely that the leather clutches my ribs.</p><p>I put my hands just below my breasts and work to get air into my lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s tight enough I think.\u201d</p><p>His chest brushes against my back as he laughs and gives the ribbon another tug. \u201cNot tight enough. We don\u2019t want them falling out.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my lip. Hard. And a little blood pools out. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll stay put. I can barely breathe.\u201d</p><p>His knuckles graze between my shoulder blades as he ties the ribbon into a knot. He\u2019s breathing erratically and his chest collides with my back with each inhale. \u201cI know, but I want to make sure.\u201d There\u2019s an elongated pause and then I feel his lips touch the back of my neck.</p><p>I stay still as he rolls his tongue along my skin and gives it a little suck, sending shivers all over my body. I want to crumble to the ground and let him catch me, but he pulls away and the feeling evaporates as he heads down the hall with a swagger in his walk. All I have left is a warm sensation on my back and I'm not sure if it\u2019s from the kiss or the prickle trying to whisper a new emotion to me.</p><p>Either way, I stuff it down and follow them out the front door, knowing I have to get my feelings under control, so I can think clearly and keep myself alive.</p><p>Because that is the whole point of life. Isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Laylen drives a 1960s Pontiac GTO; black with white racing stripes down the middle. Another sexy car to add to my list. And a sexy driver. With his long fingers curled around the steering wheel, Laylen speeds off down the dirt road toward the city.</p><p>I\u2019m in the backseat, watching the stars streak by as the car zooms down the road. Alex is next to me and is being really quiet. His knee keeps jiggling up and down as if he\u2019s centering his nervous energy into that one leg. It\u2019s making the air stifling and I can still feel where he kissed my neck, like a lingering chill.</p><p>\u201cYou know if you keep bouncing your leg like that, you\u2019re going to get a cramp,\u201d I say, when his nervous energy starts to spread to me.</p><p>He ceases jiggling his knee and looks at me. \u201cIs it bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I admit and fan my hand in front of my face. \u201cYou\u2019re making it very hot in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just my hotness that\u2019s making you hot and bothered,\u201d he jokes with a smirk.</p><p>Annoyance overcomes me and I slap his knee, kind of roughly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it is.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his knee with a half-smile on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re vicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s been a given from day one.\u201d He pauses and then glances up front at Aislin who has her eyes shut and her head resting against the window. He scoots over in the seat and leans in toward me. He smells like cologne mixed with soap and I breathe in his intoxicating scent. \u201cYou need to be careful while we\u2019re in the city. Stay by me at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss. Any other orders you need me to follow?\u201d I'm joking, but the look on his face is dead serious.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of orders I\u2019d love for you to follow,\u201d he says and reclines back with his jaw set tight. \u201cBut I\u2019d break a lot of rules if I ever gave them to you; and unlike some people, I don\u2019t break the rules.\u201d He glances up at Laylen and then directs his focus to the road ahead. In the darkness of the cab, his eyes look like coals and his face is a shadow; he looks haunted.</p><p>There\u2019s a brief confirmation from the prickle that lets me know I feel bad. Only hours ago, in the cabin, I\u2019d been rubbing up against him, feeling the most amazing feelings ever and then I went and did whatever it was that I did with Laylen. I\u2019m working up a mild apology when the city rises into view and my thought process hits a screeching halt.</p><p>Lights blink against the blackness of the night in vibrant colors and giant billboards light up the sides of the road. In the distance, where the hills fade out, buildings stretch toward the sky. I sit quietly, craning my neck from left to right to take it all in. Everything\u2019s so flashy and shocking. The shock only grows when we reach the heart of the city, where the sidewalks become packed with mobs of people and the air buzzes with excitement. There are people dressed in costumes; drinking, laughing and I even see one man strip off his clothes.</p><p>I pinch my arm to make sure I\u2019m not dreaming and wince from the sting I undeniably feel. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>Alex tucks a strand of my hair behind my ear and whispers, \u201cWhat? Did you think you were dreaming?\u201d</p><p>I rub my arm. \u201cMaybe. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time I wasn\u2019t sure if I was awake or not.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a strange look. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and fix my gaze on a man dressed as a gladiator, handing out flyers to pedestrians. \u201cI mean exactly what I said\u2014sometimes I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s happening in real life and what\u2019s just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor most of my life. Or, well, since I started feeling, which, to me, was kind of the beginning of my life.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me and, I mean, really looks at me as if I\u2019m really a person and not a star or a strange girl. \u201cWhat kinds of dreams? Were they the one\u2019s with the Death Walkers?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, the Death Walkers were in some of them. And you.\u201d And sometimes Laylen.</p><p>The lights from the street mirror in his eyes. \u201cAnd what was I doing in these dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d Thankfully it\u2019s dark because I\u2019m pretty sure my cheeks are bright red. \u201cStuff.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take him very long to catch on. \u201cOh.\u201d His forehead scrunches and he covers his mouth, then puts his hand on his lap; uncertain of what to do with himself.</p><p>After that, it gets quiet. I would feel stupid, but I have bigger problems to worry about than Alex thinking I\u2019m a pervert. I focus on the scenery; a glass pyramid, a giant pirate ship and a small replica of the Eiffel Tower. At the end of the taller buildings, Laylen veers to the right and the lights fade with the crowd. The buildings shrink into smaller, worn out houses and the gutters lining the streets are littered with garbage and cigarette butts. When we pass a corner where a group of people are shuffling around, beating the shit out of each other, Aislin locks her door.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize it\u2019s almost one o\u2019clock?\u201d Aislin informs Laylen as she checks her watch.</p><p>Laylen flips the signal light on. \u201cYeah, so? You do realize that this is Vegas, right? Most places stay open all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the later it is, the more the weirdoes are going to be out and about.\u201d She adjusts the strap of her dress, which has slipped off her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWeirdoes make the world interesting.\u201d He flashes a smile at her as he parks the car up against the curb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shakes her head and tries not to smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a great way to look at things.\u201d</p><p>Surrounding the car are abandoned buildings.

It gets quiet and very dark.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Alex asks and his low voice sends vibrations along my skin. \u201cYou look freaked out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie, clicking my seatbelt loose. \u201cI\u2019ve been chased by a pack of Death Walkers for crying out loud.

Things can get a lot worse,\u201d he states definitively.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s trying to scare me, but he is making me uneasy. \u201cLike how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says in a husky voice. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that all the time,\u201d I state quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m starting to wonder just how bad things are; how much protection you think I need.\u201d</p> <p>He keeps his lips close to my earlobe. \u201cIt\u2019s not about things being bad. It\u2019s about me making a promise.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head a little and my cheek touches his lips, but he doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI reiterate, sometimes it feels like you\u2019re speaking in code.\u201d</p><p>Aislin clears her throat. \u201cUm, guys? I think we should go in and get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Her voice breaks the connection and we both move away from each other; Alex returns to the other side of the car.</p><p>Aislin surveys the buildings. \u201cSo what\u2019s the game plan? Just go into the place and get the stuff? Where is the Wicca shop anyway, because these places all look abandoned?\u201d When Laylen stares silently out the window, Aislin rotates in the seat to face him. \u201cLaylen, did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He lowers his hand from his lip ring and mutters, \u201cThe Wicca shop isn\u2019t inside any of these buildings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean; it\u2019s in none of them?\u201d Alex asks. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Laylen vacillates. \u201cI needed to stop here first before we go and pick up the crystal.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a split second where I can feel the heat of hell breaking loose and then Alex scoots forward in his seat. Even though his movements are slow, they\u2019re full of warning. \u201cI thought we all agreed no extra stops.\u201d His voice is so controlled it sends a chill down my spine.</p><p>Laylen slides the keys out of the ignition and keeps his voice unvarying. \u201cBefore you start getting your panties up in a bunch, hear me out. Trust me; you\u2019ll want what\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d Alex lets out a cynical laugh. \u201cAre you kidding me? I already trusted you and look where it got us.\u201d</p><p>Laylen thrums his fingers on top of the steering wheel. \u201cThe Sword of Immortality is here...\u201d He points at the closest building. \u201cAt the Black Dungeon.\u201d</p><p>Alex balls his hands into fists and a vein in his neck bulges. \u201cAnd why is it at the Black Dungeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost it during a poker game a few months ago,\u201d Laylen answers evenly. \u201cI thought I had an unbeatable hand. Turns out, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight.\u201d Alex is livid. \u201cYou stole it from the Keepers just so you could lose it in a poker game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stole it for a good reason,\u201d Laylen replies. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave it in the Keepers\u2019 hands after I became immortal. You guys made it very clear about your feelings for me when I changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t kill you.\u201d Aislin presses her hand to her chest, flabbergasted. \u201cLaylen, how could you ever think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth,\u201d he says simply, not meeting her eyes, instead he\u2019s staring at the street sign.</p><p>Silence takes over. Dogs howl in the distance. Tension pollutes the air. It\u2019s at that moment that I realize just how out of the loop I am. They have history, they understand the secrets of the world; the one\u2019s no one believes in because believing in them is too terrifying for the average person.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but what exactly is the Sword of Immortality?\u201d I finally dare to speak.</p><p>\u201cExactly what it sounds like\u2014a sword that can kill an immortal,\u201d Alex says, tapping his fingers restlessly against the console. \u201cAnd it would have been really useful back at the cabin. Then maybe we\u2019d have been able to kill a few Death Walkers, instead of running like a bunch of pussies.\u201d</p><p>My fingers curl around the edge of the seat and my nails dig into the leather. \u201cSo, right now, at this very moment, if the Death Walkers show up, we can\u2019t kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we can do is run.\u201d He pauses and I can hear the fury lacing each huff of his breath. \u201cSo what\u2019s the big plan, Laylen? Because now that I know it\u2019s up there, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re walking away until we have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really gotten that far.\u201d Laylen points at a two-story brick building with a crooked rain gutter and a rickety sign on the roof. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s up on the second floor, in a secured display case.\u201d He glances at Aislin. \u201cA display case secured by black magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack magic\u2019s not my specialty,\u201d Aislin utters softly. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Laylen holds her gaze. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>She nods and averts her eyes to the window. \u201cYou know my father would never allow it.\u201d</p><p>He reaches over and delicately touches her arm and I see a glimpse of their history; the ones in the pictures. \u201cI\u2019m sure, if you think really hard, you can figure out a spell that would get us in.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a while and when she speaks, her voice is barely audible. \u201cI could do an effrego alica. It\u2019ll remove the Black magic around the case long enough for us to break it, but, if there are alarms...\u201d She looks at Laylen with sadness in her eyes as she draws her arm away from his hand. \u201cThat I can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Laylen pulls his hand away and rests it on top of the shifter. He looks even sadder, if that\u2019s possible. \u201cIf there are alarms, then we\u2019ll run.\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest plan I\u2019ve ever heard. Besides, how are you going to even get up there? From what I can remember, there are guards all over the bottom floor and the stairway, which is the only way up to the second floor, without flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend that I\u2019m going upstairs to feed off Aislin,\u201d Laylen says flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason they let people up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if one of the guards or someone like Draven goes up there?\u201d Alex asks in a clipped tone. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Draven?\u201d I wonder. \u201cAnd what the hell is in this Black Dungeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots and lots of evil,\u201d Alex mutters as his gaze traces the lines of the nearby buildings.</p><p>\u201cDraven is the owner of the club,\u201d Laylen explains, staring off in deep thought. \u201cAnd someone will have to stand at the bottom of the stairway... You and Gemma can do that and send a text if something is about to walk up. I\u2019ll go up with Aislin and stand guard at the entrance of the room. I\u2019m more than capable of protecting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? You hide? Run?\u201d He frowns. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not the one who is in desperate need to get the sword back,\u201d Laylen points out. \u201cWe can either leave, Aislin and I can go in blind and try to get the sword, or we can all go in and watch each other\u2019s backs and have a better chance at getting in and out undetected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need that sword.\u201d Alex flops back in the seat, bumping my shoulder. \u201cAnd what about Gemma? She\u2019s going to stand out like a sore thumb down in that crowd.\u201d</p><p>I run my hands along the front of the dress. \u201cI thought you guys said this would help me blend in?\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re innocence is written all over you; they\u2019ll eat you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally?\u201d My voice cracks.</p><p>His gaze slides to me and he analyzes me through hooded eyes. \u201cIt depends on what literal we\u2019re talking about, but to clarify, I mean they\u2019re going to want to get their hands and teeth all over you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say to that, so I keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cShe could pretend she\u2019s one of them,\u201d Aislin suggests. \u201cAnd you know how they view Black Angels that aren\u2019t locked up\u2014they\u2019re like goddesses to the Immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t pull it off,\u201d Alex states bluntly. \u201cShe\u2019s too reserved and weak.\u201d</p><p>I slug him in the upper arm. Not to prove a point, but because he\u2019s pissed me off. \u201cI\u2019m not weak. I\u2019ve put up with a lot of shit over my lifetime.\u201d</p><p>He winces a little and then his fingers cover his arm. He scans up my legs, my dress, my neck and lips, finally stopping at my eyes. \u201cYou really think you can go in there and pretend like you\u2019re a powerful, domineering, Angel from hell.\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though doubt floods my body. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It is such a lie, but he buys it. Or maybe he just decides not to care so much about me and care more about the sword. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll hang out on the bottom floor in the club area, next to the stairway. Aislin and Laylen you\u2019ll go up and get the Goddamn sword.\u201d Laylen starts to open the door when Alex reaches forward and snags the collar of his shirt. His eyes go dark and his voice comes out in a low growl. \u201cIf you\u2019re up to something, I\u2019ll get the sword myself and use it on you.\u201d</p><p>Aislin\u2019s eyes widen and so do mine. Laylen stares at Alex inexpressively and then nods his head once. Only then, does Alex release him. As I climb out of the car, I know I\u2019m in over my head. Vampires. Witches. Werewolves. Hell\u2019s Angels. No matter how many supernatural books I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s a hell of a lot different than real life.</p><p>The moon illuminates against the alley and lights up the puddles on the ground. The air reeks of mold and wet dogs, and the garbage cans ooze filth onto the ground that crunches beneath my shoes.</p><p>Laylen stops in front of a rusty door at the back end of a warehouse and holds his fist to the door. \u201cIs everyone ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Alex gestures his hand at the door. \u201cBut let\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Laylen lets his hand fall against the door. A couple of seconds later a small flap at the top of the door glides open and a pair of dark eyes peer out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the password?\u201d</p><p>Laylen elevates his forearm up to the flap. The flap slips shut and is followed by the sounds of several locks clicking. The hinges creak as the door swings open. Behind it is a man shorter than me with bony arms and greasy black hair. He\u2019s dressed in black jeans, a jacket and across his neck is the same tattoo as Laylen has on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mark mean on his neck,\u201d I whisper to Alex. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leans toward me, keeping his voice low and his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s the Mark of Immortality.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked, but I know I have to remain centered. I\u2019m supposed to be in control, strong, and dominant. I straighten my posture and cross my arms, like I\u2019m the toughest girl... Angel in the world.</p><p>Laylen greets the man by nodding once. \u201cDoug. How\u2019s it going, man?\u201d</p><p>Doug mutters an unfriendly, \u201cIt\u2019s goin\u2019 good. Haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d He takes the three of us in with a skeptical look. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p> <p>Laylen plays it cool with his gaze steadfast on Doug. \u201cThey\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Doug raises an accusing eyebrow. \u201cThey got the mark.\u201d</p><p>Laylen braces his arm against the wall. \u201cLook, I know you let people in here without the mark. In fact, there\u2019s a feeding ground upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Feeding ground. I\u2019m definitely in over my head. Alex must have sense my apprehension, too, because he laces his fingers with mine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Doug steps back inside and starts to shut the door.</p> <p>Laylen sticks his hand out and slams his palm against the door, holding it open. \u201cYou can\u2019t have double standards Doug. I know you let mortals in.\u201d</p><p>Doug narrows his eyes. \u201cLet go of the fucking door, before I break your arm off.\u201d</p><p>I start to laugh because the idea of a tiny man like Doug breaking Laylen\u2019s arm off seems ludicrous, but I stop when Laylen lowers his arm swiftly and darts back. Doug begins to shut the door again when Aislin marches forward.</p><p>\u201cSomno iam!\u201d she exclaims as her arm snaps out in front of her.</p><p>Doug groans as he clutches at his heart and then his eyes roll back into his head. \u201cYou...\u201d His body goes rigid, his shoulders jerk upward and his knees lock. His body aligns in a perfectly straight line before he falls backward and hits the floor.</p><p>Aislin lowers her hand back to the side and a huge grin expands across her face. \u201cSee, we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p> <p>Laylen nods his head and his eyes widen. \u201cWell, alright, I guess that works.\u201d</p><p>Aislin hops over the unconscious Doug and Laylen follows after her. When he is inside, he bends down and hooks his arms underneath Doug\u2019s. Then, with a grunt, he drags him inside and Alex and I walk freely through the doorway. Once we are all in, Laylen slams the door and fastens the locks.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Laylen says and heads toward a brick archway on the other side of the room. \u201cLet\u2019s make this quick before someone either finds him or he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>We walk down a slender hallway extending from the archway, Laylen and Aislin in front, Alex and I in the back. I notice the metal lanterns that hang on the stone walls have the Immortality mark on them. I\u2019m catching on that this is an all-exclusive Immortal club with a feeding ground upstairs, but, even with that concept, nothing could ever prepare me for what I walk into.</p><p>At the end of the hall, the area opens up into a large, but crowded room. Lanterns dangle from the ceiling, fueled by fire, not electricity. The red ceiling lights sparkle across the marble floor and there\u2019s a balcony above with a spiral staircase twisting up to it and connecting the two floors. That\u2019s the easy part to take in. It\u2019s the lower half that is intense.</p><p>There\u2019s a dance floor in the middle of the room and it\u2019s crammed with people, swaying hypnotically to the low beat of Deftones \u201cChange.\u201d They\u2019re tall, short, fat, and thin; some have pale skin and other\u2019s scaly skin. There are fangs coming out of people\u2019s mouth and fur growing on their bodies. They are touching each other, drinking; some are half naked, shirts off, wearing clothes that barely cover any skin.</p><p>In each of the four corners of the room, there are life-size, iron-rod birdcages. Trapped inside the cages are the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen. Their legs are extensive, their skin smooth and their lips a pale blue. Black-feathered wings sprout from their shoulder blades and a whip curls up their arms. Each has a black leather dress on that resembles mine and their hair is as black as ash. They are twirling around a pole in the center of the cage and with each movement, I feel a pull towards them; they are hypnotic. Several people around the room seem mesmerized by them, like they feel the pull too.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Black Angels,\u201d I say over the music as I turn to Alex. I\u2019m surprised to find that he\u2019s watching me intently. \u201cAren\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>He nods once. \u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>I peer over my shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you guys think I look like them. They have wings and they move so confidently, like they own everyone. They\u2019re so... beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one\u2019s that walk outside their cages don\u2019t have wings.\u201d He sketches a line between my shoulder blades and my body counters with a shudder. \u201cAnd the last part you\u2019ll be fine with. It\u2019s the middle I\u2019m worried about.\u201d He waits to see if I catch on to his hidden meaning.</p><p>I do, but remain composed because that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to be doing.</p><p>\u201cWe should get this over with,\u201d Laylen says, removing his cell phone from his pocket. \u201cIf anything at all happens, we\u2019ll text each other.\u201d</p><p>Alex nods and then Aislin and Laylen start to head across the dance floor, but Alex catches Aislin by the arm. \u201cWait, how are you guys going to get it out without being noticed?\u201d</p><p>Aislin\u2019s eyes twinkle and she snaps her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s called magic.\u201d</p><p>He lets her go and she follows Laylen as he shoves his way through the crowd and onto the dance floor. Seconds later, the crowd swallows them.</p><p>Alex immediately snatches ahold of my hand and steers me toward the bar that\u2019s next to the dance floor and off center with the stairway. We can\u2019t see the bottom because of all the people, but I can see the rest of it. I keep my eyes glued to it, even when people run into me; trusting Alex to lead the way. When I see Laylen and Aislin emerge onto the midsection of the stairway, I relax and allow myself a quick glance around the room.</p><p>There are people and creatures in booths eating dinner, at the bar ordering shots. A lot of attention is magnetized toward me; quick glances from some of them, but others rudely stare. I adjust my shoulders higher and move to Alex\u2019s side because it seems like a domineering move. We walk up to the bar together and Alex pulls out a barstool for me.</p><p>I sit down, swing my legs to the front and rest my arms on the transparent countertop that shows the alcohol bottles lined up underneath it, along with a vat of red, thick liquid. I pretend I\u2019m okay. Completely in control. Until the bartender strolls up and I\u2019m reminded just how na\u00efve I am.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I getcha?\u201d He\u2019s tall with wide-ranging shoulders and there is a tiny mole just above his lip that I can\u2019t take my eyes off of.</p><p>All my innocence shines through. \u201cUmm... What are the choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo shots of vodka.\u201d Alex pats his hand on the counter.</p><p>The bartender nods and swings a rag over his shoulder as he backs away. He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off me until he\u2019s at the back counter and has to turn around to collect the glasses.</p><p>Alex leans over in the stool. \u201cJust knock it back quickly and try not to choke.\u201d</p><p>I bend my body to the side until our heads are touching. \u201cCan\u2019t I just not drink?\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head and gives a quick glance at the stairway. \u201cAct tough, remember?\u201d</p><p>Drinking is tough? Or maybe he wants me to do it for another reason? Sighing, I turn toward the counter and then jump when I come face to face with the creepy bartender. It takes a lot to shove down the scream in my throat.</p><p>His face is only inches away from mine. \u201cYou one of them, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d My voice comes out steady and I do an internal happy dance.</p><p>\u201cI very much would like to know.\u201d He relocates back just a little and sets two tall shot glasses down on the counter. They\u2019re filled with a clear liquid that smells like gasoline. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d put money on it.\u201d When I say nothing, he backs away with a sly grin on his face.</p><p>I swivel in the barstool, freeing a loud breath. The music is loud enough that it goes unnoticed, though. \u201cWhat a weirdo.\u201d</p><p>Alex picks up a shot glass. \u201cTake a look around Gemma. This place is full of nothing but weirdoes.\u201d He raises the glass to his lips and angles his neck back, sucking out the drink in one long gulp. His neck muscles move as he swallows it, then he lowers the glass and sets it back on the counter.</p><p>As weird as it is, I\u2019ve never drank before. I put the glass to my lips, hold my breath and tip my chin up, letting the drink spill into my mouth and flood my throat. It feels like acid ripping away at my esophagus and stomach muscles. I seal my lips shut, forcing myself to choke it down as I drop the glass down on the counter. I can\u2019t breathe. Can\u2019t think. My blood and my heart flare with potent heat. \u201cWhy the fuck did you have me drink that?\u201d I mutter through a soft gag.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d he whispers, glancing around the room with his arms crossed. \u201cOr you\u2019re going to black out.\u201d</p><p>I inhale through my nose and it makes my lips stutter. The choke and burn propel up my throat and I start to lean forward to hack. Alex meets me in the middle, rendering me motionless with a touch of his hand on my arm. He pushes me upright, makes me sit up straight, then he bends forward and suddenly his lips are on mine. At first, I think he\u2019s trying to hurt me because his mouth is pressed against mine so hard it feels like the skin is going to bruise. He\u2019s strong. And fierce. His hands come down on my hips and he jerks me forward as his tongue slips into my mouth. The taste of him inside my mouth smothers the alcohol and I still can\u2019t breathe, but for a whole different reason.</p><p>He continues kissing me, grabbing at strands of my hair so he can tip my head back and devour my mouth, but as quickly as it starts, it strikes a dead end as his lips leave mine without forewarning.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d he breathes demandingly and I\u2019m confused because I thought that I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to be domineering.</p><p>I don\u2019t protest, though, as he guides me to my feet and directs me toward the dance floor. I try to stay next to him, but the tightness of the dress limits my legs\u2019 mobility. I also feel dizzy and my limbs are kind of heavy. Walking suddenly seems to be the most complex thing in the world and, after a lot of staggering, he finally wraps his arm around my back to support me.</p><p>As we reach the crowd, I tuck in my elbows, but then put them back out, not wanting to seem intimidated. He shoves through the people that smell like sweat, as well as rust, and when we finally arrive in the middle, he stops. There\u2019s a blond girl to my right with fangs poking out of her mouth and she\u2019s dancing with a guy that has pointy ears. To my left, is a woman with purple hair made of thick strands that have heads with eyes at the end.</p><p>\u201cI did see someone with snakes for hair.\u201d I utter to Alex. \u201cThat night at the cabin.\u201d</p><p>He stands in front of me with his eyes fastened on the stairway just over my shoulder. \u201cYeah, you shouldn\u2019t have been able to see that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain why in the car.\u201d There\u2019s a silent cautioning in his eyes, so I zip my lips and shuffle closer to him as I\u2019m elbowed in the back and the side. It\u2019s overwhelming; too many people and too many sexy moves going on. I\u2019m struggling to remain collected.</p><p>Luckily, the song switches to a slower, more sensual beat and everyone mellows to grind against each other. I\u2019m not sure what to do or why we are out here, but Alex takes the lead. He puts his hand on my hip and lures me to him with his eyes on me. He slides his hand slowly up my side, along my ribs and to my shoulders where it starts to drift downward. His skin is searing hot against my arm and when he arrives at my wrist I practically die from the heat. He grips my wrist forcefully; pressing his fingers into my skin, then lifts my arm up and positions my hand on top of his shoulder.</p><p>My body is very much alive, awake and in tune when he does the same thing with my other arm. I can\u2019t hold back the moan of pleasure clawing up my throat. I let it out because there\u2019s nothing else to do.</p> <p>The muscles in his jaw twitches as he places his hands on my hips and entices me toward him until our bodies are connected. He begins swaying us to the music and rubbing against me with each movement. His green eyes are black below the inadequate lighting and his lips are blood red. He inches his mouth toward my ear and breathes against my skin. \u201cThe bartender was on to you. I had to find a way to get you out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy kissing me?\u201d I ask, breathless.</p><p>His fingertips knead my hips. \u201cThat was to get you to stop choking.\u201d He pulls back a little. \u201cAnd the dancing is to get you into the crowd and away from wandering eyes. You stand out way too much.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the blond girl with fangs and she\u2019s nipping at pointy-eared guy\u2019s neck. He lets out a groan similar to the one I let out just seconds ago. \u201cI think I blend in pretty well,\u201d I say.</p><p>His brow teases upward. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I slip my hands farther up his shoulders and down to his back. When my palms are covering his shoulder blades, I dig my nails in and pull him closer. \u201cIn fact, I think I have this whole Angel thing down pretty well.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, grinning haughtily. \u201cYou\u2019d be screwed if I wasn\u2019t here to guide you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t here, then I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d My head is getting hazy and uncensored words are slipping out of my mouth.</p><p>He frowns. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>He grows quiet, takes a step back to add room between us, and his attention leaves me as his eyes drift to the stairway. It bugs me because I want them on me. I want him to look at me. Touch me. Be only about me. I\u2019m becoming very needy and the feeling consumes me.</p><p>I hook a finger underneath his chin and make him look at me. \u201cI thought you brought me out here to dance?\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows dip together. \u201cNo, I brought you out here to keep you hidden and to keep an eye on the stairway.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and scratch him with my nails as I draw my hand away. \u201cI want to dance, just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>His eyes go squinty as he scrutinizes my facial features and eyes. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head with sureness even though I have no idea what being drunk feels like. \u201cNo, I\u2019m perfectly sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood because you only had one shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and I clamp down on his shoulders and force him to diminish the space he\u2019s put between us. His eyes enlarge and his lips part in shock. Without another thought, I bend my head forward and collide our lips. The music is loud and drenches my body in lyrics as I bask in the taste of him. My head spins with vapor as I suck his lip into my mouth. He groans loudly, and I bite down on his lip and let my hands trail down his back with my nails aiming downward so I\u2019m gently scratching his skin.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d he murmurs as his hand moves from my hip to my back, then creeps downward. He cups my ass and crushes my body against his. I\u2019m drowning in blackness and he is my air.</p> <p>I seal our lips together and his tongue willingly slips into mine. I feel his breath enter my mouth and the compulsion for more takes over me. My hands glide up his back and I fasten my arms around his neck. I taste him thoroughly as I stand on my tiptoes and climb on top of him. His breath hitches in his throat as I hook my legs around his midsection, allowing his hardness to press against me. It\u2019s stimulating and makes my body crave more, so I cling onto him and writhe my hips up and down, rubbing up against him.</p><p>A deep, throaty groan escapes from him and he reciprocates by pushing his body closer to mine. His hand slip between my legs and his eyes are shut, but mine refuse to close. I can see everything. Feel everything. I\u2019m high. I\u2019m centered. I\u2019m in control.</p><p>People are dancing recklessly and it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a movie that\u2019s stuck on fast forward; none of it can be real. Alex is kissing me, feeling me, touching me and making me feel like I\u2019ve been starved. My arms begin to tremble and when I glance down at them, my skin is covered in black veins like tar has replaced my blood. The veins are crawling across my skin and I start to scream. I\u2019m falling. Floating. What am I doing?</p><p>Alex jerks back and his lips are moving, but I can\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying. I unhitch my jaw to speak, but my voice is noiseless. My eyes roll into the back of my head and my limbs go limp. I begin to sink to the ground and I\u2019m not sure how far down it is before I hit.</p><p>Or, if I\u2019ll ever hit anything.</p><p>Maybe I just fall and fall and fall.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I\u2019m drowning in a black ocean and the clouds above rain ash. The water is hot and my skin is covered in blisters. It\u2019s burning me alive and filling my lungs with venom. I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m...</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d Alex\u2019s voice floats through my dream of death.</p><p>My eyes roll into the back of my head as my eyelashes flutter open. My head is resting on Alex\u2019s lap and the streetlights outside highlight the concern on his face. He has a bite mark just below his lip and long red marks on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d My voice is hoarse.</p><p>He lets out a sigh of relief. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d Aislin asks.</p><p>I realize we\u2019re in the backseat of the GTO and that she is in the passenger seat. There\u2019s a scratch on her forehead, two holes in her neck and her hair has fallen out of the pins.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have bite marks on your neck? And why does Alex have those red lines on his?\u201d I begin to sit up and my brain throbs against my skull. I press the heel of my hand to my forehead and wince. \u201cOw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie back down,\u201d Alex insists and guides me back down onto his lap. \u201cDon\u2019t try to sit up until we know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask, situating my head into his lap. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Laylen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaylen went into the Wicca shop to check things out before we all go in.\u201d He brushes my hair away from my forehead. \u201cAnd what happened is someone slipped you a sensualis augendae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d My voice cracks. \u201cA date rape drug?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and then hesitates. \u201cNot a drug, but a spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone put a date rape spell on me? I bet it was the bartender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been a lot of people. There was too much attention on you and... well, like I said, you radiate innocence. I should have never brought you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarried you... Can\u2019t you remember? You put up quite a fight.\u201d</p><p>My eyes enlarge as my mind sifts through the cloudy images of what happened. I\u2019d been all over him, practically attacked him. \u201cI scratched your neck, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He covers the lines with his hand. \u201cYeah, but don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I reach out to touch his neck.</p><p>He lowers his hand and lets my fingers graze the lines. \u201cI said, don\u2019t worry about it. Trust me. It wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d The look in his eyes and the huskiness of his voice makes me wonder if he thinks it was good.</p><p>I fix my attention to Aislin and the holes in her neck. There\u2019s dried blood around each one and the skin has a ring of red around it. \u201cDid you get bitten?\u2019</p><p>She sighs deeply. \u201cYeah, we ended up running into Draven. Luckily, it was after I made the sword invisible with a charm, but, still, there are consequences for me being up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a Keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... So he bit you as a punishment?\u201d I summon my energy and drag my body upright, sliding my feet off the seat and onto the floor. I feel like it\u2019s partially my fault for not being able to play a good Black Angel and getting poisoned. \u201cAislin, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She covers her mouth and clears her throat, squirming uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>I glance back and forth between Alex and Aislin; finally Alex explains, \u201cVampire bites are intoxicating to mortals. The only punishment from a bite is that you\u2019ll want more.\u201d</p><p>My mouth forms an \u2019o.\u2019 Aislin nods, then faces the front of the cab and stares at the small, brick building with a crescent moon outlined by a black star painted on the window. I notice that there is the same mark on the back of Aislin\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that on your shoulder?\u201d I ask. \u201cA tattoo, or a mark, like Laylen\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t represent the same thing as Laylen\u2019s.\u201d She sketches the outline of the tattoo with her finger. \u201cBut it is a mark\u2014the witch\u2019s mark. After I became a witch, it appeared there.\u201d She lifts her foot onto the console and flips the ceiling light on. On her ankle there is a ring of golden flames that trims a black circle. \u201cAnd this one appeared because I have Keeper blood inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they just all of a sudden show up?\u201d I ask, gripping my head. \u201cOut of the blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Keeper\u2019s mark appeared when I was about twelve, which was also about the same time I really started learning about what it means to be a Keeper.\u201d Aislin returns her foot to the floor. \u201cAnd my witch\u2019s mark showed up when I was about fifteen, which was when I first found out I possess Wicca magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everyone has their own mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, there are a ton of them. One for vampires, pixies, fey, Foreseers...\u201d She trails off as she takes in the shocked look on my face. \u201cOh, yeah, I guess I should have started out by explaining that, yes, those things do exist.\u201d</p><p>I nod as I lower my hand from my head. \u201cI just didn\u2019t realize how true it all is.\u201d</p><p>Alex leans forward to capture my gaze. \u201cHow true what is?\u201d</p><p>I turn to face him. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve read. I thought all of the creatures were just made up.\u201d</p><p>His lips tug up into a small smile. \u201cBooks are like a gateway to real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d I bend my neck and rest my head on the back of the seat. \u201cSo how many marks do you have?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He eyes me perceptively. \u201cI just have the Keepers\u2019 mark.\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hair behind my ear, remembering how I saw it when he answered the door shirtless back at his apartment. \u201cOh yeah, the one on the side of your ribs.\u201d</p><p>He brings his leg up on the seat as he turns his body toward me. A sly grin spreads across his face. \u201cIf you need a refresher, I can show you it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I blame the eager response on the remains of the Rufi magic spell inside my body.</p> <p>\u201cAlex,\u201d Aislin hisses. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of the car if you don\u2019t want to see,\u201d he says without taking his eyes off me.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she refuses. \u201cIf I get out, you two will probably screw each other on the backseat.\u201d</p><p>In the snap of a finger, Alex goes from hot to cold. He slumps back into the seat and his Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he swallows hard. I come to the conclusion right then that maybe Alex suffers from a bipolar disorder. He\u2019s so emotionally erratic. First, he hates me. Then, he kisses me, touches me, and makes me moan. Sometimes, I irritate him. Sometimes, he\u2019s teasing me.</p><p>Aislin heaves a huge sigh of relief. \u201cOh good, we can go in.\u201d</p> <p>I track her gaze to the front of the store and Laylen is beneath the entry waving us in. None of us speak as we climb out and enter the store, which fortunately doesn\u2019t have any costumers but us.</p><p>The air smells like sage, as well as oregano, and the black and white checkerboard floor has the witch\u2019s mark painted in the middle. Glass counters border the walls that display jewelry, candles, and incense. On the shelves, behind the counter, there are creepy, almost disturbing objects. The worst is a statue of a naked man and woman kneeling down in front of each other. Extending out of the woman\u2019s back is a large spider with a set of fangs aimed at the man\u2019s head.</p><p>Aislin browses the room, trailing her fingers along the glass. \u201cWhere\u2019s Adessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be down in just a minute.\u201d Laylen relaxes against a display case and his eyes wander to me. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling embarrassed because he knows\u2014everyone knows\u2014that I basically tried to rape Alex in the middle of the club. But Alex didn\u2019t seem too eager to stop me either.</p><p>I walk around the room, wondering what it means. Had he been under a spell or did he really just want me? I come across a small glass ball filled with violet ribbons positioned in a stand. I peer down inside it, curious if I\u2019ll see my future. Maybe I\u2019m a Foreseer, although that can\u2019t be true. I don\u2019t have a mark.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, you might get stuck inside that.\u201d Alex suddenly appears by my side and I jump, startled. \u201cIt\u2019s a Foreseer\u2019s crystal ball.\u201d</p><p>I throw my hand over my accelerating heart. \u201cJesus! You scared the shit out of me.\u201d I catch my breath and glance back at the ball. \u201cSo, this is what they look into to see the future.\u201d</p><p>He nods and flicks his fingers against the crystal ball. \u201cBut they have to go inside to see the future. So please be careful. We don\u2019t want you getting stuck in one.\u201d</p><p>I lower my hand from my chest. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Foreseer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re... different. I\u2019m afraid the power inside you might set it off.\u201d He raps his fingers on the crystal ball again. \u201cIn fact, you probably shouldn\u2019t touch anything in here at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding the floor,\u201d I say with acerbity. \u201cBecause that seems like it would be very tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does sound pretty tricky.\u201d He leans in toward me and drops his voice. \u201cI think you know that\u2019s not what I meant, so quit being a smartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re being an ass.\u201d I inch forward and invade his personal space and am rewarded with gratification when he jolts from the sparks that overwhelms us. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. One minute you\u2019re being nice to me and the next you\u2019re being a jerk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m conflicted,\u201d he states, touching the scratches on his neck.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout doing what I want and what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to ask him what he wants to do, but a woman stoops through the beaded entryway and steps into the room. She\u2019s around thirty-years-old or so with cat-shaped eyes and her black hair flows to her waist and curls up at the ends. She wears a blue velvet dress, large hooped earrings, an array of metal bracelets, and her skin is the color of honey.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you all. I\u2019m Adessa, the owner of this store and a second generation witch.\u201d Her voice is smooth like silk. \u201cLaylen told me that one of you is a witch yourself and is looking for a Vectum Crystal.\u201d Her eyes land on me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and point at Aislin. \u201cNo, not me... her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm... that\u2019s interesting.\u201d She assesses me for a split second longer, and then turns to Aislin. \u201cSo, what particular one are you looking for, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been using the purple amethyst.\u201d Aislin rearranges her golden-brown hair so it will cover up the bite marks on her neck. \u201cBut since we have to travel a long distance, I think maybe the gold-leafed one would work better.\u201d</p><p>Adessa twists the chain of her necklace around her finger. \u201cHow long of a distance is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about 500 miles,\u201d Aislin says. \u201cGive or take a few.\u201d</p><p>Adessa unravels the necklace from her finger and walks behind the counter. \u201cI think I have something that will work even better than the gold one.\u201d She tips her chin up and draws an invisible rectangle in the air with her finger. One of the shelves flattens into the wall and disappears. My mouth drops agape as a door appears in its place. Adessa flicks her hand and the door swings open.</p><p>\u201cAfter you,\u201d Adessa says to Aislin with a motion of her hand.</p><p>Aislin bites down on her lip and tentatively steps inside. Adessa follows her, then a red light beams throughout the room and the door slams shut.</p><p>I\u2019m teetering somewhere between fascination and terror. \u201cMagic blows my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s fascinating, then wait until you start traveling to other cities and worlds.\u201d Laylen strolls up beside me and rests his arm on the countertop.</p><p>I hop up onto the counter and cross my legs. \u201cOther cities and worlds?\u201d</p><p>He unfastens the clip on his leather watch and resizes the band. \u201cYeah, like the City of Crystal. The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Afterlife.\u201d Alex strolls up on the other side of me with a look of possessiveness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe Afterlife?\u201d I ask, tugging the bottom of my dress down. \u201cLike, The Land of the Dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d He slides his arm along the counter until it touches my hip. I guess he\u2019s conflicted again, but I wonder if he\u2019s doing what\u2019s right, or what he wants. Maybe the Keepers are making him get close to me. The thought nearly strangles me. I want him to want me, just like the song says.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of worlds for the dead,\u201d Laylen says and hops up onto the counter beside me. He lets his long legs dangle to the floor as he nudges me playfully with his elbow. \u201cOne day, I\u2019ll have to explain them all to you.\u201d</p><p>Alex unexpectedly places a hand on my thigh and he draws me closer to him. \u201cIf she has questions, she can ask me.\u201d</p><p>Laylen gives him an innocent look. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Alex? Afraid she\u2019ll hear the truth?\u201d</p><p>Alex grinds his teeth and grips onto my leg harder. Laylen looks amused as he hops off the counter and then walks toward the other side of the room. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he calls out.</p><p>Alex keeps hold of my leg, but stays quiet. I try to pretend that it isn\u2019t making me think dirty thoughts, but there are so many sensations running between my legs that I\u2019m pretty sure I could have an orgasm at any moment.</p><p>I need a distraction. \u201cWhy did Adessa think I was the witch?\u201d My voice sounds raspy.</p><p>Alex gives me no relief as he slips his hand higher onto my thigh. \u201cProbably because of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I absentmindedly touch the corner of my eye. \u201cAre they that weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re weird,\u201d he says as his hand brushes the hem of my dress. \u201cBut in a good way.\u201d His fingers slip underneath the leather. \u201cThey\u2019re mesmerizing.\u201d</p><p>Sparks kiss my entire body, from my toes to my legs to my neck, and my back begins to curve forward. I think it will stop him, but instead he glances over at Laylen who is distracted by a box on one of the shelves. Then he delves higher until his fingers touch the edge of my panties.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop with you.\u201d There\u2019s a plea in his voice, like he\u2019s begging me to make him stop. Like I have that kind of control of the situation. I\u2019m helpless as my legs uncross and my body begins to recline back on the counter. It\u2019s disturbing because Laylen is right there and I don\u2019t care. All I want is for his fingers to search a little bit higher.</p><p>Alex makes this funny noise in the back of his throat and then my back brushes glass. The crystal ball rolls underneath me and I feel a current rush up my spine and slam into the nape of my neck.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes bulge as his nails plunge into me. \u201cNoooo!\u201d</p><p>I feel my body being pulled into pieces, each limb disconnecting from my center, as I\u2019m sucked away into a blanket of darkness.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>I\u2019m falling, deep and fast into an unknown place. Maybe it\u2019s an abyss and I\u2019ll never reach an end. Fear consumes me as I realize that I might spend the rest of my life falling.</p><p>A white light abruptly appears below my feet. As I plunge closer, it begins to shimmer like glass hitting the sunlight, brighter and brighter until it becomes so vibrant I have to shut my eyes. I tuck my knees to my chest as warmth swathes me. Then, I suck in a breath as my knees slam into the ground and plunge into moist dirt and grass.</p><p>My body flips forward and my face lands in the grass. My knees feel bruised, but I leap to my feet and take in the scenery. Orange and pink leaves skip across the grass, which stretches for miles until it reaches the trees. There\u2019s also a lake and the water shimmers in the sunlight. The place is strangely familiar, but I can\u2019t quite figure out why. It\u2019s the same sensation I had when I drifted to the field with the mother and daughter. Was that what that was? A vision, like this? There hadn\u2019t been a crystal ball, though.</p><p>I check to make sure my stitches are okay when a streak of purple whizzes by and I jump back with my hand against my heart. A little girl, wearing a purple dress, runs up to the shore of the lake and spins in the sand. She\u2019s around four or five-years-old with long brown hair flapping in the wind. She kind of reminds me of the girl in the field. Her face is distorted by a haze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too close to the lake,\u201d a voice calls out from behind me.</p><p>I whirl around just as a boy runs past me with his arms stretched outward. He looks to be a few years older than the little girl. He has dark brown hair and his face is blurry also. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need to be careful,\u201d he warns. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fall in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the little girl replies, teeter-tottering at the edge of the water. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just move away,\u201d he begs with his hand extended out to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to swim.\u201d</p><p>She takes ahold of his hand and he leads her away from the lake. \u201cYou always save me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cYou two, get over here right now!\u201d The sound of a man\u2019s voice makes the color of the land around me dim and the hairs on my arms stand on end. He\u2019s tall, husky, with jet-black hair similar to Marco\u2019s. He wears a black button-down shirt, grey slacks and has a gold chain around his neck. And like the children, his face is also obscured.</p><p>He marches with confidence, each stride firm and in control. He\u2019s intimidating and disturbs my nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go,\u201d his voice ices out at the children. \u201cGet your asses back to the castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d the girl asks as she clutches onto the boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201d the man bellows. \u201cYou never ask me questions. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>I hear the soft tread of approaching footsteps and then a slender figure dashes by me. She has long brown hair and she\u2019s wearing a floral dress. I think it might be the mother and daughter from the field.</p><p>She scoops the girl up in her arms and hugs her protectively. \u201cYou stay the hell away from her!\u201d she shouts at the man.</p><p>Her presence brings warmth to the darkness the man instilled and the two combine to create a recipe of emotions that makes me nauseous. I squat down to the ground, feeling like I\u2019m going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cThis is not your decision,\u201d the man snaps and, in two long strides, is standing in her face. \u201cYou knew when she was born that this would have to happen one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy, I\u2019m scared,\u201d the girl whispers as she buries her head into her mother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>The mother smoothes back the girl\u2019s hair and kisses the top of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, sweetie. You don\u2019t need to be scared. I promise I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d The man turns to the boy and points his finger at a hill. \u201cGo inside, right now.\u201d</p><p>The boy glances from the man to the girl, torn on what to do. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare mouth off to me!\u201d the man shouts and the skin on his neck tints red. \u201cNow, get your ass inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice shakes as he bows his head and trudges up the hill toward a grey stoned castle with lofty towers and a peaking roof that stretches high into the clouds.</p><p>The man reels back to the woman. \u201cNow, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\u201d</p><p>She stands defiantly, holding her daughter in her arms as she steps back. \u201cYou aren\u2019t taking her anywhere. She\u2019s my daughter, not yours. You don\u2019t own everything in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit I don\u2019t.\u201d He pauses and the woman continues to back away. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be the hard way, then.\u201d He lunges at the woman and steals the little girl from her arms, even though the girl kicks and hits at him.</p><p>The woman screams as she reaches her arms out toward her daughter, but the man draws out a knife from his pocket and she freezes.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d she whispers with her fists balled at her sides. \u201cYou need her too much.\u201d</p><p>The man aligns the sharp point of the knife closer to the girl\u2019s neck. \u201cHurting her won\u2019t make her useless, just scarred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d the mother begs, clasping her hands in front of her.</p><p>The girl hovers back from the knife. \u201cMomma, help me.\u201d</p><p>Keeping a hold of the knife, the man reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a small black bag. \u201cOr, if you want, I can use this?\u201d He tips his head down at the girl. \u201cHey, sweetie, how would you like to go for a swim in the lake?\u201d</p><p>The girl shrinks back. \u201cBut I can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d the man coaxes as he begins to untie the bag. \u201cSomeone will be there to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off!\u201d the mother screams and storms towards them. \u201cShe\u2019s just a little girl. And\u2014and if you put her there, then you can\u2019t get her back.\u201d</p><p>The man laughs, throwing his head back, and shoves the woman back. \u201cThere are ways to get her back when I need her. She would probably be better off down there, anyway, until it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>The woman stumbles, but quickly stands back up. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t; just as long as you get into the lake yourself,\u201d the man says. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a choice. It\u2019s either you or her.\u201d</p><p>I leap to my feet. Go in the lake! Why!? Was he going to try and drown her? Fighting down the vomit burning at the back of my throat, I walk towards them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get away with this.\u201d Her voice is edging toward hysteria. \u201cI know the real reason why you want her and, sooner or later, someone else is going to figure it out. You\u2019ll never be able to get away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I highly doubt it. I have everyone wrapped around my little finger.\u201d He sets the girl down on the ground, puts the knife out in front of him, and points his finger at the castle. \u201cGo inside now.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms and elevates her chin. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving my mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d the man hollers and crows caw from the trees.</p><p>The girl steps forward, getting closer to the man. \u201cYou are a very, very bad man.\u201d</p><p>The man targets the sharp side of the blade at her face. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on inside, sweetie,\u201d her mother says and gestures her daughter to go. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>It takes the girl a second, but she finally lowers her arms, and heads toward the castle. My heart breaks for them, knowing somehow that it will be the last time they\u2019ll see each other. The girl will grow up motherless. There will forever be an empty hole in her heart and all she\u2019ll want is to feel love, but maybe it will never be possible because this moment will shatter her.</p><p>There are so many similarities between the little girl and me, and I wonder if that\u2019s why I\u2019m seeing this vision. Am I going to meet the girl one day? Am I supposed to help her?</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s time to deal with you.\u201d The man lets a pause drag out as birds caw in the distances and circle above our heads \u201cGet in the lake.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. No. This can\u2019t be happening. I don\u2019t want to see this, yet, I can\u2019t seem to stop running toward them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been planning this all along, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Her voice quivers as she backs toward the shoreline and the man matches her every step. He has the knife in one hand and the bag in the other. \u201cEvery single word that\u2019s come out of your mouth has been a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me well. Now quit stalling and get into the lake. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to force you in and that will make the situation unnecessarily painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about not getting caught.\u201d She reaches the brink of the lake and the waves roll against her ankles. \u201cThere are people who you don\u2019t have wrapped around your finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll have to take care of them as well.\u201d He scoops out a handful of what looks like ash from the bag and then sprinkles it into the lake. It makes the water murky and still.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ve won.\u201d She holds her chin high and submerges her legs into the lake. \u201cSomeday, it will all catch up with you.\u201d</p><p>The water rises to her waist and the lake goes dead calm, like before a storm. The wind stalls and the birds become silent. It\u2019s as if every part of nature knows something bad is going to happen. Like me. My legs fight to reach her, but I hear a swoosh and then the water splashes up. She plunges under the water, her arms flailing before they disappear. I let out a blood-curdling scream that ripples through the stillness. The man turns his back on the drowning woman and strolls away, whistling some funky tune that sounds like a mix between \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World After All\u201d and \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\u201d</p><p>Without even thinking, I jump into the lake, forcing my legs against the pressure as the cold water ascends higher upon my body. When it reaches my chest, I freeze, suddenly remembering that I can\u2019t swim.</p><p>I\u2019m about to backtrack when I feel a set of bony fingers wrap around my ankle and I\u2019m jerked beneath the water. I gurgle as water floods my lungs and mouth. My legs and arms battle to find the surface, but the hand pulls me down into the ice-cold water and keeps dragging me deeper until I can\u2019t hold my breath anymore.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I gasp for air as my eyes shoot open. The first thing I see is Alex\u2019s worried face and then Laylen\u2019s. I\u2019m lying on the cold, tiled floor of Adessa\u2019s store. My skin is dry and my lungs aren\u2019t waterlogged. I can breathe again.</p><p>I scramble to my feet and then grip the counter when the blood rushes to my head. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou touched the Foreseers\u2019 ball after I told you not to.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice shakes slightly. \u201cAnd you went into a vision just like I said you might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident... I was distracted by you trying to...\u201d I trail off when I notice that Laylen is listening intently. \u201cWhatever. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I place my other hand on the counter, trying to control and bury all my emotions; but I can feel each one, like nails being inserted into my heart. He killed her. He made her drown and the girl was left in his hands. What did he do to her when he went back to the castle?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d I pant as my chest rises and falls violently. \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t... I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, look at me.\u201d Laylen\u2019s voice envelops my body.</p><p>I tip my chin up and meet his eyes, which look like deep pools of water. \u201cIf you want me to, I can calm you down.\u201d He glances at Alex, checking.</p><p>I look to my side and Alex steps into my line of vision. He examines my eyes and he must see something horrifying because he nods at Laylen. \u201cGo ahead, but only this one time.\u201d</p><p>I turn back to Laylen and he nods, then places a hand on my shoulder. \u201cAre you okay with it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not exactly sure what he\u2019s going to do to me, but it has to be better than the invisible nails in my heart. \u201cGo ahead. Please.\u201d</p><p>He rests his other hand on my other shoulder and then positions his body in front of me. He slides his hands up my neck, rests them on my cheeks and hunches over so he\u2019s at eye level with me. \u201cIt\u2019ll be just like on the porch, only... less sensual.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He wets his lips with his tongue and shakes his head so his bangs are out of his eyes. \u201cNow close your eyes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Giving one last glance at Alex, I let my eyes close. Images of water and the woman drowning instantly overpower my head, but they fade as tranquility flows down my body. It\u2019s like I\u2019m being kissed all over and those kisses erase every single place the vision has taken in my soul. I\u2019m being healed, sewn back together again. My emotions belong to me.</p><p>\u201cLet your heart settle,\u201d Laylen whispers. \u201cAnd your body relax.\u201d</p><p>I give into his instructions and my knees start to buckle. His hand winds around my back and he braces me against his chest. I feel his lips brush my hair and then he says, \u201cTake her to the car.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking to, but, seconds later, an arm slides behind me and I\u2019m being scooped up into someone\u2019s arm and a current drowns me. I relax against his sturdy chest and let him take me wherever. I\u2019m calm. I\u2019m all right.</p> <p>I hear the bell go off as we exit the store, and then cool night air hits me. The car door squeaks open and he stops moving, leans forward and sets me gently onto the backseat. The leather is cool against my skin and I roll to my side, ready to go to sleep.</p><p>The seat sinks next to my feet and the door slams shut. I know he\u2019s in the car with me, but he remains silent. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d he finally asks.</p><p>I open my eyes, even though I don\u2019t want to. I haven\u2019t slept in ages and I want to sleep. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>His gaze is consuming, even in the dark. \u201cCan I... Can I ask you what you saw? In the vision?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I push myself up and put my feet on the floor. There\u2019s a gap between us and I don\u2019t try to reduce it. I give him a recap of every detail I can remember from the vision and Laylen\u2019s magical touch keeps me at peace through the entire journey.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you were really lucky, right?\u201d Alex mutters when I finish.</p><p>I\u2019m perplexed. \u201cLucky how?\u201d</p><p>He props his boot up on his knee and stares ahead at the street. \u201cFor one thing, I\u2019ve heard stories about people getting stuck inside visions and never returning; and, for another, because you didn\u2019t get captured by the Water Faerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater Faerie?\u201d My dress is crooked and I raise my hips to realign it back into place. \u201cOkay, that needs explaining.\u201d</p><p>He glances at my hips as I lower my ass back to the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s what pulled you and the woman down in the lake. Water Fey are the Guardians of the Underworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Underworld?\u201d I ask. \u201cAs in, the place where the Greeks believed people went after they died?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClose.\u201d He seems hesitant to embellish. \u201cBut it\u2019s not exactly the same.\u201d He takes a deep breath and keeps his eyes ahead. \u201cThe Underworld is the land of the dead. It\u2019s also a prison. After the Keepers capture someone like, say for instance, a vampire that has been on a killing spree, we sentence them to a life in the Underworld as a punishment.\u201d</p><p>I question why he uses a vampire as his example, perhaps as a jab at Laylen. \u201cBut why wouldn\u2019t you just kill them instead? It makes more sense that way and it seems like a far worse punishment.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cTrust me. Death is an easier punishment than getting sent down there. Most go insane from the torture within a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d I pause, drinking in the knowledge he gives me and I connect it with what I know. \u201cDoes that mean the woman I saw get dragged into the lake is going to end up in the Underworld?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he answers with unwillingness. \u201cThe Water Faeries usually don\u2019t kill the people. They are under strict orders to take whatever they catch straight to the prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why do they want prisoners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they feed off the prisoners\u2019 fear. It\u2019s what keeps them thriving, even in their dead form.\u201d</p><p>I hug my arms around myself. Nausea is starting to mix with the tranquility Laylen put in me. \u201cSo, if the vision I saw really ends up happening, then the woman\u2019s going to end up being tortured down in the Underworld.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He sighs, and then moves his foot off his knee and to the floor. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe the future can be changed, especially since we\u2019re trying to do that with the star and the portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t change?\u201d I whisper. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on how strong she is, she could survive the torture for up to a few years without it driving her mad. But once she loses her mind, the Queen will have her killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen of the Dead. She\u2019s in charge of everything that goes on in the Underworld. After a prisoner goes insane, they no longer produce the right kind of fear for her people to feed off of, so she gets rid of them.\u201d</p><p>I feel like banging my head on the window, but my body is too drained to move toward it. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ruthless thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand that most of the creatures we send down there have committed horrible deeds,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe kind of crimes that haunt people\u2019s nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, considering the Death Walkers have killed me over and over again in my nightmares, I can understand that comparison,\u201d I say.</p><p>His head gradually turns toward me, but he doesn\u2019t look at me. Instead he looks over my shoulder at the window. \u201cYou never mentioned before that they killed you.\u201d</p><p>I sit up straight and move my face into his line of vision, trying to get him to look at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I needed to give you the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always want you to give me the details,\u201d he says and closes his eyes. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Why won\u2019t he look at me? \u201cYou don\u2019t think my nightmares are visions, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not even possible for a Foreseer to do.\u201d He opens his eyes and continues to stare over my shoulder at the window. \u201cThey have to have the power of the crystal to channel the psychic energy. But Gemma, I\u2019d really like you to give me the details of the nightmares you keep talking about.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s acting strange, like it hurts him to look at me and be in the car with me. \u201cWell, I want you to give me details, too. About you.\u201d</p><p>He glances at my face, but then swiftly looks back at the window. \u201cThere\u2019s not that much to know.\u201d</p><p>I inch toward the edge of the seat and place myself in his line of vision. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that for one second and I have a great idea. You can start off by telling me why you won\u2019t look me in the eye.\u201d</p><p>He blinks several times and finally meets my eyes. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t like the calm, sleepy look in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes with my fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m just really tired. I haven\u2019t slept in over twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from tiredness.\u201d He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s from Laylen. He put the look there and I don\u2019t like it because you look content and you hardly ever look content.\u201d</p><p>I drag my bottom lip into my mouth and press my knees together, avoiding his accusation. \u201cAlex, I want to know something about you. Something real. Like maybe why you\u2019re so hot and cold all the time? It confuses me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me something real.\u201d I practically beg, because I need things to feel real at the moment, instead of feeling like I\u2019m drowning in a sea of illusions.</p><p>He places his hand beside my leg, not touching me, but close. \u201cThe first time I saw you, I was scared.\u201d</p><p>That isn\u2019t what I expected. \u201cYou seemed pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pissed, too.\u201d He scoots forward and our knees brush. \u201cBut pissed at myself for feeling the way that I did\u2014the way that I do.\u201d His jaw tightens and then his hand moves to my hip. \u201cI was taught not to feel that way.\u201d</p><p>My muscles constrict beneath his touch and every ounce of the comfort Laylen put in me singes into ash. \u201cTo feel what way?\u201d</p><p>His lip part, then he shuts his eyes tightly. \u201cOut of control. Lost. Confused. Terrified. I\u2019m not supposed to let those things get to me.\u201d His eyes open and I suck in a breath at the rawness they emit. \u201cYou want to know something real about me, Gemma? I\u2019m empty. Dead. Completely numb inside, except for when I\u2019m around you. I\u2019m hot and cold because I try to fight my feelings, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do\u2014that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>I think about what he said earlier: what\u2019s right and what he wants. \u201cDo you want to feel those things though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to feel a lot of things.\u201d His fingers burrow into my hip and I shudder as heat caresses my skin. He bends his elbow and with one hand pulls me across the seat toward him. When I\u2019m near enough, his free hand grabs my waist; he lifts me up and sits me down on his lap so I\u2019m straddling him. My chest heaves erratically as he traces his finger up my cheekbone and tucks a strand of my hair behind my ear.</p><p>His lips dip toward my neck. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m around you, I forget everything else.\u201d He doesn\u2019t explain if that\u2019s good or bad, and I don\u2019t get a chance to ask him because his teeth nip at my neck and I forget how to speak.</p><p>I bring my hands up to the back of his neck, then slide them up and tangle them into his hair. His mouth opens and his tongue rolls along my neck. I draw his face closer and lift my hips up and his mouth nears my collarbone. I\u2019m completely ready to go back to the feeling I experienced on the bed in the cabin. I want him to explore me further. I want him to touch me all over, but he gives me a quick kiss and then pulls back. I\u2019m about to object when he picks me up by the waist and I nearly smack my head on the ceiling of the car as he lays me down on the seat. Then he covers my body with his and kisses me hard, stealing my breath away.</p><p>When our bodies can\u2019t take it any longer, he pulls away and looks down at me as we both pant. I can feel it, just like he said, the numbness in me when I\u2019m not with him being filled and I need more. I move my hands up his muscular arms and the longer I touch him, the more I let go because I let my emotions own me. When I reach his back, I try to force him to me, but he shakes his head in protest.</p><p>I frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shadow over with a look that sends my body into a fit. He kneels up and grabs my arms roughly. I let him because I want to and that\u2019s all that matters. In one quick motion, he pins my wrists together and restrains them above my head. Then he lowers himself back on me as his hand glides down my body. When he reaches the top of my dress, he jerks it down and my breasts spring free. Moments later, his mouth is devouring my nipple, licking it and biting it gently. There are too many emotions inside me; need, want, hunger, panic, fear, connection, serenity. It\u2019s potent and amazing to the point of overwhelming.</p><p>I arch my back up as my nipples harden and then let my legs fall open. His hand immediately slides down my stomach to the bottom of my dress, then his mouth moves upward, his breath soft on my skin and his lips wet. His other hand keeps my arms pinned up above my head as his fingers slip up my inner thigh. I want to grab him, dig my nails into him and let it all out, but I\u2019m helpless and can only cry out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d My neck arches as my body curves into him.</p><p>He moves his lips from mine and looks me in the eye as his fingers graze the trim of my panties. For a faltering second, I almost tell him to stop. I\u2019ve never done this before. I\u2019ve never done anything at all, except with him. I\u2019m deprived in every area of human affection and it\u2019s terrifying to think that he\u2019s going to be inside me. As he slips his fingers beneath the fabric, the fear and doubt are immediately replaced by this need to find out what it feels like to be alive and connected. He waits long enough for me to stop him before he slides a finger inside me.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans and he lowers his mouth to mine as he begins to move his finger.</p><p>My nipples brush against his chest with every ragged breath I take and I find myself wishing he had his shirt off so I can feel his skin touching mine. I moan and bite at his lips and he bites back at mine. It feels so good and my hips start to move against him. I can feel it again, the sense of freedom from a world of pain. It\u2019s almost within my reach. Right as I\u2019m about to reach it he slips another finger in me and his mouth leaves mine. My lips part as my neck arches and my head tips back. He watches me fall blindly into a feeling I\u2019ve only experienced with him and I want to stay there. Forever.</p> <p>As I come back down, he slips his fingers out of me and releases my wrists. I leave my worn-out arms above my head as he props up on his elbows, one on each side of my head. I work to regain control of my breathing and he smoothes my hair back from my damp forehead.</p><p>He studies my eyes carefully with a small, smug smile on his lips. \u201cThere, now I can look you in the eyes again.\u201d</p><p>My lips turn upward, but I\u2019m too tired, overwhelmed and drained to speak.</p><p>The smile erases from his lips and he lets out a slow sigh. \u201cI\u2019m completely fucked.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what he means. \u201cWhy? Because of me?\u201d</p> <p>He traces my cheekbone with his finger and I will my eyelids to stay open. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t even supposed to become friends with you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve yet to understand what the term friend means on a personal level. \u201cIs that what we are? Friends?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a soft laugh as his hand strays to my jawline and then to my neck. Repositioning his body slightly to the side, he traces a delicate path down my collarbone to the curve of my breast and then the pad of his thumb grazes my nipple. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close.\u201d</p><p>My body quivers underneath his touch and he begins to lower his lips to mine again. God knows what the hell we would have done next if the damn bell on the store\u2019s door didn\u2019t ding. He jumps off me like I\u2019m made of fire and grabs my arms to aid me upright. I reach for the bottom of my dress to pull it back over my legs and he grabs the top and covers my breasts.</p><p>I\u2019m combing my fingers through my hair when the passenger door swings open and the interior lights click on. Aislin climbs into the car, carrying a petite silver box with delicate flower engravings on the frame of it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we...\u201d She trails off when she catches sight of us. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSitting here, talking,\u201d Alex answers with a nonchalant shrug. \u201cWe had a bit of an incident inside and needed a time out.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me over with accusation. \u201cGemma looks flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the accident involved her,\u201d Alex says with a blas\u00e9 attitude and I realize just how good of a liar he is.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d She sets the box down on the console. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went into a vision,\u201d I say, noting the lingering breathlessness in my tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d she exclaims so loudly a dog from one of the nearby yards starts howling. She lowers her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re a Foreseer.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, but Alex shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think it was the star\u2019s power that set it off. You know the divination crystal runs off energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but does the star radiate that much power through her? I thought it was controlled inside her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho knows how it works, Aislin. You know nothing\u2019s ever happened like her. She\u2019s basically a mystery.\u201d</p><p>The moment of bliss I experienced just seconds ago vanishes as everything catches up with me again. I\u2019m reminded of what I am, what I used to be. I\u2019m reminded of the pain, the desolation, the betrayal. They continue to chat about me like I don\u2019t exist and, after a while, I kind of wish I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Laylen climbs into the car and then we\u2019re on the road, heading back to the house. I rest my head against the window and allow exhaustion to take my body as I shut my eyes. I drift to sleep, wondering what my dreams will hold.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>I\u2019m plummeting deeper into the murky lake; the water smothers my lungs and blinds my eyes. I kick my legs, trying to fight my way to the surface. I refuse to drown. I refuse to die.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d A voice floats up from beneath my feet. \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>I kick harder and paddle my arms, attempting to doggy paddle.</p><p>\u201cNo, Gemma, down here,\u201d the voice comes from below me and I\u2019m overpowered by a comforting feeling. I know whoever it is won\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019m supposed to listen to it... I\u2019m supposed to go to it. My legs and arms go limp and my dead weight carries me down to the bottom of the lake where tall grass encloses me.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d the voice entices. \u201cNow, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>For what? I think.</p><p>The voice responds inside my head. I need you to save me.</p><p>How?</p><p>Just trust me.</p><p>I trust you. Bubbles float from my mouth.</p><p>Good. Now, whatever you do, don\u2019t panic.</p><p>Why?</p><p>A set of fingernails stab into my ankles and I\u2019m being hauled downward again. I panic and claw at the water, but I\u2019m drowning; useless, becoming part of the dead. For a brief, yet very important moment, I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Someone shakes my shoulder. \u201cGemma, wake up.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids snap open, I spring upright, and my head smacks into Alex\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Gemma.\u201d Alex surrenders his hands up in front of him and I pant loudly and hug my legs to my chest. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>I eye his hands, then glance around at the vacant front seats of the GTO and then at the shelved walls of Laylen\u2019s garage. The interior light is on and the car door is wide open.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Aislin and Laylen?\u201d I stretch my arms above my head, curl my back in and stretch.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re already inside,\u201d he says as he reaches around the seat and flips the lever. \u201cGetting things set up for Aislin\u2019s spell.\u201d</p><p>I yawn. \u201cHow long have we been sitting out here?\u201d</p><p>He pushes the seat forward. \u201cAwhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just wake me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew you were tired and I thought I\u2019d let you sleep. In fact, if you want, you can go lie down in one of the spare rooms.\u201d He ducks out the door and climbs out of the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI think I will.\u201d I scoot toward the door and he offers his hand to help me out, but I decline, moving around it, and put my feet onto the cement floor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d he states. \u201cAt me?\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cWhy would I be mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he says as I proceed towards the steps. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>I twist the knob and push the door open. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. I was just painfully reminded of what and who I am to you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers encircle my elbow and he stills me. \u201cAnd what do you think you are to me?\u201d</p><p>I look directly into his eyes and utter the truth. \u201cA star.\u201d</p><p>His fingers prod deeper into my arm, but he presses his lips together, not denying it. I feel my heart fracture down the middle and a tiny fragment chips off. Where it will end up, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>After I change out of the leather dress and back into my clothes, which Aislin washed, I go to sleep like Alex suggested. He makes me keep a knife on the nightstand next to the bed in case something happens while he\u2019s gone. I find images of cloaked monsters, a glacier world and an eerie lake haunting my head as soon as I shut my eyes and, soon I\u2019m wide awake.</p><p>I lie in bed for a while before I force myself to get up. It takes me even longer to decide to go find Laylen, but, finally I tuck the small knife into the back pocket of my jeans and step out into the hall. The house is enormous and it takes a while to find him. He\u2019s in a small room with black walls, no windows and a corner lamp. There is a trivial bookshelf in the corner and a stereo is on top of it, playing the soft tune of \u201cInto the Ocean\u201d by Blue October. In the center of the room is a red sofa where Laylen is lying down, reading a book. I feel uncomfortable just walking in so I stand in the doorway, deciding the best way to interrupt him.</p><p>He\u2019s fully engaged in the book and doesn\u2019t seem to notice me. I start to back away, deciding to let him be when he turns the page and calls out, \u201cYou can come in, Gemma. I promise I don\u2019t bite.\u201d He glances at me with a sparkle in his blue eyes. \u201cThen again, maybe I should say that I do. That might entice you to come in.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together and step over the threshold. \u201cI\u2019m not that fascinated with biting. Just curious.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, shuts the book and sets it down on a rectangular table in front of him. Then he sits up, lowers his boots to the floor and pats the spot beside him. I take a seat and he studies me, like I\u2019m a foreign creature.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I run my fingers through my hair and wipe my face self-consciously. \u201cDo I have something on my face?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and sucks his lip ring between his teeth. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that you look so much like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your mom.\u201d</p><p>Every single one of my nerves unites with my heart; it bounds in my chest and dispenses eagerness through my body. \u201cYou knew her?\u201d</p><p>He nods as he pushes up the sleeves of his black shirt. \u201cI did and you look so much like her. Except for the color of your eyes. Hers were blue.\u201d</p><p>I picture a woman with long brown hair like mine, lengthy limbs and eyes as blue as the sea. \u201cWhat was she like? No one\u2019s ever told me anything about her and I can\u2019t remember a single thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was really nice and she was one of those people who you knew you could trust,\u201d he says it like it\u2019s the simplest thing in the world to tell me and I decide Laylen might be the one person who can teach me what the term friend means. \u201cYou really can\u2019t remember anything about her?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, bring my feet up onto the couch, and bend my legs to the side of me. \u201cBut I was only one when she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t,\u201d he says with a pucker at his brow. \u201cYou were four. Who told you that you were one?\u201d</p><p>I pierce my fingers into the palms of my hand until the skin splits open. \u201cMarco and Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d Laylen reclines back in the sofa, pondering. \u201cWhy would it make a difference whether you were one or if you were four?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe to torture me?\u201d I flop my head on the back of the chair and stare at the ceiling with my hands lifelessly at my side. Is there anything in my life that isn\u2019t built on a lie? \u201cI\u2019ve never understood them or much of what they did, other than they seem to really hate me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers graze the inside of my wrist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>I elevate my head and look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. It\u2019s not your fault it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not completely true.\u201d He lets out a stressed sigh and his muscles flex as he folds his arms. \u201cI knew what the Keepers were doing with you and I didn\u2019t do anything to stop it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were like, what, eight when all this was going on?\u201d I say. \u201cBesides, it had to be done to me, right? So the world can be saved and all that; or, whatever the fuck the point was?\u201d I loathe the bitterness that drips into my voice.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought, nibbling on his lip ring and making these soft sucking noises. \u201cMaybe, I guess... Gemma, what has Alex told you?\u201d</p><p>I give him a quick recap of what I\u2019ve been told. The one thing I keep quiet about, though, is the electricity and what it does to Alex and me. That\u2019s just too complicated. And too personal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d he says when I finish. He gives me a sympathetic look and I feel pathetic. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t realize how bad things were for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I repeat, plucking at a loose string on the armrest.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Stephan made this big plan to keep you from feeling or whatever,\u201d he expresses. \u201cBut what I never got was how the plan actually worked. How Marco and Sophia were supposed to make you become emotionally detached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex told me it was because if you raised someone to never know what happiness and sadness and love are, then they wouldn\u2019t know how to feel them. It was working great, too, until a couple of months ago when I snapped out of my zombie trance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know what caused that?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI have no idea, other than the fact that I remember it felt like someone was watching me right before it happened.\u201d</p><p>He contemplates everything for a concise moment. \u201cNone of this makes sense.\u201d He brushes his blue-tipped bangs out of his eyes with his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s like when your mom disappeared. Not much about that made sense, either.\u201d</p><p>My heart strikes in my chest as my eyes enlarge and I verge on a panic attack. \u201cI\u2014I thought she died? I was told my mother and father are dead.\u201d My voice squeaks at the end.</p> <p>\u201cThey figured she must have died because of what happened.\u201d He scoots closer so we\u2019re huddled together, places a hand on top of my thigh and my heart settles. \u201cI overheard my parents talking about how Jocelyn was pissed off when she found out you had to go live with Marco and Sophia so the star could be protected and she was planning on running away with you. As soon as Stephan found out he went to stop her. I guess he found you standing up at the top of this hill in the forest, but he couldn\u2019t find your mom. The Keepers looked for her for about a month, but they never found her.\u201d My blood boils. \u201cSo they just assumed she died because they never found her?\u201d</p><p>A look of loathing shadows his face. \u201cThat\u2019s how the Keepers are\u2014secretive and confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot about the Keepers is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>I clutch at my chest as I hunch over, trying to breathe normally. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s not dead and she\u2019s out there somewhere... alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the exact same thing my parents thought,\u201d he says and runs a hand down my back to comfort me.</p><p>I take a few deep breaths and then sit back up. \u201cMaybe we could talk to your parents and try to get more details.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dim as he lounges back in the chair and rests his arm on the armrest. \u201cMy parents are dead, Gemma. They died in a car accident a few months after your mother disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>Me and my Goddamn uncensored mouth. \u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was a long time ago.\u201d He acts like it isn\u2019t a big deal, but he can\u2019t even look at me.</p><p>\u201cDoes Alex know about any of this stuff?\u201d I change the unpleasant subject. \u201cAbout my mom and how she supposedly died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing about Alex is... he\u2019s kind of been brainwashed.\u201d His voice carries hesitancy. \u201cHe\u2019s got it in his head that the Keepers can do no wrong, but, yeah, I\u2019ve mentioned it to him and he didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>My mind is spinning. There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know and so much Alex hasn\u2019t explained.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have an idea.\u201d Laylen rises to his feet and tugs down the sleeves of his shirt so they cover his arms and mark. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a break from all of this deep talk and go into the kitchen and get you something to eat?\u201d</p><p>I nod and follow him out of the room, wondering what to do next and who I can trust. It seems like the world is full of unsolvable mazes and liars trying to direct me through them.</p><p>I might have been witnessing the strangest scene I\u2019ve ever come across. A vampire/Keeper is making my breakfast and it\u2019s nothing simplistic, either. He\u2019s cooking bacon, eggs, French toast and pancakes because he says I need choices. No one has ever cooked me anything before and I\u2019m in awe.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on one of the barstools that border the island, breathing in the fresh scent of cinnamon, bacon and the aroma of a brand new experience. We haven\u2019t talked much, but I\u2019m enjoying watching him move around the kitchen. The way every time he ducks his head and his hair falls in his eyes, the way his limbs stretch as he walks and the way he keeps sucking on that lip ring of his.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he says as he turns the pieces of bacon over with a fork and the grease in the pan sizzles. \u201cAbout your emotions and or should I say lack of emotions.\u201d</p><p>I inch the stool forward and the legs scrape against the tile. \u201cOkay, what about them?\u201d</p><p>He twists the knob on the stove, adjusting the temperature of the burner. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that sounds an awful lot like magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d I prop my elbows onto the countertop and rest my chin on top of my overlapping hands. \u201cLike Wicca magic? Or like black magic?\u201d</p><p>He grabs a plate from the cupboard. \u201cIt could be either, really, or something else entirely different from Wicca magic. There\u2019s a ton of things that can wipe out a person\u2019s ability to feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you think they wiped out my emotions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d He scoops up a spoon full of eggs and piles them on a plate. \u201cIn fact, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, I knew you when you were a kid and you were fine then; happy, healthy and kind of bossy.\u201d He flashes me a grin.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could remember you,\u201d I say as he slides the plate of eggs across the counter. \u201cIt kind of seems weird that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be because of your emotions.\u201d He turns off the stove and grabs a rag that sits next to the sink. \u201cI mean, think about it. You were emotionally detached from life\u2014from everything, right? And emotions play a huge part in why people remember things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d I take a bite of eggs and they taste delicious. \u201cBut maybe, that could come from magic, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He finishes cooking the rest of the food. \u201cBut the question is, why? I mean, I know it\u2019s supposed to be because of the star, but what if it\u2019s because of something else.\u201d</p><p>I choke on my eggs. \u201cYou think I was made emotionally numb for another reason?\u201d</p><p>He sets a pan in the sink and turns on the faucet. \u201cGemma, at this point, I have no idea what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve spent three years in the dark, never hearing a word from any of the Keepers.\u201d He speaks loudly over the running water. \u201cAnd then Alex and Aislin show up with you and say that the Death Walkers suddenly found you after years of you going undetected.\u201d</p><p>Strangely, he\u2019s making sense. What if there\u2019s more? Why have I just assumed that the story Alex told me was the correct story?</p><p>He turns off the water and begins piling French toast, pancakes, and bacon onto the plate. When he\u2019s done, he sets the plates on the counter in front of me. Then he hops onto the counter and watches me as I eat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating any?\u201d I ask, pouring syrup over a few slices of French toast.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t eat food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... oh.\u201d I feel so stupid. Of course he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a vampire. I point my finger at him and click my tongue. \u201cGotcha.\u201d I dig into my food, struggling not to act too uneasy at the fact that he seems to be fascinated by my chewing.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you eat?\u201d I break the silence.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNothing, usually. I\u2019ll eat food sometimes when I\u2019m bored, but it\u2019s never out of hunger.\u201d</p><p>I drag the fork across the eggs, deliberating. \u201cLaylen, can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d I ask and he nods again. I take a bite of the eggs and chew. \u201cHow exactly did you get turned into a vampire?\u201d</p><p>His face contorts with confusion. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how it normally works when a person goes through the change, or whatever you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called the transition.\u201d He hops off the counter and strolls around the island toward me. \u201cAnd no, something else caused the memory loss.\u201d He pulls out a stool and sits down beside me. \u201cThe only thing I can remember about that night is coming out of a club and hearing someone come up behind me. When I turned around, everything went black. When I woke, I had a bite mark on my neck and blood all over me.\u201d He holds up his arm and tracks a finger along the Greek symbols that are on his forearm. \u201cAnd, of course, I had this lovely little thing right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it hard to deal with?\u201d I set the fork down on my plate and rotate in the stool so I\u2019m facing him and our knees are touching. \u201cI mean, changing like that? It had to be hard.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cMy Keeper\u2019s blood helps me control my cravings for blood, but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re nonexistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve never bit anyone\u2014ever?\u201d</p><p>He scratches at his wrist and shifts uncomfortably. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips a beat. \u201cSo, you have.\u201d</p><p>He stares at the wall in front of us. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few slipups, but I never killed anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they... Do you...\u201d I have no idea why I\u2019m asking the question, only that I\u2019m curious and need\u2014and I mean need\u2014to know. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shoot upward as his head whips in my direction. \u201cHow does it feel when I bite someone?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAnd how does it feel for them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d he asks me inquisitively.</p><p>I decide to be honest. \u201cCuriosity, and the fact that I can\u2019t seem to keep my damn mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>His lips tug up to a miniscule smile. \u201cYou really want me to tell you how it feels to sink my teeth into another person\u2019s neck?\u201d I start to apologize because I think he\u2019s upset, when he leans forward. \u201cHow it feels to suck hot blood out of someone\u2019s vein?\u201d I swallow hard at the animalistic look in his eyes as he dips his head toward my face. \u201cHow it feels to hold someone in my arms, knowing I can do anything to them?\u201d His voice purrs across my skin. He puts a hand on each side of me, slants his body and moves closer. \u201cYou really want to know, Gemma?\u201d He breathes on my neck and I choke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t... I don\u2019t...\u201d I trail off as his lips brush against my skin and my eyelids shut on their own accord.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I told you it was terrible?\u201d he whispers against my neck. \u201cWould you run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d I begin to fall backwards on the stool and grab ahold of the edge of the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you it felt mind-numbingly good?\u201d He kisses my neck and my shoulder shudders into him. \u201cWould you let me bite you?\u201d</p><p>My mind has melted into wax and air has gotten trapped in my lungs. \u201cWould you bite me, if I said yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d His lips part and I feel his teeth nick my skin. I don\u2019t move because I want to know. I want to stay right here.</p> <p>As I\u2019m entirely letting go to my curiosity and my body\u2019s need for an answer, his tongue slides out and he licks me like a dog. My eyes snap open as he pulls away and there\u2019s a huge smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cI would never bite you, sweetheart,\u201d he says with humor in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re too innocent and pure and that makes for a bad addiction.\u201d When I pout, he touches his finger to my bottom lip. \u201cAnd besides, I\u2019d never be able to forgive myself if I bit you.\u201d I let my lip return to its rightful place as he gets up from the stool and makes his way to the window. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a fan of feeding. I\u2019ve only done it a few times and it makes me feel guilty afterwards.\u201d He draws back the curtain and lets the sunlight inside. \u201cSo, what do you want to do next\u2014\u201d</p><p>The window explodes, sending shards of glass through the air, like deadly raindrops. Laylen ducks down as a wave of ice rushes through the broken window and curves down to the floor. It slithers towards my feet and spirals up and attaches to the ceiling, forming thick beams.</p><p>\u201cLaylen!\u201d I jump from the stool and it topples over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>As I round the corner of the island, he stands up. My brain barely registers his movements as he races over to me at an inhuman speed and grabs my hand. The next thing I know, we\u2019re racing down the hallway and the ice is chasing us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d I pant as I force my legs to take longer strides.</p> <p>\u201cDeath Walkers.\u201d He veers us to the right as one of the rooms\u2019 doors blows from the hinges and flies towards our heads. The rest of the doors follow and he hunkers down, pulling me down with him. He shields my head with his arm and glances up and down the hall. \u201cI have no idea how they fucking found us.\u201d</p><p>Ice crawls across the floor, along the ceilings and glazes the walls. Snow whirls in the air as the house begins to crack down the center of the floor. It\u2019s petrifyingly cold and I have flashbacks to the night in the woods, being chased, watching the Death Walkers take out the cabin with their ice.</p><p>My heart hammers in my chest as I tuck my head into his shoulder. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>His chin brushes the top of my head as he turns his head from left to right. \u201cCome on. Follow me. And keep your head down.\u201d</p><p>He moves his body away from mine and keeps his head low as he gets down on his hands and knees, crawling toward the front door. I follow; the ice on the floor burns against my palms and the wintery cold air crisps my eyelashes. Beams are forming in bulks, creating a jail cell with no way out.</p><p>I continue to follow Laylen, sliding from left to right out of the beams, but fog starts to seep through the open doors and windows, filling up the entire house. Before I know it, I can\u2019t see a damn thing.</p><p>\u201cLaylen?\u201d I cough against the plunging temperature in the air. \u201cLaylen, where are you?\u201d He doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cLaylen, please.\u201d</p><p>The dead silence is terrifying, but I try not to panic. I crawl on my hands and knees until I find my way into a room that\u2019s clear from the murky fog. I jump to my feet and remove the knife from my back pocket; noting the blue tint of my skin and the tremble and tightness of my frozen limbs. The fog is getting to me and I need to move fast before I get hypothermia.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell should I do?\u201d There are no windows in the room, just a few empty shelves and a door. I quickly run over to it, but it comes crashing down and flies straight at my head. I drop to the floor, flat on my stomach, and the blade of the knife grazes my hand and slices my palm open. With my uninjured hand, I begin to push myself up when something steps up in front of my face. Black fabric circles its feet and ice cracks out from under it.</p><p>I kneel up and tip my chin up to the Death Walker standing in front of me. It\u2019s sickening to look at up close; dry peeling skin and blood oozing from the visible muscles. Its eyes are hidden underneath the hood, but the glow is blinding.</p><p>I skitter backward on my knees, poising the knife out in front of me. Without warning, it charges, sending ice dispersing from the walls and ceiling. The shards are as sharp as glass and each piece that hits me rips at my skin. I manage to swing the knife at the monster, knowing it won\u2019t kill it, but hoping it will wound it. I only slice the fabric of its cloak, though, and seem to piss it off. I dodge to the side and try to get my feet steady beneath me, but it floats over my head and lands behind me. I whirl and aim the knife at it again, but I\u2019m way off goal and I stab at the air.</p><p>My feet slip against the slick floor as I try to spin back around to run, but it grabs ahold of my arm and lifts me up until my legs are dangling below me. I open my mouth to scream, but a dense cloud puffs from its fleshless lips. Cold air enters my throat and steals the sound away.</p><p>Bits of ice and frost crackle across the inside of my mouth and down my airway. The Death Walker tips its head back, lets out a blood curdling scream and countless shrieks echo throughout the house. Its fingers leave my arm and I crumple to the floor, clutching my neck as I roll onto my back. The Death Walker cries out again as my body stops falling, each limb dying. The ice spreads down into my lungs, wrapping around each bone, contracting them and I can feel the skin shriveling from the pressure. I listen to my heart still as the Death Walker leans over me. As it opens its mouth again, my heart goes silent. Then everything goes black.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think it\u2019d be better if I were dead,\u201d I say to Alex as I walk around the trees and head further into the forest.</p><p>He catches me by the arm, jerks me back and twirls me around to look at him. \u201cWhy would you ever say that?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the lake that\u2019s peeking through the brim of the forest. \u201cBecause then, I wouldn\u2019t have to feel the pain anymore.\u201d</p><p>He hooks his finger under my chin and makes me look at him. His green eyes glisten in the sunlight that is flickering through the branches of the trees. It looks like he\u2019s about to cry and I don\u2019t understand why. \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t feel the pain anymore, then you wouldn\u2019t be able to feel how great it feels when it leaves you. Without pain, everything else wouldn\u2019t matter to you. It would all be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think that\u2019d be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than love?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as tears puddle the corners of my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I know what that is and I\u2019m not sure I ever will.\u201d</p><p>He embraces my cheek with his hand and grazes his thumb just below my eyes. \u201cYes, you will. You\u2019ll know because for a moment, that pain will be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, can you hear me?\u201d Alex whispers. \u201cGemma, wake up.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself being lifted and then arms coddle me closer to a tepid chest. Electricity webs through me and the ice in my body shrinks and melts. I\u2019m no longer cold, but feverish. I tuck my head in and let the heat take me over as light gleams around me.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t go to sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep your eyes open.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying, but it\u2019s hard. I can\u2019t... Suddenly I can\u2019t feel the pain anymore.</p><p>I wake up confused and with an earsplitting headache. My hand is bandaged up, I\u2019m lying in a log bed, and there\u2019s a blanket over me and a pillow under my head. The walls are made of the same logs as the bed and so is the nightstand and the dresser. There\u2019s an antique vanity in the corner and a window next to it, which shows the extensive scenery of mountains that are submerged in snow.</p><p>I clutch my head as I sit up and blink my eyes, trying to piece everything together, but my memories are a bit foggy. \u201cAm I back in Wyoming? Holy fuck, have I been dreaming the entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on where you think the dream started from?\u201d Alex\u2019s voice wraps around my body and makes me remember the dream I\u2019d been having. It also makes me remember all the things Laylen and I talked about.</p><p>He\u2019s by the doorway, looking comfortable as he leans against the doorframe with his arms folded. He\u2019s wearing a black t-shirt, faded jeans with a tear in the thigh area, different from the clothes I saw him in last time, and his dark brown hair is damp.</p><p>I lower my hand from my head. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over six hours,\u201d he answers simply. \u201cYou were pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hours?\u201d I start to get up, but the soreness in my head sends me straight back to the bed. \u201cWhat happened? Because the last thing I can remember is the Death Walker breathing on me, then it felt like I was dying.\u201d</p><p>He uncrosses his arms, walks across the room and sits down at the foot of the bed. \u201cYou should have been dead. The Death Walker breathed the Chill of Death on you and it\u2019s lethal, but somehow... somehow you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>I check over my arms, which have fingernail-size cuts all over them. \u201cHow did I survive?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and the muscles in his arms go stiff. \u201cI have no idea. All I can figure is it has to do with the star being inside you.\u201d</p><p>The star. I wish he\u2019d stop reminding me. I throw the blankets off me and move my legs over the edge of the bed. \u201cWhere are Aislin and Laylen?\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand down his face and sighs. \u201cAislin couldn\u2019t transport all four of us out of the house at the same time, so she had to make two trips. When she transported back to get Laylen, she never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I exclaim and begin to put weight on my feet, despite my wobbly knees. \u201cWell, we have to go back there and get them. I mean, the Death Walkers were there and they\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabs my arm and gently steers me to the side so I fall onto his lap. \u201cCalm down, my father called not too long after and said they were fine. That Aislin\u2019s crystal had shattered, but they were able to make it to the car and drive to the city.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I remember the conversation Laylen and I had in the kitchen. \u201cSo they\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re okay\u2014everyone is okay. Everything is going to be okay. God, it\u2019s nice to be able to finally say that.\u201d</p><p>Why does it feel like there are pieces of the story missing? \u201cDid you talk to them yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Aislin and Laylen?\u201d he asks and I nod. \u201cNo, I tried like a thousand times before my father called, but their phones went straight to voicemail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, how did your father get ahold of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey called him from Adessa\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are they now?\u201d</p><p>He eyes me over suspiciously. \u201cThey\u2019re all headed here. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Marco and Sophia?\u201d I say, cradling my bandaged hand as I tip back. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, yet,\u201d he replies with a dash of annoyance. \u201cWhen we went back to Laramie, we couldn\u2019t find anyone.\u201d</p><p>None of this makes sense and it\u2019s frustrating because he doesn\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s like he\u2019s blind\u2014brainwashed. \u201cAnd what about your father? Where was he this entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was out in Magia Terra.\u201d He takes my injured hand in his and traces the folds between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cMagia Terra?\u201d My body responds elatedly to his touch, but I tell it to shut the hell up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this wasteland where useless or broken magical objects are dumped,\u201d he explains as his finger roams to my palm where the knife entered. \u201cHe does work there a lot and there\u2019s no reception whatsoever. I don\u2019t know why I never thought of it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s back now?\u201d I frown as he brings my hand to his lips and he delicately kisses the bandaged area. He\u2019s being weird. Too affectionate.</p> <p>He nods, then picks me up by the hips and turns me around to face him. \u201cHe\u2019s headed here now, so relax.\u201d He kisses my neck as his fingers sneak up between my legs and he spreads them open so there\u2019s one on each side of him. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Everything isn\u2019t fine. I have no idea where we are, what happened, or what exactly was said when Stephan finally called. I\u2019ve missed a lot while I\u2019ve been out and the only person that has been completely honest with me isn\u2019t here.</p><p>His fingers travel up the top of my leg and he kneads my thighs with his fingers. \u201cRelax, everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I crane my neck and glance back out the window at the snow-covered land. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in one of the Keepers cabins in Colorado.\u201d He fixes a finger underneath my chin and makes me look back at him. \u201cCan we stop talking about this now? I\u2019d really rather be doing other stuff,\u201d he says in a demanding tone and then he leans forward and kisses me freely.</p><p>It\u2019s completely out of character for him. Usually, he\u2019s either out-of-control or trying to restrain himself and the last time we talked, he made it pretty clear that he thinks of me as just the star. He\u2019s too comfortable, as if he suddenly thinks it\u2019s okay to kiss me and touch me. I need to stop him and get some answers.</p><p>\u201cI think we should...\u201d I begin to protest against his lips, but I trail off as his tongue determinedly enters my mouth.</p><p>His hands slide up to my waist, leaving a trail of heat on my stomach as they touch my bare skin. Turning us to the side, he winds one hand around my back and covers my body with his as he lays me on my back. He spreads my legs open and positions his body between my legs and we fit perfectly together. At least for a moment, but as his hand wanders up the front of my shirt and cups the outer layer of my lacy bra, I remember how powerful his touch is and I scream at my brain to snap out of it.</p> <p>It works. I wiggle my arms between us and, with effort, push him back. \u201cIs there any way I can take a shower? I\u2019d like to wash off all my cuts.\u201d</p><p>He pants, his green eyes glossy as he studies me. Then, his hand leaves my shirt and sneaks between my legs. \u201cYou want to take one right now,\u201d he says, rubbing me.</p><p>My body quivers for his fingers to be inside me, but I fight against it, and remain in control. I nod because I need a second to clear my head and try to figure out what\u2019s going on.</p><p>He sighs and then brings me with him as he stands to his feet. He tugs my shirt back over my stomach and tucks a few pieces of my hair behind my ear. Then he laces his fingers with mine, leads me across the room and scoops up a bag near the doorway. \u201cWhile we were in Laramie, we stopped by your house and picked up some of your clothes and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say and take the bag from him.</p><p>He leans in and kisses my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the flow of electricity, I\u2019d think he\u2019s the mirage because Alex is not affectionate. Hot, intense, irrational, maybe even a little bipolar\u2014yes. Loving and caring\u2014no.</p><p>He shows me where the bathroom is and then makes a joke about taking a shower with me before leaving. I\u2019m lost and I don\u2019t know what to do. Jump out the window and run through the mountains? Trust Alex? Trust Stephan?</p><p>I strip off my clothes and let the water run hot before I step in and close the curtain. Rinsing off my body feels like I\u2019m rinsing off the last few days. By the time I step out, I feel a little bit better. Not trusting, but better.</p><p>The room is overflowing with steam and I can barely see. I feel around for a towel and then wrap it around me. When I head to the counter where my bag is, the steam parts open and reveals a figure standing near the door.</p><p>I step back and tighten the towel around me. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>He takes a step forward and exposes his dark green eyes, messy brown hair, broad shoulders and an amused smile on his lips. It looks like Alex, but I can tell right away that it isn\u2019t by the lack of voltage in my body.</p><p>\u201cShit... You\u2019re the mirage.\u201d I back toward the shower, smacking my knee on the corner of the porcelain tub as I work to hold the towel together. He matches my moves, mimicking my pace, and then speeds up when I reach the stained glass window in the corner.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re Gemma.\u201d His voice is soft like velvet, alluring even. \u201cBeautiful, confused, poor, broken Gemma.\u201d He trails his fingers along the top of the towel, just above my chest. I bend my knee to kick him, but he bends his own and his knee caps restrain my legs against the wall. His hand drifts toward my neck and I let out a scream as I smack his hand away.</p><p>He slaps his hand over my mouth, snatches ahold of my wrists, and twists my arm in a very awkward position. Then he spins me around so my back is pressed against his chest and his arms snake around my midsection. I raise my foot and fling my leg back to kick him, but he hops away and dodges my endeavor. His arms constrict around my arms and his skin is warm against mine, but not in the same way as Alex\u2019s. He has a strange smell to him, like lilacs mingled with freshly fallen rain. The smell is pungent and makes me nauseous.</p><p>He covers my mouth with his hand as he directs us toward the door and I bite down on his skin. \u201cDammit.\u201d He slaps the back of my head as he curses and I swing my head back; making us lose balance and we slam into the toilet.</p><p>As he works to get us both to our feet, without letting go of me, the door comes crashing in and Alex rushes inside. The blood promptly drains from his face. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>The mirage laughs disdainfully as his arms wrap back around me. \u201cHello to you, too, old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld friend?\u201d My eyes widen and I freeze. \u201cAlex, you know him?\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head, looking as perplexed as I feel. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>The mirage shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ll be the one asking the questions.\u201d</p><p>Alex glances at me for an explanation and I shrug. He cautiously takes a step further inside the room, closing in on us. \u201cWhy? You have no place to go.\u201d</p><p>The mirage laughs again. \u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting what a mirage is and how we travel. I can be out of here quicker than you can blink, if I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Alex stops moving and clenches his fists as he battles to contain himself. My body lets out a terrified shudder. I\u2019ve never seen him worried. Usually, he\u2019s the man with the plan, but he looks helpless and lost.</p><p>The mirage\u2019s mouth moves next to my neck and a floral scent whelms my nostrils. \u201cShudder again and I might just take you back to my house instead of where I\u2019m supposed to take you. I could have a lot of fun with you.\u201d</p><p>I angle my head to the side and cringe. The towel is slipping loose and he has himself pressed up against me in every strategic place. \u201cBack off, pervert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you touch her, I\u2019ll break off all your fucking fingers.\u201d Alex dares another step into the room so the only thing between us and him is the sink. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m pretty sure you know what I am, after all, you seem so dead set on being me, then you know what I\u2019m capable of and just how good I am at breaking bones.\u201d He pops his knuckles and neck.</p><p>The body of the mirage begins to quiver and vibrate. The possibilities of what he could be doing spin a web of disgust through my body, but Alex seems pleased by whatever he\u2019s doing. He continues to shake and shiver faster and faster, until he conclusively lets out a jolt that lurches us both forward.</p><p>\u201cNicholas Harper.\u201d Alex crosses his arms and a patronizing look arises on his face as the mirage skims his arms down to my waist.</p><p>I slant my head back to look at the mirage. His hair is no longer brown, but a sandy-blonde and his eyes are as golden as the desert sand. He\u2019s shorter than Alex and a little thinner, but probably around the same age. It creeps me out to see him in real form, not because he\u2019s bad looking, but because I realized he\u2019s basically a shape-shifter and he can be anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s really fun messing with your head,\u201d he says and his real voice is higher. \u201cAnd that scene in the forest was priceless. I\u2019ll never forget the scared looks on your faces.\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m surprised. I always figured you\u2019d end up with something like the Death Walkers. Tell me, when did you decide to switch sides?\u201d He\u2019s acting arrogant and condescending which I normally hate, but, at the moment, I\u2019m thoroughly entertained.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t switch sides,\u201d he says with irritation. \u201cI was merely having fun with this lovely girl right here and the Death Walkers just happened to show up at the right time. It couldn\u2019t have been better timing if I planned it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was all it was about?\u201d Alex doubts with a frown. \u201cTo simply fuck with our heads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a purpose.\u201d His shoulders lift up and then descend as he shrugs. \u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to divulge it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other time?\u201d I question and Alex looks at me for clarification. \u201cThe one in the parking lot? Where you were pretending to help me with the Death Walker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind manipulation. Foreseer\u2019s are excellent at it.\u201d His breath stings at my nose and I almost gag at the floral scent. It\u2019s so powerful, like he\u2019s recently eaten rose petals. He strengthens his hold on me, arms tightening as he urges me closer to his chest. His heart beats through his chest and against my back, slow and rhythmic like a drum. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful thing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I scrunch my nose and make a face. \u201cLet me go.\u201d I try to kick him, but miss again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one calling the shots here,\u201d he says, then sniffs my hair as his hand drifts down my stomach to the base of the towel. Alex starts to move forward with a vein popping out in his neck. \u201cWhich means I can do whatever I want with you.\u201d</p><p>I wiggle my arm enough that I can jab my elbow into his stomach. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>His stomach muscles tense. \u201cFeisty. I like it,\u201d he whispers in my ear and I slam my head straight into his nose.</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d His hands leave my body and I dash over to Alex, meeting him in the middle of the room. He grabs my arms and swings me behind him. Prodding me with his elbow, he drives me toward the door as he reaches for his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u201d Nicholas calls out, still clutching his nose. There\u2019s blood running down his arm and dripping onto his grey t-shirt.</p><p>Alex pulls a small knife from his pocket and flips the blade open. \u201cGemma, go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and there will be even bigger consequences.\u201d Nicholas pinches the brim of his bleeding nose. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re a Keeper and know all the laws and rules, I bet you can guess what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeseers can only punish Foreseers,\u201d Alex states as he poises the knife out in front of him.</p> <p>He removes his hands from his nose and there\u2019s blood all over his face. \u201cWhich is exactly what she is.\u201d</p><p>My jaw nearly slams to my knees. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Alex turns his head and puts his finger to his lips, shushing me. \u201cListen, there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d He looks back at Nicholas. \u201cGemma, she\u2019s... there are things about her that make her different, but she\u2019s not a Foreseer.\u201d</p><p>He grabs a towel from off the hook and begins to dab the blood off his face. \u201cDid she see a vision?\u201d</p><p>Alex wavers with his arm bent at the elbow and the knife stationed in front of him. \u201cYeah, but there were special circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t give a shit what she is or what the circumstances are. You know the law and the law says if a person sees a vision, then they belong to the Foreseers.\u201d He wipes his hands off with the towel and tosses it onto the counter. \u201cGemma saw a vision; therefore, she belongs to us and she\u2019s going to the City of Crystal with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know what the fucking laws say,\u201d Alex snaps. \u201cBut, like I said, she\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent.\u201d Nicholas throws his head back and laughs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. She has to go back with me. She can try and plead her case when she gets there, if she wants to.\u201d His gaze drinks me in. \u201cShe can even wear the towel.\u201d</p><p>I pull a disgusted face, secure my hand onto the towel and then cower back behind Alex. \u201cCan\u2019t you make him go away?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>Alex shakes his head over and over again and then he pounds his fist against the countertop, causing perfume bottles to topple from the cabinet into the sink. He kicks the cupboard and punches a hole in the wall, breathing furiously and with deep, ravenous heaves of his lungs. After a long dragged out pause, he finally utters, \u201cFine, she\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I cry, jumping in front of him. \u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m not going anywhere with him to some city with a bunch of future seeing weirdoes.\u201d</p><p>He sighs heavily and adjusts the towel higher up on my chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice, Gemma. Laws are laws. If we break them, we\u2019ll pay and you\u2019ll still end up having to go down there.\u201d</p><p>I lock eyes with him and give him a silent plea. \u201cCan\u2019t you do something, like beat him up? Or, stab him with your knife?\u201d</p><p>Alex smashes his lips together like he\u2019s trying not to laugh at me. \u201cAs much as I would love to do either, I can\u2019t. Technically, he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was with the Death Walkers,\u201d I argue. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been fucking with my head... he made me think I was going crazy.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas lurks towards us with a smirk. \u201cNow, that wasn\u2019t entirely me. Some of that stuff was conjured up from your own head. I was just trying to give your Foreseer ability a little nudge. You should be thanking me. Now that the gift\u2019s starting to surface, the nightmares should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just run?\u201d I ask Alex, ignoring Nicholas.</p><p>Alex shakes his head and offers me a look of compassion. \u201cForeseers can travel anywhere by the power of the crystal. If he wants to find us, he can and very quickly.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas starts to laugh as he reaches the edge of the counter. \u201cWe are brilliant creatures, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Alex rolls his eyes and slams his hand against Nicholas\u2019s chest, shoving him back. Nicholas bumps his hip on the corner of the sink as he staggers backward, tripping over his feet. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m going with her,\u201d Alex tells him.</p><p>The humor vanishes from Nicholas\u2019s face as he recovers his steadiness by bracing his hand on the wall. \u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no laws forbidding Keepers from entering the City of Crystal,\u201d Alex informs him as he slides his pocketknife back into his pocket. \u201cSo I can go whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>It makes me feel a little bit better, but not much. I don\u2019t want to be a Foreseer. I already have too much on my plate, and adding the ability to see futuristic visions is going to splinter it even more. \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s no other way?\u201d I whisper to Alex, hoping.</p><p>There\u2019s definitiveness in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you come back with me. You won\u2019t have to stay there.\u201d</p><p>Can I believe him? Can I trust him? What other choice do I have?</p><p>He licks his lips as he stares at my mouth, and then increases his voice so Nicholas can hear. \u201cThe Keepers have much more weight than the Foreseers and, in the end, we all know how this is going to turn out.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s eyes smolder like embers as he glowers at Alex. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed. You still do whatever the hell you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Alex replies coolly as he leans in and kisses my cheek possessively. \u201cI absolutely fucking do. There\u2019s no other way to live life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Nicholas retrieves a miniature crystal ball from the pocket of his cargo pants. It\u2019s filled with red rubies and there\u2019s a glittery tint to the glass. \u201cGo head, my little Gem,\u201d he says to me as he holds the ball. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the towel barely covering my body. \u201cYou have to let me change first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Nicholas questions and I want to slug him. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to leave you alone. For all I know, you\u2019ll jump out the window and run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d I question. \u201cRun out into the mountains and die?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, you could be that stupid.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and march forward with my hand beginning to elevate to hit him. Not just for this, but for everything else; for pretending to be Alex and making me think I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p><p>Alex gently touches my hand and it subdues me. \u201cWe\u2019ll step out so you can dress, but hurry, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to that.\u201d Nicholas moves towards us, but Alex pushes him back again, and his shoulder slams into the wall as he fights to keep his footing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a fucking pervert,\u201d Alex says in a firm voice. \u201cNow, step out and let her change. She won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas studies me for an eternity, then his eyes dim to a deep brown as he winds a path around me. He squeezes between us and the towel rack, and heads to the doorway. \u201cYou have one minute.\u201d He goes out into the hall and Alex follows, giving me a lingering last glance before he shuts the door.</p><p>I hurry and pull on my jeans and a black t-shirt, then twist my hair up into a messy bun with a few bobby pins I find in a drawer.</p><p>\u201cFifteen seconds,\u201d Nicholas shouts from the other side of the door.</p><p>Panicking, I glance at the window and consider jumping out and making a run for it. Maybe the risk of freezing to death is worth it? Before I can arrive at a definite decision the door swings open and the knob bangs against the wall.</p><p>Nicholas struts inside with the crystal ball in the palm of his hand and Alex is just behind him. \u201cTimes up.\u201d</p><p>I really, really dislike this guy. \u201cWhat exactly am I supposed to do with it?\u201d I ask as I put my hands on my hips and stare at the crystal.</p><p>\u201cPut your hand on it,\u201d he instructs as he elevates his arm so the crystal ball is closer to my face.</p><p>I glance at Alex and he nods once. I summon a deep breath and tell myself I\u2019m not afraid, that I\u2019ve lived without fear forever and that this vile, toxic feeling intensifying in me really means I\u2019m hungry. As my fingers brush the cold glass, there\u2019s a burst of light and warmth that inundates my body. My body jolts forward as the sink, shower and mirror evaporate into light. A tunnel forms in front of my face and twists toward me. I try to back away, but I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s up and what\u2019s down. I feel my limbs disconnect, but there is no pain, only soft tugs. I fall apart and collapse into a tunnel, unsure where I will end up.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>My limbs reconnect with my body as I crash against a glass floor and catch myself with my hands. I quickly push to my feet and my wrist lets out a loud pop. I wince as a sharp pain zips up my arm. I cradle my wrist and get to my feet. I\u2019m standing in a field layered with grass that glistens like gemstones. Above, the sky is blue with sharp, distinct edges that resemble the cuts on a diamond. The clouds float back and forth, thin and wispy. At the end of the field is a godly throne perched on an immense silvery podium that\u2019s trimmed with various shades and sizes of emeralds.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this place?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>There\u2019s a faint swoosh and then Alex drops down from above, landing gracefully beside me. His cheeks are wind kissed and his hair is disarranged. He quickly puts a finger up to his lips. \u201cShh... Keep quiet.\u201d</p><p>Another swoosh and Nicholas appears next to me. He smoothes the wrinkles from his cargo pants and ruffles his sandy hair back into place. \u201cThat was fun,\u201d he remarks cleverly as he rubs his hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s seriously the best part about being a Foreseer\u2014falling into the unknown and not knowing where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>I shake my injured wrist until it pops back into place. \u201cIf you think that was fun, then I\u2019d hate to hear what you think is torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, a four-post bed, and some leather straps,\u201d he says with a wink. My jaw drops and he grins.</p><p>\u201cCan we just get this over with?\u201d Alex rearranges his hair into place with a quick tousle from his fingers. \u201cThe quicker we get out of here, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Nicholas stuffs his hands into his pockets and rocks back on his heels. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to let Gemma leave until she\u2019s trained.\u201d He winks at me again. \u201cWhich gives us a lot of time to get to know each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019d rather go back with Alex.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas scowls at me and stomps off in the direction of the throne that sits a couple hundred feet away. Alex and I trail after him down a path of broken teal porcelain and past a translucent sheet of glass. Every once in a while, the sheet of glass flickers and an image of a woman flashes across it. She is doing different things each time; writing in a journal, crying in a street, dancing in a field.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how they keep an eye on the future,\u201d Alex whispers in my ear. \u201cThe screen continuously shows them what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>I nod as the image of the woman fades into a lake that ripples in the sunlight, and that\u2019s how it stays until we reach the throne\u2019s podium. Standing beside the throne, is a short, plump man with elf shoes and curly brown hair. Nicholas approaches him, says something in his ear and the little man nods before hurrying off through the grass.</p> <p>Alex places his hand on the small of my back and says in a low tone, \u201cAnd you need to be careful around Nicholas. He\u2019s part faerie and he can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaerie,\u201d I mouth with wide eyes. He looks normal, which makes me question how many people are just people? And how many are something else disguised as humans? Have I crossed paths with some of them and had just been too oblivious to notice?</p><p>We wait in silence until an elderly man materializes from behind the throne. He\u2019s tall and lanky with pallid skin and shoulder-length grey hair. The silver shade of his robe matches his eyes and on the top of his hand is a circle wrapped around a \u201cS.\u201d I assume it\u2019s the Foreseer\u2019s mark, although, I haven\u2019t spotted one on Nicholas.</p><p>Nicholas backs away from the throne and stands near the rim of the podium as the old man takes a seat in the throne. His thin fingers curl around the velvet armrests as he situates in the seat. \u201cWelcome to the City of Crystal. I am Dyvinius, leader of the Foreseers.\u201d He speaks in slow, monotone syllables. \u201cI understand that you were able to use the Foreseers\u2019 power to view a vision yesterday?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Alex. What am I supposed to say? \u201cI guess...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Dyvinius drums his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you know much about what a Foreseer does, or who we are, so I\u2019ll explain because it really is the most magnificent thing,\u201d he says and repositions the bottom of his robe so it\u2019s covering his feet. \u201cA Foreseer uses the energy of the Divination Crystal to see what\u2019s going to happen. It helps us prepare the world for the future. Once a vision is read, it becomes permanent. There is no changing it.\u201d</p><p>He should probably explain that to the Keepers, since they think differently. The bigger picture suddenly opens up before me like I\u2019m finally looking past the light and witnessing a small part of my future. Through all the chaos, emotions and secrets unwinding, I\u2019ve never taken the time to see what it all means when I connect everything. In the end, I\u2019m the key to saving the world. I will always be the star first and Gemma second.</p><p>\u201cWhen a person goes into their first vision, they usually don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dyvinius continues. \u201cTypically, a Foreseer\u2019s ability is discovered before they see their first vision. Occasionally, someone does end up slipping through the radar undetected. Most of the time, we find them, but sometimes, we don\u2019t.\u201d His silver eyes target on me. \u201cWe have a tracking system that lets us know when there\u2019s been an interference with the Divination Crystal. Now, it\u2019s not necessarily bad, but the vision does need to be read correctly. Otherwise, it can alter the human world.\u201d His face lights up and the wrinkles around his eyes multiply. He claps his hands and straightens up his shoulders. \u201cAnd so, I\u2019ve brought you down here to go into the vision again and read it correctly. That way, you can be trained as a Foreseer.\u201d</p><p>My mouth droops to a frown. \u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>Alex snags the back of my shirt and draws me back as he steps forward. \u201cShe can\u2019t stay here right now. There are certain things that require her to stay with the Keepers at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Dyvinius\u2019s eyes glaze with ice. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlex Avery,\u201d Alex responds, positioning himself in front of me so I have to peek over his shoulder just to see what is going on.</p><p>\u201cIs there any relation to Stephan Avery?\u201d Dyvinius questions.</p><p>Alex reaches behind him and slips his fingers through mine. \u201cHe\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Dyvinius frowns, displeased. \u201cTell me, Alex, what are the circumstances that are keeping Gemma with the Keepers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Alex says. \u201cLike the Foreseers, the Keepers have certain things they have to keep to themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there are also laws we\u2019re all supposed to follow and the law states that if a person is able to use the crystal ball to see a vision, then they have to be trained in the City of Crystal by the Foreseers.\u201d His mouth sags and on his expressionless face, it looks alarming. \u201cIf Gemma doesn\u2019t stay here, then she could alter the future by accident. Or get trapped inside a vision if she tries to enter one again. Untrained Foreseers are very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>My heart races inside my chest. He\u2019s going to make me stay.</p><p>\u201cI understand that. I really do,\u201d Alex reassures him, stroking the back of my hand. \u201cBut there has to be something we can work out.\u201d</p> <p>Dyvinius considers this, running his thin fingers along the jewel patterns on the armrest. \u201cHmmm... like, maybe a bargain?\u201d A dark look arises on his face and his grin is very Cheshire Cat. \u201cPerhaps we can work something out. If you make a promise that she will never use a crystal ball again until she is properly trained, then I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t let her go back with the Keepers for a while.\u201d He pauses. \u201cOf course, after it\u2019s all done, she\u2019ll have to come back to get trained. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to have her make the promise, but I have a feeling you\u2019d rather do that.\u201d</p><p>Sensing something is wrong, I yank on Alex\u2019s arm. \u201cAlex, what will happen if you make the promise?\u201d</p><p>He moves his hand away from mine. \u201cI guess a promise can be arranged by me,\u201d Alex says through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Dyvinius beams, gesturing his hands at the palace land behind us. \u201cYou understand that you\u2019re making a promise and that there are consequences if you break the promise?\u201d</p><p>Alex nods slowly. \u201cYeah, I understand how it all works.\u201d</p><p>Dyvinius leans forward in the throne and looks like a greedy little thief with hunger in his eyes. \u201cThen I need you to say the words out loud.\u201d</p><p>I try to grab Alex\u2019s arm to stop him, but he wrenches it away. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I feel something break, like a crack in the sky, and I know that somehow he will be paying for making the promise. I want to hug him for it and hit him at the same time.</p><p>Dyvinius relaxes back on the throne. \u201cNow that that\u2019s been taken care of, I just need Gemma to read the vision correctly and then I\u2019ll let both of you return to the human world.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and move out from behind Alex, shooting him a quick questioning glance, but he avoids eye contact. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>Dyvinius responds, \u201cWell, I\u2019m guessing that when you went in the vision, either some clips were missing, or things might have been blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I reply. \u201cI could see what was going on, but I couldn\u2019t tell who anyone was because their faces were too blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, though. It will make it a little easier for you to correct because all you will have to do is put their faces together,\u201d Dyvinius explains. \u201cIt\u2019s when events are missing when things become a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but that doesn\u2019t explain how I\u2019m supposed to put their faces together,\u201d I say, deflated. Going back into the vision is one of the last things I want to do because I don\u2019t want to witness the woman drowning all over again. It was too painful the first time.</p><p>\u201cYou go back and read the vision again.\u201d Dyvinius looks at Nicholas who\u2019s sitting at the edge of the podium. \u201cAnd Nicholas will go in and help you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas rises to his feet with a sly smirk on his face. \u201cIt\u2019d be my pleasure.\u201d He winks at me and I glare in return.</p><p>This is all wrong. Not only do I have to go back into the horrifying vision, but I have to go in with the assistance of a foreseer/faerie/creepy pervert.</p><p>Dyvinius snaps his fingers and the chubby little man from earlier scurries out from behind the throne. He\u2019s carrying a crystal ball with violet ribbons swirling in the glass and it looks very similar to the one back at Adessa\u2019s. He places the ball in Dyvinius\u2019s hands and bows his head before scampering back behind the throne.</p><p>Dyvinius extends the crystal ball toward me with his fingers wrapped around the smooth glass. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>Sucking in a breath, I stride up to the podium and stop just short of the foot of the throne. I peer down at the crystal, seeing nothing but ribbons and the reflection of my violet eyes. \u201cI just place my hand on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo start with.\u201d Dyvinius motions at Nicholas. \u201cGet over here and take her hand.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas zealously snatches my hand and it takes a lot of effort not to cringe. \u201cOrders are orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, close your eyes and picture the vision you saw,\u201d Dyvinius instructs. \u201cThen hold the picture in your mind while you place your hand on the crystal.\u201d</p><p>Ready to get this over with, I shut my eyes and focus on the eerie lake full of painful memories. I picture the grey stoned castle with peaking towers, where the children are forced to go. I picture the trees and autumn leaves that blow from the wind as the woman drowns. I let my fingertips skim the glass and then I\u2019m jerked forward and my body ruptures into pieces before raining into the tunnel made of light.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>I drop out of the sky, like a bird with a broken wing, with no control over my landing. My feet crash into the ground and sink into the dirt. I trip forward, my knees bending, and roll my ankle to the side.</p><p>I hop forward, trying to shake it off. \u201cOne of these times, I\u2019m going to break apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Nicholas settles beside me and swiftly grabs ahold of my hand.</p><p>I tug my hand out of his and put weight on my sore ankle. Traveling by crystal is going to end up killing me with all the injuries I\u2019ve been getting. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just not very good at landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get the hang of it, eventually,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, I could give you private lessons.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and hobble forward toward the lake that\u2019s rippling in the soft breeze. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I shield my eyes and turn in a circle, taking in the green grass, the leaves dancing across the land and the castle looming in the distance. \u201cSo, what do I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wait until the vision starts.\u201d His sneakers scuff the dirt as he hurries to my side. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me when it does, though, so I can help you see it clearly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see when it starts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your vision, so only you can see it. That\u2019s the way things work.\u201d</p><p>I motion at the trees around the lake. \u201cWhat does this look like to you?\u201d</p><p>His shoulder presses against mine and the scent of lilacs, forest and rain invade my nostrils. \u201cEverything looks grey,\u201d he breathes. \u201cThere\u2019s a little haze and color here and there, but most of it is distorted.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to knee him in the leg to get him to back off when a streak of purple whizzes by us. The little girl dances and spins in the sand near the lake, her long, brown hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s starting.\u201d I move away from Nicholas and hike toward the shore.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d he calls out.</p><p>\u201cA girl dancing in front of a lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see her face?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s as blurry as it was the first time I saw the vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to focus harder,\u201d he says simply, trailing behind me.</p><p>Like it\u2019s that simple. I glance over my shoulder at him. \u201cFocus harder on what? The images?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a look that puts me on edge and then he struts up behind me. His fingers enfold around my upper arms and I start to step forward, but he lures me back. \u201cRight now, your mind is trying to adjust to the power of the crystal, but it can\u2019t quite figure out how to get completely there. The first thing you need to do is relax.\u201d</p><p>I try to overlook the flowery aroma and focus on relaxing. My mind searches for something that will make me calm. Laylen\u2019s face appears in my head, but then it shifts to Alex. But Alex doesn\u2019t make me calm. At all. He makes me uneasy, irrational and just plain insane. At the moment, though, seeing his green eyes settles my unstable pulse so I latch onto the image of him. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, now let your mind focus. The images are already in your head, but you haven\u2019t connected them to what you\u2019re seeing yet.\u201d His fingers creep up to my shoulders like little spiders. \u201cHave you ever looked at one of those magic eye pictures before?\u201d</p> <p>My shoulders stiffen under his touch. \u201cUh, yeah, I think so? In school, once, when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is kind of like looking at one of those.\u201d He begins to massage circles on my skin. \u201cRelax your eyes and let your mind make sense of the images.\u201d</p><p>Jerking my shoulders upward, I shrug off his hands and concentrate on the images. The boy has raced up to the girl and is guiding her away from the lake. Their faces are hazy, so I hold onto the image of Alex and it relaxes my eyes and unwinds my body. A tunnel starts to form and the trees and lake begin to blur into colors and shapeless images. Slowly, the girl\u2019s face alters like a lens on a camera. It\u2019s coming into focus\u2014</p><p>The man strides up the hills toward the shoreline and darkness sweeps across the land. The calm drains from my body and smothers my concentration with it.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nicholas asks.</p><p>\u201cI almost had it and then this man appeared and he ruined my concentration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him then. Try to pretend he\u2019s not there.\u201d</p> <p>Easier said than done. I know what the man does\u2014how evil he is. I return my line of concentration to the boy and cling onto the image of Alex again. The tunnel gradually shapes into a tornado, swirling around until it peaks at the bottom. The boy\u2019s features began to surface through the haze, but before I can link the image to my mind, the tunnel snaps back as the woman sprints up to the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I can\u2019t do it?\u201d I ask with discouragement. \u201cThen, what am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d he insists, still hovering over my shoulder. \u201cAll you have to do is catch a glimpse of each of their faces and, in the end; your mind will connect the pieces together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I can\u2019t see all of their faces before the vision ends?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a hushed chuckle. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have to keep you down here until you do.\u201d</p><p>Determination washes away my discouragement and I avert my attention back to the vision. The boy is heading back to the castle. Shoving anything related to stress out of my head, I relax and the tunnel develops again. Bits and pieces shift like a puzzle being put together and the haze begins to fade away. He has green eyes that match the leaves and grass, brown hair, and a sad look on his face. What a minute. That can\u2019t be... no there\u2019s no way.</p><p>As he disappears into the castle, I fling my concentration to the man, who is yanking the girl from the woman\u2019s arms. I focus on nothing else, except piecing together the girl\u2019s face. My head is pounding, but I refuse to look away. Seconds later, the tunnel spins and the blurriness crumples.</p><p>My jaw drops to the ground. Her eyes... The color... Violet. \u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d I mutter, slowly walking towards them. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>But no matter how many times I blink, she looks the same and a painful revelation slams against my chest. The girl is me. It makes no sense, though. I can\u2019t remember this happening. Besides I thought I was supposed to see the future, not the past.</p><p>The woman\u2014my mother, starts to back down the hill to the lake, and I will my legs to move and chase after her. Suddenly solving the vision is much more important than anything else in my life.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you going?!\u201d Nicholas shouts after me.</p><p>The tunnel zooms onto my mother\u2019s face; bright blue irises, a warm smile, snow-white skin. I think of the picture I found. As beautiful as she was in the picture, she\u2019s a hundred times more beautiful in person. It\u2019s all making sense now, pieces connecting, and the weight of it sends me to my knees.</p><p>Tears stream down my cheeks as I watch her get dragged beneath the water and the man leaves her, walking back up the hill. He has a sickening grin on his face, a scar on his cheek and hair as dark as the night sky. I grab onto every little detail I can. I hate this man, and I have to figure out who he is. I hate him with so much passion that it makes everything else inside me numb. I will kill him one day, like he killed my mom\u2014I will make him pay.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck happened? What did you see?\u201d Nicholas asks as the image of the man fades into the grass.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I suck back the tears and stare out at the dark, still water. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be something important since you\u2019re all worked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell him and get my feet under me. \u201cBut can you answer one question?\u201d</p><p>His mouth turns upward into a pleased grin. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible to see a vision that takes place in the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not very common, since there really isn\u2019t much point in seeing the past,\u201d He pauses, contemplating. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing your vision took place in the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so....\u201d I trail off, recollecting everything I\u2019ve seen and how much it hurts, deep inside my chest. \u201cCan we just go back now? The vision\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He eyes me over with his golden eyes. \u201cI know it is. I can see everything now that the vision is complete. It\u2019s a beautiful place, by the way. Well, minus the Keepers\u2019 castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the Keepers\u2019 castle?\u201d Alex had mentioned that the lake was the entrance to the Underworld, but he never said anything about the castle belonging to the Keepers. Why would he keep that from me?</p><p>He thrums his finger on his chin. \u201cI thought you would have known that since you\u2019re a Keeper.\u201d</p><p>I disregard his question because I have no idea if I\u2019m a Keeper or if he\u2019s supposed to think I am one. \u201cCan we go back now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d He eludes my question and strides toward me. \u201cWas there a purpose to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d There\u2019s a personal purpose to it, but the bigger picture is unclear. Something is tugging at the back of my mind, but it won\u2019t emerge. \u201cIs there supposed to be purpose to every vision? Is that maybe the reason why I saw it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, but not always. Normally, Foreseers use the crystal to see a vision that has a purpose.\u201d He tucks his hands into the pockets of his pants. \u201cBut your vision was started by accident, so maybe there\u2019s a reason you saw it, and maybe not. And maybe that\u2019s why you saw a vision from the past.\u201d</p><p>I know there\u2019s a reason I saw it. It\u2019s not just about me watching what happened to my mother. I\u2019m remembering it too, when it first happened, something I\u2019ve never been able to do before. \u201cPlease take me back.\u201d I hold out my hand for him to take.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go back? We can stay here a little bit longer... Get to know each other a little better.\u201d He moves toward me and I back away toward the trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d I ask as my back brushes against the trunk of a tree. \u201cDon\u2019t you know when someone\u2019s not interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Gemma.\u201d He reaches above me and his hand comes down to the side of my head. Autumn leaves fall from the branches and shower down over our heads. \u201cLet\u2019s stay here for a while and enjoy the seclusion.\u201d</p><p>I maintain a firm voice. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to stick around here. Now, please, take me back.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curves into a devious grin, then as quick as a flick of a firefly he leans forward and presses his lips to mine and his hand comes up to my breast.</p><p>I shove him back and slap him across the face. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever touch me without permission again.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his cheek. \u201cFeisty.\u201d He grins.</p><p>I march forward and lean into his face, stabbing my finger roughly against his chest. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take me back now, I\u2019ll show you how feisty I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d He lowers his hand from his face and there\u2019s a handprint on his cheek. He links arms with me and steers me back toward the hill. \u201cBut can I just say that you\u2019re a little nervous for a Keeper?\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m not a Keeper. I\u2019m just a confused girl stuck in a world that doesn\u2019t make sense. I feel the now- familiar pull bringing me back to the normal world; I shut my eyes and let myself go.</p><p>A little girl laughs as she runs around a tree and her fingers snag at the leaves on the low branches. \u201cYou can\u2019t catch me. You can\u2019t catch me.\u201d</p><p>A little boy with green eyes and dark brown hair chases after her. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>They both laugh as the girl runs out from behind a tree and sprints across the grass into a field of violet flowers. Her violet eyes blend with the flowers in the field and there\u2019s freedom in the way she runs, like she has no burdens bearing down on her shoulders; no fallen star, claiming hold of her heart. The boy dashes after her, moving faster. As he nears her, she stops in the center of the field and reels toward him. Her eyes sparkle as she considers something, then she races toward him and throws her arms around his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He catches her and they both laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re really on one today, aren\u2019t you? But that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m having fun.\u201d</p><p>She smiles brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend in the whole-wide world, Alex.\u201d</p><p>When I open my eyes, my feet are planted back on the podium in front of the empty throne with Nicholas at my side. The sky above looks a little darker and the blades of glass a little sharper, like the scenery has slightly altered. Or maybe it\u2019s my perception? Alex is sitting at the foot of the throne and a thousand emotions rush across his face at once as he rises to his feet. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>I look into his eyes that match the little boy\u2019s eyes in the vision. You\u2019ve known all along. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas frees my hand from his sweaty grip, saunters up next to the throne, and takes a seat in it. \u201cEverything looks smaller from up here.\u201d</p><p>Alex rolls his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s just what the Foreseers\u2019 need\u2014someone like you in charge.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas props his foot up on his knee, grips onto the armrest and raises his chin. \u201cI think it would be one of the smartest moves they could ever make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go,\u201d I interrupt them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here anymore.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shakes his head as he stands up from the throne. \u201cAnd if I was in charge, I would have never let you go.\u201d He steps down beside me. \u201cBecause you have a lot of power, Gemma. You just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know a lot of things yet, but I have a feeling I will, soon enough, because the truth is catching up with me, like a rushing wave ready to crash onto the idle sand of a beach.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>I have it all planned out. I\u2019ll make Alex tell me what\u2019s going on\u2014why I can suddenly remember things about my past. Why we once spent a day running around in a field, playing. Why we knew each other so well, but now we don\u2019t. But most importantly I need to find out what he knows about that day. The day my mother was killed.</p><p>As soon as we land in the cabin, he goes into protective mode. Suddenly, he\u2019s all about me and making sure I\u2019m okay. He gives me very little time to react.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d He places his hands on my shoulders and maneuvers me down the hall toward the couch in the living room.</p><p>I stare into his eyes and I mean really stare, past the spark, the power and the undying lust that always floods my body whenever I look at him. The scary part is that all I can see in his eyes is me.</p> <p>He slows down when we reach the coffee table and cups my cheek as he watches me meticulously. \u201cDid Nicholas... He didn\u2019t try anything, did he?\u201d</p><p>I cringe at the revolting recollection of the kiss and the grope. \u201cBesides being a pervert? No. But I\u2019m really wondering how you know the guy... faerie... Foreseer or whatever the hell he is.\u201d</p><p>Alex shrugs and his hand leaves my face and falls to his side. \u201cSometimes the Keepers will get together with the Foreseers and he would come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the Keepers\u2019 castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d His eyebrow crooks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, I saw it in the vision, remember?\u201d</p><p>He shifts his weight and stuffs his hands in his pockets. \u201cWere you able to see more this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d My eyes narrow as I cross my arms and push past the wall of control between him and me. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to tell me the truth. I mean it this time. None of your bullshit, omitting the truth.</p> <p>He claims my gaze, mimicking my assertiveness. \u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the worst possible answer because a question like this only ends with a bleeding heart. \u201cHas my memory been tampered with?\u201d</p><p>The grandfather clock in the corner ticks maddeningly loud in the background and the snow splatters at the windows. The beams above our heads creak and somewhere in the house a faucet is dripping.</p><p>He stares at me indifferently and unmoving, as if time has immobilized and I know that it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d I cry as my heart splits open and bleeds out. \u201cJust answer me.\u201d</p><p>He flinches at the sound of my voice and time seems to move again. \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>My voice shakes uncontrollably as I close the distance between us so he can see me bleeding from the inside. \u201cBecause the little girl in the vision was me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and he looks genuinely shocked. \u201cIt was you? How\u2019s that even possible? I thought visions were of the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas said it happens sometimes,\u201d I snap. \u201cBut don\u2019t pretend like you didn\u2019t already know that. The whole time in the car, when I was babbling my heart out about the woman drowning in the lake, you pretended you didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and his hands leave his pockets. He reaches for me, but then decides against it and pulls back. \u201cI swear, I didn\u2019t, Gemma. The first time you told me was the first time I ever heard a story like it.\u201d He pauses, making sure to maintain my gaze. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t know is why you think the little girl is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause her eyes were violet.\u201d The prickle stabs at the back of my neck and all my anger channels to him. I shove him, just to make myself feel better. To feel something that\u2019s real. \u201cAnd the woman in the lake...\u201d I can\u2019t finish because saying it out loud makes her death even more real.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t stumble back, doesn\u2019t flinch, and doesn\u2019t move. He\u2019s an indestructible statue that I wish I could break and crumble so he\u2019d be broken like me. Then maybe he could understand and tell me how to take the pain away. \u201cThe woman in the lake was your mother.\u201d He whispers to himself.</p><p>My mother is gone, to a world full of evil torture, where she\u2019s either dead or insane, and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m in that world too.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and his voice and eyes soften. \u201cGemma, I don\u2019t even know what to say. I\u2019m about as confused as you.\u201d He\u2019s quiet for a while, considering something, and then he lets out an uneven breath. \u201cYou think your memories been erased?\u201d</p><p>I nod, gripping the edge of the coffee table and trying to breathe. I\u2019ve lost all control. The prickle is stabbing at the back of my neck. I\u2019m breaking apart, dying, and I wish it would all just end. \u201cDo you remember when we were in the cabin and I was crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d His voice is a whisper through the blood roaring in my ears.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I was crying is because I saw something... something that was kind of like a vision,\u201d I say, going back to the peaceful place. \u201cI was in this field and it was at night and there was a little girl and a woman there, too. They couldn\u2019t see me and I couldn\u2019t see their faces. I thought that I was dreaming, but it felt so real and familiar. Familiar as in a lost memory.\u201d I stand up straight. \u201cFamiliar as in I was four-years-old when my mom died and I went to live with Marco and Sophia. Familiar as in I\u2019d lived it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out you were four?\u201d He doesn\u2019t even try to deny it.</p><p>\u201cLaylen told me,\u201d I fume. \u201cHe told me a lot of things\u2014truthful things. He isn\u2019t a liar like you.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and fury flashes in his eyes. Before I can react, he picks me up, lays me onto the couch and encloses his body over mine. He situates his elbows next to my head and presses his chest close to mine so my hands are caged.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d I complain. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to hear me out.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice shakes as his emotions begin to flee from the box he usually keeps them in. \u201cAnd listen to the whole story before you over-react.\u201d</p><p>I continue to cry and it makes me feel weak. I need to stop crying. Stop crying! \u201cThen, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he assures me. \u201cI just knew about it, which to you is probably equally as bad, but it had to be done.\u201d</p><p>I sob silently as the possibilities of what happened swirl in my head. \u201cPlease, just tell me. I can\u2019t take the dark anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember the prophecy I told you about?\u201d he asks quickly and I nod. \u201cWell, I left out a few parts of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImportant parts, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s usually the case when parts are left out.\u201d He transfers his weight, giving me a little breathing room as he continues, \u201cWhile Stephan was trying to figure out a way to keep the prophecy from happening, your mother disappeared\u2014or, if what you say is correct, was thrown into the Underworld.\u201d He pauses, staring down into my eyes, but he isn\u2019t looking at me; he\u2019s remembering. \u201cYou were extremely emotional... Crying all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had just lost my mom,\u201d I snap and twist my body beneath him. \u201cOf course I was emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it was wrong. I\u2019m just trying to explain why Stephan did what he did,\u201d he says, breaking out of the memory. \u201cA lot of Keepers are born with gifts, some more useful than others. The one Sophia has is called unus quisnam aufero animus, or one who removes the soul.\u201d</p><p>The prickle taunts the back of my neck, embedding deeper into my skin. \u201cYou took my soul away!\u201d Strength overcomes me and somehow, I manage to get my arms in between us to shove him off and he actually falls to the floor.</p><p>He\u2019s stunned. I\u2019m stunned. And, for a moment, we both remain frozen in place. Then I snap out of my trance and leap up from the couch. \u201cThis is worse than the star. At least that can be construed as adding life, but taking away my soul is like ripping away the very essence of my humanity. I\u2019m nothing but a shell of a girl. There\u2019s nothing inside me!\u201d The room sways and my vision spots as the truth sinks into my skin like acid. I grasp onto the back of the sofa, gasping for air. \u201cHoly shit! I\u2019m not even a person... I\u2019m not anything...\u201d</p><p>Alex moves up behind me and places his hand on the small of my back. \u201cCalm down, okay? That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet\u2014away\u2014from\u2014me,\u201d I gasp between shallow breaths, jerking my shoulder upwards, trying to shrug his hand off my back. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to listen to me,\u201d he begs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take your soul away. It was something different\u2014something less drastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, just say it,\u201d I demand. \u201cAnd stop tiptoeing around the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome sit down with me and I will.\u201d He smoothes his hand down my back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I lower my body closer to the couch and cling onto it. Please let this be a dream. I want to wake up.</p><p>His arm wraps around my side. His hand slides under me and onto my stomach. Then he draws me back, gets a hand under my knees and scoops me up. He sits down, bringing me down with him, so I\u2019m sideways on his lap and my legs are on the armrest. \u201cI need to finish this, Gemma. You need to know\u2014deserve to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then why didn\u2019t you just tell me from the beginning?\u201d I wipe the tears from my eyes with the sleeve of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not a nice person, Gemma,\u201d he states bluntly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure, after I tell you; you\u2019re going to hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can live with that?\u201d I choke. \u201cMe, hating you forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He inhales deeply and shuts his eyes. \u201cBut I need to get it out of me because I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d He opens his eyes and hunts for something in mine. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s looking for; the truth about my feelings, whether I will hate him, or just how much pain is in me. It doesn\u2019t really matter, though, because nothing is in me, but heartache.</p> <p>\u201cTell me.\u201d My voice is like dandelion seeds in the wind, defenseless against the power.</p><p>He nods, moves his hand up my back and holds onto me. \u201cThe unus quisnam aufero animus is mostly used as a form of punishment, but we weren\u2019t trying to punish you. You were just a little girl and Jocelyn\u2019s daughter. So, Sophia did something a little less severe. She detached your soul from your emotions. Since emotions have such a huge connection with memories, it made it so you couldn\u2019t remember anything about your past.\u201d</p><p>An annoying buzzing develops inside my head, like a hive full of bees stabbing at my brain. Alex inspects me attentively, trying to anticipate my next move, but all I can focus on is the buzzing.</p><p>\u201cAfter your soul was detached, you moved to Laramie to live with Marco and Sophia so they could keep you hidden from the Death Walkers,\u201d he continues, putting a hand on my shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the cold that made it difficult to track the star\u2019s energy, but I\u2019m not exactly sure what.\u201d He gives me a shadow of a smile. \u201cYour soul is still in you, though, along with your memories. You just can\u2019t connect with either of them. Or... couldn\u2019t.\u201d He gives me a look that makes my skin hot and fiery, and it isn\u2019t just the electricity. It\u2019s something else\u2014something deep within my core; a wick trying to ignite. Maybe it\u2019s my soul trying to reunite with me. Or maybe it\u2019s just a feeling that will eventually simmer out.</p><p>I slow my breathing before I speak. \u201cWhy did I start to feel again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows the answer to that.\u201d He shuts his eyes and massages his temples with the tips of his fingers. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve become immune to Sophia\u2019s gift.\u201d</p><p>Breathe. Just breathe. \u201cShe tried to do it again?\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes and his pupils shrivel to pin dots. \u201cShe tried it a few months ago, after you started showing emotions again. You don\u2019t remember because she did it while you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean she snuck into my room, while I was sleeping?\u201d I sit up, rotate my aching body and kneel up on his lap. \u201cThat\u2019s the sickest and most twisted thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips delve into my hipbones as he detains me from getting up. \u201cI doubt that, but yes, it\u2019s kind of twisted.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, put my hands on his shoulders, and push away from him as much as I can. \u201cSo what\u2019s your\u2019 brilliant plan now? Keep me locked up here until it\u2019s time for the portal to open?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an indication of pity in his bright green eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else with the same gift as Sophia that\u2019s heading here right now. He\u2019s supposed to be more powerful than Sophia and Stephan seems convinced it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>My hand collides with his face and my palm strikes his cheek. His eyes widen. Mine widen. I\u2019m trembling from anger, regret and the deep slashes he\u2019s put in my heart. I have no control over myself anymore, but I never really did. So I let the windstorm take me away as I get to my feet and head toward the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou say it like it doesn\u2019t matter, but it does.\u201d I pick up his pocketknife that\u2019s on the table and he jumps to his feet as I flip the blade open.</p><p>\u201cGemma, don\u2019t,\u201d he warns, winding around the couch to get to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d I ask rounding around the table. I stretch my arm out in front of me and put the tip of the blade to my wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt myself or don\u2019t feel the pain? Which one is it, Alex. Which one really matters to you?\u201d</p><p>He stops on the other side of the table as I drag the knife down my forearm. My arms and hands shake as blood spills out and streams down my arm. It hurts, but not as much as my heart. \u201cI\u2019m a person. I breathe, I have blood inside me.\u201d My voice trembles as I toss the knife onto the floor. \u201cI\u2019m not just a fucking star!\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t utter a word. He just watches the blood drip onto the floor and stain the wood. I suck in a sharp breath as tears drift down my cheeks and then I turn my back on him and storm into the bedroom. I think about jumping out the window. I could run and live and breathe. I could feel whatever I want. Be whatever I want. I could find love and be whole. I could find out what I really want.</p><p>But deep down, I know that I can\u2019t. It\u2019s bigger than me and no matter what I do the problem will always be there. It\u2019s either my emotions or the world. So I stay in the room and throw myself on the bed where I cry and cry until I my eyes are dry. Then I lie quietly and let myself bleed.</p> <p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I whisper beneath the stars. \u201cPlease. I need it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, I can\u2019t,\u201d Alex says, but I can see his self-control withering. \u201cI want to so bad, but I\u2019ve already done it too much.\u201d</p><p>I clutch onto his shoulders, still fixated on the stars. \u201cPlease, I want to feel what it\u2019s like just once before it\u2019s gone. I want to know what it\u2019s like to forget for just one second\u2014what it\u2019s like to completely connect with someone.\u201d</p><p>He sketches his finger along my collarbone without speaking and I look away from the stars. There\u2019s blackness in his eyes like the darkness in the sky, but within the depths of his pupils there\u2019s a spark that matches the stars.</p><p>He leans in and kisses me. Slowly at first, but then as the electricity takes over, his lips and tongue become rougher. He begins to rip my clothes off and I want him to because I want to feel the last part of being human\u2014the most powerful feeling that ever existed.</p><p>Love.</p><p>And maybe this will be the way I finally find it.</p><p>My eyes shoot open to the bedroom ceiling of the cabin as the feelings of the dream kisses my skin and makes me want to breathe. My cheeks are damp with tears; my neck and wrist ache. There\u2019s a hand on my wrist and a warm body very close to me. I tilt my head to the side and find Alex kneeling on the bed, winding gauze around my self-inflicted injury.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you keep it up you\u2019re going to be one big bandage.\u201d He snips the end with a pair of scissors and then chucks them on the nightstand. Then he slides his legs out from underneath him and sits down on the side of the bed. \u201cGemma, what the fuck were you thinking? You nearly cut your vein open.\u201d</p><p>I turn my back to him as I roll onto my side. \u201cI wanted to show you that I\u2019m a real person, that hurts, and bleeds just like any other person. I wanted you to understand that I\u2019m not just a Goddamn star.\u201d</p><p>The mattress springs up as he shifts from the bed and I think he\u2019s leaving, but then the mattress concaves as he sits down beside me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to make you feel better and I\u2019m probably the worst person to try, but I\u2019m going to try anyway.\u201d His arm moves over to my side and in his hand is a locket, shaped like a heart. There are floral engravings in the silver, along with a violet stone and carved on the back are the initials \u201cG. L.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are my initials?\u201d I touch the front of it with my fingertips and a memory flashes in my mind. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be yours before the Keepers took it away because they were afraid it would... it would resurface your memories.\u201d He pauses and slips his fingers through the chain of the necklace. \u201cYour mom gave it to you.\u201d</p><p>I sit up on the bed and face him. There are dark circles under his eyes and my blood is all over his shirt. He looks defeated, a tree with a split trunk about to break apart and fall over. He looks how I feel.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you showing it to me?\u201d I ask, trailing my fingers up the thin chain until I reach his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he says with mystification. \u201cI just can\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t have any control over anything when I\u2019m with you and, honestly, I\u2019m sick of fighting it.\u201d</p><p>I coil the chain around my finger. \u201cSo if I asked you to take me away\u2014save me from the Keepers and let me keep my emotions, would you?\u201d</p><p>He forces a lump in his throat down. \u201cI have no idea and I\u2019m begging you not to ask me because, if I say yes, then everything will end and, if I say no, you and I will end. There\u2019s no right answer.\u201d</p><p>I want to ask him. I want to know just how much he feels for me because I\u2019m reaching my end and I want to understand everything that I can. I want to feel what I felt in my dream. I need to do everything I can before my time is up. \u201cCan I wear the necklace?\u201d</p><p>He nods and then motions for me to turn around. \u201cI\u2019ll put it on you.\u201d</p><p>I turn in the bed, tuck my legs under me and sweep my hair to the side. \u201cI have to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>He moves up behind me. \u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>I tap my fingers on my knee, unsure why it even matters. \u201cDo you feel bad? And I mean, really feel bad for hurting me; for lying to me?\u201d</p><p>His breath feathers against the back of my neck. \u201cGemma, I can\u2019t... I\u2019m not... We shouldn\u2019t even be talking about this. I was never supposed to tell you.\u201d</p><p>My fingers wrap inward and my nails scrape a layer of my skin away. \u201cFine, please put the necklace on.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move and I dig my nails in deeper because the physical pain suffocates the emotional hurt. \u201cI made a promise to you once that I would never do anything to hurt you,\u201d he finally speaks. \u201cWhen we were kids, and I meant it more than I\u2019ve ever meant anything in my life.\u201d He pauses and we both take in a breath. \u201cSo if you want to know, if I feel bad for breaking my promise and letting you hurt for the last seventeen years, then, yes, I do. It kills me every day.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond and he doesn\u2019t give me time, clearing his throat as he hooks the chain around my neck. \u201cI can\u2019t quite get it to hook right.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my lip and shut my eyes as I nod. \u201cIt looks pretty old.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later, his fingers graze my neck. \u201cWell, shit. I guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at him and his eyes look a little watery. \u201cWrong about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you being a Foreseer.\u201d He gently touches the back of my neck. \u201cYou got your mark.\u201d</p><p>I glance around the room for a mirror, but there isn\u2019t one. \u201cIs it a circle, wrapping an \u2018S\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that was the Foreseer\u2019s mark?\u201d he questions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw it on Dyvinius.\u201d I turn back around so he can put the necklace on. My shoulders slouch as his arms put pressure on them. \u201cSo this means I\u2019m actually a Foreseer and it\u2019s not the star causing the visions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d His fingers repetitively brush my neck as he fiddles with the clamp. \u201cI thought it was just the star\u2019s power setting off the crystal because usually the Foreseer ability is inherited.\u201d</p><p>I let my chin touch the hollow of my neck so he can get the necklace fastened. \u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t one?\u201d</p><p>The clamp clicks and then his fingers move away from my neck. \u201cJocelyn was just a Keeper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about my father?\u201d I ask, shutting my eyes as his fingers tangle in my hair. \u201cMaybe he could be one.\u201d</p><p>He tugs at the roots and pulls my head back. What is he doing? \u201cMaybe, but I can\u2019t say for sure since I don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who he is?\u201d I raise my head up and he lets go of my hair, then I turn around and face him. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Jocelyn would never tell anyone who he was.\u201d He kneels up on the bed in front of me. \u201cFor some reason, she insisted she had to keep it a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m alone in the world?\u201d I say and blow out a breath at the truth. \u201cI mean, really alone?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head and gives me a sad smile. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d I disagree. \u201cI have no mother or father. No memories. No friends.\u201d He starts to protest, but I cut him off. \u201cAnd I understand that soon the pain connected to those will all be gone, but right now it hurts more than the Goddamn cut on my arm.\u201d I pause as I worked up the courage to ask a question I haven\u2019t even so much as dared to think until now. \u201cCan I ask you something?\"</p><p>He looks wary. \u201cIt depends.\u201d</p><p>I ask him anyway. \u201cWhat happens after I stop the portal from opening? Then what?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he stares at the corner of the room and, for a fleeting moment, he looks like he might cry. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I could press him further, but there\u2019s no point because I know there are only two ways it could go. I live or I die. I will have a life or I won\u2019t. I will end empty and unknowing, or finally be free. I wonder how people do it. Face death when they know it\u2019s coming? Seize the day when there are minimal days left?</p> <p>I crash to the bed, my head falling to my hands as I begin to sob. For once, I want to do exactly what I want when I choose and feel every single part of the moment, without holding back or being afraid. I want to live in the moment.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d Alex places a hand on my back. \u201cPlease calm down.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as tears stream down my cheeks. My chances are going to end soon. My emotions are going to be ripped away and they may never return. I may never get my moment to feel happiness, love, peace, freedom. And I need one that\u2019s mine.</p><p>I sit up and give him no time to respond as I crash my lips into his. I clutch onto his shirt as he kisses me back until my lips swell and my lungs need air. Then he grabs my shoulders and breaks us apart.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d His breath is ragged. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaves wildly. \u201cYes, we can. Please. I just want to feel before it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d There\u2019s sympathy in his eyes and my heart prepares for rejection. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve kissed me before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know and it\u2019s getting harder and harder, but I\u2019m afraid if I start I won\u2019t stop this time. There\u2019s just too much...\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much meaning and that makes everything more complicated. I\u2019m going to lose control and I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if it would hurt as bad if someone else said it, because it hurts like a knife to my heart, coming from his mouth. I know there are reasons why it shouldn\u2019t matter, but it does because he\u2019s the one that hurt me. He\u2019s also the first person I\u2019ve felt something for. What the emotion is, I don\u2019t know yet. It could be hate. It could be lust. It could be love. There is a very thin line between all three.</p><p>I start to climb off the bed as the moment leaves me when he grabs me by the arm and pulls me back to him. He licks his lips and his elbows bend in a little as he lures me closer. Then without warning, that loss of control takes over and he\u2019s kissing me violently. I wrap my arms around his neck as he scoops me up and lays me on my back. His fingers knot through my hair while his other hand travels down my neck, my breast, all the way down to the top of my jeans. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s wrong after everything that has happened. What I care about is having the moment before I\u2019m gone. I want it more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything. I want him to slip his fingers inside me and feel me like he did in the car. I want to feel the peace inside my body. I want to feel connected to someone wholly and completely, even if it\u2019s for a few irrational moments.</p><p>His tongue slips into my mouth as his hand slides under my shirt. He snags the hem of it and his other hand glides around to my back. Holding my weight up, he yanks my shirt off in one swift motion and then he unhooks my bra. My chest heaves as I lean up, grab his shirt and begin to take it off because I want to see him and feel him like he\u2019s seen me.</p><p>I get it stuck on his head and he lets go of me to reach behind him and finish tugging it off. I immediately slide my hands up the front of his chest that\u2019s carved of muscles and imprinted with a black circle and a ring of flames\u2014his Keepers\u2019 mark.</p><p>He covers my hands with his as it nears his neck. Fire blazes in his eyes as he brings my wrists together in front of me. He\u2019s careful not to put pressure on my injured wrist as he moves his body forward and forces me down onto my back. Then he lets me go and compels our chests together. I shut my eyes and inhale in the closeness, the contact, the human connection. Our skin statics as our bodies join and our hearts thud against each other\u2019s chests. I lie there letting the feelings overtake me, consume me. I\u2019m flying, falling, spiraling out of control. The prickle is going wild and a ravenous need I never knew existed jerks me forward. I grab onto his face and seal my lips to his. There\u2019s no hesitation on his part as he kisses me back with every part of his body. I keep thinking I need air because I\u2019m not breathing, but my lungs somehow find a way around that. I stop needing air and I\u2019m free.</p><p>My fingers travel up his back and his skin is scorching underneath my palms. His back is stimulated by my touch and he slips a hand under my neck, gripping my skin, demanding me closer. He takes my uninjured arm and my elbow bends as he pins it next to my head. His tongue traces the inside of my mouth before he takes soft nips at my lips, my neck and then just above my chest. Then his tongue rolls across my nipple as he gently draws into his mouth and sucks hard, but I want him to do it harder. I want my feelings to overtake the knowledge of what lies ahead. I want him to make me feel one last time and give me something to hold onto.</p><p>Craving to get closer, I open my legs up and let his body fall between them. I begin writhing my hips and rubbing against him, but it isn\u2019t enough this time and he lets me go as he shifts away from me, kneeling up between my legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I pant as I rise up on my elbows.</p><p>Without saying a word, he flicks the button of my jeans and tugs them down to my knees.</p><p>\u201cAlex.\u201d I moan as his fingers trail down the inside of my thighs.</p><p>He stops at the sound of my voice and meets my eyes. He\u2019s not in control anymore\u2014I\u2019m not in control anymore. Our emotions are controlling us. And the electricity. And the need to keep feeling it. Lust is definitely an addiction; like heroin, potent and controlling.</p><p>His fists clench and I hear a tear in his voice. \u201cGemma, I think, I should stop... I don\u2019t want to. You make me... Fuck, you make me feel alive.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer him. I just kick my jeans off, instigating a low growl out of him as he lies down on top of me again. His hands wander all over my breasts, my hips, my thighs. Ultimately, he takes off my panties and slips his fingers inside me. He feels me until I cry out and then he strips off the rest of his clothes.</p><p>I lie naked underneath him, my body sweaty and my heart racing, pumping adrenaline through my body. All I can feel is the warmth of his skin, the comfort of his body and the overriding desire to stay away from what the prickle wants me to feel because it\u2019s advising me that I should pull away. Danger.</p><p>When he slips inside me it hurts more than cutting my wrist open, but I\u2019m glad that it hurts. It makes it real, not fake, like everything else is in my life. He closes his eyes and breathes in through his nose as his head lowers like he\u2019s savoring the moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he whispers against my cheek.</p><p>I nod, turn my head toward him and our lips connect. He kisses me deeply as he rocks into me and I respond with an arch of my back. It hurts, but it also feels amazingly good and I want more. I loosen up the muscles in my legs so he can rock into me more easily and allow our bodies to move together. His eyes are untamed as he brings my arms above my head and even though it hurts my wrist, I let him hold me down.</p><p>When he kisses me again, I bite at his lip and he lets out a groan. With each thrust, my body and mind climb higher toward the ceiling, the sky, and the stars. When I feel myself reaching that highest point, I open my eyes and let my head fall back. I feel myself fix and then break apart again as I leave my mind and then slowly return. Somewhere along the line, I start to cry for reasons I don\u2019t understand. Not wanting him to see, I shut my eyes and turn my head.</p><p>Seconds later, Alex\u2019s movements become less rhythmic and then he stills inside me. We pant, our sweaty bodies pressed together and our hearts beating violently. He moves away and gives me a quick kiss on my cheek as he pulls out of me. I feel empty, hollow, like my heart and mind are severed from my body. I roll onto my stomach as he lies down on his back. It\u2019s quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou were right from the beginning,\u201d he says as he stares up at the ceiling with his arms tucked under his head. \u201cYou used to know me and really well. When we were kids.\u201d</p><p>I rest my hand next to my face. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He turns his head and meets my gaze. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve started to remember things,\u201d I say. \u201cLike us running around in a field.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tugs to a small smile. \u201cThe one with all the flowers?\u201d</p><p>I nod and my voice falters. I don\u2019t remember, not really anyway because they\u2019re just clips and images to me. \u201cWe seemed like we were having fun.\u201d</p><p>His smile turns sad as he scoots down onto the pillow and rolls onto his hip. \u201cWe had a lot of fun. You used to pick the flowers and give them to me all the time, even though I would tell you time and time again that guys are supposed to give the girl flowers.\u201d</p><p>I remember back in his car and how there was a dried flower hanging from the mirror. I wonder if that\u2019s why he kept it there. Maybe he has thought about me all these years. I could ask him, but I\u2019m not sure I want to know because either answer will hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips part and it looks like he\u2019s going to say something that will change everything. \u201cGemma, I....\u201d He trails off and his throat muscles move to force a lump in his throat down.</p><p>We don\u2019t say anything else as we lay face-to-face with our hands barely touching and stare at each other. It\u2019s like a silent good-bye and the moment is flawless because it\u2019s real. Part of me wishes that when I fall asleep, I\u2019ll die right there on a peaceful note.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>\u201cGemma, wake up.\u201d Someone kisses my forehead and brings a static zap to my skin.</p> <p>I roll over, griping and moaning. \u201cI\u2019m too tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, please just open your eyes,\u201d he pleads.</p><p>Sighing, I open my eyes. Alex is standing near the edge of the bed, leaning over me. He\u2019s put his clothes back on and there\u2019s a bag over his shoulder. I sit up, bringing the sheet with me to keep my naked body covered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask and then curl my knees into my chest. \u201cIt\u2019s time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, hurries to the foot of the bed and picks my jeans and t-shirt up, tossing them to me. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Panic surges through my body as I grab my jeans and quickly slide my legs into them. \u201cDid the Death Walkers find us?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head again as he walks over to the window and peers out. It\u2019s dark outside, but the moon is bright and the stars are vivid. \u201cNo, I\u2019m taking you away from here.\u201d</p><p>I tug my shirt over my head and flip my hair out of the collar. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\"</p><p>He moves away from the window and adjusts the handle of the bag higher onto his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I thought I could, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I button my jeans, but pause as shock sets in. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me away so they won\u2019t detach my soul?\u201d</p><p>He nods, stepping in front of me. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it again... Lose you again.\u201d</p> <p>I scratch my head, at a loss for words as I slide to the edge of the bed. \u201cBut I thought it has to be done? So the star can stay preserved and save the world... Alex, I don\u2019t understand?\u201d I\u2019ve prepared myself for the end and now he\u2019s saying it isn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t know what to do with that.</p><p>He releases a slow breath and then squats down in front of me. He places his hands on my knees and keeps his voice low. \u201cI know that the world needs to be saved, but right now, I can\u2019t do it. Right now, I need you to come with me so that we can at least try to find another way to save it or get the star out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201c</p><p>He puts his finger over my lips. \u201cBut I need you to come now, because my father\u2019s going to be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a defining moment in my life; one that I will either look back and regret or cherish. I rise to my feet and he threads his fingers through mine as panic and relief flash across his face. We exchange a look of understanding and then we run down the hall together and out into the garage.</p><p>There\u2019s an old, black Jeep Wrangler parked in the middle and he guides me over to the passenger side door. I hop in and he rounds the front while I quickly buckle my seatbelt.</p><p>He drops the bag onto the console, climbs in, and slams the door. Then he unzips the bag and takes out a sword. It has a silver blade with jagged edges and a black handle with a red stone on the end. Carved along the side of the blade is the Mark of Immortality and there are flakes of dried blood on the metal.</p><p>\u201cIs that the Sword Of Immortality?\u201d I ask and he nods.</p> <p>He turns the key and the engine purrs to life. Then he presses on the garage door opener, rests the sword in his lap, and tosses the bag on the backseat. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>I eyeball the sword as the garage door creeps open and snow drifts in. \u201cBut I thought we were running from your father?\u201d</p><p>He shifts the car into reverse. \u201cWe\u2019re running from everyone now, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>My eyes expand as I realize how true this is. Once we drive away, it\u2019s just him and me against a large army of Death Walkers and a group of Keepers who will do anything to protect the world.</p><p>With one hand gripping the steering wheel and the other grasping the shifter, he sucks in a deep breath. \u201cOkay, hold on. It\u2019s going to be a pain in the fucking ass to get out of here. The snow\u2019s worse up here than it is in Laramie.\u201d</p><p>I clutch onto the handle on the roof and brace my feet against the dash. As the door reaches the top, he floors the gas, but then quickly taps the brakes. He stares in the rearview mirror with a look of horror on his face. I follow his gaze to the back window with fear in my veins, wondering if his father has arrived. There are hundreds of yellow eyes flickering through the trees and shimmering against the snow. The whole area looks like it\u2019s lit up with twinkling Christmas lights. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m more upset, or less, that it\u2019s Death Walkers and not his father. Do I want my soul more or my life?</p><p>Through the midst of the Death Walkers a tall figure steps forward and into the garage. As the light hits his face, my hand grips the door handle. The scar on his cheek, the darkness in his eyes, the evil he brings with him.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no.\u201d I whisper as I flip the handle and crack the door. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>Alex turns his head toward me. He\u2019s still holding the sword and his knuckles have gone white. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>I let go of the door and clutch onto his arm. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s the man who put my mother in The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head in denial. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no way.\u201d</p><p>I release his arm and trace my finger down my cheek. \u201cYes, the man in the vision had that exact same scar.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s acting strange, torn and baffled. He reaches for the handle of the door and then changes his mind and shuts off the engine. The man enters the garage and cold air gushes through the vents of the car. \u201cYou can\u2019t be right,\u201d Alex mutters as he lowers his head onto the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cAlex, I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s him,\u201d I practically shout. \u201cThat\u2019s the man.\u201d</p><p>He raises his head and the look in his eyes takes me off guard because he looks like he doesn\u2019t know what the hell to do. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. That can\u2019t be him because it\u2019s Stephan... That\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>The Death Walkers close in on the house, tromping up the driveway and leaving their tracks in the snow. Soon the exit is blocked by rows and rows of black-cloaked creatures, freezing the land and house. It\u2019s snowing unbreakably, veil of ice falling from the sky and to the earth. It makes it hard to see, but I can still see enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I ask Alex as I kneel in the seat and keep my eyes on Stephan. \u201cI mean, he showed up with them... and he did that to my mom.\u201d</p><p>Stephan is just lurking at the opening of the garage, leaning against the doorframe, like he\u2019s waiting for us to come to him. Like we\u2019re that stupid.</p><p>Alex takes the keys out of the ignition and stuffs them into his pocket. He turns his body toward the door with the sword positioned at his side. He doesn\u2019t explain as he starts to open the door.</p><p>I grab the back of his shirt and yank on it. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously not getting out, are you?\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder at me and then exhales before leaning over the console. He gathers the chain of my necklace in his hand and I think he\u2019s going to tug on it and break it off my neck, but instead, he tucks it beneath my shirt. \u201cWhatever you do, keep that hidden. Don\u2019t let anyone know you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I reach for him as he moves away and land on the console as he climbs out of the car. He shuts the door, leaving me alone in the cab.</p><p>I press my hand to the locket hidden under my shirt. Why did he do that? Why would he make me hide it? I think I might know, but I\u2019m not ready to accept it, yet, because it means that he no longer wants to save me. It means that the last few beautiful moments together didn\u2019t mean anything. It means that he believes his father is good even after showing up with the Death Walkers. Alex and Stephan exchange a few words at the back of the car. Alex is talking heatedly with his hands, waving the sword around, and Stephan is a motionless conversationalist. I force my gaze off them and start searching the car for a weapon. I\u2019m not going to go down without a fight, not just for myself, but for my mother.</p><p>I find an aged pocketknife in the glove compartment and take it out. This isn\u2019t going to end well. I can feel it through every infliction that has been done to me, but I get out of the car anyway with the knife in my hand and round to the back of the Jeep, plotting a way to kill him and wondering if I have it in me.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Stephan says in an eerily calm voice as I round the rear of the Jeep and come up behind Alex. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>Alex glances over his shoulder at me and his eyes go straight to the knife clutched in my hand. Don\u2019t even think about, he mouths and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWell, Alex, you\u2019ve done a really shitty job keeping her out of trouble,\u201d Stephan says as he walks over to a shelf in the garage and rolls up the sleeves of his button-down shirt. He scans the shelves and then selects a pickaxe. \u201cI thought I taught you better than that. I thought I taught you to be strong, not weak and pathetic.\u201d He holds the axe like a baseball bat and gives it a practice swing. My eyes never leave the blade. \u201cI thought I taught you to never let your emotions get in the way. To turn it off and always put your obligation as a Keeper first.\u201d</p><p>Alex holds the sword behind his back with the sharp tip pointed at the floor. \u201cI was, but I\u2014\u201c</p><p>Stephan swipes the axe down and sinks the blade into the wood of the shelf. It breaks apart and splinters of wood fly through the air. \u201cI don\u2019t want fucking excuses. What I want, is a son that obeys and only follows my orders.\u201d</p><p>I finally understand why Alex is so hot and cold. Laylen nailed it. He\u2019s brainwashed, or at least, his father has tried to brainwash him; tried to create a soldier that only listens to him. The problem is, that the passionate emotions that grasp you and control you in the heat of the moment are far more powerful than ones that sedate you.</p><p>Stephan continues to swing the axe over and over again, ripping the garage into pieces of wood and spilled tools. He kicks at the tire of the car and slams his fist into the window. Glass covers the floor and scatters by our feet, but he doesn\u2019t stop until everything is broken.</p><p>Alex reaches back and grabs my hand as Stephan turns toward the driveway and flings the axe out at the Death Walkers. It hits one of the monsters in the chest and it lets out a deafening scream, but the rest stay motionless, the tail of their cloaks gusting in the wind as snow blows down on their heads.</p><p>Stephan stills and runs his hands down the front of his shirt, brushing bits of wood off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to punish you.\u201d He seizes Alex\u2019s arm and yanks the Sword of Immortality from his hand. \u201cBut you\u2019re no longer going to be a part of this.\u201d He holds the sword in front of him and greed consumes his eyes. \u201cFinding this, however, is the one thing you\u2019ve done right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex\u2019s pulse is pounding through his fingers and against my own racing pulse. His free hand sneaks around his back and he feels around for the knife. He pries my fingers off it, steals it from me, and holds it at his side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand from his and search for a weak spot or wide gaps between the Death Walkers that maybe I can slip through and then run out into the night. Because, I\u2019m not going down without a fight.</p><p>Alex draws his elbow back and then his arm darts forward. It happens so quickly it takes my brain a second to catch up, but when I grasp what is going on, blood is spilling out of Stephan\u2019s chest. The knife is lodged in his chest, right where his heart resides.</p><p>A river of blood empties down his body and his skin goes white as he stumbles back, banging his elbow against one of the ruined shelves that hangs from the wall. He\u2019s killed his father! Really killed him!</p> <p>\u201cRun,\u201d Alex orders as he whirls to me. He shoves me towards the stairs that lead to the house. \u201cHe\u2019ll recover in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you stabbed him in the heart.\u201d I trip up the bottom step.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cMy father\u2019s immortal, Gemma. More than immortal. Even the sword won\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>Those words shake the earth below my feet and I swear to God the ground is about to open up and swallow me whole. Alex shoves a very stunned me into the house and I collapse to my knees and hit the side of the dryer. I skitter to my feet and stand up as Alex starts to shut the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I say and step towards him. \u201cThat\u2019s... no one ever mentioned anything about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because no one knows.\u201d He reaches forward and pushes me back with strength that bruises my skin. I fall back and bang my head on the wall. \u201cNow run. Just get somewhere and hide until I can figure this out. All that matters at the moment is that you're alive.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s a heartfelt moment where he reveals his true feelings or if he\u2019s referring to the star. I start to open my mouth to argue, but Stephan appears behind him and the door slams shut as he tackles Alex from behind. I run through the house and head for the kitchen to get a knife, but the front door blows open and is ripped from the hinges. A wave of ice rushes into the house and glazes the wood floor as a Death Walker marches inside.</p><p>I turn back for the garage door, but a Death Walker is coming in from that side. Not having anywhere else to go, I sprint for the living room and hop over the coffee table as herds of Death Walkers thunder through the sidewalls. They\u2019re stronger than I thought; using their bodies as a wrecking balls to get through the walls of the house. They\u2019re overtaking the place; their eyes lit up and their corpse fingers seeking my body.</p><p>Fuck. I need a plan. I back toward the sliding glass door, glide it open and, not giving myself time to rationalize, I run out into the forest, into two-feet of snow, with no weapon because it\u2019s the only choice I have left.</p><p>Night and the cold surround me as I swing my arms and battle the branches, fighting my way deeper into the trees. The snow is in my shoes and the cold pierces my lungs. A ways in, I make a curve and follow the moonlight, hoping I\u2019ll come out near the driveway and road. Every shadow moves and branches snap from all direction. I\u2019m exhausted and lethargic. I can no longer feel my toes.</p><p>I hear a cackle from behind me, but don\u2019t dare look to see what it is. I attempt to pick up my knees and take longer strides; move faster. Ice crackles up behind me and I start to run again. My arms and legs are barely moving as ice spirals down from the trees. I hear a snap and another cackle, and then something heavy hits me on the head. My skull cracks and I fall face first onto the ice. I try to push back up, but I\u2019m shoved right back down. I turn my head to the side and skim the outlines of the trees. Death Walkers are everywhere, watching me through the forest.</p> <p>I have nowhere else to go.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>They march me back to the house, some in front of me and some in back. They can\u2019t understand English, or at least they pretend they can\u2019t, because I try to reason with them as they close in on me. I even beg for my life and feel pathetic for it afterwards. They don\u2019t want to kill me, at least not yet, which means everything I\u2019ve been told was a lie. Nothing makes sense. No one seems trustworthy. It seems like there\u2019s no hope left for clarification.</p><p>It takes a lot of energy to march one foot in front of the other. I\u2019ve lost my bandage somewhere along the way and my cut has started bleeding again. My skin is pale blue and mapped with veins, and my clothes are soaked and frozen to my skin.</p><p>When we arrive at the back door of the cabin, one of the Death Walkers steps up and glides the door open even though the glass is gone. It tilts its face toward me and points its bony finger at the open doorway, motioning for me to go inside. It looks like the Reaper giving me a death omen, but I listen because backtracking means going against the rest of the herd.</p><p>The cabin is wrecked, the beams of the ceiling have collapsed, the doors are missing and there are massive holes in the walls. The furniture is shredded apart and tipped over, and the windows are in pieces on the floor. Alex and Stephan are waiting for me in the middle of the mess. Alex is sitting on the remaining piece of the couch that\u2019s intact with his hands resting in his lap and his head hung over. Stephan is near the fireplace and he has a hole in his shirt, blood on his jean, and the Sword of Immortality in his hand.</p><p>When Stephan\u2019s eyes find me, the greedy look in his eye promptly reappears. \u201cWell, the guest of honor has finally arrived.\u201d</p><p>Alex quickly raises his head up and he looks ill as he takes in my bleeding wrist and blue skin. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p> <p>The scene doesn\u2019t feel right, too formal and subdued for the circumstances. \u201cI\u2019m wondering the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>Stephan walks across the room, whistling with every step. He stops when he\u2019s only a few feet from me and tilts his head to assess me. He isn\u2019t much taller than I am, but he\u2019s a lot thicker in his arms and shoulders. His cheekbones are sharp and the scar is very distinctive. \u201cMy son is no longer going to tell you anything,\u201d he says and then calls over his shoulders. \u201cAre you, son?\u201d</p><p>Alex avoids eye contact with me as he nods once. \u201cYes, Father.\u201d He seems younger at the moment and breakable. \u201cIt was my fault and I messed up, but I didn\u2019t understand the situation.\u201d</p><p>What he says aches, but so does my wound. I press my palm down onto my bleeding wrist and search the wreckage of the living room for some kind of weapon, something I can protect myself with. \u201cWhat situation?\u201d I ask, trying to stall.</p><p>\u201cThe one where you stop asking so many questions,\u201d Stephan growls and kicks a piece of table across the room. \u201cI try and try to do everything right, but you two have made it almost impossible.\u201d</p><p>Alex rises from the couch. There\u2019s a bruise on his cheek and his nose is bleeding and crooked. \u201cI said I\u2019m sorry. I just got confused and forgot what the purpose was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re going to fix that now,\u201d Stephan says. \u201cBefore she gets any worse. I don\u2019t even want to know how far you pushed her toward humanity.\u201d</p><p>Alex glances at me and I know what he\u2019s thinking. I wonder if he can picture it as clearly as I can; how he thrust into me, pressed himself against me, kissed me and felt me because my images are quickly fading as numbness infects me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d I ask, tearing my gaze from Alex and fixing it on Stephan. \u201cDrain me dry, kill me, lock me away in a box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Alex says robotically with pity and it makes me want to throttle him. \u201cI already explained to you what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him. \u201cYou explained a lot of things to me, which make no sense now; especially, since it\u2019s been made clear what he did to my mother and that he\u2019s working with them.\u201d I aim an unsteady finger at the Death Walkers lurking near the walls. \u201cAnd besides, the last time I checked, you woke me up telling me you were going to save me.\u201d</p><p>Stephan swipes the sword around and flips the blade into the air. It comes down and he twists his arm to catch it effortlessly. \u201cI\u2019m impressed. I really didn\u2019t think anyone would figure out what I did to your mother.\u201d He gives a dramatic pause. \u201cHow on earth did you do it?\u201d</p><p>I expect Alex to tell him about my Foreseer ability, about the visions, about my newfound mark, but he stays silent.</p><p>\u201cYour mother needed to go,\u201d Stephan says, pacing the length of the room. \u201cAnd she went like a coward, begging me to take you instead of her. She didn\u2019t seem to understand that the world\u2019s fate depends on you and your inability to feel.\u201d</p><p>I stab my nails into my palms and let the skin split open. \u201cIf the world\u2019s fate depends on that, then why are you working with the Death Walkers?\u201d I ask. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t see them being in a on a plan that has anything to do with saving the world. They\u2019re nothing but evil and they tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cKill you? They were trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>I sink down on the couch. My skin, my jeans and my hand are soaked in blood and snow. \u201cYou can\u2019t be buying this?\u201d I ask Alex.</p><p>Alex shakes his head and I think I see remorse hidden deep inside his pupils. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>Stephan stretches his hand in the air and snaps his fingers. \u201cBring me the memoria extracto.\u201d</p><p>The wind kicks up and spins the air with snowflakes. A Death Walker treads through the back doorway, carrying a small black box with a red eye on the lid. It walks up to Stephan and brings a chill into the room as it hands the box to him before going back outside.</p><p>Stephan bends down and sets the sword on the ground. The light casts shadows in his eyes as he stares at the box. He cups the top with his hand and pries the lid off with a requiring tug, then dispenses it onto the floor. He reaches his fingers inside and draws out a round dark object that has a sandpaper texture.</p><p>I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cA rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a rock. It\u2019s the most magnificent thing I\u2019ve ever discovered.\u201d Stephan holds the rock between his fingers and squints at it. \u201cI found it in the Wasteland, completely intact.\u201d He tosses it in the air, turns over his hand and catches it. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better than detaching your soul because it wipes out your entire mind. You won\u2019t even be able to function anymore.\u201d</p><p>Vomit burns at the back of my throat as memories of my empty past flow through me in a line of pointless events. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Alex sucks in a breath and his hands start to shake as he joins his father in the center of the room. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I can\u2019t trust you,\u201d Stephan says. \u201cYou prove that time and time again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t know...\u201d he trails off. The idea of pleading with Alex seems pathetic, but I spot a small window when his gaze collides with mine. \u201cI get confused when I\u2019m around her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Summoning inner strength, I stagger to my feet and shuffle to him while gripping my wrist in my hand. \u201cAlex, don\u2019t let him do this to me. Please. This is so much worse than detaching my soul.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hold as much agony as I carry inside me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gemma. About everything. I should have never taken it that far.\u201d</p><p>When the angry heat sweeps through my body, I let it out the only way I can think off. By kicking him in the shin and slapping his face, arms, and chest repeatedly, but he just stands there and takes it.</p><p>But Stephan rushes forward, seizes my arm and throws me down on the ground and I land in a pile of wood that used to be the coffee table. The prickle spears at the back of my neck, liberating a feeling of irreversible hate. I never loved Alex\u2014I understand that now\u2014but I cared for him deeply. I trusted him against my innermost warnings; let him do things to me that no one ever had. It\u2019s my own fault for trusting him, though, and I make a vow right there that if I make it out of this, I\u2019ll never trust him again. I\u2019ll never trust anyone again.</p> <p>I pull my knees to my chest and shut my eyes as the Death Walkers close in on me and build a wall of ice around us, trapping us in brick of ice. Stephan squats down in front of me, he eyes me over and then darkness possesses his pupils as he holds the rock up above his head.</p><p>\u201cAlex, I\u2019m going to let you do the honors,\u201d he says with a grin.</p><p>Alex\u2019s jaw twitches as he refuses to look at me. \u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019d rather do,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ll do it or go with her.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s fist shakes as he unhurriedly makes his way over to his father and snatches the rock from his fingers. Stephan stands up while Alex lowers himself in front of me. He struggles to look at me and I make it harder on him, not blinking or moving as I stare into his eyes, forcing him to see me the entire time.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I try one last time.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer and his hand wobbles as he places the rock in front of my face, right between my eyes. Up close, there are swirls of black that entwine at the roundest side. Those lines begin to pirouette, spin and cycle like writing a song of death and soon I can hear the lyrics.</p><p>This is it. This is the end of my short-lived life. It seems like I\u2019ve done everything, yet, I\u2019ve done nothing. Every moment, every emotion has been acted out on a stage made of imaginary wood that only I could see. It has never existed, not really, and now it\u2019s gone.</p><p>My head fills with static. I see my life. I see my death. I finally see my future.</p><p>Laughing. The sun shining as we run through the field, chasing each other.</p><p>Happy. He smiles. I smile and everything makes sense.</p> <p>Smiling. We stand up in front of a thousand people, but the only one that matters is him. His green eyes are on me as he whispers that he loves me and I reply that I love him.</p><p>Love. I wish it were real.</p><p>The cabin begins to diminish into contorted objects as my skin glows beneath the locket. The electricity drifts from my body and one word comes to mind as I fall toward the floor.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The last thing I see is Alex\u2019s green eyes, then my legs and arms go inert and my heart dies with them. I gasp my last breath of air as my life leaves my body, leaving behind nothing more than a spirit. I see my mom\u2019s bright blue irises, her warm smile; I see the life I\u2019ll never have. The humming in my head grows louder until I can\u2019t think anymore; can\u2019t feel. My eyelids fall shut and only one feeling remains.</p><p>Hollow.</p><p>The black water crashes against the sandy shore and ash rains down from the clouds and floats across the land. Alex pulls me against him, so tightly we are almost one soul. I breathe in his scent of cologne, wanting to stay in his arms forever.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gemma,\u201d he whispers against my cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll always save you. No matter what, I\u2019ll always save you.\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He moves back and flattens our palms together forming a temple. \u201cEgo promitto ad protegendum tibi in perpetuum.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand the language, but I know that he means what he says from the bottom of his heart and I hold onto that.</p><p>\u201cNow close your eyes and trust me,\u201d he says softly but with strength.</p><p>As I submit and close my eyes, a bright orange flame erupts across the land and burns down on the trees. Then silence sets in with the smoke circling around us and suffocating us into the darkness. I want to run, but I cling onto him for dear life, knowing he\u2019ll save me somehow.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>My head is buzzing, like a Goddamn bug trapped in a light, over and over again. It just about drives me crazy. My skin is warm, my body relaxed and the air smells like lilacs and rain. The ground below my body is soft. I feel content.</p><p>Feel? But I\u2019m supposed to be dead, or at least locked in a coffin in my own head.</p><p>I shoot upright, but as the blood rushes from my head, I fall back onto the mattress. I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing. I\u2019m lying in a bed in a room with pale purple walls and a small window that lets in the sunlight. The view outside is filled with colorful lights and flamboyant buildings that reach toward the skyline.</p><p>\u201cI know this place...\u201d I mutter. \u201cVegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the safest place I could think of.\u201d His voice not only sends a chill down my spine, but it also makes my body tingle with heat and my heart wake up from its very deep sleep.</p><p>Alex walks through the doorway, taking tentative steps as he inches himself toward the bed\u2014toward me\u2014and every image of the last time we were in bed together flashes through my head. The way I felt, the way he made me finally breathe and then minutes later, he stole it all away from me by betraying me, ripping out my heart and shredding it to pieces; he probably still has my blood on his hands.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a black t-shirt and a pair of jeans and his hair is damp and sticking up all over. He looks like a normal guy, completely harmless, but it\u2019s just an illusion.</p><p>I throw the blanket off me and swing my legs over the side of the bed, noting I\u2019m no longer wearing my clothes, but a pair of boxer shorts and a t-shirt that doesn\u2019t belong to me. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d His voice is soft as he continues to step toward me; his bright green eyes are fixed on mine. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh sharply as I put weight on my weak knees. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever heard come out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Alex stops dead in his tracks, his expression filling with infuriation. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>My knees shake as I stand up and find my stability. \u201cIt means your promises are worthless. At least, the ones you make to me.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cMy promises got you to Adessa\u2019s, safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe and sound doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does for the moment, Gemma, and you\u2019ll understand why, if you just let me explain.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and take a step forward, wanting to get out of the room and away from him. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m walking around alive and normal, but I\u2019m not going to waste my time listening to your bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re walking around normal because of me\u2014because of how I feel about you.\u201d He moves to the side, obstructing my path. \u201cJust let me explain.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and dodge to the right, but I\u2019m like a newborn deer and my knees give out on me. His arms encircle my waist and he catches me before I crash against the hardwood floor. He picks me up, carries me over to the bed, and sets me back down. I start to get back up, but he puts his hands down on the bed, one on each side of me, and lowers his face toward mine.</p><p>\u201cI just need five minutes to explain,\u201d he almost begs. \u201cFive minutes for me to tell you what happened and then, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>I search his eyes for the person that lay with me in the bed. \u201cFive minutes,\u201d I say. \u201cBut that\u2019s all you have and if one single thing sounds like bullshit, then you leave, not just the house, but my life.\u201d</p><p>He nods without hesitation. As his lips part, I\u2019m not sure if he will help me understand, or crash my world again. </p> </body></html>"]
