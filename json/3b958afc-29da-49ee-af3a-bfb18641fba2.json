Not only that, her fingers hurt from continually cracking her knuckles. Frogs jumped in her stomach and were stuck in her throat. She\u2019d clenched her jaw hard enough to make her earlobes sting. Given her erratic physical reactions, one would believe she was facing the hangman\u2019s noose. An executioner\u2019s blade. Or a blind date.</p><p>She was meeting a man. A man she didn\u2019t know. A man she\u2019d never spoken to. A man who held her entire future in his hands.</p><p>And that absolutely chapped her ass, sucked balls and blew donkey dick.</p><p>No man ever had that much power over Keely McKay. She\u2019d made sure of it. Even with five older brothers, and a dozen older male cousins, she\u2019d always been the queen bee. Using her stubbornness to get her way, not her feminine wiles.</p> <p>Not that she was opposed to flashing her cleavage to get a leg up in this situation.</p><p>No need. You are a professional, qualified woman. Not a Nervous Nellie. Not a Wild Child. Buck up.</p><p>Chin up. This is your time to shine.</p><p>There were a hundred reasons why good fortune should finally smile on her. She\u2019d done everything right on the business front: secured the funding and found the building to further the cause she believed in.</p><p>On the personal side: she was a loving daughter, a dedicated sister, a loyal friend, an involved aunt. A proud member of the Wyoming community she\u2019d grown up in and hoped to grow old in. She took pride in her ability to connect with people from all walks of life. She derived great joy from helping people. Heck, she\u2019d chosen her career because she was good at those things.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking for kudos or glory, just a place where she could do what she loved, help people heal close to home\u2014close to their families.</p> <p>Now that her dream of giving back to the community\u2014filling a need for rural healthcare\u2014was within her grasp, would this mysterious man help smooth a path to success? Or would he trip her up?</p><p>Maybe all this worry was for nothing. Maybe she\u2019d get lucky. God knew if the decision were based on hard work, dedication, knowledge and drive, she\u2019d be golden.</p><p>Restless, she wandered through the main floor of the century-old building, originally Moorcroft\u2019s first general store. During the course of its existence, it\u2019d housed the post office and an attorney\u2019s office. For the last thirty years it\u2019d sat empty.</p><p>She\u2019d always wondered why no one had renovated the stalwart stone building\u2014an answer she was now learning firsthand. New construction of steel frame structures was easier, cheaper, faster and more efficient. Hence, many historic buildings were lost to the blade of a bulldozer or tumbled by a wrecking ball. A sad situation for a western state with precious few architectural treasures in the first place.</p><p>So the State of Wyoming had wisened up and toughened regulations, forming the Wyoming Historical Western Preservation Committee to deal with the lax construction policies and administration of fines. The committee also gauged a structure\u2019s historical merit, determining those to be listed on the official register, as well as overseeing any structural and architectural changes of registered buildings, both on the state level and with recommendation to the National Historic Register.</p><p>Talk about a taste of bureaucracy.</p><p>After dealing with committees and subcommittees, and tracking down funding sources, Keely discovered the entire house of cards depended upon whether she could convince the certified architectural restoration specialist to oversee the project. The company representative insisted on making a personal appearance to gauge the validity of the proposed project before rendering a decision.</p><p>As if the situation wasn\u2019t convoluted enough, she\u2019d inadvertently discovered the restoration company she\u2019d contacted and the company that owned the Sandstone Building she lived in...were one in the same.</p> <p>Western Property Management Services and Full Circle Consulting shared the same PO box in Denver.</p><p>If she believed in fate, she\u2019d take that as a good sign.</p><p>The door creaked and a shaft of sunlight seared her retinas. Keely blocked the bright ray with her hand, willing her heart to stop racing as fast as a spooked antelope. This was it. Her future. Her destiny.</p><p>Please. Just this one time. Let things go my way.</p><p>She plastered on a charming smile.</p><p>As the form sauntered closer, Keely blinked several times. No way. Had to be a trick of the light. Or a trick of the swirling dust motes. Her eyes\u2014shit, maybe she needed glasses. The male figure with a laconic walk looked like...nah. It couldn\u2019t be him.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>All six foot four inches, two hundred odd pounds of muscle and grace pulled into sharp focus.</p><p>Keely gasped like a Victorian maiden.</p><p>Or maybe she had stumbled onto the set of a low budget horror movie.</p><p>The man was a stunning example of masculine flawlessness.</p><p>And the dead last man in the world Keely ever wanted to deal with.</p><p>Her brother\u2019s best friend.</p><p>The older brother of the guy who\u2019d dumped her.</p><p>The jerk who\u2019d left her high and dry at her brother\u2019s wedding reception three years ago.</p><p>Jack Donohue.</p><p>That bitch fate had a nasty sense of humor.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Jack Donohue believed he\u2019d adequately prepared himself for meeting Keely McKay. Boning up on his sarcasm. Practicing his disdain. Confident those reactions would prevent his instantaneous red-hot jolt of desire.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work. The damn woman had gotten under his skin like a burr. Or tick. Or a fever. Or blood poisoning.</p><p>His gaze zoomed over her pointy-toed boots, skintight denim, gaudy rhinestone belt, plaid, pearl-buttoned shirt and stopped on her arms defiantly folded across her chest.</p><p>Definitely not his type.</p><p>A square, yet decidedly feminine jaw shadowed her willowy neck. Her upper lip was a perfect cupid\u2019s bow. Her lower lip was plump in the center and drooped outward slightly, which contrasted with the upturned corners of her wide mouth, creating a permanent smirk. Jack remembered how sweet and hot her smirking mouth felt moving beneath his.</p><p>Her pert, freckled nose wrinkled. Those sapphire blue eyes blazed and his groin tightened in response.</p><p>Jesus. What kind of sick fuck got off on a woman glaring at him?</p><p>You. When the woman in question has starred in your X-rated fantasies for the last eleven years.</p><p>No doubt his intense scrutiny would raise her ire. Chances were slim the hotheaded cowgirl had mastered the art of curbing her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. You are Full Circle Consulting? And Western Property Management?\u201d</p><p>He tried\u2014and failed\u2014not to look smug. \u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only are you my expert consultant, you\u2019re my landlord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised? Try shocked. Dismayed. Completely and utterly crushed. Talk about unreal. Could my life get any worse at this moment?\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cNo. Please. Don\u2019t answer that. I cannot believe I pinned all my hopes on this...\u201d Her voice broke and she turned away.</p><p>He waited, but Keely didn\u2019t toss out a barbed parting shot. She didn\u2019t do anything at all.</p><p>Damn. Why was he disappointed? He hadn\u2019t prepared for her immediate admission of defeat. He\u2019d anticipated verbal sparring. Sad that he\u2019d actually looked forward to going head to head with Keely. Her insults were lightning fast and usually funny as hell\u2014even if he refused to admit that to her. \u201cLook, surprise factor aside, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>Keely offered him a bad-tempered shrug.</p><p>\u201cDid Carter send you to me for help with this project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Carter doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve bought this building.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s my deal, okay? I didn\u2019t want interference from my brothers. Ditto for my parents, my aunts, my uncles and two billion cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the McKay family handbook clearly state you all have to tell each other everything?\u201d</p><p>His attempt at humor fell short when Keely flicked him a dour look. \u201cGo ahead and call Carter. Laugh with him about his clueless little sister. I should be used to it by now.\u201d</p><p>Her retreat into silence disturbed him. He waited for her to speak or to lash out or something.</p><p>But minutes ticked by and nothing passed through her compressed lips but angry puffs of air.</p><p>Finally, Jack said, \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on here? No bullshit charm, Keely. No insults. No half-truths.\u201d</p><p>Keely sagged against the wall. \u201cBuying this crappy old building was the first step of turning my dream into reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d</p><p>She studied him to gauge his sincerity. Apparently she found something that allowed her to offer an explanation. \u201cMy dream has been to open a physical therapy clinic with enough space to eventually expand into a full-service healthcare center.\u201d</p><p>Jack was taken aback. And a little impressed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cRural healthcare sucks, especially out here where it can be a hundred miles between towns of any size. For the last four years, I\u2019ve worked my ass off saving money to open my own rehab clinic. Dr. Monroe has referred her repetitive injury patients to me and she promised if I got the place up and running, she\u2019d open a satellite office here. So, I\u2019ve been moonlighting at the VA in Cheyenne for the cash and the practical experience. At some point, I realized this building was ideal. Not too big. Not too small. Centrally located. Perfect, right? Still, I knew my brothers would try to talk me out of buying it because it needs so much work, but there\u2019s just something about this forgotten place that speaks to me.</p><p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell them. They wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He recognized Keely\u2019s frustration at having a vision no one else saw or understood.</p><p>\u201cI wanted something that was just mine. I wanted to do it my way, with my money, and my ideas. But this clinic would benefit everyone, not just me, so it\u2019s not about my ego but about me wanting to help people.\u201d Her eyes searched his, almost frantically. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever wanted to prove yourself? To be different or do something different from what people expect of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I was feeling cocky that I\u2019d pulled it off. Everything was going miraculously well. The real estate broker kept quiet. As did the banker. I thought I\u2019d jumped through all the proper hoops. Imagine my surprise when I learned I can\u2019t change a freakin\u2019 thing on the building that I now own without the step-by-step approval of some damn committee.\u201d</p><p>Welcome to his world.</p><p>\u201cOh, and on top of that, I have to hire a qualified expert, already certified by the committee, to oversee the remodeling process. So the specialist can reassure the committee that my contractors aren\u2019t destroying the \u2018unique and key\u2019 elements that make it a historic building.\u201d</p><p>Jack dealt with the pros and cons of rebuilding versus restoration every damn day and it never got easier. Or clearer.</p><p>\u201cThis place was\u2014 is\u2014in absolute disrepair. Know what\u2019s asinine? The committee would let the building fall to ruin rather than allow me to make desperately needed improvements that don\u2019t meet with some\u2014\u201d she gestured wildly, \u201c\u2014obscure set of rules. Which was why I contacted Full Circle Consulting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cI had not a friggin\u2019 clue you owned the company or trust me, Jack, I never would\u2019ve called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deeply hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me ideas,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cDid you try another company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey turned me down. The project is too small and they\u2019re too busy. The other companies I found aren\u2019t certified in Wyoming. It could take up to a year for the official certification process, provided they actually give a damn about becoming certified in Wyoming\u2014which most don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook. To be honest, it\u2019s not about the money. I don\u2019t have the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a small-potatoes project like this? You could\u2019ve saved yourself some of that precious time and called me rather than driving up here from Colorado. Or was the prospect of seeing my disappointment too big a temptation to resist? Did you rub your hands with glee at the thought of crushing my dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely, just listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try and placate me, Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. What was the name of the other company you contacted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBDM Incorporated. They\u2019re based out of Chicago. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t really matter now, does it?</p><p>I\u2019m screwed.\u201d She spun on the bootheel and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Jack clenched his fist by his side. BDM. His former partner Baxter\u2019s company. Baxter\u2019s luxury of blithely turning down work, when Jack raced all over the damn country taking every job in every podunk town from Barrow, Alaska to Bangor, Maine, burned his ass.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to take every job. You don\u2019t need the money.</p><p>True, but it was a matter of pride to prove to the restoration community that his expertise was just as much in demand as Baxter\u2019s after their professional split. Jack suspected the reason Baxter\u2019s company had refused to consider Keely\u2019s restoration was because BDM was in the queue for a prestigious project in Utah.</p><p>A select group of architectural specialists had been invited to bid on a complete restoration of two city blocks in the small burg of Milford, Utah. The Milford Historical Preservation Consortium was a privately funded organization, insistent upon hiring a company whose morals and ideals meshed with theirs.</p><p>Although Jack\u2019s professional qualifications were top-flight, his personal qualifications had disappointed the committee. No long-term relationship, no wife, no kids, no religious affiliation.</p><p>Baxter retained the advantage on the Milford project because he was married. During their partnership, Baxter\u2019s main focus had been drumming up business. Jack stayed in the trenches with the contractors and traveled extensively while Baxter remained in the Chicago office. Baxter\u2019s availability was why Jack\u2019s former girlfriend Martine was now Baxter\u2019s wife.</p><p>Martine. Beautiful. Educated. Sophisticated. Every quality Jack had required in a woman. The double whammy of Martine and Baxter\u2019s betrayal had nearly crippled him. Baxter was twenty years Martine\u2019s senior, a balding man with a big gut and a bigger mouth, but Baxter\u2019s bank account was his biggest asset.</p><p>Rather than allow the situation to explode into an ugly scandal, Jack bowed out of the partnership, licked his wounds, relocated to Colorado and hung out his shingle. Now his former partner was his main competition.</p><p>Too bad Jack couldn\u2019t conjure up a wife. Then Baxter would be out on his fat ass as far as the Milford job. Jack wanted that project and he\u2019d do anything to get it.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>So what are you doing in Wyoming, pissing with Keely McKay? She can\u2019t help you.</p><p>But you could help her. This is a noble project. And you\u2019re a quart low on nobility since you\u2019ve been chasing the gravy train the last few years.</p><p>Nudged by his conscience, Jack followed the foot-traffic pattern on the dusty floor, mentally tallying the building wreckage as he bypassed it.</p><p>Keely stood in front of a busted window, staring at the faded blacktop. She whirled around, her body stiffening at his approach.</p><p>Jack\u2019s body stiffened too\u2014for an entirely different reason. The sweet perfume of spring lilacs wafted toward him. Pure lust grabbed him by the short hairs. That intoxicating aroma had haunted him since the night he\u2019d filled his lungs with her scent. Breathing nothing but her. Tasting nothing but her. Swallowing her hunger and letting it feed his... He shook his head to clear the memory. It hadn\u2019t ended well. Every encounter with Keely McKay ended badly.</p><p>Whose fault is that?</p><p>His. Hers. Who the hell knew why they threw atomic sparks off each other?</p><p>\u201cSo, did you follow me just to glare at me? Or have you already formulated a nasty comment to fling at me before you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m formulating an eviction notice.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s lush lips parted, then flattened.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Miz McKay, why was I unaware you were renting the Sandstone apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Mr. Donohue, why was I unaware you were my landlord for the Sandstone apartment?\u201d she lobbed back.</p><p>Jack ignored her taunt. \u201cI hate that you pulled one over on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so. But that sort of makes us even for you pulling one over on me today, doncha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, it\u2019s hardly my fault you are unaware of your individual renters. I sent references, which your company approved. I paid the security deposit, which your company still has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact had I known, I never would\u2019ve rented to you.\u201d</p><p>Keely shifted to an aggressive posture. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto, but your personal dislike is a moot point because I\u2019ve never been late paying rent. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m throwing wild parties or staging orgies.\u201d</p><p>When he quirked a questioning brow at the \u201corgies\u201d comment, she cocked her head pertly. Like a trained dog. Right. Keely McKay was more pit bull than pampered poodle and he ought to brace himself for her biting sarcasm. \u201cBeing rude to me is not helping your situation,\u201d Jack pointed out.</p><p>\u201cJust how could my situation get any worse? The apartment I\u2019ve lived in for two years\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years? My property management company doesn\u2019t offer two year contracts.\u201d</p><p>Her defiant chin lifted a notch. \u201cI finished the term of Domini\u2019s lease after she married Cam. I applied the following year under my own name when the lease came up for renewal. Like I said, your company could\u2019ve denied me then.\u201d</p><p>During that crazy time, not only had Jack dissolved his partnership with Baxter Ducheyne, his father had also died unexpectedly. Jack\u2019s attention to his rental properties had been nearly nonexistent. Owning properties in three states meant he couldn\u2019t remember every tenant, but Keely\u2019s name would\u2019ve jumped out at him like a rabid skunk.</p><p>\u201cAs the building owner, I can terminate any lease agreement at any time, for any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your way of telling me to pack my shit?\u201d</p><p>As much as he wanted to bark out a gleeful yes! he hesitated. Carter McKay would be livid if Jack unceremoniously booted his beloved baby sister from the apartment, particularly when Carter discovered</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t disclosed that he owned the Sandstone Building. The same building which housed the restaurant Carter\u2019s wife managed as well as three other businesses owned by various McKay spouses.</p><p>Talk about a clusterfuck.</p><p>\u201cHello? Earth to Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack refocused. Keely glared at him. Jesus. She was gorgeous when she was pissed off. Maybe especially when she was pissed off.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna answer me? Or do you have a limp tongue as well as a limp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful what you say next, cowgirl,\u201d Jack warned. \u201cYou\u2019d be wise not to tick off your landlord.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re kicking me out anyway, so what do I have to lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m kicking you out.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s razor-sharp gaze pierced him. \u201cNow are you going to tease me and claim you\u2019re not passing on the project?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, knowing his non-response would drive her crazy.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>So did he.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. Why are you dicking with my head, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can. Because I get off on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you where to get off, bucko.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBig talk.

Will your boyfriend be jealous we\u2019re tossing bitchy banter back and forth?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s your best shot? Accusing me of being gay?\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted again. \u201cAccusing? Dude. My gaydar goes haywire around you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re an expert in all things gay because you live in Buttfuck, Wyoming?\u201d he said with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Jack-off... You actually have a sense of humor! You should share that playful side more often.</p><p>Guys really go for it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cName one thing about me that sets off your finely honed gaydar sensors.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the floor. \u201cYour shoes. Straight men don\u2019t wear tasseled loafers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Straight men in Wyoming don\u2019t wear tasseled loafers. But since you\u2019re from South Dakota, maybe you missed the memo.\u201d Keely studied him helpfully. \u201cI\u2019ll even impart a bonus reason why my gaydar goes off.\u201d</p><p>Fascinated by her twisted logic, Jack murmured, \u201cThis ought to be stellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what happened at Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception? Or should I say what didn\u2019t happen? That proves you\u2019re not attracted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only proved I\u2019m not attracted to you, cowgirl.\u201d He was such a liar. And a sucker. The immediate hurt look in Keely\u2019s eyes almost weakened him into apologizing for being a jerk now and being an idiot back then.</p><p>But Keely rallied. \u201cIf you are so hetero, why haven\u2019t I ever seen you with a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t exactly run in the same social circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin let it slip you\u2019ve never brought a woman home. So I\u2019m just saying...\u201d</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t brought his girlfriends home due to his never-ending embarrassment about being raised on a farm. \u201cUnlike my little brother, I don\u2019t drag every skank home to meet Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Keely\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cAre you calling me a skank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you denying you had a threesome with my brother and his best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if that makes me a skank then you\u2019re one too! I overheard Carter bragging to Colt about you guys having threesomes all the damn time in college!\u201d</p><p>The woman had balls. Keely didn\u2019t apologize, justify or explain her past sexual behavior. Strange to think he would\u2019ve thought less of her if she had.</p><p>Several brutal moments passed.</p><p>Finally, something clicked with her and she backed up. Way up. A look of mortification entered her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. God. I don\u2019t know what it is about you that pushes all my wrong buttons, Jack. Insulting you... Lord. I\u2019m usually way more professional than that and I apologize. Profusely.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity of her regret surprised him.</p><p>She sighed and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault everything is so screwed up. It\u2019s also not your problem that I naively pinned all my hopes on Full Circle Consulting to get me back on track.</p><p>I know better. I-I just wish there was something...\u201d Her voice dropped and she bit her lip.</p><p>Oh fuck no. Was tough as nails Keely McKay about to burst into tears?</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for it.</p><p>But he found himself drawn to her anyway. \u201cHey. Cowgirl. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She expelled a watery laugh. \u201cAlthough, you should know I was prepared to throw myself at your feet and promise I\u2019ll do anything if you\u2019ll help me.\u201d</p><p>Anything? Now we\u2019re talking.</p><p>A preposterous idea began to form. One so...crazy she might actually go for it. Maybe they could help each other out.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Keely\u2019s steely, yet teary-eyed gaze met his. \u201cYes. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned forward. \u201cThen marry me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cM-marry you?\u201d Keely sputtered. \u201cIs this some kind of sick joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m dead-ass serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would I marry you? I don\u2019t even like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack atcha, babe, but this could solve both of our problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my problem,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen until the guys with the straightjackets arrive, because you are certifiable.\u201d</p><p>Jack loomed over her, his vibrant green eyes blazing. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say you\u2019d do anything to get me to oversee your project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen shut up and listen.\u201d</p><p>Damn man. Bossing her around.</p><p>You like it. You like that he doesn\u2019t fall in line.</p><p>\u201cLast week I was shut out of consideration for a huge restoration project because of my marital status...or lack thereof.\u201d</p><p>Keely blinked at him. \u201cWhy would it matter whether or not you were married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just does,\u201d he said testily.</p><p>\u201cIs the remodel job in a nunnery or something?\u201d Heaven knew Jack Donohue would tempt a nun into tasting the sins of the flesh. Repeatedly. With absolute gusto and zero repentance.</p><p>\u201cNo. But you\u2019re thinking along the right lines. The committee choosing the overseeing company for this project is very conservative, very traditional and they have the money to be choosy.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cMight seem weird, but religious organizations often select their contractors based on their religious preference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSay the Catholic church is adding on. They have the right to consider only Catholic contractors. This group set up parameters that might seem unusual, but I\u2019ve dealt with far worse constraints, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it an issue of the consultant having to live in this conservative town for the duration of the project?</p><p>Is the committee afraid a hot single guy will pose a threat to the unattached ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot single guy?\u201d he repeated, tacking on a bad-boy grin. \u201cCareful, Keely, you might give me the wrong idea that you\u2019re somewhat attracted to me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of saying, You are all that hotness and a bag of chips, baby, Keely rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAfter I visited the site and met with the committee last week, I knew they were interested in my ideas. But when it came to my personal life...their enthusiasm waned.\u201d</p><p>Her brain warned, Don\u2019t ask him if the committee thinks he\u2019s gay, but it was no use; her mouth ignored the directive. \u201cAre they afraid you have a male lover hiding in the closet at home?\u201d</p><p>With that snarky comment, she\u2019d pushed Jack too far.</p><p>He crowded her against the wall. \u201cYou looking for a firsthand demonstration of my heterosexual prowess, cowgirl? Because I\u2019m more than up for the challenge.\u201d</p><p>Please. Your body is hot and hard and you smell so damn good and it\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve had a real man this sexy this close to me. \u201cUmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Jack leapt back and rubbed the squished section of skin between his dark eyebrows. \u201cYou can rile me up in no time flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why this marriage idea would never work. We\u2019ve come to verbal blows more than a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus we don\u2019t even live in the same state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think.\u201d He paced, muttering to himself. He stopped in front of her with a triumphant gleam.</p><p>\u201cA wedding is out. How about if we announce we\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngaged in what? Battle? Not a newsflash, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cSmartass. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. How is an engagement any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d explain why we\u2019re living apart.\u201d</p><p>Keely stared at him. \u201cYou are insane. How do you propose we explain the fact we can\u2019t stand each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have to change that. In public we\u2019ll have to moon around in love or some such sappy shit.</p><p>Pretend we rock each other\u2019s world.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her immediate response\u2014 never fucking happening\u2014 and said, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Those piercing green eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy? Are you in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three years since I found my girlfriend fucking my business partner and I ended up getting fucked.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Some woman was stupid enough to cheat on Jack Donohue? Keely wanted the down and dirty details, but Jack stalked off. He jammed his hand through his hair as he stared out the dirt-caked window.</p><p>\u201cJack? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy personal and professional life went up in flames. None of that garbage matters now. But this job in Milford? It\u2019s more than a job. It\u2019s like I have a chance to get back what I lost.\u201d</p><p>His embarrassment sparked a feeling scarily close to real sympathy. And empathy. Salvaging pride was something she understood. \u201cLook, before I scream no fucking way and run, spell out exactly what I gain from this devil\u2019s bargain, if I decide to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll personally oversee your restoration project. After I examine the renovation plans from your contractor, I\u2019ll call the head of the Wyoming Historic Preservation Committee and officially sign on as your consultant. They\u2019ll expect me to monitor compliance frequently since this will be a rush job.\u201d</p><p>Her head buzzed with a mix of excitement and fear. Maybe her life wasn\u2019t in the toilet. But she played it cool. \u201cWhat would you expect from me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a minimum of one month commitment from you. During this engagement you\u2019ll travel to Milford with me and convince the committee we\u2019re madly in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me the committee is aware you\u2019ve been single for a while?\u201d</p><p>Jack paced again. \u201cI didn\u2019t share specifics on my personal life. I more or less sidestepped the question. But there has to be a way we can convince them we\u2019ve secretly been together for the last few months...\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cAha! I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason we didn\u2019t go public with our relationship\u2014even with families\u2014was because of our rocky past. I saw you as my best friend\u2019s pesky little sister; you were dumped by my little brother. But we crossed paths again when you needed my help with this restoration project. It turned into something more than a working relationship. Each hour we spent together built on our past as a bridge to our future until bam\u2014change of heart.\u201d</p><p>Keely began to clap.</p><p>Jack gave her that devil-may-care grin and bestowed a deep bow.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt the story is plausible for the Milford crowd, but you\u2019re forgetting one teensy tiny detail. We can\u2019t be selective about who we tell. We have to tell everyone. Which means we have to convince my entire family that we\u2019re a couple.\u201d</p> <p>A look of horror crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean? No one who knows us will ever believe we put our differences aside. Not for an hour, not for a day and certainly not forever. Neither one of us can act that well. So thanks for stopping by personally and ruining my life.\u201d Keely ducked under his arm and started walking away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Don\u2019t let the door hit your ass on the way out. Literally. It might fall and crush you.\u201d</p><p>His deep, sexy laugh unfurled an unwanted reaction low in her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t all talk. I never imagined wild child Keely McKay was afraid.\u201d</p><p>Keely wheeled around. \u201cExcuse me? What am I afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake! That\u2019s ridiculous. Why would I be afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re afraid I can make you fall in love with me for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me fall in love with you? Dude. The only thing you make me want to do is punch you in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Sarcasm is a defense mechanism to mask your fear.\u201d With each word he\u2019d closed the distance between them. \u201cSo it\u2019s easier to slink away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. I knew you had a big ego, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Jack clamped his hands on her butt. Keely shrieked but he held tight, jerking her lower body to his.</p><p>\u201cAn ego isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s big about me, baby. Want to ride on the Jack-hammer? Guaranteed to rev you up all night long.\u201d</p><p>Eww. Eww. Eww. \u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in admitting you want me.\u201d He nuzzled the skin in front of her ear and a shiver trilled down her neck.</p><p>\u201cIs this greasy used car salesman act supposed to be turning me on? Because it ain\u2019t working, bucko.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cNot trying to turn you on, just proving I can act. You really believed I\u2019d morphed into a creepy scuzzball, huh?\u201d</p><p>Yes, dammit. Jack won that round.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this, Keely. If you say yes, we\u2019ll both get what we want: you\u2019ll get the building remodel approval, I\u2019ll have a chance at the Milford project and we\u2019ll both have our pride. After it\u2019s over we can go back to hating each other, same as always.\u201d</p><p>Keely admitted there was a certain appeal in his off-the-wall proposal. She\u2019d kept her family in the dark about the purchase of the building and her career plans. If she confessed the reason for her secretiveness was also due in part to her intimate relationship with her former nemesis, Jack Donohue...that would make perfect sense.</p><p>Jack whispered huskily, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re warming to the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pressing yourself into me instead of away from me.\u201d</p><p>She was? Holy crap! What was wrong with her? Keely put her hands on his firm chest and tried to shove him. The damn solid man didn\u2019t budge. He squeezed her closer. \u201cNow, is that any way to treat your intended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to scour myself with bleach when this is all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But for now...do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>Say no. Scream no. It\u2019s not worth it.</p><p>\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack held up his hand and dug out his cell phone. He dialed. Waited with a smug grin. \u201cHenry? Jack Donohue. I just wanted to thank you for your hospitality last week. Milford is a great town and I appreciate the chance to talk with you and the committee about my ideas. Anyway, the reason I called... Did you perchance find a gold watch in your office? Oh. No, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just wondering how to explain the loss of it to my fianc\u00e9e, since it was a gift from her.\u201d</p><p>No going back now.</p><p>He locked his gaze to hers. \u201cReally? I thought I\u2019d told you about Keely. No? Well, we\u2019ve kept it under wraps, but the cat is out of the bag now.\u201d Jack\u2019s teeth gleamed a victorious smile. \u201cOf course I\u2019d love to bring her to Milford. Sure. Call me after you talk to the committee and have a firm date.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, punching the air with a loud \u201cYes!\u201d the most juvenile gesture she\u2019d witnessed from stick-up-his-ass Jack Donohue. \u201cIt\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered. What now?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at his watch. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to drive back to Denver, I\u2019ve got no choice. But I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with my stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff? What stuff? Work stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd personal stuff. I\u2019ll be working out of the apartment for a while. There\u2019s wireless Internet, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa whoa whoa. Working out of the apartment? As in my apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember who owns the building? Now it\u2019s our apartment,\u201d he corrected with an edge to his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot only will I be working here, I\u2019ll be living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Oh, hell no. You can\u2019t just move in with me.\u201d</p><p>Cue his wolfish grin. \u201cOh, cowgirl, I most certainly can.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. He could. She was so monumentally screwed.</p><p>\u201cHave the building plans ready for me to look at day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t boss me around, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it, Keely.\u201d</p><p>Did he honestly expect her to play the part of docile little wifey-to-be when they weren\u2019t in the public eye?</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>Before Keely voiced a protest, Jack tucked her hair behind her ear, letting his sure, yet teasing touch linger on the curve of her cheek. God. He had the most amazing hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you set up dinner with your parents? So we can tell them our good news. Hopefully that\u2019ll pave the way to convincing your family we\u2019re head over heels in love.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. Right. If Cam leveled his nasty cop stare at her, she\u2019d spill her guts. Carter would cajole and tease her into admitting it was a sham. Colt could pin her down and tickle the truth out of her. Colby would tie her to the corral until she confessed the hard facts. Cord would just send his wife AJ to nag her. Her best friend would never believe Keely was knocking loafers with Jack, let alone letting those loafers reside under her bed permanently.</p><p>This so wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>Jack retreated and pointed at her. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about, Keely. You\u2019d better get used to gazing at me with adoration, not disgust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then you\u2019d better bring me a big goddamn engagement ring as an incentive to pretend I love you.\u201d</p><p>Late the following afternoon, Jack yelled, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>Keely gaped at him as he scaled the stairs. \u201cJesus, Jack, why don\u2019t you scream that a little louder so AJ, India and Domini all come barreling up here?\u201d</p><p>An oversized duffel and an enormous suit bag hit the landing at the top of the stairs. \u201cBut their feminine squealing about your good luck landing me as your mate might be a tad embarrassing for you, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are about four seconds from me knocking you off this landing, bucko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big, wet, sloppy kiss for your traveling man? Fine.\u201d Jack adjusted the backpack straps and bent down to retrieve his other bags.</p><p>She elbowed him in the gut as soon as his hands were full. \u201cThere\u2019s your kiss\u2014Irish style, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Keely. That was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But it was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>She had a feeling it was going to be a long night.</p><p>They decided to stick to basics about the engagement. Keely had contacted Jack for his expertise on her concerns about buying the building. They met in Denver and Cheyenne, talked, one thing led to another...blah blah blah. Instant love.</p><p>Too bad she\u2019d had to suck down two slugs of whiskey before her \u201clove\u201d drove them out to her folks\u2019 house.</p><p>Jack parked by the barn and faced her. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re forgetting something.\u201d She pinned him with a dubious look. \u201cCrap. I don\u2019t have an engagement ring. They won\u2019t believe you can\u2019t live without me if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a damn ring, Keely.\u201d He opened the glove compartment and pulled out a blue velvet jewelry box. \u201cWe should\u2019ve done this earlier, so I hope it fits. May I have your hand?\u201d</p><p>Keely closed her eyes as the cool metal slid up to her knuckle. This was not how she imagined the magic moment when the man of her dreams slipped a ring on her finger.</p><p>\u201cYou afraid to look?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cCome on, cowgirl, give me some credit. I didn\u2019t dig it out of a Cracker Jack box.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hand felt heavy. No wonder. When she peeked at the square cut diamond set in a platinum band, she realized the stone was the size of her fingernail. Keely met Jack\u2019s gaze. \u201cIs this for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The stone? Yes, it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you took me seriously about the gigantic ring, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI figured ten plus carats would get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the attention of anyone within a mile.\u201d Keely waggled her fingers, admiring the diamond\u2019s flash of brilliance. \u201cThis is spectacular. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be a first,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThank you, Jack, would be a start.\u201d</p><p>Keely angled across the console and placed her hand on his smoothly shaven cheek. \u201cThank you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were soft, a luminous green, nearly hypnotic. The moment was so intimate she almost believed it was real.</p> <p>Her dad knocked on the window and barked, \u201cYou comin\u2019 in or what?\u201d and brought a screaming halt to her momentary lapse in judgment.</p><p>Jack kissed the inside of her forearm and mouthed, \u201cShow time.\u201d</p><p>Nerves danced in her belly. Over the years she\u2019d stretched or circumvented the truth with her parents, but never uttered such a bald-faced lie as, \u201cJack and I are getting married!\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s parents took the news like she\u2019d expected: complete and utter disbelief.</p><p>Of course, her mother tried to be polite. Show some kind of enthusiasm and not accuse her only daughter of absolute insanity.</p><p>Her father wasn\u2019t so tactful. He demanded to know if she was pregnant.</p> <p>Keely deflected additional questions about their impending nuptials by discussing her purchase of the Brewster Building. In minute detail. She\u2019d droned on so long she\u2019d even managed to bore herself in the highly embellished retelling.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you keep something this big under wraps, girlie?\u201d her father challenged.</p><p>\u201cThe usual. Threats. Bribes.\u201d She fluttered her lashes at Jack. \u201cCharm. When it all came together so suddenly, it seemed like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestiny,\u201d Jack finished silkily.</p><p>Oh gag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too goddamn quick, if you ask me,\u201d her dad groused.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Me buying the building? Or me getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. How do you know what you\u2019re getting into?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I contacted Jack. He\u2019s the expert.\u201d</p><p>Her dad\u2019s eyes darkened further. \u201cExpert? Hell, how many times have you been married, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Jack answered evenly.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I was talking about Jack\u2019s restoration expertise, not his marriage expertise.\u201d</p><p>Carson harrumphed.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about a wedding date?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>Jack sent Carolyn a dazzling smile. \u201cI\u2019d vote for immediately, but it depends on our schedules. Keely is anxious to get the clinic up and running, so finishing the building is our first priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talking weeks or months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths, probably.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn sipped her tea and cast Carson a sly look. \u201cYou thinking what I\u2019m thinking, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat this engagement is a sign of the apocalypse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d She looked to her mother for support and wished she hadn\u2019t. Shit. This was not going well.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes held that calculating squint that never boded well for anyone.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m thinking we can throw Keely and Jack an engagement party the likes this town has never seen. Right away.\u201d</p><p>Keely stopped stirring her mashed potatoes. \u201cWhat? No. Ma. That\u2019s not necessary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s necessary, sweetheart. Our only daughter is tying the knot with the man of her dreams.</p><p>We want everyone\u2014and I mean everyone\u2014in four counties to rejoice with us in the news that the last McKay wild child has been tamed.\u201d</p><p>Tamed? Oh for fuck\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t call for an enormous party with all the trimmings I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t panic. Smile. Act like this is no big deal.</p><p>\u201cBesides, sweetie, with so many, many, many family members and friends here, it is the best way to make the official announcement and allow them to congratulate you in person. Don\u2019t you remember how wild and fun Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception was?\u201d</p><p>Poor Jack looked positively green. Keely would\u2019ve enjoyed his discomfort if she hadn\u2019t felt a little green herself. Still, she couldn\u2019t resist taking a shot at him. \u201cIt\u2019s something Jack and I will never forget, will we? Are you up for this, Jack darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His lips curled in a half-smile. \u201cThe more the merrier, as you always say, right?\u201d he shot right back.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jack\u2019s mother has her own list of who she\u2019s inviting. We don\u2019t only want McKays and Wests in attendance, right? Anyway, if you\u2019ll leave me her phone number, Jack, I\u2019ll call her tomorrow.</p><p>Between the two of us we\u2019ll have everything organized, so all you two lovebirds will need to do is show up at the party.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s glass of milk stopped midair. \u201cYou\u2019re calling my mother to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Carolyn set her teacup in the saucer. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Keely inserted smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s very thoughtful of you, Ma, wanting to include Doro from the get-go. Except we haven\u2019t told Jack\u2019s mother about the engagement yet.\u201d</p><p>There was that no bullshit glare from her dad again. \u201cWhy the hell not? You embarrassed about marryin\u2019 my girl, Donohue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t told her because we wanted to tell you first,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>Her father\u2019s glower lingered on Jack as he passed Carolyn another packet of sugar.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re calling Doro tonight, right honey?\u201d she cooed at Jack.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, buttercup,\u201d Jack cooed back.</p><p>\u201cHave you told any of your brothers yet?\u201d Carson demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamona?\u201d</p><p>Keely shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re all fired up to strap on that old ball and chain if you ain\u2019t tellin\u2019 anyone that matters to you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you and Mama, Daddy. Doesn\u2019t that count?\u201d</p><p>When he squinted, Keely realized he knew she was up to something. The man always busted her.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Jack and I are thrilled you\u2019re throwing us a party,\u201d Keely said with as much false cheer as she could muster. She patted her mother\u2019s hand, making sure she got a good look at her ginormous engagement ring. \u201cI\u2019m putting you one hundred percent in charge of planning the engagement party you\u2019ve always dreamed for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dammit. \u201cI mean, why waste all the good games when there are men around? I say let\u2019s save the games for the bridal shower.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s gaze turned shrewd. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll wear a dress? A nice dress? Not a jean skirt and boots? Or a miniskirt and boots?\u201d</p><p>Hell no. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned forward, the picture of earnestness. \u201cI promise she\u2019ll look appropriate for the occasion even if I have to dress her myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Carolyn. Can I help you clear the dishes before Keely and I take off?\u201d</p><p>Keely wasn\u2019t sure if her ears were playing tricks on her, or if her father actually muttered, \u201cSuck up.\u201d</p><p>While Jack tried to charm her mother in the kitchen, her dad took two shot glasses from the china hutch. He poured Jameson whiskey in each glass and passed one to her.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t Mama and Jack be here if we\u2019re toasting in celebration of my upcoming marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t celebrating. This whole thing is giving me indigestion and whiskey is better than Tums. Drink up.\u201d His gaze turned crafty when Keely hesitated. \u201cUnless you really have a bun in the oven and that\u2019s why you ain\u2019t drinkin\u2019 my good Irish?\u201d</p><p>The cunning coot had played her good. She slammed the shot and poured another and slammed it too.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 about this situation that makes me happy, punkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes she\u2019d inherited pinned her in place. \u201cBecause he shoulda talked to me about marryin\u2019 you first.\u201d</p><p>For Christsake. That\u2019s why her dad was pissy?</p><p>\u201cMight seem old-fashioned, but you are my only daughter.\u201d He knocked back a slug of whiskey. \u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019 it woulda been nice to\u2019ve been asked.\u201d</p><p>Keely was strangely touched. She moved to where he sat in his favorite chair and wrapped her arms around him from behind. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make you feel better, I\u2019ll chew him out for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d make me feel better if you weren\u2019t marryin\u2019 him at all. It\u2019s too damn quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that you proposed to Mama the night you met her. So try again.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed, \u201cSmartypants. He ain\u2019t your type.\u201d</p><p>Since when wasn\u2019t tall, handsome, well-built, sarcastic and rich not her type? \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t a cowboy, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first and only cowboy in my life, Daddy. I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d want the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck up, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d He pressed his leathery cheek to hers. \u201cNow go on, get outta here and stop drinkin\u2019 all my damn whiskey.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cAn engagement party?\u201d Jack bit off the second she shut the car door.</p><p>Keely squirmed. \u201cWhat was I supposed to say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo would\u2019ve been a good place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an opportunist. Think of it as the ultimate occasion to convince people we\u2019re really getting married.\u201d</p><p>Jack swallowed his retort and turned up the radio.</p> <p>Keely lasted about thirty-five seconds before she flipped the music off. \u201cYou actually like that noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I listen to it if I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably think it makes you sound sophisticated if you tell people you listen to jazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d be better off listening to that goat-yodeling crap you prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. At least it\u2019s honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs honest as the Nashville music executives can manipulate in a slick multimillion dollar recording studio with a marketing team in the wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesty much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHow is it my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my car, ripping on my music choices.\u201d He expelled a heavy sigh. \u201cCan you just not talk for the rest of the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>A minute later she dragged out her iPod and sang along. Loudly. By the time Jack parked behind her building, he almost wished he hadn\u2019t asked her not to talk.</p><p>Keely appraised him coolly. \u201cWant me to stay in the car with you while you call your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? To hold my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Jack. I thought Doro would want to talk to me, but you can deal with her on your own.\u201d</p><p>Just as she grabbed the door handle to get out, Jack hit the automatic locks. Keely faced him again, fury in her stiff movements. \u201cLet. Me. Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. And yes, buttercup, I\u2019d like it if you stuck around when I called her.\u201d He offered her a winsome smile. \u201cMy mother adores you. She hoped you and Justin would end up together.\u201d</p><p>Keely redirected her eyes away from his. \u201cYeah, well, I hope to hell she doesn\u2019t know why that one didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out because you broke up with Justin.\u201d</p> <p>No answer.</p><p>Her long pauses never boded well for him. \u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Justin broke up with me after you told him to ditch me.\u201d</p><p>Jack silently repeated the numerical sequence of pi to the fifteenth digit before he spoke. \u201cAre you really blaming me for my brother\u2019s stupidity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She spun toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Justin told you about our New Year\u2019s tryst with his friend Logan. God knows I never would\u2019ve told any of my brothers about my sexcapades. I\u2019m assuming Justin wanted to...impress you or some damn thing. All I know is Justin told me that you told him I wasn\u2019t the woman for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin didn\u2019t come right out and admit he was calling it quits because of the threesome, but he hinted pretty strongly that my slutty behavior\u2014which he enjoyed immensely while we were in the moment, mind you\u2014was why he was breaking up with me...after talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake. Justin is an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say any of that shit to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said was he should know you weren\u2019t the woman for him because it didn\u2019t bother him to watch his buddy fucking you. I said if Justin loved you, he should\u2019ve thrown Logan out the goddamn hotel window for daring to put his hands on you.\u201d Jack remembered being extremely pissed off because his brother had Keely McKay in his bed and wasn\u2019t man enough to keep her satisfied, nor was he man enough to call the shots.</p><p>Comprehension dawned in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. That dumbass took it totally out of context and you blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. I mostly blamed Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He couldn\u2019t handle you anyway, could he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She gifted him with a flirty grin that made his balls tighten. \u201cYou think he\u2019ll be upset by our engagement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But he won\u2019t freak out as much as your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted. \u201cCarter is a pussycat. You oughta be worried about Cam; he\u2019s always armed. Plus, he knows we had an...incident at Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>No wonder the guy always glared at him. \u201cDid you tell him what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019? I haven\u2019t told anyone the embarrassing truth. All Cam knows is that I was unhappy and it was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d Jack jammed his hands through his hair again. \u201cWe really have to call everyone tonight, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And since your folks didn\u2019t reproduce like rabbits, your list is considerably smaller than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom and dad always wanted more kids. It\u2019d be easier on her now if she had more family around...\u201d Guilt popped up. Again. Followed quickly by sorrow. Again.</p><p>She smoothed her hand up his forearm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your dad, Jack. Marvin was very sweet to me the couple of times I met him.\u201d</p><p>A hollow emptiness expanded in his chest whenever his dad\u2019s name was mentioned. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m apologizing... I\u2019m really sorry I was such a jerk two years ago at my family picnic.</p><p>When I saw you moping around, I thought it was because I refused to talk to you. I had no idea it was because your dad had died. After Macie chewed my ass, I went looking for you to express my condolences, but you were already gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Maybe you can run interference for me with Macie when she finds out I own the Sandstone Building. I imagine she\u2019ll rip me a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d She gestured to his phone. \u201cGet crackin\u2019. I\u2019ll hang out until you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>His mother was beside herself he\u2019d snatched up that \u201cfine young woman\u201d Keely McKay for his wife.</p><p>She spent more time chatting with Keely than with him. Maybe because Keely snapped a picture of her engagement ring with her cell phone and sent it to her. Maybe because Keely begged her to help Carolyn plan the engagement party. But Jack couldn\u2019t accuse Keely of pandering, because she genuinely liked his mother. He felt his first twinge of guilt about this charade; it\u2019d hurt his mother when he and Keely called off the engagement.</p><p>A sexy trill of laughter caught Jack\u2019s attention and he watched Keely\u2019s lips curve into a smile.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, we didn\u2019t tell anyone, so your boy isn\u2019t keeping you out of the loop, Doro. I promise. Yes. I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Keely clicked the off button. \u201cYour mom says your dad would be proud of you.\u201d</p><p>More guilt.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next on your list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just send everyone else a text message with that picture of your engagement ring?\u201d Hell.</p><p>That actually sounded whiny. What the fuck was happening to him?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea but let\u2019s take a picture of us. The light is all golden and glowy right now.\u201d She yanked on the door handle. Four times in rapid succession. \u201cLet me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience isn\u2019t your strong suit, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter learn that early on.\u201d After Jack skirted the front end of the car, Keely positioned him against the passenger side and took over. He allowed it. For now. But the cowgirl was sorely mistaken if she thought he was malleable like the men she usually dated.</p><p>\u201cPut your hand here. No, here. Now pull me close. Angle your head into mine. Hang on. I wanna get the ring in the pic too.\u201d She settled her left hand prominently in the center of his chest. \u201cOkay. Hold that beautiful smile on the count of three. One. Two...\u201d</p><p>At the last second, Jack turned and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Jack.\u201d She jumped away from him. \u201cThat was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you payback was a bitch. So let\u2019s see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Keely lifted the camera out of his reach. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I do.\u201d Jack snatched the phone, clicking to the last picture. He grinned. The light reflected off Keely\u2019s glossy black hair, creating a halo effect. She smiled prettily as he lovingly smooched her cheek. He flipped it around so she could see the screen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, but I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone looking at this will think we\u2019re happy, and that\u2019s the point, right?\u201d He pushed a few buttons and sent the picture to everyone in her phone book with the message, Jack Donohue and I are engaged!</p><p>Love, Keely. \u201cThere. It\u2019s a done deal. Now everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keely swiped the phone and scrolled down. \u201cNo, no, no, no! You sent this to everyone?</p><p>Including... Omigod, Casey and Renner and Kent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are Casey and Renner and Kent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome guys I\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack boxed her against her the car with his body, forcing her undivided attention. \u201cYou will not fuck around on me, ever, understand? No calling other guys. No flirting with other guys. No kissing other guys.</p><p>No touching other guys. As far as the world is concerned, we are engaged for real, and you will not embarrass me, or yourself, by acting any way other than wildly in love with me, got it?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid to his mouth and she licked her lips.</p><p>Fuck. He\u2019d spent way too many hours thinking about what he\u2019d do if that tempting mouth of hers was ever close to his again. If he lowered his head he could taste the juicy sweetness of those full red lips as he swallowed her surprised moan...</p><p>The phone in his hand buzzed with a text message.</p><p>Dammit all to hell. \u201cI said got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She kept peering at him with those enormous midnight blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing to say?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cJust one thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossessive much?\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know the half of it. Jack permitted a feral smile. \u201cBetter learn that early on.\u201d He pushed back and tucked the phone in her front shirt pocket. \u201cGo upstairs and make your calls. I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d</p><p>Keely sauntered away.</p><p>Jack dug his cell phone out and brought up the engagement picture he\u2019d forwarded to himself. It exemplified a couple who looked wildly in love. He reworded the text message and hit send all.</p><p>No going back now.</p><p>Three hours later, Jack punched his lace pillow for the millionth time. He could not get comfortable in this stupid, lumpy, midget-sized bed.</p><p>You can\u2019t get comfortable because you\u2019ve got a hard-on the size of a Louisville Slugger.</p><p>He stared at the rows of stuffed animals lining the bookshelves. Creepy damn things. Then he gazed at the ceiling, wide-awake.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the last two hours trying not to gawk at Keely\u2019s legs. Or her ass. Or her tits. Or the little slice of her belly that teased where her booty shorts gapped in the front. Or where the bottom curve of her butt cheeks peeked out in the back.</p><p>What kind of man got hard from a pair of flannel shorts?</p><p>He did, evidently. She hadn\u2019t been deliberately teasing him either. If Keely had slunk out of her bedroom in a skimpy Victoria\u2019s Secret getup, he wouldn\u2019t have reacted.</p><p>Right. Keely McKay could wear sackcloth and ashes and he\u2019d be lusting after her.</p><p>She\u2019d all but ignored him as she cleaned up the kitchen. Tidied up the living room. She\u2019d handed him the remote to an older model TV. Talk about horrified\u2014no big screen/flat screen and no cable. That\u2019d change first thing tomorrow.</p><p>Then Keely bid him goodnight. At ten-thirty. Jack didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. He could crack open his laptop, but work didn\u2019t appeal to him. Wandering down to the local bar alone didn\u2019t sound like fun. Watching TV was out. He set up his coffeemaker. Then he\u2019d gone to bed.</p><p>And there he lay with his dick as rigid as rebar.</p><p>Every time he thought of something nonsexual, such as his conversation with Carter\u2014which was little more than profanity laced threats. Or his conversation with Justin\u2014which was little more than the accusation Jack had fucked up Justin\u2019s relationship with Keely just so Jack could have her\u2014the throbbing in his groin abated somewhat.</p><p>Somewhat.</p><p>But then Keely, the sexy, sassy, sultry, sweet-smelling cowgirl from hell would float into his mind\u2019s eye again and he\u2019d be back to square one. Hard, horny. Hating he had no outlet.</p><p>Wrong. There\u2019s no shame in beating off. No different than any other night in your pathetic sex life.</p><p>True. So Jack closed his eyes, spread his legs and took himself in hand. He imagined Keely easing that yellow tank top up, revealing the creamy expanse of her taut belly. In his fantasy, her belly button was pierced and a little silver cowbell jangled with every twitch of her curvy hips.</p><p>He stroked his cock from root to tip.</p> <p>She tossed the tank top and cupped her tits. They were on the small side, but Jack wasn\u2019t a tit man anyway. Her thumbs drew circles around the rosy nipples, brushing the tips until they puckered. She moaned and slid her palms down her belly, beneath the waistband of the flannel shorts, swinging her hips with gusto. Her long black hair whipped from side to side as she shimmied the shorts off. Her pussy was shaved except for a tiny strip of black hair. She traced the line of her slit with a slender finger, parting the delicate pink lips.</p><p>Oh fuck yeah. His hand on his cock moved faster.</p><p>The phantom image of Keely drifted forward, her come-hither stare locked on the movement of his fist as he beat off. She placed her left foot on the footboard, giving him an unobstructed view of her glistening sex. She thrust her middle finger into her cunt and moaned softly as she pumped it in and out.</p><p>Showing him the wetness, biting her lip as she pleasured herself in front of him.</p><p>When she started grinding the heel of her hand into her clit and pinching her nipple, the slap slap slap of Jack working his cock became louder. Keely pulled her fingers from her juicy sex and sucked them into her wicked mouth.</p><p>Jack lost it, furiously pulling on his cock until his release spurted out and coated his hand.</p><p>After he\u2019d caught his breath, he opened his eyes. Alone in his room, whacking off to an illusion again.</p><p>But damn, what an illusion.</p><p>What if it weren\u2019t? Once the news of their engagement spread, everyone would assume they were sleeping together. What if he could have Keely as his sexual playmate for a little while?</p><p>Right. Keely would totally go for that. Never mind the fact they couldn\u2019t stand each other. And at least in his delusion Keely hadn\u2019t spoken and ruined it, like he was sure she would in real life.</p><p>No. It was better to have the fantasy in this case.</p><p>Mind made up, Jack finally relaxed enough to drift toward sleep.</p><p>At seven o\u2019clock an unfamiliar screeching whir woke Keely. She jumped out of bed in her underwear and a camisole and raced into the kitchen, figuring an appliance had exploded. But the noise was from some fancy-ass coffee pot. Beans were grinding, steam billowed, water hissed and popped. A loud click and the aroma of hot, fresh coffee rolled out.</p><p>Keely\u2019s mouth watered.</p><p>\u201cA thing of beauty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s deep, scratchy morning voice sent a pleasant tingle down her spine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful damn noisy. Does it bake muffins too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t need to. It makes the best coffee in the world and you\u2019ll forget all about muffins once you get a taste. If you ask me real nice I might even let you have a cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me real nice, I might even let you borrow a cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2014\u201d he plucked a mug from the dish rack, \u201c\u2014will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>She ripped her favorite cup out of his grasp. \u201cHuh-uh. Find another one and keep your paws off this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always this cranky in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Keely spun on her heel and slammed her bedroom door. She set her favorite UWYO mug on the nightstand and threw herself on the bed.</p><p>Dammit. She did not want to share her apartment or anything in it with Jack. Not coffee. Not small talk. She would never survive this fake engagement. Never. She might as well march right back out there and give him back the ostentatious ring along with a really nasty piece of her mind.</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and glared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kidding about sending you back to bed. Did you want coffee?\u201d</p><p>What the heck? Why was Jack being nice to her?</p><p>Just go with it.</p><p>Keely inhaled a slow, deep breath. \u201cSure. Just let me throw something on.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze systematically inched up her body. When their eyes met, the heat and interest she saw floored her. \u201cNo need to get dressed on my account. In fact, all you really need is your special cup, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suggesting a clothing optional coffee klatch?\u201d</p><p>His answering smile was decidedly wicked. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>The man was succeeding at keeping her off balance.</p><p>She detoured to the bathroom and brushed her teeth, but didn\u2019t attempt to fix her bedhead. In the kitchen area, she sat across from Jack at the small dinette set.</p><p>He poured coffee from an insulated silver carafe. \u201cI don\u2019t think I asked you last night if you\u2019d set up a meeting time with Chet and Remy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting with them at two.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cI was hoping to get it out of the way first thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re working on a job outside of Aladdin and that was the earliest they could get away.\u201d Keely blew on her coffee before she took a sip. Oh. It was heavenly. Not too bitter, not too bland. She took another sip. Yep. Second one just as good as the first.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. However, I find it...interesting that of all the items you could\u2019ve brought from your place in Denver, a coffeepot topped the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just a coffeepot, a coffeemaker,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cThe premier all-in-one brew system using the French press method. And I only buy free-trade Guatemalan coffee beans which makes the entire coffee experience nearly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrgasmic?\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cA dirty and mean sense of humor first thing in the morning. I may learn to like you yet.\u201d He smiled when she stuck out her tongue at him. \u201cAfter I call the cable company and get us hooked up to the twenty-first century, I\u2019ll head over to Spearfish and pick up a new TV before the two o\u2019clock meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I don\u2019t watch much TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you plan on being here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming the boob tube is going in your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would I put it amidst all those stuffed animals?\u201d Jack shook his head. \u201cIt goes in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t argue. He\u2019ll just remind you he owns the apartment and can put anything wherever he damn well pleases.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m hitting the shower.\u201d Maybe it was petty, but she stayed under the spray until not a drop of hot water remained. She smeared in her favorite lotion\u2014Sky Blue Lilac Dreams\u2014from head to toe, and ran a comb through her tangled hair, calling it good. Most days she didn\u2019t fuss with her appearance. No exception today because she did not want Jack Donohue thinking she\u2019d duded herself up for him.</p><p>Normally she\u2019d walk naked to her bedroom, but with Jack here... Her inner bad girl urged her to saunter buck-ass nekkid right past him. Her inner good girl primly reminded her to cover herself so not an inch of skin was visible.</p><p>Her inner good girl won for a change. She wrapped a towel around her torso before she scooted into her bedroom.</p><p>Keely had just finished dressing when she heard loud knocking on the door. Early for visitors but she knew who\u2019d popped by unannounced. Without guilt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AJ stood on the landing, gripping Foster\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s this pile of garbage about you marrying Jack Donohue?\u201d AJ demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not garbage.\u201d Keely clapped her hands and Foster ran into her arms with a heart-melting little boy giggle. She lifted him and spun him around to more giggles. \u201cDidja miss your Auntie, Fos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p> <p>She looked him over, completely smitten. With his dark hair and lanky build, Foster would be the spitting image of his father, Cord, if not for the silvery hue of his eyes, which he\u2019d inherited from AJ.</p><p>He slapped his palms on her cheeks. \u201cPlay Legos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear you only love me for my toys.\u201d She kissed his forehead before setting him down. She grabbed the box out of the toy closet and dumped the contents on the rug. \u201cHe\u2019s either gonna grow up to be a bricklayer or a house builder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are avoiding the question. I want all the details, Keely West McKay, and I want them right now.\u201d</p><p>Keely sighed. \u201cI know you can\u2019t have coffee in your condition, but do you want a glass of juice?\u201d</p> <p>AJ folded her arms across her chest in a belligerent posture. \u201cNope. Spill. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months back I bought a building in Moorcroft to turn into a clinic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me that either? Geez, K, I thought I was your best friend and now I find out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my best friend, but this was something I couldn\u2019t talk about to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone except Jack Donohue?\u201d AJ retorted.</p><p>How was she supposed to convince AJ, who could sniff out a lie at twenty paces, the engagement to Jack was real? In AJ\u2019s hormonal state, joking, cajoling and dodging would only annoy her. Best to go on the defensive. Keely offered a brittle smile. \u201cHard to believe, but I do have a life outside of Sundance and the McKay family. Since I spend half my time working at the VA in Cheyenne, you wouldn\u2019t know anything about that part of my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo fill me in.\u201d</p><p>After rambling on about her need for secretiveness she sighed. \u201cLong story short, I contacted an approved historic restoration company, only to discover that Jack owns the company. We got to talking and the more time we spent together, the more things...changed between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long since this \u2018change\u2019 has taken place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months. Give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to mention to me or anyone else in the family that you\u2019d fallen for the man you used to hate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for me. I still sorta hate him on your behalf, K...\u201d AJ\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cI cannot wrap my head around the fact you\u2019re marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate is a strong word for the man who\u2019s your landlord,\u201d Keely said sardonically.</p> <p>\u201cMy landlord?\u201d Her eyes widened with understanding. \u201cFor Healing Touch Massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, which means he\u2019s also Macie\u2019s landlord for Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, and India\u2019s landlord for India\u2019s Ink, and Skylar\u2019s landlord for Sky Blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. Jack owns the Sandstone Building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Jack Donohue is Western Property Management. Evidently he owns a half a dozen different rental properties across several states.\u201d</p><p>After a minute or so, AJ snapped, \u201cSo Jack\u2019s been having a big chuckle keeping that information from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d And Keely couldn\u2019t wait to witness India\u2019s reaction. Talk about ripping him a new one. That woman redefined in your face and she was ten times worse when she was knocked up. Heh heh.</p><p>The bathroom door creaked. Both Keely and AJ spun toward the sound. Jack strode out.</p><p>Keely clenched her jaw to prevent it from falling to the floor. Holy freakin\u2019 shit. Jack was shirtless.</p><p>His upper body was a mass of defined muscles\u2014his pecs, biceps and triceps were as perfect as the smooth bronze skin covering his immense frame. His waistline tapered into a flat abdomen and slim hips, hugged by the low-slung jeans. She\u2019d never seen Jack wear jeans. The man who lived in suits looked...well suited to 501s.</p><p>The tips of his dark, wet hair brushed his shoulders, reinforcing his wild look. His mouth curled up in a sultry smile when his gaze connected with Keely\u2019s.</p><p>A powerful lust steamrolled her.</p><p>Jack crossed the room with panther-like grace.</p><p>Her body stiffened when he nuzzled the side of her neck and circled his big hands around her upper arms.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave me any hot water again, babe. I had to take a cold shower.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. He smelled delectable. Despite his claim of cold water, his chest felt hot enough to scorch her clothes. \u201cSorry. Maybe you oughta sweet-talk the landlord into replacing the tiny overworked water heater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sweet-talking gets you whatever you want with me. And a cold shower was probably in my best interest this morning after last night.\u201d Jack straightened and smiled at AJ. \u201cMrs. McKay. Nice to see you.\u201d His gaze momentarily dropped to the swell of her abdomen. \u201cCongrats. When are you due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour months. Take that into consideration when you\u2019re picking a wedding date. Keely does not want her matron of honor to be nine months pregnant in the wedding pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d was shouted behind them.</p><p>They turned toward Foster, who\u2019d stacked the Legos in the shape of a house.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Jack crouched down and admired Foster\u2019s creation. \u201cInteresting how you used red at the bottom and yellow at the top. Very original.\u201d</p><p>Foster blinked silvery eyes at Jack.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little shy,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cNah. He\u2019s just thinking. You\u2019re a craftsman, aren\u2019t you? Me too. Let\u2019s see what we can come up with. I used to spend hours playing Legos. I forgot how much I loved them.\u201d Jack settled next to Foster and grabbed four long sections of white block and lined them up on the base.</p><p>Keely melted a little, seeing Jack engrossed in playtime with her nephew. She never imagined he\u2019d be the type of guy who\u2019d sit on the floor and play Legos.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for his softer side. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s part of the scam.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>AJ tugged Keely into the kitchen. She whispered fiercely, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll admit I see his appeal. Not only is he unbelievably good looking, he\u2019s got an amazing body and he likes kids\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget he\u2019s loaded,\u201d Keely added.</p><p>AJ whapped her on the arm. \u201cThat is not how you choose a man you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life with. I imagine the sex is pretty rockin\u2019 too?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s gaze skittered away and she prayed AJ would drop it.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at AJ, fearing her best friend had guessed the truth about the Jack situation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the real deal for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not regaling me with tales of the size of his penis, or how he screwed you in the bathroom at Coors Field, or how you went down on him on a twisty mountain road, or the wicked tricks he can perform with his long tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, keeping the intimate details to yourself means what happens between you two is too personal to share.\u201d</p><p>Or there aren\u2019t any down and dirty details to share.</p><p>AJ hugged her and sniffled in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, K. Even if Jack isn\u2019t the man I\u2019d choose for you.\u201d</p><p>Me neither. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Keely silently breathed a sigh of relief. If she\u2019d convinced AJ about the legitimacy of the engagement, she should be home free as far as the rest of her family buying it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jack rounded the corner with Foster, burning Keely with a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cGirl talk. AJ has great ideas for the centerpieces for the engagement party. A bouquet of Wyoming wildflowers\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack held up his hand. \u201cYou promised no party details, remember? I need the keys to your truck for my trip to Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>Keely opened her mouth to belt out, Oh hell no, you ain\u2019t touchin\u2019 my truck when she noticed the challenge in his eyes. \u201cJack, darlin\u2019, I can drive. In fact, I\u2019d love to go with you since we\u2019ve spent so little time together recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how sweet she is?\u201d Jack said to AJ with a totally fake smile. \u201cBut I realize you have tons of stuff to do around the apartment today\u2014cooking, cleaning, pressing my work shirts, organizing my side of the dresser before we pore over the plans with West Construction this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d She heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cSwapping cars today will work out great.\u201d</p><p>Alarm danced through Jack\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She bit her cheek to stop the laughter. Jack babied his 760li Series BMW. The notion of handing her the keys would give him a nervous breakdown.</p><p>Which would serve him right.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cI see some things haven\u2019t changed between you two,\u201d AJ said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fight brewing and I don\u2019t wanna be around for the making up part.\u201d She took Foster\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, son. Aunt Domini has a bowl of Cheerios with your name on it downstairs at Dewey\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Foster didn\u2019t hug Keely goodbye. The only thing that interested the kid more than Legos was food.</p><p>The door slammed.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her the truth?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. She thinks because I haven\u2019t been regaling her with tales of our kinky sexual exploits that this must be wuv, twue wuv. \u201d</p><p>\u201cQuoting The Princess Bride will not steer my focus from the fact you are not driving my car today or any other day, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We\u2019re engaged. It is my right to drive it, especially if you\u2019re taking off in my truck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere do you need to go today?\u201d</p><p>Nowhere, but she wasn\u2019t about to admit that to him. \u201cI have a life, Jack. I have a job. I need a car.</p><p>And no, I\u2019m not asking anyone to ferry me around town when there\u2019s a perfectly good car sitting in the parking lot. Besides, people would gossip that my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t trust me to touch his precious Beemer.\u201d</p> <p>Jack loomed over her. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you. Do you have any idea how much I paid for that car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay, way too much?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cWho cares? It\u2019s just a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a car? It\u2019s a feat of German engineering\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome feat! It doesn\u2019t have a trunk big enough to hold more than a French press coffeepot made in China and a bag of Guatemalan coffee beans.\u201d When he snarled, she jabbed him in the chest with her index finger. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. The only way I\u2019ll let you borrow my truck to pick up that all important big-screen TV is if you let me drive your car.\u201d</p><p>Jack paced to the living room. Muttered to himself and stalked back to her. \u201cFine. But if anything happens, and I mean a single rock chip or an itty bitty scratch, I will take it out of your hide, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. I\u2019ll treat it like it\u2019s my own.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s probably why Keely got a speeding ticket not two hours later.</p><p>But it\u2019d been so damn tempting. A V-12 with 360 horses under the hood? And a long stretch of empty black road in front of her? Sheer heaven.</p><p>She\u2019d neglected to mention her love of fast cars to her intended. Trading in her old Corvette, after the years she\u2019d spent zipping through traffic in Denver and opening the throttle on the deserted highways of the west, had broken her heart. But when Keely moved back home for good, she knew Wyoming weather could change in a heartbeat. Making the long, lonely drive between Sundance and Cheyenne in the winter months was dangerous and necessitated a four-wheel drive truck.</p> <p>So if Keely stumbled on the chance to rod the piss out of a car meant to be driven hard and fast and loose, she did so without an ounce of guilt.</p><p>Just her bad luck she\u2019d blazed past a Crook County Sheriff\u2019s car as she\u2019d hit the one hundred thirty miles per hour mark. When the flashing lights finally caught up with her, she hoped Sheriff Shortbull was behind the wheel. He\u2019d let her off with a warning. He always did. She manufactured a charming but contrite smile.</p><p>Keely watched in the rearview mirror as the driver\u2019s side door of the cop car opened. Her smile dried up. Her stomach dipped. The unmistakable hulking form of her brother Cam started toward her.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She reluctantly rolled down her window. \u201cI can explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLicense and registration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. Seriously. Just listen for a sec.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his head inside the car. \u201cNot. Another. Word. License and registration.\u201d</p> <p>Keely popped the glove box and found the vehicle registration right where it was supposed to be. She passed it and her license through the window, waiting while Cam did his cop thing. \u201cExit the vehicle and come with me.\u201d</p><p>Keely trudged to the passenger side of the cop car and climbed in.</p><p>\u201cDid Jack really let you drive his car? Or did you steal it when he wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe let me have it. We traded. He needed my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you drive like an idiot?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is this bullshit about you and Jack Donohue getting married anyhow?\u201d</p><p>Big brother number four didn\u2019t beat around the bush. She allowed him time to recant his jerky statement. When he didn\u2019t, she offered him a haughty, \u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Cam ripped his sunglasses off. His eyes snapped fire. \u201cYes, it is. I know you. I\u2019ve seen the venom in your eyes when you look at him, so don\u2019t give me that \u2018I\u2019m madly in love with him\u2019 crap. Come clean. Right now.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, Cam did know her to the bone and she had one chance to deflect the conversation.</p><p>\u201cOkay, smarty, if you know me so well, then what have I been working on for the last four months?\u201d</p><p>He squinted at her with his I can toss your smart ass in jail stare.</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a clue, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sweetheart, whatever you\u2019ve secretly been working on, you\u2019ve done a damn good job of hiding it, not only from me, but from the family. And I would know all about hiding stuff, wouldn\u2019t I? So who better than me to ferret out the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. I ain\u2019t done. What I do know, little sis, is Jack Donohue did something to you at Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception that made you cry. I\u2019ve never pushed the issue, even when I wanted to castrate the son of a bitch for hurting you. And if I thought he\u2019d physically injured you? I would\u2019ve killed him on the spot. Period.\u201d</p><p>Yikes.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>She hated to lie to her brother. Cam considered lying the ultimate sin, the biggest betrayal, but she did it anyway. \u201cYes, I hated Jack. No doubt we\u2019ve had a rocky past. The reason I haven\u2019t told you what went down between us that night is because it\u2019s between me and Jack. You also know me well enough that if he would\u2019ve hurt me, I would\u2019ve sliced off his dick before you\u2019d gotten the chance. That said, I\u2019ve changed.</p><p>Jack has changed. When I needed his help, he really came through for me.\u201d</p><p>The squinty-eyed stare he\u2019d inherited from Dad appeared again. \u201cHelp with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe building I bought in Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat building? Jesus, Keely, why haven\u2019t I heard about this before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d For the one-trillionth time, Keely explained. Cam wasn\u2019t any happier with the explanation than anyone else had been.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014me, Cord, Colby, Colt, Carter, Kade, Buck, Quinn and Ben\u2014would\u2019ve helped you check it out. We\u2019re family. You should\u2019ve come to us first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I can tell, none of you are licensed with the Wyoming Historical Society to facilitate the approval of my remodeling plans. Jack is. So all you, Cord, Colby, Colt, Carter, Kade, Buck, Quinn, and Ben could\u2019ve done is tell me the building needs a shitload of work, which I already knew. To be fair, I did talk to Chet and Remy, so I rounded up all the expert help I needed on the construction front. What I need from you right now is your support in other ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me grief about my engagement to Jack. He\u2019s my...choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll drop it for now. But I\u2019m still writing you a ticket for reckless driving.\u201d</p><p>Keely would gladly take the two hundred dollar fine instead of subjecting herself to Cam\u2019s continued scrutiny. She smiled. \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled up behind his BMW in the parking lot of the Brewster Building and did a visual sweep for damages. Lucky for that mouthy cowgirl, everything looked fine.</p><p>He re-secured the tie-downs over the boxes in the back of the truck and grabbed his clipboard before heading up the steps.</p><p>Inside, he let the ambience of the past and the promise of the future wash over him. Sometimes when he stood in an old building, he swore the energy of previous inhabitants surrounded him. Guiding him to consider the past. This project was no different, despite the bizarre circumstances.</p><p>Jack glanced at the painted tin ceiling. Made notes. He checked the buckled walls. Every inch of the lathe and plaster had to come out. Ripping out the plumbing upstairs would fix the water damage problems.</p><p>He wandered, half-listening to the banging and clanking of tools.</p><p>A long staircase spiraled up the right side, ending in a balcony. The curved banister was in decent shape, although the wooden balustrades were missing. He\u2019d need a specific solution for those repairs on the remodel plans. Since the staircase was the architectural focal point of the room, it needed to retain as much of the original design as possible.</p><p>He\u2019d scrawled another question about replacing the individual glass windows fronting the offices on the balcony, when Keely barreled around the corner, carrying a rotting chunk of plasterboard. She heaved it out the side door with a grunt. \u201cGross-ass shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>She gasped and whirled around. \u201cWhoa. I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed that. What were you tossing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody put a moldy chunk of Sheetrock in front of the old boiler access and it sealed shut, probably with the help of a gallon of mouse piss.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cNasty, smelly mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre Chet and Remy around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Keely whistled shrilly. \u201cGuys! Jack is here.\u201d</p><p>Jack winced. \u201cA warning about your deafening whistle might be in order next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>Two guys bounded down the stairs. Both mid-thirties. The tall, stocky man had curly light brown hair and dark eyes. The shorter, stockier man had curly dark brown hair and light eyes. Jack vaguely remembered meeting them at Carter\u2019s wedding. He thrust out his hand. \u201cJack Donohue. Full Circle Consulting.\u201d</p><p>The taller guy spoke first. \u201cChet West. West Construction.\u201d</p><p>The shorter guy inserted himself between them. \u201cRemy West, also of West Construction. Cousin Keely here told us you own the Sandstone Building. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cYou guys did a great job on that remodel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we had a choice,\u201d Chet said. \u201cNow I know why you were such a hardass on approving the plans. Architects as owners are construction guys\u2019 worst nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re back for more.\u201d</p><p>Remy smiled. \u201cWe ain\u2019t dumb. You may be a pain in the butt, but you paid top dollar and gave us a good recommendation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come I didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Keely demanded of her cousins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause we keep our mouths shut. No matter what.\u201d Chet\u2019s gaze moved between Keely and Jack.</p><p>\u201cSo can you. Keely never once mentioned being involved with you on a personal level. She played all coy and secretive about her \u2018expert\u2019 help.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted a brow at Keely. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discreet, haven\u2019t we, buttercup? Now we\u2019re engaged and there\u2019s no denying I\u2019m a lucky man.\u201d When he attempted to put his arm around her, she flinched. Damn woman could at least pretend his touch didn\u2019t repulse her. Just to be ornery, he jerked her to his side, keeping their bodies touching. \u201cCome on, Keely, no need to act shy. We are with family.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet how much she really is the blushing-bride type beneath that blustering cowgirl exterior.\u201d</p> <p>Keely froze, then stiffened with anger.</p><p>Jack wondered if he should\u2019ve worn a cup.</p><p>Chet addressed Keely. \u201cAunt Caro is throwing a big bash for you guys, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext weekend. We\u2019d love for you to come, but I\u2019ll warn ya, my brothers will be gunning for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor keeping the building buying a secret from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the McKays bring it,\u201d Remy said. \u201cWe don\u2019t back down for no one. Our word is our bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen, bro.\u201d Chet and Remy bumped fists.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of bond...your business paperwork is up to date. If West Construction forged a deal with Keely about specific duties, project costs, potential overruns and a timeframe for each stage, then as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re good to go on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense a but.\u201d</p><p>Jack flashed his teeth at Chet. \u201cA couple of minor considerations that don\u2019t have to be addressed today, but I\u2019d like clarification on next week. Deal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yeah it\u2019s a deal.\u201d Remy shook Jack\u2019s hand first, followed by Chet.</p><p>\u201cThank you. One other thing. Would you be interested in replacing the water heater in Keely\u2019s apartment? I never knew how bad it was until I started staying with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You want us to do it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow us to the building supply store. I\u2019m pretty sure Jeb keeps an extra unit around. You\u2019ve got a truck?\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted. \u201cThink you can fit it in the trunk of your Beemer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Keely\u2019s truck, but the back is filled with electronic equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We\u2019ll pick up the replacement, meetcha at the apartment and help you unload.\u201d Remy lightly punched Keely in the arm. \u201cGot yourself a good one there, K.\u201d</p> <p>When they were out of earshot, Keely mumbled, \u201cSuch suckers for an open wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as they\u2019re gone tonight, we will be having a serious discussion about a few things.\u201d Jack dangled her keys, with the rubber ducky key chain, in front of her scowling face. \u201cGive me back my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you\u2019ve unloaded your shit from my truck.\u201d</p><p>Back at the apartment, Chet and Remy hauled up the bulky boxes, insisting on helping Jack mount the TV after they installed the new water heater. By the time they left it was after eight.</p><p>Jack heard her settle across from him and crack the top on a bottle\u2014on a bottle of beer he\u2019d bought.</p><p>\u201cYou said we had to talk. So talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a second to enjoy my beer before you launch into an argument with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t always argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Keely blew out an impatient breath. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He tried to get comfortable on the lopsided couch as he sipped his beer and gathered his thoughts.</p><p>Better to jump in feet first than to dip a toe in the water, knowing the shark would bite either way. \u201cWhy do you flinch whenever I touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh. I\u2019m not used to you touching me, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo. You need to get used to it.\u201d Jack didn\u2019t break eye contact. \u201cCome over here by me.\u201d</p><p>Her flip, \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m perfectly comfortable here,\u201d annoyed the shit out of him.</p><p>\u201cGet over here. Now. Or I will pick you up and drag you.\u201d Her tiny flare of fear had him backtracking. \u201cJust do it. Please.\u201d</p><p>Keely shrugged and plunked beside him. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Jack set his hand in the middle of her right thigh. She jumped and knocked his hand away. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. I didn\u2019t think. I just reacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means we need to condition you to change your reaction.\u201d</p><p>Skepticism filled her eyes. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve figured out a way to \u2018condition\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis oughta be fun,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, most definitely fun.\u201d He grinned, knew it looked unrepentant and didn\u2019t care. \u201cDon\u2019t trust me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the basis of our problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The basis of our problem is we don\u2019t like each other, Jack. Which makes it hard to have trust.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you tell me about this conditioning method?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather show you.\u201d He gently placed his hand on her face and she flinched. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d she snapped, ducking away.</p><p>Jack removed his hand, waited a beat, then caressed her cheek with the back of his knuckles.</p><p>She flinched again.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Keely, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to hit you. Sit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least if you were hitting me I could hit you back.\u201d</p><p>His hand froze. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I was hitting you than touching you?\u201d</p><p>Keely held her body immobile, which didn\u2019t provide him any more encouragement than her cringing.</p><p>Great. Between Martine dumping him and the incident with Keely\u2014which affected him far more than he\u2019d ever admitted to himself\u2014his sexual ego had taken a serious hit in recent years. Was he doing this all wrong?</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cOkay. Try again.\u201d</p><p>He set his hand on her knee. \u201cMaybe we should start here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? I hardly flinched at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s heartening.\u201d Jack lightly caressed the smooth skin. She didn\u2019t object. This could work if he took baby steps.</p><p>Yeah, if you\u2019re lucky maybe the prickly woman will let you hold her hand tomorrow.</p><p>The sexual cynic inside him laughed that only a hard-up moron became excited by stroking Keely\u2019s cute kneecap.</p><p>Fuck. This was so not him. Waiting. Asking permission. He was large and in charge.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should start with you dousing me with tequila,\u201d Keely muttered.</p><p>Jack scowled. \u201cYou have to get drunk just to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not be contrary for one goddamn second?\u201d</p><p>Keely opened her mouth, probably to fire off, I\u2019m not contrary, but she snapped it shut.</p><p>Ah. Progress. While he waited for her to jumpstart the conversation, he lightly swept his thumb over the top of her knee.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we chat about?\u201d she intoned sweetly.</p><p>\u201cBring me up to speed on your family. You could talk about them all damn night.\u201d</p><p>A small smile. \u201cTrue. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you spend significant time with your nephews since you have an entire closet filled with toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed. Except I have nieces now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has girls?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always counted Kade\u2019s three daughters as my nieces since Kade is like my sixth brother. And Chassie has sweet little baby Sophia, but I\u2019m talking about Cam and Domini\u2019s girls, Oxsana and Liesl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Carter told me they planned to adopt twins. A boy and a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did. Dimitri is Oxsana\u2019s twin brother. When Cam and Domini were at the orphanage in Romania, Liesl, who was five at the time, began following them around, sharing Dimitri and Oxsana\u2019s likes and dislikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiesl spoke English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she learned from watching TV.\u201d</p><p>He playfully bumped her with his shoulder. \u201cSee? TV\u2019s not all bad.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s beautiful, wistful smile appeared again. \u201cAccording to Cam, Domini would\u2019ve brought every kid in the orphanage home, so it\u2019s ironic Cam was the one who pushed to adopt Liesl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jack\u2019s hand inched higher on her leg.</p><p>\u201cCam, being nosy Cam, noticed Liesl limped, but she\u2019d always shuffle away and hide whenever he asked her about it. When he grilled the orphanage caretakers, they told him her leg had been blown off by a land mine when she was two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019d wandered away from her drug-addled parents into a freakin\u2019 minefield. Then they abandoned her into state care. Luckily she got a prosthetic leg, which isn\u2019t always the case, and actually, is out of the norm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFittings are difficult for younger kids because they grow so much. Balance is always an issue. They constantly need new prosthetics and each one is expensive. You can imagine that isn\u2019t a priority in what\u2019s basically a third world orphanage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you know a lot about prosthetics,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI learned tons helping Cam find the right one. Anyway, Cam was heartbroken no one wanted to adopt her due to her handicap. He understands probably better than anyone what it\u2019s like to live with that embarrassment. That fear of being alone.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe fought for her. He wouldn\u2019t leave Romania without her, actually. So Liesl returned to the U.S. with them and the twins. Every day, for like three months after they brought her home, Liesl battled going to sleep at night. She was afraid she\u2019d wake up and find her new life was all a dream.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keely\u2019s voice broke and Jack squeezed her thigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd now...I can\u2019t imagine Liesl not being part of their family.

It\u2019s funny. Cam was always ambivalent about being a parent. So it\u2019s hysterical he\u2019ll probably end up with the most kids out of any of my brothers. That said, God knows all my brother\u2019s wives are in some freaky race to see who can pop out the most McKays. Jesus.</p><p>They\u2019re all pregnant again. It\u2019s an epidemic that makes me want to stay far, far away from their overactive uteruses.\u201d</p><p>He gently stroked her soft skin, watching her closely. \u201cThey\u2019re all pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Channing, AJ and Macie are knocked up. So\u2019s India. And Chassie. And my cousin Quinn\u2019s wife, Libby, is on baby number two. On the West side, Blake\u2019s wife, Willow, is expecting their first. His brother Nick\u2019s wife, Holly, is expecting their second.\u201d</p><p>Jack whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s some seriously scary reproductive mojo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it. That doesn\u2019t include any of my friends. Many are on baby number three. Heck, some of them are already on husband number three.\u201d</p><p>As stealthily as possible, Jack slipped his arm behind Keely on the back of the couch. Her hair was long enough he could twine a silky section around his index finger. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been tempted to take the plunge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my fair share of boyfriends. Some say more than my fair share, but I\u2019ve never seen myself with any of them long term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m flawed. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d derive great joy in detailing all that is wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if your opinion of me bothers me worse than your opinion of yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Keely snorted. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to tell you you\u2019re a beautiful woman, Keely. You didn\u2019t offer a glimpse of your insecurity because you were fishing for compliments.\u201d</p><p>Silence. An unhappy, uncomfortable silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me.\u201d She attempted to squirm away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not teasing you.\u201d Don\u2019t snap at her. \u201cWhy is it so damn hard for you to take a compliment from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never given me one and it\u2019s insincere,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>Jack tugged on her hair until she faced him. \u201cIf you\u2019re challenging my sincerity, then I should at least get a chance to prove it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need proof. We\u2019re pretending to be engaged for Christsake. How much more insincere can it get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might be lying about some things, but this...pull between us is real.\u201d</p><p>Keely shivered. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can demonstrate if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were conditioning me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTake a chance, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I say no you\u2019ll call me a chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll even cluck.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYou are crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s part of my charm.\u201d Jack angled his head until his nose brushed her ear. Goddamn. The woman\u2019s scent was a shot of adrenaline straight to his groin. \u201cClose your eyes, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>She muttered unintelligibly, but she complied.</p><p>Fascinating.</p><p>He dragged his fingers to the top of her thigh where her hand clenched into a fist. He brushed his mouth across the lilac scented skin below her ear. \u201cMy lips are a perfect fit for this spot, right here.\u201d</p><p>She arched into him slightly.</p><p>\u201cI could spend an hour touching you with my mouth and my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo start. Then I\u2019d unbutton your shirt, kissing each section of skin as I bared it. I\u2019d look my fill. I\u2019d taste my fill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s lips skimmed the hollow of her throat. \u201cAnd then whatever you want, Keely, just name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this proving?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m conditioning you to my touch, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is just a game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jack let his heated breath follow the sexy curvature of her jaw. \u201cAnd no. Getting you comfortable with my touch is a means to an end, but the process isn\u2019t a hardship. Not at all.\u201d Hadn\u2019t the woman noticed his cock straining against his zipper?</p><p>Keely\u2019s breath caught when he tugged on her earlobe with his teeth.</p><p>He smiled against her cheek, figuring he\u2019d won her over. \u201cAm I proving myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jarred by her response, he stilled. If he hadn\u2019t persuaded her, then why was her voice unsteady? Why was her breath choppy?</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not the type of man to take it slow or give me a play by play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know me so well?\u201d he murmured with a trace of humor.</p><p>\u201cWell enough to know I prefer the zero to four second response time you have, whether it\u2019s in anger or with lust. That\u2019s honest. This calculated seduction is not.\u201d Keely extracted herself from him and stood.</p><p>She reached for her beer. \u201cMaybe it would be better if we just watched TV.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>That sneaky bastard.</p><p>Keely turned, blocking Jack\u2019s view as she pressed the bottle of beer to her lips and drained it.</p><p>Damn. Her entire body\u2014blood, muscles, tissues, bones\u2014felt as if he\u2019d zapped her with a cattle prod.</p><p>Wobbly knees, dry throat, rapid heartbeat, damp panties, haywire responses from a simple touch? Damn embarrassing. Jack had stroked, whispered and teased until she was mere seconds from mounting him.</p><p>She\u2019d enjoyed plenty of lovers. Men who\u2019d rocked her world in bed. But she\u2019d never experienced such a visceral reaction to a man\u2019s heated touch and the soothing cadence of a deep voice drifting across her skin.</p><p>\u201cKeely? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She jumped. Damn him. She would not be a freakin\u2019 wreck of hormones in her own space. \u201cYou want another beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou having one?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m having two. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take one. Since I bought them.\u201d</p><p>Keely booked it to the kitchen. She took her time uncapping the beer bottles, stalling really. But she needn\u2019t have bothered; Jack was yakking on his cell phone when she returned. She sat across from him, propped her booted feet on the coffee table and studied him.</p><p>Jack Donohue was a total contradiction. Polished, yet rugged. Confident, yet not overtly cocky.</p><p>Professional, yet an air of wildness surrounded him. Down to earth, as well as aloof. Smokin\u2019 hot, yet ice cold.</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>Will the real Jack Donohue please stand up?</p><p>Although Jack wasn\u2019t talking to her, she sensed his intense focus on her, totally on her. She couldn\u2019t drop her guard around him for a single second. Screw the conditioning exercises. She\u2019d never get accustomed to the way Jack made her feel.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to handle it. Because it\u2019s not in my job description, nor is it in my contract. Yes, I\u2019m sure. And for the record, I was against hiring them in the first place. No. This is not an \u2018I told you so\u2019 moment, George. What am I supposed to do about it from here? You\u2019re there, I\u2019m not. Handle it. You\u2019re the GC. No. Because I can\u2019t right now.\u201d</p><p>Jack stopped and stared at her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a cool look. Oh no. The molten look in Jack\u2019s eyes was hot enough to melt cinderblocks. He wanted her. Keely knew if she stayed in this room, he\u2019d have her the second he ended the call. His way.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t do a damn thing to stop him.</p><p>Keely listened to her inner voice advising retreat. Keeping their gazes locked, she saluted with the bottle and backtracked into her bedroom. She leaned against the door and locked it, trying to calm her racing heart.</p><p>But over the rapid lub-dub lub-dub lub-dub, she swore she heard the sound of Jack...clucking.</p><p>The next morning Keely was up and out of the apartment before Jack stopped snoring in the guest bedroom.</p><p>Once again she hadn\u2019t beaten Dr. Joely Monroe into the office. The doc\u2019s door was wide open and a regular old coffeepot\u2014not some fancy-schmancy French-Chinese hybrid\u2014was brimming with fresh, hot, strong coffee. Keely grabbed a cup and plopped across from the doc.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself comfy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Doc. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Monroe\u2019s eyes glommed onto Keely\u2019s left hand. \u201cNice ring. New, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Keely had been freelancing in the clinic as a physical and occupational therapist for more than two years. From the start Doc Monroe had encouraged Keely\u2019s dream to own a physical therapy clinic. She\u2019d offered advice and a recommendation to the Rural Medical Initiative about funding the venture. But Keely didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to the doctor about her personal life.</p><p>Sometimes Keely wondered why she kept her life compartmentalized; she told AJ about her love life, Ramona about her career issues, her brothers and parents the entertaining tidbits, but no one knew all sides of her. How refreshing would it be to just be herself with one person? How bizarre would it be if that person was...Jack?</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s brand spankin\u2019 new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep secrets for a living, McKay. We work together two, three days a week. You couldn\u2019t have given me a hint you were seriously involved with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. He\u2019s from out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>Satan. \u201cJack Donohue. In my own defense, it was sudden. And no, I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Carter\u2019s best friend, so I\u2019ve known him forever. He\u2019s also an architect specializing in restoration and his business is based out of Denver. He\u2019s supervising my building remodel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d The doc blew across her coffee. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been gone so much?</p> <p>Hooking up with him in Denver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially. But the VA consultant fee is three times what you pay me. Can\u2019t blame a girl for making a living.\u201d She offered an impish smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I just hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Jack or with the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. Now that you\u2019ve begun the process of readying a space for a clinic, I\u2019d hate to see you abandon your dream and move to the big city to be some hotshot architect\u2019s wife.\u201d</p> <p>Keely scalded her tongue with coffee to keep from refuting the statement.</p><p>The doc asked, \u201cAre Chet and Remy doing the remodel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust it to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart girl. Maybe I\u2019ll swing by and check out the progress. I\u2019ve been debating whether to remodel my kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never home long enough to eat a meal, let alone cook one.\u201d</p><p>Doc\u2019s gaze fell to her coffee cup. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m seeking changes in my life too. I\u2019m tired of all work and no play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a man to play with, I can hook you up with one of my cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d</p><p>Keely blinked at her. \u201cHow many do you need?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Monroe\u2019s sly smile gave her a younger, playful appearance. \u201cEnough to keep me from getting bored.\u201d She drained her coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s see what torturous schedule Brenda lined up for us today.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, Keely kicked the foot exerciser beneath the bench in the PT room. She glanced at the clock and handed her last client of the day a towel. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next week, Gladys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m feeling better, Keely. I don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. You had a hip replacement. My job is to make sure you\u2019re doing your exercises and not spending all your time watching TV.\u201d</p><p>Gladys looked petulant. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything better to do.\u201d</p> <p>Keely scooted forward on her rolling chair and took Gladys\u2019s hands. \u201cI understand you miss Paul. But letting your health deteriorate... He wouldn\u2019t want that for you. I don\u2019t want that for you. You shouldn\u2019t want that for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes clouded with tears. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not advocating you start kickin\u2019 up your heels at the Golden Boot, but you need to do a physical activity every day. The simple exercises I showed you are enough. Keep a log this week of what you\u2019ve done, how you\u2019ve felt afterward, and we\u2019ll go over it next week, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair. Thanks for not yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh pooh. I\u2019m not exactly a drill sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I keep coming back to you, sweetie.\u201d Gladys rubbed her thumb across Keely\u2019s engagement ring. \u201cThis is new. Pretty and shiny, like new love. What is your young man like?\u201d</p><p>A pain in the ass.</p><p>Not a response poor Gladys would understand since she\u2019d lost her husband of fifty years just last fall.</p><p>\u201cJack? He\u2019s...smart.\u201d</p><p>Gladys harrumphed. \u201cDetails, girlie. What does he look like?\u201d</p><p>Keely rattled off, \u201cTall, dark and handsome doesn\u2019t even begin to describe him. He\u2019s gorgeous, outrageously sexy, with this killer smile and these intense green eyes that just seem to bore into my soul.\u201d</p><p>She froze. Good Lord. Had she really regurgitated that out loud? She actually sounded like a lovesick fool.</p><p>Maybe you are.</p><p>\u201cMen like that are always good between the sheets too.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her gaze to Gladys\u2019s, she said, \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich tells me everything I need to know.\u201d Gladys winked and pushed to her feet.</p><p>Keely followed Gladys into the waiting room. Her PT sessions were \u201copen door policy\u201d meaning family members could pop in and observe the session. Her eyes narrowed on the man lounging outside the therapy room. \u201cJack? What are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d surprise you. Take you out for dinner.\u201d He pressed his mouth to hers while her jaw hung half-open in shock. His lips moved to her ear. \u201cDo you really consider me outrageously sexy, cowgirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d she whispered back. Not that she wanted to revisit the explicit sexual dreams she\u2019d been having damn near every night since Jack had moved in.</p><p>\u201cNow isn\u2019t that sweet,\u201d Gladys said dreamily.</p><p>Sweet as snake oil.</p><p>\u201cSince my intended doesn\u2019t intend to introduce us, I\u2019ll introduce myself.\u201d Jack clasped both Gladys\u2019s hands in his. \u201cJack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladys Johansson. You can call me Gladys. Actually, you can call me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed help out to your car?\u201d Keely asked, trying to sidestep Jack.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetie. You go on and get ready for your young man.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to walk you out while Keely is gussying herself up for me, Miz Gladys.\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Gladys waggled her fingers at Keely. \u201cToodles until next week.\u201d</p><p>When Jack sauntered back in, still smirking, Keely bit her tongue against lashing out at him for his presumptive behavior, not only with her, but also with her client.</p><p>\u201cShe is a sweetheart. Reminds me of a lady back home who used to serve me cookies and lemonade after I mowed her lawn. I always ended up staying and chatting with her for an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That showed her a different side of Jack. Which seemed ironic, since earlier she\u2019d been reflecting on those different, unknown, sides of herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved. Where can we eat around here besides Dewey\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to finer dining establishments than what\u2019s available in the Sundance-Moorcroft metro area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you think so highly of me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf the tasseled loafer fits...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice dig. Only took you thirty seconds. You\u2019re slacking, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>Keely shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m tired. My brain is sluggish. How about pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s bar food at the Rusty Spur and the Golden Boot.\u201d</p><p>Impatiently, he said, \u201cJust ride with me and we\u2019ll find someplace, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll save you time and gas. If you\u2019re hungry there are two options. Dewey\u2019s or the Twin Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t step foot in the place, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. I\u2019ve been banned from Twin Pines. For life. I think.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s too-handsome face registered shock. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to get banned for life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a bar fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started a bar fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I sure as hell didn\u2019t back down from one when someone else did. Stuff got broken. Bottles, tables, noses.\u201d She waved him off. \u201cOld news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me, but disturbing news nonetheless.\u201d Jack scowled. \u201cDewey\u2019s it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you. I have to close up and file my paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Keely considered changing her work clothes, but Jack would think she\u2019d gussied herself up for him, so no dice. In Dewey\u2019s, she spotted him in the far corner booth. He stood, waiting to reseat himself until after she\u2019d sat. Okay. That gentlemanly courtesy was impressive. And sweet. And unexpected.</p><p>Nervous, because this felt like an actual date, she flipped through the menu even when she\u2019d memorized it ages ago. \u201cWhat are you having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken fried steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Been a while since I\u2019ve had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, we\u2019re actually agreeing on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a full moon.\u201d</p><p>His answering bad boy grin had her heart doing the two-step.</p><p>After the waitress took their order, Jack stared at her with unabashed interest. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said testily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know when your birthday is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be around to shower me with expensive presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know some of that stuff about each other before the engagement party.\u201d</p><p>True. Especially in light of suspicions all wasn\u2019t right with said engagement. \u201cMay twenty-third. I\u2019m twenty-seven. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril fourth. I\u2019m thirty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an old timer, eh?\u201d</p><p>A slight scowl. \u201cI\u2019d say experienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Experienced, what other secrets do we need to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with the basic first date stuff. What\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak. Followed closely by bacon. Followed closely by chocolate.\u201d She picked up a straw and rolled it between her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I can guess yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>There was that wicked grin again. \u201cI dare you to try.\u201d</p><p>Keely considered him. \u201cThis is way too easy, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo stun me with your insight, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoached salmon. Wild rice pilaf. Brussel sprouts. Plain cheesecake.\u201d</p><p>A stricken look crossed his face.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI totally nailed you didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Jack angled across the table. \u201cNot. Even. Close. But I am intrigued by the thought of you nailing me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh.

What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr chicken?\u201d she taunted softly.</p> <p>His hot eyes returned to hers. \u201cMy favorite food is not chicken. It\u2019s not a nice juicy rump...roast, although I admit to being more of a butt man than a breast man.\u201d</p><p>Keely blinked. She was quickly losing control of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one more chance to nail me,\u201d Jack said with a sexy rasp.</p><p>\u201cOnly one?\u201d she cooed back.</p><p>Jack\u2019s hungry gaze zeroed in on her mouth. \u201cPlaying fast and loose will only encourage me to play the same. Be certain you\u2019re prepared for what that entails.\u201d</p> <p>Yikes. \u201cSpeaking of favorite foods, I\u2019m betting yours is some kind of wild game that fits with your personality. Boar?\u201d</p><p>His lips lifted. \u201cWrong. This round goes to me. My favorite food is homemade meatloaf. Followed closely by mashed potatoes and gravy. Followed closely by corn on the cob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap. That\u2019s so...Midwestern of you, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Down home cooking appealed to Jack more than haute cuisine? Man. He\u2019d surprised her like four times today. \u201cYour turn to guess. What\u2019s my favorite movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. The Princess Bride.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019s mine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Jerk,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>Jack laughed. A deep, rumbly, sexy sound and she caught herself wanting to smile and sigh at the same time.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass?\u201d she tossed out.</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue Lies, \u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat seems appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>Keely fiddled with the straw, rolling it back and forth in the condensation.</p><p>Jack snatched her hand, stopping the fidgety movement.</p><p>Talk about big hands. Not soft, girly hands either, but rough. Manly. His fingers were long and thick, sprinkled with just enough dark hair to be masculine, not apelike. God. It\u2019d been forever since she\u2019d had a real man\u2019s hands stroking her bare skin. Would Jack be gentle? Teasing? Or forceful?</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>She shifted her gaze up. The curiosity or guilt he saw in her eyes caused a spark of heat to flare in his.</p><p>Jack stretched across the table until their mouths were a kiss apart. \u201cWe\u2019re fucking kidding ourselves that we can keep this platonic for much longer.\u201d</p><p>The growly timbre of his voice destroyed any smartass comment she might\u2019ve conjured. She wanted to hear that growling noise against her throat, in her ear, on her belly, on the insides of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this sweet, you two lovebirds holding hands and whispering naughty nothings to each other.\u201d</p><p>Keely looked up at India with murder in her eyes.</p><p>Jack recovered quickly. \u201cIndia. Nice to see you looking so...round. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me, Donohue. Babies rock but pregnancy sucks.\u201d India cocked her hip against the side of the booth. \u201cSince you\u2019re gonna be part of the family now, I expect my rent won\u2019t go up. Ever. Especially in light of the fact you withheld the information about being our landlord.\u201d</p><p>Jack muttered something about false expectations.</p><p>Now this was better. Watching Jack get raked over the coals for a change.</p><p>\u201cHow are the engagement party preparations going?\u201d</p><p>Talk about a short attention span. \u201cMom is doing everything. Jack\u2019s mother is coming Friday to help.</p><p>We\u2019re staying out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how is it that you guys ended up together?\u201d India asked.</p><p>Keely changed the subject. \u201cYou feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine and fucking dandy. Fat as a frog. You\u2019ve gotten worse at deflection, by the way, so suck it up and answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnancy has made you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaner. Start talking about how this love match came about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re blaming you and Colt.\u201d</p><p>Jack went board stiff across from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did we have to do with it?\u201d India demanded.</p><p>\u201cYour wedding reception was the first time Jack and I acted on our attraction to each other, wasn\u2019t it, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and kissed her hand.</p><p>\u201cOnce we started working together...it was pointless to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was destiny,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cThis sappy crap is making me want to barf,\u201d India said.</p><p>The waitress dropped off their food. \u201cIndia, your order is done. I\u2019ll get it and meet you at the register.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it your night to cook?\u201d Keely asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cOoh, you\u2019re as funny as my husband. I\u2019m starved all the freakin\u2019 time.\u201d She shouted, \u201cHey, Bea, throw in like a dozen cookies too, willya?\u201d</p><p>With that India waddled away.</p><p>\u201cPregnant women are so easily distracted by food.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned at her. \u201cIs there any place we can go in this town without running into one of your relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Keely released his hand and reached for her steak knife, half-resentful, half-glad India had ruined the moment.</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t surprised they finished the meal in near silence. In near record time too.</p><p>He paid the check and Keely headed upstairs to the apartment. The thought of watching her sexy ass shake as those long legs climbed the stairs made his dick hard.</p><p>Damn her relatives. She\u2019d almost admitted she wanted him as much as he wanted her. He was to the fuck it point\u2014he was fucked if he did and fucked if he didn\u2019t fuck her. Might as well grab some smokin\u2019 hot sex while he could get it.</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the living room.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d curled up in her favorite corner of the couch and flipped through the three channels. \u201cWhen is the cable company supposed to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Between eight and noon. Will you be around?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s gaze flicked to him. \u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you gonna be here to take care of it since it was your idea?\u201d</p><p>Jack plopped on the couch. \u201cThings went to shit today and I\u2019m flying to Iowa first thing in the morning to straighten it out. I\u2019ll be back Friday night, Saturday morning at the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Wait a second. Saturday night is our engagement party. You cannot miss that! The whole reason we\u2019re having the stupid party is for people to think we\u2019re getting married. Do you know how humiliating it\u2019ll be if you don\u2019t show up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be. I mean it. So help me God, Jack Donohue, if you aren\u2019t standing beside me wearing a fake-ass smile to rival mine, I will track you down and flay off every bit of your yellow skin with a bullwhip.\u201d</p><p>Her lack of faith in him rankled. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig talk, tough girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sayin\u2019...\u201d She turned away.</p><p>\u201cGive me the damn remote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Keely threw it at him.</p><p>After ten minutes of enduring an insipid sitcom, she spoke. \u201cWhere does jetting off to Iowa leave my project this week?\u201d</p><p>Her petulance wasn\u2019t from the interruption in the restaurant, but a business-related snit? That annoyed him even worse. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if I were here or not at this stage. I\u2019ve stuck around because I was cementing our cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnxious to get back to your fast-paced lifestyle in Denver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, some great lifestyle. I\u2019ve been busy trying to play catch up the last couple years after everything went to hell. Living high on the hog hasn\u2019t been my number one priority.\u201d He looked at her, wondering if he sounded bitter to her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is worse? The fact she left you for him? Or losing the partnership?\u201d</p><p>No one had ever asked that question. \u201cBoth. Everything tumbled like a house of cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your folks meet her?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? Talk about an episode of Green Acres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re embarrassed about bein\u2019 raised on a farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Could we please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Justin wasn\u2019t embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin was a rodeo cowboy and it fed into his persona. I\u2019m an architect and it detracts from mine. Big difference. How many guys did you bring home to meet the parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. But not bringing dates here wasn\u2019t because my rural roots mortified me. Mostly I was embarrassed about the kind of guys I\u2019d been dating.\u201d</p><p>Her honesty shook him to his core and spurred him to follow suit. \u201cLook. My parents didn\u2019t know anything about Martine except I dated her and we broke up. They didn\u2019t know why my partnership with Baxter hit the skids either. None of it mattered because my dad had a fatal heart attack a month later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why Justin dropped out of the PBR tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s taken over running the farm, which is what he and Dad always wanted. None of us expected it\u2019d be so soon.\u201d It infuriated Jack that his dad had worked himself into an early grave. Infuriated and saddened him. \u201cAnyway, Justin keeps an eye on Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever help out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean throwing money at them out of guilt, yes. If you mean sitting in the combine or\u2014\u201d going home to face my past, \u201c\u2014slipping on a pair of coveralls and shoveling manure, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I keep my business and personal lives separate,\u201d he said curtly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she opened her mouth to argue, Jack silenced her with a harsh look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t presume to dissect the way I handle my family life when you handle yours awful damn close to the same way.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s head fell back into the couch cushion. \u201cWe\u2019re never gonna pull this off, Jack. We can\u2019t go five minutes without snipping at each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe managed more than five minutes in the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure luck. Lightning won\u2019t strike the same place twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s force it to strike again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That sounds fun. Not.\u201d</p><p>Just to be obstinate, he scooted closer to her. \u201cYour middle name is West. What\u2019s mine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack... Off Donohue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. My middle name is Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Michael. Kinda sounds like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChas Michael Michaels,\u201d they said simultaneously.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMaybe we do have a few things in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName one thing besides lowbrow movies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe both like Carter\u2019s kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about sports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Keely shrugged. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures. I watched VERSUS when Justin was on the PBR tour, but after he left I stopped. You don\u2019t like football or baseball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. No. Men will watch anything with balls. Which is why I\u2019m surprised about men\u2019s homophobia.\u201d She shot him a sideways glance. \u201cIf you tell me you like men\u2019s wrestling or figure skating I\u2019ll knit you a rainbow sweater, GQ.\u201d</p> <p>Good God, Keely was a pain in the ass. He wanted to kiss that smart mouth so much it bordered on ridiculous.</p><p>Jack draped his arm across the back of the sofa, feeling like a teenage boy attempting to get to second base. Hah. Try again. He hadn\u2019t made it to first base with her.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>No reaction to him invading her space.</p><p>Stubborn woman. If Keely wouldn\u2019t acknowledge him, he\u2019d goad her. \u201cWhat were you about to say in the restaurant before India interrupted us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d she replied flippantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve been told I have a very short attention span.\u201d</p><p>He clucked a couple of times.</p><p>She jabbed his gut with her elbow. \u201cI ain\u2019t skeered a nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Keely debated. Then her words tumbled out in a rush, \u201cWhy you were looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he asked inanely, even when he knew.</p><p>\u201cLike you wanted to devour me. You looked at me like that once before. At Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception. Remember?\u201d</p><p>The memory broadsided him. After his life went to shit in Chicago, he\u2019d hid out at Carter and Macie\u2019s to try and get his head on straight. At Carter\u2019s insistence, he\u2019d tagged along to Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception. He\u2019d ended up doing whiskey shots with Carter, Colby and Cord. Seeing the men\u2019s connections with their wives only increased his sense of displacement, of disillusionment. Of the bone-deep fear he\u2019d never be worthy of that kind of love and devotion, let alone find it. No matter how much he drank, he felt completely sober...until he\u2019d clapped eyes on Keely McKay. Talk about punch drunk. She was breathtaking. When their eyes met, a primal need consumed him.</p><p>Jack had crossed the floor, taken her hand and led her out of the big tent without a single word. He hadn\u2019t cared that she wore high heels. He hadn\u2019t cared she was in a long, formal bridesmaid\u2019s dress. He hadn\u2019t cared about anything but slaking his lust with her sexy, nubile body while gazing into her incredible midnight blue eyes.</p><p>Once they were finally alone, Jack couldn\u2019t voice a coherent thought, so he kissed her.</p><p>It was the single most explosive kiss he\u2019d ever experienced. It literally knocked them both to their knees. They rolled around on the cold ground amidst the dirt, rocks and hay. Every kiss burned hotter.</p><p>Every touch built his pure blinding lust for her higher. Keely\u2019s urgent whispers tickled his ear as her hands worked his belt buckle.</p><p>That\u2019s where the memory blurred. Hell, that\u2019s where it ended completely. Jack woke up alone, hours later, freezing, with his pants unzipped. His stomach hurt\u2014probably she\u2019d socked him in the gut after his untimely fall into drunkenness. His body had picked a bad time to succumb to the whiskey.</p><p>Although they\u2019d never spoken of what hadn\u2019t happened, from that moment on, Keely McKay had hated the sight of him.</p><p>Not that he blamed her. He couldn\u2019t even look at her now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to interpret that look any better now than I did back then,\u201d she said, subtly bringing him back to the present.</p><p>Jack twined his fingers in her hair. \u201cHow long we can continue this pretense we\u2019re not imagining balling each other\u2019s brains out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce bitten, twice shy, Jack. Flirting to cement our \u2018cover\u2019 is one thing. Beyond that...not happening.\u201d</p><p>He gave her credit. Keely didn\u2019t scoot away from his touch to prove her point. \u201cSo if I kissed you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy it, but that\u2019s as far as it\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go directly to the bed twenty feet from here,\u201d he said with a silken purr. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing but time.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes widened with pure comic sarcasm. \u201cOoh. And would you need time to snag your bottle of Viagra?\u201d</p><p>Jack yanked on her hair. \u201cFYI, buttercup, I don\u2019t need any fucking Viagra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She batted at his hold until he released her hair. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been handy three years ago when my hand was on your deflating cock.\u201d</p><p>His humor vanished as his pride emerged. \u201cYou want to know why I lost my erection that night?\u201d</p><p>Jack crowded her until they were nose to nose. \u201cBecause I imagined you fucking my little brother. I realized I didn\u2019t want sloppy seconds.\u201d</p><p>Keely shoved him and scrambled off the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting lie, Mr. Limp Dick. Keep believing it if it serves your self-deluding reputation as a stud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just pegged my bullshit meter to an all time high. It\u2019s called \u2018whiskey dick\u2019 for a reason, Jack- off.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Jesus. Man up. She deserves better.</p><p>As Jack started to apologize, to admit his shame about the incident and plead for another chance, Keely loomed over him, shaking with fury.</p><p>\u201cHave an awesome fucking time in Iowa. But if you pull a no show Saturday night, I\u2019ll track you down and skin you alive\u2014starting with your squishy dick. Not a threat, a promise.\u201d She retreated to her bedroom and slammed the door.</p><p>Not what he\u2019d been angling for tonight. Not at all. And yet, he wasn\u2019t surprised. Turned on, but not surprised.</p><p>Viagra.</p><p>As if.</p><p>Jack adjusted his erection. He considered breaking down her damn door and dropping his pants to prove \u201csquishy\u201d wasn\u2019t in his goddamn realm of existence when in her company.</p><p>Right. Terrific plan. The mouthy cowgirl probably had shotguns under her bed.</p><p>Screw that. Jack wasn\u2019t backing down. However, pushing her tonight smacked of harassment.</p><p>But this was far from over.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>She was going to fucking kill him.</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t here yet.</p><p>His plane had been delayed leaving Des Moines. They\u2019d spoken briefly once and not about the farce they were presenting to their family and friends...in less than an hour.</p><p>\u201cNervous, dear?\u201d</p><p>Keely turned and smiled at Jack\u2019s mother, Dorothy \u201cDoro\u201d Donohue. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been to engagement parties before, but never mine. I tend to get nervous in new situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack does too, if that\u2019s any consolation. But I\u2019m sure you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t a clue the infallible Jack Donohue experienced anxious moments. Who better than his mother to share his foibles? \u201cReally? He\u2019s kept that from me. He\u2019s always so...poised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s gotten over it. We all overcome adversity.\u201d Doro fussed with the strap on Keely\u2019s dress. \u201cMy Jack is a good man. We couldn\u2019t have kept the farm after Marvin died if not for Jack\u2019s financial support.\u201d</p><p>Keely was speechless. Obviously Doro wanted to connect with her, regardless of whether Jack would be livid she\u2019d spilled intimate details of his family\u2019s financial struggles.</p><p>\u201cListen to me blather on. I know I\u2019ve said it a hundred times, but I\u2019m happy he\u2019s settling down with you, Keely. Hopefully he\u2019ll take time to enjoy his life with you. You\u2019ll be good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you call him on his b.s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoro!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Jack is a man who expects to be in charge all the time. He needs a strong woman who\u2019ll stand up to him. You knocking him down a peg or two will keep him grounded and your lives interesting, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Keely smiled. She genuinely adored the plump, sweet widow with the gentle disposition. Pity the only thing Jack inherited from Doro were her green eyes. \u201cThanks for coming to help my mom get ready for this.\u201d</p><p>She waved off Keely\u2019s thanks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a treat to be around your family. Your brothers\u2019 wives certainly are a fertile bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t that the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to draw straws for the ring bearer position.\u201d</p><p>Because she was feeling ornery, Keely said, \u201cI\u2019m hoping the fertility blessing holds true for Jack and me. He wants a pile of kids. Right away.\u201d</p><p>Doro\u2019s entire face lit up. \u201cReally? Well, Jack isn\u2019t exactly a pup, is he? And I would love to have grandbabies to spoil.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe sure and ask Jack about it when you see him.\u201d Keely winked and sauntered off, feeling...guilty.

What do you need?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Her mom led them to a small office down the hallway from the main room. After she closed the door, she sagged against the metal desk.</p><p>\u201cMa? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Carolyn McKay sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. With all the party preparations I haven\u2019t had time to talk to you alone.\u201d She pinned Keely with a probing look. \u201cI\u2019d be lax in my mothering duties if I didn\u2019t ask if you\u2019re sure about marrying Jack.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s stomach clenched. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exactly seem to be a love match, and when you\u2019re together...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom. You haven\u2019t seen us together except the one time we told you we were engaged.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Redirect. \u201cWe\u2019re both busy. He\u2019s been gone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing that worries me. I\u2019m selfish enough to want you to live here with the rest of our family, but I\u2019m enough of a realist to understand that might not be possible with Jack\u2019s job. He\u2019ll be your husband. You\u2019ll need to be with him, wherever that is, and I doubt that\u2019ll be in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>How was Keely supposed to allay her mother\u2019s fears when they were groundless? \u201cMy clinic is here.</p><p>My life is here. My family is here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs much as it pleases me to hear that, promise me you won\u2019t marry Jack if you\u2019re not absolutely sure he\u2019s the right one.\u201d</p><p>Keely frowned. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>Her mother brushed the hair from Keely\u2019s cheek. \u201cBecause contrary to popular opinion in our family, you are not impulsive. This engagement blindsided everyone. I recognize the wild look in your eyes, Keely.</p><p>I wore that same fearful look when I became engaged to your father. Since you were a little girl I\u2019ve worried you\u2019d never find a man who\u2019d measure up to the pedestal you\u2019ve placed your brothers and your father on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Jack measures up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you oughta be asking yourself that question, not me.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded and a second later her dad stuck his head in. \u201cPeople are startin\u2019 to arrive, Caro.</p><p>Who\u2019s on meet and greet detail?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAJ and Channing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any idea where they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hang on, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cSnoopy damn man,\u201d her mother muttered. \u201cLast thing, I promise. Hold out your arm.\u201d A silver bracelet dangled from her fingertips. She wrapped it around Keely\u2019s wrist and fastened it. \u201cMy mother gave this to me when I became engaged to your dad and now I\u2019m passing it on to you.\u201d</p><p>Between each crystal bead was a steel link giving the bracelet a strength that belied the delicate look.</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes swam with tears. Her throat tightened. \u201cOh, Mama, thank you. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you. You\u2019re welcome. I hope it brings you good luck.\u201d She kissed Keely\u2019s forehead. \u201cI love you, girlie. Be happy with Jack. If that means you\u2019ll be living with him in Denver or the Congo, so be it.</p><p>Happiness in your own life is all I\u2019ve ever wanted for you.\u201d Her mother shuffled out.</p><p>Confused by the myriad of emotions, Keely hid in the office for another ten minutes. When she\u2019d stalled long enough, she ventured out. She and Jack entered the main room at the same time.</p><p>Oh. My. Freakin\u2019. God. Talk about being on a pedestal. No, the man was in a class by his handsome self. He wore a black suit that looked casual but the cut and fabric screamed expensive. No tie. He\u2019d left the last button on his pristine white shirt undone, exposing the thick column of his throat. Keely had the uncontrollable urge to run to him, press her lips to the vulnerable spot above his collarbone and taste his skin.</p><p>But Jack didn\u2019t flash her the smile that turned her knees wobbly. He scowled at her. Scowled. At her.</p><p>At her own damn engagement party.</p><p>Jerk.</p><p>Indifferent to their audience, Keely strolled across the room acting like she couldn\u2019t give a crap he\u2019d finally shown up. Which would tick him off.</p><p>Still, his heated eyes never left hers.</p><p>She latched onto his lapels, using them to draw herself to her tiptoes. \u201cPerfect suit for a funeral, GQ.\u201d</p><p>She smashed her mouth to his for a brief, hard kiss.</p><p>Jack\u2019s hands circled her upper arms. He appeared to be hauling her closer, when in actuality, he was pushing her back. \u201cYou determined to piss me off first thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh joy, my life is complete.\u201d She spoke against his throat. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve pulled a no-show, I would\u2019ve tracked you down and castrated you, Jack- off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee if you ever put your hands on my junk again, chopping it off will be the last thing on your mind, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cCocky much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when it\u2019s warranted.\u201d Jack kissed her temple and nuzzled his face against her head. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking push me, Keely, I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. And I so give a flying fuck what kind of bad day you\u2019ve had when I\u2019ve been here alone for the last three goddamn days, fielding questions about our supposed relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake, it wasn\u2019t like I was on vacation. I\u2019ve been in Iowa. In cornfield hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say you got cornholed in Iowa?\u201d</p><p>Jack actually growled.</p><p>She grinned. Keely one; Jack zero.</p><p>Anyone who watched them would see lovers embracing in a private moment. Not the nip Keely placed on his jaw or the answering bite he gave the top of her ear. She sucked in a harsh breath at the sharp pain. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d miss an oozing canker sore.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed and released her. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to track down my mother.\u201d He pivoted on his dress shoe and sauntered to the kitchen.</p><p>Damn frustrating man. She headed the opposite direction even when she wanted to follow him to see what he was up to.</p><p>The second Jack disappeared from Keely\u2019s line of vision he closed his eyes and collapsed against the wall. Pulse racing, cock hard, mouth dry.</p><p>Dammit. That smart-mouthed cowgirl would be the death of him yet. Jesus. Did she have to look so goddamn fantastic? One look at Keely\u2019s sinfully curvy body in that skintight porn-star-meets-country-girl dress, and any objectivity sailed right out of his lust-addled brain. He couldn\u2019t think beyond stopping her insults with his mouth. His lips. His teeth. His tongue.</p><p>Get control for fuck\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cGot a minute, Donohue?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Jack\u2019s eyes opened. How had Cord McKay snuck up on him so fast?</p><p>You were stuck in a fantasy featuring your sexy fianc\u00e9e, a woman who\u2019d rather spit on you than swap spit with you.</p><p>\u201cSure, Cord. Glad you could make it to the party.\u201d</p><p>The man planted himself in front of Jack, arms crossed, menace in his posture. \u201cHere\u2019s where I\u2019m comin\u2019 from. If you do a single damn thing to hurt her, I will gut you.\u201d</p><p>Jack waited, expecting Cord to grin and say, \u201cJust kiddin\u2019, man, welcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>But Cord\u2019s fiery blue eyes, identical to Keely\u2019s, refused to break contact. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cord walked past without another word. But slow enough that Jack glimpsed the knife case attached to Cord\u2019s belt.</p><p>This was going to be one goddamn long night.</p><p>For the next hour, while friends and family mingled, Jack and Keely stayed as far away from each other as possible. No one noticed, and for the first time Jack was grateful for Keely\u2019s large family.</p><p>But he watched her. Constantly. She had a dark-haired, dark-eyed baby girl cocked on her hip as she talked to her cousin Chassie. Two men\u2014Chassie\u2019s husbands\u2014approached, and each kissed Keely\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Trevor plucked the grinning baby girl from Keely\u2019s arms while Edgard rubbed Chassie\u2019s belly and murmured to her. A blond boy streaked through their circle before rejoining the roving gang of kids\u2014which looked to be about twenty strong.</p><p>More family members joined the group and Jack tried to place them all.</p><p>Why? It\u2019s not like it matters if you know their names. This is a charade, remember?</p><p>He listened to two older women speculating on how wild Keely\u2019s bachelorette party would be. He refilled his cup for the third time, wishing someone had spiked the punch.</p><p>The hair on the back of his neck stood up. Jack slowly turned around. Great. McKay number two.</p><p>\u201cColby. Nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>Colby grunted. He looked around and leaned in. \u201cConsider this your one and only warnin\u2019, Donohue.</p><p>You ever hurt her, I\u2019ll gut you.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. \u201cSo noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to be up front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Colby strolled back to his sweet-looking wife and rowdy kids.</p><p>Jack indulged in small talk with a couple of ranchers who\u2019d worked with the McKays for years. But as he listened politely to talk of drought, high feed prices, low returns and government interference, his gaze continually sought Keely out. She laughed and flitted from group to group, the lovely embodiment of a free spirit. Then he noticed her hand was clenched into a tight fist at her side. Was she looking to punch someone? Who?</p><p>You probably. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For some reason, that made Jack smile.</p><p>\u201cSo as long as you\u2019re hidin\u2019 over here, I wanna take the opportunity to tell you if you harm a single hair on Keely\u2019s head, I will gut you.\u201d</p><p>His smile dried up and he looked sideways at Colt McKay.</p> <p>\u201cWe clear on that?\u201d</p><p>Jack knew his attempts to reassure the assorted male McKays that he\u2019d never cause precious Keely distress would backfire when the \u201cengagement\u201d went to hell. He kept his lie simple. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Colt nodded and meandered away.</p><p>Another two hours remained of the party. If Jack stuck to the crowds, maybe he could avoid the oh-so-fun, one-on-one threat time with Keely\u2019s remaining brothers.</p><p>As if she sensed him gawking at her, Keely cocked her head and looked straight at him. Her tight-lipped smile was better than flipping him off, he supposed, but not by much.</p> <p>\u201cFunny how my little sis ain\u2019t wearing the googly-eyed look of a woman wildly in love. She looks like she wants to punch you in the face,\u201d Cam McKay commented behind Jack.</p><p>Fan-fucking-tastic. \u201cYou know Keely. She gets mad first, listens to reason second. She\u2019ll be fine once we\u2019re alone to hash it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat being said... I\u2019m speaking off the record, not as a deputy, but as Keely\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Jack waited.</p><p>\u201cIf you cause her a second\u2019s pain, I will gut you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear.\u201d</p> <p>Cam grunted and shuffled off.</p><p>Imagining his bloody guts dragging in the dirt was getting old. Maybe no one would notice if he snuck out, since most of the attendees were Keely\u2019s family and friends.</p><p>What did that say about him?</p><p>A hand landed hard in the middle of his back and Carter McKay sidled up beside him. \u201cSo you and Keely, huh? Gotta admit, I didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve had it bad for her since the first time I met her at your house when she was jailbait.\u201d</p><p>Carter laughed. Not pleasantly. \u201cGood thing you never told me that before you put a ring on her finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my baby sis. I gotta look out for her and make sure she isn\u2019t hooking up with some scumbag.\u201d</p> <p>Jack bristled. \u201cYou suggesting I\u2019m not good enough for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. If I ever get the barest whisper you\u2019ve hurt her in any way, well, fair warning, I\u2019m gonna gut you, Donohue, old friend or not. Dig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Carter clapped him on the shoulder again. \u201cSmart man. I see the boys are back to sneaking cookies. Gotta bust them.\u201d And Carter was gone.</p><p>Could this day get any more bizarre?</p><p>Another set of footsteps stopped behind him. Jack braced himself for a new \u201cfriendly\u201d warning from another male member of the knife-happy, psycho McKay clan. But his mother\u2019s sweet voice rang out. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely party, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to you, I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Jack hugged her tightly, feeling ridiculous at the boyish need for his mother. He was immediately comforted by her presence, her softness and the familiar scent of her always-present Jean Nate perfume. \u201cSorry I was gone this week when you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, son. For all intents and purposes, I\u2019m retired. I know you\u2019re a busy man. I enjoyed spending time with Keely. Such a ball of fire, that girl. And her family is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they\u2019re a swell bunch when they\u2019re not threatening to gut you.</p><p>His mother picked a piece of lint from his lapel. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled you\u2019re marrying such a perfect woman for you.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze zeroed in on tantalizing Keely, gesturing wildly as she talked to cluster of white-haired women. Young. Old. Male. Female. Didn\u2019t matter. She was always surrounded by people. Keely drew them to her like bees to flowers. Man, she was sweet. And hot. And pissed as hell at him.</p><p>Keely caught him looking again, and not so subtly scratched her cheek with her middle finger.</p><p>His dick stirred and he grinned at her.</p><p>Yeah, he had it bad that it turned him on when she flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cI see you watching her all the time.\u201d</p><p>Guiltily, he returned attention to his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s my intended. Naturally I\u2019m looking at her. Do you find that odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I find it sweet. You don\u2019t show that side of yourself often these days and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re sharing it with her.\u201d</p><p>Before Jack formulated a response, his mother added, \u201cBut I am surprised you are insistent about starting a family right away.\u201d Her gaze drifted to the band of McKay offspring running amok through the crowd.</p><p>His eyes zoomed to hers. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Keely share that tidbit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier today. She said you weren\u2019t getting any younger and she didn\u2019t want people mistaking you for your kid\u2019s grandfather at school events.\u201d</p><p>What a troublemaker. That little snot-nosed cowgirl had earned serious payback.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that mind your own business scowl, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Ah hell, now he\u2019d hurt her feelings. He was batting a thousand today. \u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to speak out of turn. And I understand how much you value your privacy. But to be honest, I can\u2019t wait for grandchildren to spoil. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning on getting a lot of baby-making practice in. Soon.\u201d Jack grinned when his mother gasped and whapped him on the arm.</p><p>His brother inserted himself into the conversation. \u201cWell, ain\u2019t this just great? Us all together celebrating how my big brother stole my girl away for himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin David Donohue. What a horrible thing to say to your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Jack wanted, no, he encouraged me to break up with Keely so he could have her. Tricky, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it. That was years ago. Whatever happened between you two\u2014\u201d he warned Justin not to put Keely in a bad light in front of their mother, \u201c\u2014is over and done with. Keely and I crossed paths long before you entered the picture, so technically, she was mine first.\u201d</p><p>Justin belligerently folded his arms over his chest. \u201cYou must\u2019ve worked some serious magic on her because Keely hated you, Jack. She called you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery name in the book, I know. We laugh about it now, actually. Sometimes Keely even uses it as a term of endearment.\u201d He smiled and gave his mother a one-armed hug. \u201cSpeaking of...I need to have a word with my soon-to-be blushing bride.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt Justin\u2019s glare singeing his hair as he wandered toward Keely surrounded by her friends. Too bad, bro. You fucked up. She\u2019s mine now. He hovered on the outskirts of the circle, waiting for his beloved to acknowledge him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>So Jack set his chin on her shoulder and palmed her hips, trying not to be distracted by that damned lilac scent. \u201cHey, baby.\u201d</p><p>Keely immediately stiffened up.</p><p>Everyone in the group noticed. He half-chided, \u201cRelax. I won\u2019t tickle you in front of your friends.\u201d He dropped his voice. \u201cAll my favorite ticklish spots are strictly between us.\u201d</p><p>Muffled laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, can you all excuse us? I need to steal her away for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Murmured assent followed. And miracle of miracles, Keely didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Jack clasped her hand and towed her behind him.</p><p>Halfway down the empty hallway, Keely jerked out of his hold. She put her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so all-fired important you had to drag me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere in the hell do you get off telling my mother, for Christsake, that we\u2019re going to start a family\u2014a big family\u2014right after the wedding bells stop pealing?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curled in an impish smile. \u201cI was cementing our cover, Jack. I thought you\u2019d be happy.\u201d</p><p>He got right in her face. \u201cNothing about this situation is making me happy, Keely. Especially not every goddamn one of your brothers threatening to gut me\u2014 gut me! \u2014like some redneck code of vengeance if I do anything to hurt poor little ol\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better make me happy, huh?\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>Jack crowded her against the wall, bracing his hands on either side of her head. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to say? I have no control over my brothers.\u201d Keely drilled him in the chest with her index finger. \u201cAnd speaking of... Since when does your brother get to act all, \u2018You\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me, baby\u2019, when that stupid asshole dumped me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know. I have no control over my brother either.\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other.</p><p>\u201cIf you have nothing else to chew my ass about, let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance, buttercup.\u201d He searched her eyes. No teasing warmth. Just cool appraisal. \u201cWhy are you being like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Business-like? Isn\u2019t that how you wanted it between us in private? You turn the charm on and off with me whenever it suits you. Why can\u2019t I do the same to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause even though this engagement is fake, you\u2019re not, Keely. I don\u2019t want you to become like me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot daggers at him. \u201cGod, you piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did I say?\u201d Hell, he thought what he\u2019d said made sense. He\u2019d been honest with her for a change.</p><p>\u201cJust when I want to punch you in the kidney for bein\u2019 a total jackass, you show me a part of you that ain\u2019t half-bad.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s heart sped up. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat part. The real, sweet, sincere side of you. You didn\u2019t toss off a sexual comment like \u2018I\u2019ll show you the best part of me, baby\u2019. You act as if this is more than us cementing our cover. You act like you care about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do care about you, Keely. More than I should.\u201d Jack brushed a damp tendril of her glossy hair behind her ear, letting his finger trace her perfect, beautifully shaped jawline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With his every inhalation, Keely\u2019s scent teased him. Warm. Flowery. Womanly. He leaned closer, drawing in a deeper breath. When their gazes clashed and Jack saw raw desire swimming in the amazing blueness of her eyes, he stopped fighting the inevitable. He framed her face in his shaking hands and said,</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d before he smothered her mouth with a blistering kiss.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>She was kissing Jack Donohue. Kissing him like crazy. Kissing him like she\u2019d fantasized about after he\u2019d kissed her so thoroughly at Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception.</p><p>It was so much better when they were both sober.</p><p>Keely slid her hands beneath his suit coat up his muscular back. Oh man. Such a hard-toned body.</p><p>Such an insistent mouth. The hint of cologne on his heated skin wafted up from his open-collar shirt.</p><p>Drugged. She felt utterly drugged by his masculine scent and the sheer power of his body pressed to hers.</p><p>Jack wouldn\u2019t let their lips part for more than a second before he dove back in for another mind-blowing kiss. His tongue was hot velvet and smooth as whiskey as it glided and stroked and teased. He seduced her, reduced her to a trembling mass of need with just the power of his avid mouth.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus, Keely,\u201d he muttered against her lips. \u201cI want you so fucking bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her chin. \u201cSteamy, raunchy sex is a more productive outlet for our frustrations than flinging insults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she moaned when his lips slowly feathered down her throat, hitting every sensitive spot with unerring accuracy.</p><p>Jack sucked the tender slope between her shoulder and her collarbone, letting his breath fan the damp spots as his tongue licked to the other side.</p><p>The gentle sweep of his thumb in front of her ear as his firm lips and sharp teeth assaulted her neck caused her whole body to quiver with unbridled lust.</p><p>\u201cI want to hike up your skirt and fuck you right now against this wall. Raw.\u201d His mouth brushed the shell of her ear. \u201cHard.\u201d He blew oh so softly. \u201cFast.\u201d</p><p>Her sex moistened and clenched with want.</p><p>Then she and Jack were face to face. His wild eyes didn\u2019t fit his matter-of-fact tone. \u201cSay you\u2019ll let me do every dirty thing to you I\u2019ve ever fantasized about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve imagined having sex with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he admitted. His rough whisper launched another blissful shiver through her. \u201cSince you were barely sixteen.\u201d</p><p>Keely blinked at him, trying desperately to believe his incredibly sweet bullshit. \u201cStrange way of showing it, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know you would\u2019ve lorded it over me. I fought it. No more.\u201d He pressed his pelvis into the cradle of her hips, letting his cock rub her belly button. \u201cSay yes.\u201d</p> <p>As if she could possibly say no. Keely raked her fingers down his back, wishing her fingernails were leaving scratches from his shoulders to his tight ass. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s never-ending kisses morphed from brutal to sweet. Passion tempered with unexpected tenderness. Her head was buzzing. Her blood was humming. Her body was doing the boot scootin\u2019 boogie.</p><p>The kiss waxed and waned, burned and soothed, so she almost didn\u2019t hear the giggles. When the noise finally registered, louder, Keely managed to break her lips free.</p><p>\u201cJack. We have an audience.\u201d She peered over Jack\u2019s broad shoulder. Her nephews and nieces were gawking at them.</p><p>When she attempted to extricate herself, his possessive embrace increased. \u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll tattle to everyone.\u201d Keely caught the eye of Kyler, the self-appointed ringleader. \u201cKeep this to yourself, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kyler\u2019s enormous grin revealed two empty spots where his front teeth had been. \u201cNo way.\u201d He raced down the hall in front of his entourage. In the main room, he shouted, \u201cHey, guess what?\u201d The crowd quieted. \u201cAunt Keely and Jack are kissin\u2019 in the hallway!\u201d</p><p>Laughter broke out.</p><p>Kyler snatched his moment in the spotlight as his due. \u201cAnd they were kissin\u2019 so much they didn\u2019t even notice us. We waited, but it didn\u2019t seem like they were ever gonna stop. They were kissin\u2019 forever.\u201d</p><p>Keely groaned. Her forehead fell to Jack\u2019s chest. \u201cSee? Now everyone knows we were sucking face.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed her crown. Twice. \u201cAnd we\u2019da gotten away with it too if wasn\u2019t for them meddlin\u2019 kids.\u201d</p><p>She snickered and looked up at him. \u201cI never would\u2019ve pegged you as a Scooby Doo fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Scooby Doo boxers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you full of surprises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea of the surprises I have in store for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on.\u201d</p><p>He made a low, sexy noise in his throat and his eyes flashed heat.</p><p>\u201cBut first, we oughta face the curious crowd, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Jack stepped back. He kissed her knuckles, and gestured for her to go first. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, bucko. Together in a united front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as this party is over, I\u2019m hauling your ass back to the apartment to celebrate our engagement.\u201d His insistent voice tickled her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about chickening out on me, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so ready for you to prove you\u2019re cock of the walk, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Catcalls and wolf whistles greeted them as they crossed the threshold. Someone shouted, \u201cSpeech!\u201d</p><p>Someone else shouted, \u201cToast!\u201d Yet another person shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s see another kiss!\u201d</p><p>Jack sensed her unease and murmured, \u201cTrust me to handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cTough. There\u2019s no way to get out of it now, and I don\u2019t want you slipping up and calling me Jack-off in a fit of pique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Just...don\u2019t embarrass me on purpose or anything, okay? I hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He blocked her from the crowd\u2019s view. He held her chin and peered into her eyes. \u201cKeely. I\u2019d never do that.\u201d Jack\u2019s mouth brushed hers in a kiss so sweet and earnest her fears vanished.</p><p>More catcalls.</p><p>Jack led her to the front of the room behind the cake table. Keely kept her gaze focused on Jack\u2019s striking profile.</p><p>\u201cThanks to everyone for coming today. And Kyler, buddy, you\u2019ve got incredibly bad timing.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I\u2019ve been gone all week, and I was extremely late getting here today, which didn\u2019t please my intended at all. And she shared that displeasure with me. Several times. Loudly.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>Her stomach roiled. Damn him. He\u2019d sworn he wouldn\u2019t embarrass her.</p><p>Give him a chance. Trust him like he asked you to.</p><p>Keely inhaled and let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhich comes as no surprise to most of you. Keely and I haven\u2019t exactly been... What\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivil?\u201d she supplied.</p><p>Another round of guffaws.</p><p>\u201cYes, we haven\u2019t exactly been civil to each other over the years. So we were more shocked than anyone when our feelings for each other changed in such a short amount of time. But the fact of the matter is, I\u2019m absolutely crazy about her, and she feels the same about me.\u201d Jack\u2019s questioning gaze hooked hers.</p><p>She blew him a kiss. \u201cKeep going, Jack darlin\u2019, you\u2019re startin\u2019 to get back in my good graces.\u201d</p><p>Muted laughter.</p><p>\u201cI speak for both of us when I say we\u2019re happy to be here amidst our families and friends, celebrating what we both wanted but never thought we\u2019d find. Thank you.\u201d He brought Keely\u2019s left hand to his mouth and kissed her engagement ring.</p><p>She laid her palm on his cheek; her fingers traced the hollow beneath his cheekbone. She would\u2019ve been content with that little PDA. But Jack wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He curled his hand around her neck and yanked her forward for a prolonged kiss that damn near melted her fillings.</p><p>While she basked in the moment, pressed against Jack\u2019s body, his mouth controlling hers with possessive kisses, and clapping surrounding them, Keely almost wished this engagement was the real deal.</p><p>The photographer snapped a billion pictures. Keely\u2019s face hurt from smiling. Her feet hurt from wearing heels. And somehow through it all, Jack found a way to keep her laughing, as well as lacing every sentence with sexual innuendo.</p><p>It was enthralling. It was scary as hell because there was no going back now. They\u2019d be lovers before the end of the night, guaranteed.</p><p>After the party ended, Keely shooed Jack away to spend time with his family while she helped clean up the party remnants.</p><p>\u201cI have to say, Jack\u2019s little speech completely changed my mind, K.\u201d</p><p>Keely folded a pale lavender satin tablecloth. \u201cChanged it about what, AJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how you and Jack feel about each other. It was very romantic. Funny. Sweet without being silly.\u201d AJ snatched the tablecloth, stacked it with the others. \u201cBut I\u2019ll confess\u2014the biggest convincer? You two making out when you weren\u2019t aware anyone was watching.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cOmigod. How many people saw that?\u201d</p><p>AJ shrugged. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all thought it was.\u201d She sighed. \u201cReminds me of when me and Cord first hooked up. Man. We could not keep our hands off each other.\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted and pointed to AJ\u2019s distended belly. \u201cYou still can\u2019t keep your hands off each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. It\u2019s great to be me.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>Carolyn bustled in with a cardboard box. \u201cOkay. The kitchen is cleaned and this is the last of my stuff to take home.\u201d</p><p>Since her mom\u2019s hands were full, Keely hugged her from behind. \u201cThanks for everything. You rocked it, Ma. It was a fantastic party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, yet I\u2019m glad we\u2019re only doin\u2019 this once.\u201d Carolyn yawned. \u201cLord, I\u2019d better get home before I fall asleep standing up. AJ, darlin\u2019, you need a ride?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah. I have my truck since Cord took the boys home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. See you.\u201d Carolyn hefted the box and disappeared out the side door.</p><p>At AJ\u2019s 350 Cummins turbo diesel Chevy, Keely said, \u201cNeed a boost getting into your monster truck, el preggo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But you can bet your butt I\u2019ll let my handsome hubby give me a hand to help me down.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Cord, that hand would go straight up his wife\u2019s skirt. Those two still acted like randy teens.</p><p>Keely admitted a tinge of jealousy her best friend had found the type of love all women dream of.</p><p>She meandered to her own rig, anxious about going home, which was a total crock because chances were slim Jack would even be there yet.</p><p>Still...how would this play out? Scenarios flitted through her brain but nothing solidified. Maybe having a blank slate wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.</p> <p>Trudging up the stairs, she knew she\u2019d ditch her high heels first thing. People thought pointy-toed cowboy boots were painful? Please. Boots were bedroom slippers compared to these torturous devices.</p><p>Keely had just locked the door behind her and tossed her purse on the side table when she heard him speak.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to wonder if you\u2019d chickened out.\u201d</p><p>His deep, slightly amused voice triggered tingles of anticipation. \u201cNo. My mom did all the party prep work. I couldn\u2019t leave her there to handle the cleanup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p> <p>She focused on him, slouched in a straight back kitchen chair. The glow of the backlighting gave Jack an attractively dangerous look. Barefoot, with his pristine shirt unbuttoned; his sleeves were rolled up, exposing his thick forearms lightly dusted with dark hair. Clutching a glass of amber liquid in his hand, he reminded her of James Bond\u2014a gorgeous professional male, but ruggedly raw and masculine beneath the polished exterior. His face was shadowed, masking his emotions. But the aura surrounding him wasn\u2019t the cool and collected demeanor of a patient man. No, the air crackled with the energy of an animal ready to pounce.</p><p>Right then, Keely knew she was way out of her league with Jack Donohue. He\u2019d push her. Control her. Force her to experience levels of need and desire she\u2019d never fathomed.</p><p>Jack tipped the glass and sipped, studying her from his spot in the center of the room. She waited. It damn near killed her to wait, but she did it.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, are you scared of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you think I\u2019ve been drinking?\u201d He waggled the glass. \u201cIced tea, not whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d she said inanely.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I scary to you, Keely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve been avoiding getting tangled up for a reason, and here we are, about to get seriously entangled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d he asked nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cMy reason? Or what I think yours is?\u201d</p><p>His white teeth glimmered in the darkness when he smiled. \u201cYour reason first. And I expect nothing less than complete honesty from you, buttercup. Especially when you enlighten me with what you perceive as my reason.\u201d</p><p>Keely squeezed her hands into fists and counted to ten. Twenty. Thirty. Forty. Fifty. Sixty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d he said huskily, when she\u2019d hit the one hundred-twenty mark.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the God honest truth. I\u2019ve avoided getting tangled up with you because I\u2019ll give in to you, Jack. I\u2019ll give you everything you demand from me in bed, every part of myself I\u2019ve never shared with another man. I\u2019m a strong-willed woman. I\u2019m used to calling the shots with men. But when I look at you, I have the overwhelming need to...surrender. I\u2019ve felt the sexual heat shimmering between us since I was sixteen and I had no clue what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid it\u2019s more than just sex?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. If she didn\u2019t speak, technically, she wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see as my motivation?\u201d he asked, his voice barely a throaty rumble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got something to prove. To me. To yourself. Because of what happened three years ago.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed softly. \u201cHow insightful you are, cowgirl. It\u2019s a little scary.\u201d He took another drink. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason. When I saw you today? In that pretty dress that showed off every goddamn curve I\u2019ve been trying like hell not to notice for the last eleven years? My dick got so hard it freakin\u2019 hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse spiked.</p><p>\u201cDuring the party, all I could think about was peeling the silky fabric down your body. Taking my time to enjoy every inch of your warm, beautiful skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I want to rip the fucking thing off and gorge myself on you.\u201d</p><p>Keely took three steps closer to read his eyes. Oh damn. Heat and passion and hunger. For her. \u201cSo do it.\u201d</p><p>Jack was on her before she inhaled another breath. His hands tearing at the zipper on her dress. His mouth devouring hers with hot, wet, sucking kisses. They fumbled with buttons and snaps in their frenzy to get naked.</p><p>And it was still too slow.</p><p>Her dress fell to the floor, leaving her in an itsy bitsy black thong and matching demi-bra. Keely jerked his shirt down his arms and ran her hands all over his chest. Firm muscles covered with just the perfect amount of dark hair. God. He was amazing. When she hit the waistband of his suit pants, she groaned disapproval that he still wore the damn things. She tried to unhook his belt. Repeatedly.</p><p>Jack broke the kiss. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you have a condom.\u201d</p><p>He reached in his front pocket and handed her one. Keely ripped it open with her teeth. When his pants pooled around his ankles, followed by his briefs, she zeroed in on his cock.</p><p>Holy shit. She didn\u2019t remember it being that big. Keely dropped to her knees. She placed the condom in her mouth, circled her hand around the base of his thick cock and rolled it down the length.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ, Keely. Warn a guy next time.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her onto her back on the carpet. Then he joined her on the floor. He hung on all fours above her, pure male animal, his knees bracketing her hips. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. Lose the panties.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she shimmied the stretchy lace off.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes never left hers as he moved between her thighs. He levered himself over her, matching them groin-to-groin. Lining up his cock, he shoved himself into her in one hard thrust.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ, Jack. Warn a girl next time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. He was still smiling as he kissed her. And kissed her until she could barely remember how her mouth felt without his all over hers.</p><p>The heat from his body sent prickles of pleasure dancing across her skin. The ends of his hair tickled her neck as he kissed her. Her entire being was primed to blow sky high and Jack wasn\u2019t moving. At all.</p><p>Keely traced the sides of his torso, circling around to squeeze his buttocks, hoping to urge him on.</p><p>He lifted his head and stared into her eyes. \u201cPut your hands above your head and keep your legs right where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>She arched, forcing her lace-covered breasts against his hot chest as she slowly swept her arms up.</p><p>Jack threaded their fingers together, pressing their joined hands into the carpet and let his full weight rest on her.</p><p>Oh man, that felt good. Really, really good.</p><p>Then he began to move. A shallow stroke followed by a deep thrust. He studied her face, gauging whether he was pleasing her.</p><p>Boy-howdy he was definitely pleasing her.</p><p>His hips picked up speed. She marveled at the sheer strength of his body yet the tight control he maintained over it.</p><p>The continual friction of his pelvis rubbing over hers made her clitoris throb. Made her moan. Why wouldn\u2019t he intensify the friction and send her screaming to that elusive point of ecstasy? Whenever she attempted to arch her lower body to increase the contact, he wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cJack. Please.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his face to hers. \u201cNo.\u201d He kissed her again, in the deceptively lazy way she was beginning to crave. His mouth seduced. His body controlled.</p><p>Keely thought she\u2019d lose her mind. The scrape of the carpet on her backside. The damp heat of Jack on her front side. The coiling sensation inside her womb as he rocked into her. The single-minded way Jack kissed her, as if sex was just a byproduct of those deliciously addicting kisses.</p><p>After she relaxed into him, giving him the control he\u2019d demanded, he tensed and fucked her harder.</p><p>Faster. Deeper.</p><p>Her midsection tightened. Keely arched hard. This time, Jack let her grind against him. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.</p><p>I\u2019m so close. Like that...yes!\u201d</p><p>The pulsing, throbbing, mind-scrambling orgasmic goodness increased exponentially when Jack sucked on her neck. He zeroed in on the magical spot that brought forth her nearly rapturous moan, which would be embarrassing if it weren\u2019t so amazing he\u2019d immediately discovered the secret spot that always set her off.</p><p>Jack slowed his strokes as he came in a drawn-out grunt. His cock pulsed inside her and her vaginal muscles automatically clamped down to prolong his orgasm.</p><p>After she\u2019d regained her bearings, Keely blinked at him. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>He murmured, \u201cWelcome back, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I wanna come back. That was a damn spectacular place to be.\u201d</p><p>Jack gifted her with a cocky smile and released her hands, but didn\u2019t move off her. She touched his face, tracing the start of his hairline. The twin slashes of his dark eyebrows. His nose. His cheekbones. That strong sexy jawline.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I wanted to punch this fine-looking mug earlier today.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t just haul off and do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I do have some impulse control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. I was hoping to see you lose all control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keely feathered her thumb across his well-kissed lips. \u201cIf anyone can make me lose total control, it\u2019s you, Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>Jack caressed and kissed her until she sighed pure contentment. \u201cSo no regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the rockin\u2019 sex? Hell no.\u201d</p><p>His left eyebrow quirked. \u201cRegrets about something else?\u201d</p><p>Yes. That this is temporary and you\u2019ll probably shatter my heart into a billion pieces when this charade is over.</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Keep it light. \u201cThe answer will have greater...benefits if you can guess what I regret.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened at her challenge. \u201cYou regret bending over a haybale in Daisy Duke short shorts at age sixteen and teasing me with a glimpse of your sweet ass cheeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I did that because you were lookin\u2019 for a cheap thrill and I am an accommodating girl. Try again.\u201d</p><p>He nipped the tip of her nose. \u201cSmartass. You regret dating my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Dating him forced me to acknowledge what I didn\u2019t want in a long-term relationship. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets about the threesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>Jack half-snarled, \u201cYou\u2019ve had more than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like hearing that jealous growling sound. Damn, Jack. That is sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou teasing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I figure what goes around, comes around. You did your share of teasing me. Like when I stayed at your folks\u2019 house over Christmas break? You never put on more than a skimpy towel after you showered. You wanted me to salivate over this hunkalicious body.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. But you did try to torpedo my relationship with Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for any reason beyond he would\u2019ve been miserable married to you.\u201d</p> <p>Ooh. That stung. Just when things were going so well. Keely turned her face away.</p><p>Jack wrapped his fingers around her jaw, forcing her to meet his gaze. \u201cLet me clarify before you jump to conclusions. Justin would\u2019ve been miserable because you\u2019re too much woman for him to handle.</p><p>Don\u2019t deny you would\u2019ve run roughshod over him. You\u2019d be bored with a man you had total control over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She poked him in the chest. \u201cWe\u2019re getting off the topic here. You were supposed to be trying to guess what I regret.\u201d</p><p>An unholy gleam lit Jack\u2019s face. \u201cYou regret not blowing me first thing tonight. You\u2019re in luck. I\u2019m more than ready to let you make it up to me now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to blow you when your dick is still inside me.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed her impudent mouth. \u201cBe right back.\u201d He eased out and pushed to his feet, feeling her eyes roving over his backside as he strolled to the bathroom.</p><p>He tossed the condom in the trash and washed his hands. Beneath his primal satisfaction was a hint of guilt. As long as he\u2019d fantasized about Keely McKay, nailing her on the floor wasn\u2019t his most suave moment.</p><p>Two knocks on the door. \u201cJack? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You impatient to get my cock in your mouth?</p><p>Crude, Donohue.</p><p>Keely pushed open the door. Her curvy frame was perfectly framed by the doorjamb. His eyes scanned her head to toe. She still wore those peep-toe fuck me pumps that belonged on a nineteen forties pinup model. Not that any model had anything on his naked cowgirl.</p><p>\u201cOoh, I\u2019m intrigued by that bad boy grin you\u2019re sportin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all for you.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s gaze dropped to his erection and zoomed back up to his eyes. \u201cBefore I get to that, I need your help taking my shoes off. I lose my balance when I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to do it in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My bedroom.\u201d She turned, flaunting her tight, round, perfect little ass. Talk about losing his balance. Jack almost tripped over his goddamn tongue. He grabbed four condoms from his shaving kit and followed her.</p><p>Her room was completely dark, except for a dim lamp on the dresser. Jack flipped the light switch, flooding the room with light.</p><p>\u201cSo much for mood lighting,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut better for me to see all of you. Bend over, put your palms flat on the mattress and spread your legs shoulder width apart.\u201d</p><p>When it appeared Keely might argue, he merely raised his eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>She obeyed.</p><p>Jack moved in behind her, setting his hands on her hips. He traced the contours of that marvelous ass, making a couple thorough passes over the same sensitive section of skin just to see her tremble. His hands followed the line of her thighs until he fell to his knees between her feet.</p><p>Using a rough-tipped finger, Jack teased the swell of her butt cheeks past the ticklish crease of her knee, down her muscled calf to the barrier of her shoe. Then he repeated the method on the other side. As he tantalized her inner thighs with butterfly-soft touches, he caught a whiff of her sex, softening, moistening for him. His eager, demanding cock slapped his belly.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d He had no intention of letting her off easy. He replicated his effort on her legs with his hot, wet tongue.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were helping with my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Jack of all trades.\u201d</p><p>Keely groaned.</p><p>Jack circled his hand around her left ankle. \u201cLift up.\u201d</p><p>She shifted. He tugged on the spike heel and the shoe popped off her foot. He kissed her anklebone and her instep before gently replacing her foot on the floor. She wiggled her toes into the carpet and sighed.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Other side.\u201d Her right foot received the same meticulous treatment.</p><p>\u201cMy feet thank you.\u201d Keely looked at him curiously when he remained kneeling on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit on the bed facing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Keely bounced she hit the mattress so fast. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be demanding and controlling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, here you are.\u201d Jack placed his mouth on the inside curve of her knee. He feathered kisses up, listening to the choppy sound of her breathing. The closer his marauding mouth moved to her pussy, the more her leg muscles quivered beneath his lips. He inhaled the aroma of her lilac-scented lotion mixed with the musky perfume of her sex.</p><p>Her eyes were dark with lust as she peeked from beneath lowered lashes. Her upper teeth sank into her kiss-swollen bottom lip. An effort to keep from crying out? Pointless. He\u2019d take great pains and great pride in making Keely come undone.</p><p>Jack curled his hands around her hips and brought her body forward to his liking, ignoring her surprised gasp. He slipped his hands under her butt and bent to lick her glistening sex. He didn\u2019t bother holding back his primal groan as he tasted her for the first time.</p><p>He could\u2019ve drawn out his oral worship, built Keely to climax slowly, but Jack was crazy to feel her explode on his tongue. After pressing kisses on her closely shorn mound, he followed the cleft down to the mouth of her pussy and wiggled his tongue inside.</p><p>\u201cOh. Damn. That\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>Jack withdrew and did it again. And again. He zigzagged his tongue up that gratifyingly wet slit, stopping to suckle her pussy lips, while his tongue probed her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>He started working her sweet little clit. Alternating sucking with tickling flicks of his tongue and firm-lipped bites. When Keely\u2019s hands landed on his head, he latched onto that pulsing nub and sucked until she screamed.</p><p>After the throbbing slowed, her hands fell away. She flopped onto the mattress with a heavy, sated sigh. \u201cCan I just say...holy fucking shit. That was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhenomenal? Astounding?\u201d he supplied.</p><p>She rested on her elbows and looked at him. \u201cNot what I expected. I thought I was giving you head.</p><p>Not that I\u2019m complaining or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jack pushed to his feet. Her avid gaze devoured his cock as he rolled the condom on. He dipped his tongue into her navel and blew across the wet spot. \u201cRoll over.\u201d</p><p>Keely flipped to her stomach. That sexy squeaking noise escaped when he yanked her hips to the edge of the bed. Her toes barely touched the floor.</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself for a hard, fast ride, cowgirl.\u201d Jack arranged his cock, lifted her ass so he could watch his dick disappear into her soft hot, pink flesh.</p><p>The mattress moved as Keely wiggled and widened the space between her thighs. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe visual is better for me too,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFucking hot as hell, Keely.\u201d He gripped the middle of her thighs and thrust deep.</p><p>\u201cYes. As hard as you want, you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>A snarl-like noise rumbled out and he slammed into her wet heat. Each slap of his hips brought forth her soft groan of approval. Keely fisted her hands into the comforter, keeping herself in place as his cock tunneled in and out at warp speed.</p><p>Sweat coated his face, dampened his hair, trickled down his chest and the crack of his ass. His toes curled into the carpet in anticipation, but he didn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Keely emitted a keening moan, shooting her hips back with more force. Caught within her vise-like pussy muscles, Jack had no prayer of holding back. His sac tightened, his cock swelled as it tried to break out of the latex. He came right along with her, a grunting, sweating maniac consumed with experiencing every hot pulse of bliss as his balls emptied.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Yes.\u201d</p><p>His strokes didn\u2019t slow even after the head rush faded. Jack kept fucking her, prolonging both their orgasms. Even in the aftermath of his release, his pelvis snapped eagerly, almost of its own accord.</p><p>Keely sagged face first into the mattress, mumbling.</p><p>What a way to end a long dry spell. Jack trailed kisses up her spine, tasting her sweat and pulled out.</p><p>She emitted a sleepy sound. By the time he\u2019d returned from the bathroom, she\u2019d rolled to her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze tracked her beautiful, moist, naked flesh. Pity he\u2019d only kissed her mouth and between her legs. He crawled up her body, stopping to tongue her rosy nipples.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d get around to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question.\u201d Jack propped himself on his elbow beside her. \u201cDo I indulge in every sexual scenario tonight because it\u2019s a one-time only offer?\u201d</p><p>Keely mirrored his position. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all. Not even close.\u201d His hand shook as he swept the damp tendrils from her neck. \u201cIs it what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all. Not even close,\u201d she mimicked.</p><p>Smiling, Jack stroked her hair, twining the dark strands around his index finger. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask what I want, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to. I see it in your eyes, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t have a clue what he expected from her. \u201cI want all of you as long as we\u2019re pretending we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of me, meaning...just sexually?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning I\u2019ll be in your bed every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m a bed hog. But I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll even out the fact you snore like a drunken pig.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. She had the funniest phrases. \u201cSounds like a fair trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnuggling up together is fine. However, I\u2019m not doing the cooking, cleaning or pressing your snappy suits, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sexually speaking, anything is fair game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t hurt and we both are into it, yeah, I\u2019m game to try it.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his mouth over hers. Once. Twice. Longer the third time when she didn\u2019t attempt retreat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very refreshing. Most women aren\u2019t so sexually open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie. In fact, most women I\u2019ve met are sexually repressed. They enjoy the tease and the chase.</p><p>They even like the first couple times of fucking, sucking and whatever. But I\u2019ve always felt...\u201d Way to toss it out there. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Keely pushed his shoulder. \u201cWhat? Come on. Tell me. You\u2019ve always felt...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I\u2019d been tricked. A woman will suck your dick a couple times and act like they love it. Maybe try the kinkier stuff once, but after that, no way. Women who truly enjoy all aspects of sex are a rare breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking as a sexually open-minded woman, I like sex. All aspects of sex. A lot. Do I have sex with whatever man trips my trigger? Sometimes. Do I feel guilty about it? No. And I do not have sex with anyone besides my partner when I\u2019m in a relationship\u2014\u201d she held up her hand and qualified, \u201c\u2014unless it\u2019s a mutual decision. I\u2019m not promiscuous. I\u2019m selective and prefer a guy to have the same sexual appetites and expectations I do. I am not afraid or embarrassed of my sexuality. That upfront admission freaks some men out. They want me to be embarrassed about my sexual past even when they\u2019re grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>Jack ran his hand down her arm. \u201cTell me about these sexual appetites and expectations. What fuels them? What feeds them?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have such an analytical brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better to figure out exactly how I can give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. Tonight was...great, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Not the enthusiastic response he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Maybe Keely thinks you suck in bed.</p><p>No. This wasn\u2019t about him. Normally, he\u2019d dissect every movement. Every position. Every suck and thrust. He\u2019d be obsessed until he figured out if he\u2019d used a faulty technique. Not tonight. Jack understood Keely\u2019s response had nothing to do with what he did. But more what he... didn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t enough, was it?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>A shrug and then she obscured her face with her hair.</p><p>He pinched her chin between his fingers, forcing her to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t hide yourself from me.</p><p>Ever. Your reactions, your anger, your pleasure, nothing, understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf this were a normal dating situation, say, we\u2019ve been going out a few weeks. We have dinner or head out to the bar and come back here to have sex. Maybe I spend a few nights at your place. Maybe you spend a few nights at my place. The sex is good. We both get off on a regular basis. How long would you stay with me?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes were clouded with indecision. \u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplete honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month. Maybe two.\u201d</p><p>Something\u2014despair or hope\u2014fluttered in his gut. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have figured you out by then. Nothing will be spontaneous or exciting between us. I\u2019ll know how you\u2019ll react before you do.\u201d She flipped her hair over her shoulder in a confident, female move. \u201cI\u2019m really good at reading people, Jack. All people. Men especially. I have been since I was a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019d get...bored with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You could be the nicest guy on the planet, with a steady job, a great family, a fun personality.</p><p>You could treat me well, bring me flowers and chocolates, romance me, be decent in the sack and I\u2019d still get bored with you.\u201d Keely frowned. \u201cNot you personally\u2014you do realize I\u2019m speaking strictly in generic terms, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>The truth sparkled like a secret gem he\u2019d personally mined with his bare hands. Why Keely pushed him away. Why she insulted him. Why she lusted after him. Why she couldn\u2019t make up her mind whether she loved him or hated him.</p><p>Her mixed up, inconsistent responses to him were in response to his mixed up inconsistent responses to her. She couldn\u2019t get a bead on him. Jack never reacted the way Keely expected him to. She was both attracted and repelled by the idea he might actually be a...challenge for her.</p><p>That drove her absolutely crazy. And thrilled her to her toes.</p><p>Oh hell yeah. He\u2019d push her. Prod her. Take her to sexual heights she never fathomed. He\u2019d pull out all the stops to make sure Jack Donohue was the one man she never forgot.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSorry. Just thinking it\u2019s good we won\u2019t be together long. You\u2019ll be ready to move on by then.\u201d</p><p>Keely traced the ridge of his pectoral. \u201cBut I am looking forward to the time we\u2019ll be spending together. Especially now I know how compatible we are in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. And I am eager to discover what you consider kinky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time you wanna paw through my sex toy collection, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you clever, keeping your used toys like mementos in a sexual conqueror\u2019s war chest.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I consider sex toys a one-partner indulgence.\u201d Jack followed the slope of her breast with his thumb. \u201cAfter we break up, I throw them out. There\u2019s something creepy about reusing them on someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is, I only allow mine to be used on me.\u201d</p><p>Jack bit back a smile. No surprise Keely set the parameters. Chances were slim any man would argue if she whipped out a vibrating butt plug and demanded he use it on her. \u201cI\u2019ll peruse the online shopping stores and see if I find something to mix it up a bit.\u201d He yawned. \u201cDamn. Been a long-ass day with the flying, the party and the rocking sex. I\u2019m ready to crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>He bounced off the bed and onto his feet. As he peeled the covers back, he tried to remember which side of the bed Keely slept on. The right side. So that\u2019s the side he chose.</p><p>Jack fluffed the pillows and slid between the cool cotton sheets.</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re on my side of the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I always sleep on the right side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jack paused. Keely probably expected he\u2019d gallantly give up the right side of the bed for her.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. Hit the lights, buttercup.\u201d He pulled the covers up to his chin and closed his eyes.</p><p>If Keely\u2019s disgruntled sigh was any indication, he would have no problem whatsoever keeping her off balance.</p><p>Now if he could just keep himself from falling for her.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Keely woke to an empty bed. She squinted at the clock. What the hell was Jack doing up so early?</p><p>They hadn\u2019t fallen asleep until after one. Not to mention he\u2019d woken up her up and proved for the third and fourth time he didn\u2019t need Viagra.</p><p>The aroma of coffee teased her. Yawning, she wandered into the kitchen. The silver contraption popped and hissed. Be her luck to break the damn thing if she touched it, so she opted to wait.</p><p>But no one said she had to wait alone.</p><p>The door to the bathroom was cracked open, which Keely figured was invitation enough.</p><p>Humid, piney-scented air greeted her. She debated on whether to let Jack know she was here, or to surprise him by climbing naked into the shower.</p><p>Surprises hadn\u2019t gone so well for her in the past.</p><p>\u201cJack? I need to sneak in and brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe when you\u2019re done you should crawl in here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed me to wash your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The shower curtain was wrenched aside and Jack grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019d rather you washed my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019d prefer a tongue bath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s an idea. Come on in. The water\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s gaze descended to his groin. His cock was already erect. Her attention wandered up his torso, over the cut muscles above his hips, the well-defined abs and the ridges of his pectorals. Yummy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing steam here, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>She finally met his eyes. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it to me.\u201d</p><p>Cue his raunchy grin. \u201cI was priming myself for your morning wakeup call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was looking forward to hot coffee. A hot man is so much better.\u201d Keely stepped over the lip of the tub and pulled the curtain closed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although the air was humid in the enclosed space, Keely shivered. Her nipples puckered and her skin broke out in gooseflesh.</p><p>Jack stood with his back to the water spray. His teasing smile was gone and pure male heat smoldered in his eyes. \u201cYou want to be wet for this?\u201d</p><p>Lord. She was already wet from the way he looked at her.</p><p>His finger started at the hollow of her throat and trailed down the center of her body slowly, as he watched her reaction to his expert touch. Her nipples hardened into tighter points. Her belly quivered. Her sex swelled.</p><p>Then Jack\u2019s palms were on her shoulders and he pushed her to her knees.</p><p>That startled her. But not as much as how fast his hand gripped her hair. How quickly he guided her face to his groin. \u201cSuck me off.\u201d</p><p>Keely opened her mouth to speak and Jack seized the opportunity to slip his thick cock between her lips. The satiny skin glided over her tongue until the cockhead hit her throat.</p><p>\u201cOpen wider. No hands. I only want to feel how you can work me with your hot mouth and sassy little tongue.\u201d</p><p>Water swirled around her knees. Spray from the showerhead left a fine mist on her skin. She sucked and swallowed, blindly reaching for the sides of the tub to find her balance.</p><p>Jack kept one hand fisted in her hair. The other hand cupped her jaw as he thrust in and out of her mouth. Fast. Then slow. But always deep. He hissed when she used her teeth.</p><p>His slippery cock was too waterlogged to discern the masculine flavor that was uniquely his. Keely relaxed her throat and angled her head, allowing him deeper entry. She simply lost herself to the moment of pleasing a demanding man. Pleasing herself by holding nothing back from him.</p><p>He murmured encouragement but didn\u2019t take it easy on her. Jack fucked her mouth how he wanted.</p><p>Not asking. Taking.</p><p>It was hot as hell.</p><p>When his strokes became less practiced and more frantic, Keely increased her sucking power, preparing herself to swallow every burst of semen.</p><p>But Jack pulled out, grunting, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Keeping one hand in her hair and fisting his cock in his other hand, Jack beat off, directing the spray of come onto her chest. His wild eyes never strayed from his intimate marking until the last spurt. He aimed that one at her face. Come splattered her lips and chin. Her tongue darted out to taste and Jack nearly roared his pleasure.</p><p>Keely almost came right then.</p><p>After Jack stopped shaking, he helped her up and let the shower spray warm her.</p><p>She tipped her head back, engrossed in the sensation of hot water pouring over her cooled skin as the evidence of Jack\u2019s passion flowed from her. Keely imagined Jack\u2019s rough hands mapping her body as painstakingly as the streaming water. She didn\u2019t open her eyes, speak or move.</p><p>I trust you. Do with me what you will.</p><p>Jack sensed her acquiescence. He held her wrists behind her back in his left hand, cupping her breast, switching sides when she moaned softly. He flattened his palm, slicking it over her belly, between her hipbones to the rise of her mound. The same time two fingers breached the wet opening to her pussy, he latched onto her left nipple and sucked hard.</p><p>At that point Keely\u2019s knees buckled.</p> <p>He chuckled against the upper swell of her breast and began a full out sensual assault.</p><p>His tongue rasped her nipples. As his fingers fucked her, his thumb flicked her clit, barely there and then persistent. He\u2019d bite down on her nipple. Suckle the sting. When she started to anticipate the pattern, he changed it.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>It drove her mad. She loved it. She hated it.</p><p>Jack\u2019s rapid exhalations across her wet skin brought forth another full-body shiver. \u201cYou ready to come for me now, cowgirl?\u201d</p><p>Keely couldn\u2019t seem to find her voice. She nodded.</p><p>His mouth was on her ear. \u201cNow I know exactly how to make you speechless.\u201d Jack\u2019s hair brushed her jaw, throat and breastbone as he licked the water trickling to her nipples. He ruthlessly suckled her, impaled her on his clever fingers and stroked her clit.</p><p>She threw back her head and screamed as every nerve ending between her breasts and her pussy throbbed in orgasmic harmony.</p><p>He held on.</p><p>After she floated back from the realm of bliss, she blinked the water from her eyes and looked at Jack.</p><p>Smiling, he pushed wet hanks of her hair over her shoulder. His finger traced the vein still pounding wildly in her throat. \u201cGood thing I put in a bigger water heater.\u201d Jack brushed his lips over hers. \u201cI\u2019ll let you finish your shower.\u201d Then he was gone.</p><p>Keely felt too relaxed to waste brain cells fretting about how quickly the power had shifted in their relationship. Or deluding herself she\u2019d ever had any power at all.</p><p>Jack filled her favorite mug with his precious coffee. He scrambled her brain with a prolonged good morning kiss. He even made the bed.</p><p>Guys were total putty after a blowjob.</p><p>Keely braided her hair in a single plait. She zipped a ripped pair of Levis, buttoned a faded flannel shirt over a long john top, and slipped on her oldest pair of ropers.</p><p>She exited the bedroom and saw Jack perched on the edge of the couch, papers strewn across the coffee table. His hair was mussed from repeatedly running his fingers through it\u2014a sign of frustration.</p><p>Jack looked up and his gaze swept over her.</p><p>She braced herself for a \u201ccountry bumpkin\u201d comment and crafted a couple of snappy comebacks. But she needn\u2019t have bothered.</p><p>He merely inquired, \u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy folks\u2019 place. They\u2019re out making the rounds on Sunday and it\u2019s the only time I can exercise my horse. Then I do whatever needs done in the barn as payment for boarding Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosamonde\u2019s Red Dream is her official name, but I call her Rosa.\u201d</p><p>He sagged into the sofa cushions. \u201cI had a horse when I was growing up. Buster. I thought he was the coolest thing ever. Drove my dad crazy that all I ever wanted to do on the farm was \u2018ride that damn horse\u2019.</p><p>He got rid of it the week after I left for college.\u201d</p><p>Keely gasped. \u201cSo you came home and your horse was gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No big deal. I\u2019d moved on by then, in many ways.\u201d</p><p>How sad for him. She wondered if his dad\u2019s attitude played a role in driving Jack from the family farm. \u201cWell, the years I lived in Denver or I was on the road, my parents never suggested getting rid of Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair to expect them to take care of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve bred her and made enough from the foals to cover her boarding costs. But even if she hadn\u2019t dropped a single colt or filly, they would\u2019ve kept her. Eventually I\u2019ll build my own place and have room for her and the stud Jessie keeps for me.\u201d She grinned. \u201cMy current landlord is a real hardass about me keepin\u2019 pets in the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>Keely snagged her Stetson off the hat rack and slung her messenger bag over her shoulder. Halfway to her truck she realized not only hadn\u2019t she said goodbye to Jack, she hadn\u2019t asked him to come along.</p><p>The day was unseasonably hot and she\u2019d overdressed. By the time Keely finished her ride with Rosa, they were both sweating.</p><p>Keely brushed Rosa down and treated her to some oats before turning her out into the pasture. She straightened the tack, cursing her dad for leaving it such a mess week after week.</p><p>Growing up the only girl in the McKay family had been a test of her mettle. Her father\u2019s and brothers\u2019 first instincts were to stash her in the house, under her mother\u2019s watchful eye. Sure, Keely wanted to learn to cook, can, sew and figure out how to wield charm to get her way like her mother did. But Keely also wanted to help with calving, branding, haying and butchering. She wanted to learn how to fix fence, shoot predators and rope strays.</p><p>Carson McKay and his sons worked hard so Keely didn\u2019t have to. The men in her life preferred her to be pampered. To know enough about horses and horsewomanship only to win rodeo queen pageants and hook a decent husband.</p><p>Ugh. Keely McKay had never aspired to the title of queen of the rodeo, much to her father\u2019s dismay.</p><p>From an early age, Keely smiled prettily and followed her own agenda. Her brothers and cousins blustered and threatened but always gave in to her wheedling when she begged them for help. A mix of bribery and blackmail was how Keely learned to run the haying machine and other equipment from Cord.</p><p>How to rope, ride and tie from Colby. How to birth a breech calf in the dead of night from Colt. Cam taught her how to fix fence. Then he dragged her off and taught her how to fish. Carter showed her how to read the stars, start a fire from flint rocks and whittle. Kade taught her about vaccination and how to pick a good bull. Buck taught her how to dress a deer. Quinn and Ben showed her how to pregnancy-check cows. Chase let her climb on the back of a bull. Luke snuck her into the bar and taught her how to play pool. Brandt shared his extensive knowledge of horses. Tell and Dalton taught her to ride dirt bikes and how to use a beer bong.</p><p>Even her males cousins on the West side of her family furthered her life education. Her cousin Dag taught her how to chew tobacco and spit. Dax forced her to learn to water ski. Chet and Remy demonstrated how to run power tools. Nick patiently showed her how to reload ammo. Blake let her bottle feed lambs and shear sheep. Harris and Lief drilled self defense moves into her. Sebastian offered educational and financial advice.</p><p>All important things. Things her dad wouldn\u2019t have taught her.</p><p>But he taught you other things. How to two-step. How to shoot. How to break a horse. How to drive a car\u2014a manual transmission truck and a four-wheeler. How to play cards. How to cheat at cards. How to laugh.</p><p>Mostly, her father showed day in and day out, what it meant to love. Carson McKay worshiped the ground his wife walked on. From the time Keely was a little girl, she knew she\u2019d never settle for anything less than that type of man. That type of undying love.</p><p>So yeah, her dad purposely messed up the tack and the barn just so she\u2019d come out on Sunday and straighten it up. That was the gruff rancher showing love. Then he\u2019d convince her to play a game of cribbage or poker. Or to ride out to check on a pump or a horse or a sick cow. Or to sneak a piece of pie or a bowl of homemade ice cream and sit with him on the porch listening to the wind. He\u2019d come up with all kinds of reasons to get her to stay a little while longer. And she always did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which is why she\u2019d felt guilty keeping her purchase of the building in Moorcroft a secret from him.</p><p>Now she was lying to him about her engagement to Jack. Although her dad would rejoice when it ended.</p><p>Keely originally figured she\u2019d have the same wahoo! sense of relief, but now, she wasn\u2019t so sure. Jack Donohue had more layers, sides and facets to him than she\u2019d imagined. He\u2019d acted sweet and sour, kind and mean, gruff and gregarious, concerned and aloof. Maybe she\u2019d misjudged him.</p> <p>Or maybe the rocking sex is clouding your judgment.</p><p>Yeah. That had to be it.</p><p>She put thoughts of Jack and her father out of her mind as she mentally planned her week. She heard tires crunching on the gravel, but it didn\u2019t sound like her mother\u2019s Lincoln Town Car. She stripped off her gloves and hung them to dry on the hook embedded in the wooden support beams. The door squeaked as she ventured out of the barn.</p><p>Shielding her eyes from the sun didn\u2019t help cut the glare. \u201cDad? Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>She froze. \u201cJack? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever noticed your tendency to slip into a Wyomin\u2019 drawl is more pronounced whenever you\u2019re nervous?\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted. \u201cYou do not make me nervous. Anyway, you didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d She moved until she saw him leaning against his Beemer.</p><p>Jack kept his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cI had brunch with my mom and brother. Evidently my mom ended up with a piece of Carolyn\u2019s silver service. She was mortified and I volunteered to bring it back for her.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jack skeptically. There was an edge to him, an edge that automatically made her bristle.</p><p>If he was here just to return a piece of silverware, she\u2019d eat her hat.</p> <p>\u201cIs your mother around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She and Dad haven\u2019t come back yet. If you leave it with me, I\u2019ll be sure she gets it.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you acting so formal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jack, make up your mind. First you accused me of reverting to a twang, now you\u2019re claiming I\u2019m acting formal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant you\u2019re acting awful formal for a woman who was on her knees with my dick in her mouth not five hours ago.\u201d</p><p>A blush stole across her cheeks, which pissed her off. This was how he treated her after she opened herself up to him? Screw him. \u201cHow\u2019s this for formal? Fuck. Off. You\u2019re an asshole.\u201d Keely pivoted and stomped up the porch steps.</p><p>Too bad she couldn\u2019t provide him with a dramatic exit, slamming the door after she flounced into the house and locking it behind her. But her boots were filthy and she knew better than to track mud and horseshit across her mother\u2019s floor. She sat on the edge of the boot bench.</p><p>\u201cWould you let me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeep sayin\u2019 crude shit like that to piss me off? Hell no. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. I came here to try and do something nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat comment was not nice by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d She grunted as she yanked off her right boot. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised we\u2019re back to you only being nice to me when we\u2019re in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you only being nice to me when we\u2019re fucking?\u201d he taunted back.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Goaded beyond control, Keely whipped her dirty boot at him. At least the man had good reflexes out of bed too and he was fast enough to duck.</p><p>Jack\u2019s look of surprise was downright comical. And totally worth it. \u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I gave you a chance to leave and you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo whipping a boot at my head is supposed to be an incentive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking riot, buttercup.\u201d He flashed his teeth. \u201cAnd guess what? It didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another boot,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cAnd lousy aim. You\u2019re goddamn lucky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed on purpose, Jack-off. And you\u2019re goddamn lucky you\u2019re not wearing a dirt halo and a dent in your fat head.\u201d She hopped up and sought refuge in the house. Maybe her over-the-top behavior would convince the stupid, smarmy jerk to take off so she could calm down.</p><p>The porch door slammed again.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>Keely took the shortcut from the back entryway to the kitchen. She scrubbed her hands in the sink and ignored Jack\u2019s gaze burning a hole in her back. When she deigned to look at him, leaning indifferently in the doorjamb, she noticed he was tapping the metal serving utensil against his palm. Smack, smack, smack over and over.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>\u201cI cannot deal with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. You brought this on yourself.\u201d Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you you\u2019re an uninvited guest in my parents\u2019 house. I may not be able to throw you out of the apartment you own, but I can toss you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop smacking that goddamn thing? It\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just warming it up so the metal isn\u2019t cold when I spank your bare ass with it.\u201d Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>Keely couldn\u2019t help it; she laughed. \u201cRight.\u201d She\u2019d gone about six steps when the word, \u201cStop,\u201d had the effect he\u2019d intended. She stopped.</p><p>\u201cDo not push your luck with me any more than you already have, Keely,\u201d he warned. Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>Of all the freakin\u2019 nerve. Keely spun around. Her stomach fluttered. She\u2019d never seen that look in his eye\u2014the taskmaster with a lesson to teach. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019m going to let you...hit me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hit you. Spank you. Big difference. Losing your temper and throwing your boot at me proved you need to learn there are consequences for acting out against me.\u201d Smack, smack, smack.</p><p>\u201cNo. Way. You are fucking delusional.\u201d The continual smack, smack, smack was wearing on her nerves. \u201cI haven\u2019t been spanked since I was about six years old.\u201d</p><p>In a clipped tone, Jack said, \u201cThen it\u2019s past time you had a reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need a reminder not to goad me,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>A stalemate?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make idle threats. Drop your jeans and show me that ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my way, Keely. You give it or I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>A small thrill surfaced. How far would he take this?</p><p>Let\u2019s find out.</p><p>She walked away. As she bypassed the living room, she realized he\u2019d followed her. If she picked up speed, so did he. Smack, smack, smack echoed until she was surrounded. The noise was in her head.</p><p>Pounding in her blood. Throbbing in her groin.</p><p>She took the stairs at a dead run.</p><p>Jack gave chase.</p><p>Keely shrieked. Her heart nearly beat out of her chest. Adrenaline soared and her pulse exploded. Her breathing sputtered after climbing the second set of stairs.</p><p>Then she was zipping down the hallway. Her room had a hefty lock. If she could get there first...</p><p>As she pushed the door open, a strong set of arms circled her waist. She shrieked again\u2014which was quickly muffled when Jack lifted her off her feet and dropped her face-first on her bed.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Jack absorbed the brunt of the fall when they hit the mattress. He quickly immobilized Keely\u2019s hands above her head and used his body weight to hold her down. Still, the woman bucked like wild bronc.</p><p>When she turned tail and ran, Jack acted like any predatory male in his position: He\u2019d raced after her to gauge how far she\u2019d take the battle of wills.</p><p>The question was what to do with her now that he\u2019d caught her.</p><p>He\u2019d ditched the cake server after she\u2019d taken off. So he\u2019d have to implement a different tool. His hand? It\u2019d be hot as sin seeing his imprint on her remarkable ass, all pink and red and his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare spank me, or I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>That settled it. Keely was getting a spanking. Her lilac scent permeated the braid and he inhaled as much of the sweetness as his lungs would hold.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take whatever I decide to dish out. And if you weren\u2019t so goddamn hotheaded, you\u2019d realize that I was trying to apologize for my smartass comment. But you opted to push me, so I\u2019m pushing back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove like this?\u201d He slid his hips from side to side, grinding his erection into her ass. \u201cOr like this?\u201d</p><p>He bumped his pelvis, thrusting as he rolled his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a pervert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust another thing we have in common, cowgirl.\u201d Jack lightly sank his teeth into the shell of her ear and soothed the sting with a soft sucking kiss.</p><p>She hissed.</p><p>His mouth returned to the curve of her jaw. \u201cI will fuck you like this, Keely, if I choose to. Face down on the bed. Keeping my intentions unclear until the moment my cock shoves into you. Might be your cunt.</p><p>Might be your ass. Might be I\u2019ll stroke my dick in your butt crack and come all over your back.\u201d</p><p>Keely shivered and not from fear.</p><p>\u201cHold still. Take what you\u2019ve got coming to you.\u201d Maintaining his grip on her wrists in his left hand, he rolled to his left side, stretching his right leg over the back of her thighs.</p><p>She stopped struggling.</p><p>Jack rubbed his palm over her butt cheeks. Damn. Keely\u2019s ass filled out a pair of 501s to perfection.</p><p>He kept stroking, building her anticipation. With his fingers around her wrists, he felt her pulse leap every time he changed direction or speed.</p><p>His first swat wasn\u2019t hard. Neither was the second. But the third and fourth\u2014one on each butt cheek\u2014stung his hand. Jack knew they\u2019d stung her, even through the denim. He peppered each side with a series of fast smacks, finishing with three hard swats down low where her thigh curved into her ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Keely continued to hold herself rigid, expecting more, he removed his leg and released her wrists. \u201cI\u2019m done. And I reward good behavior. Up on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him, but she obeyed. Jack took a second, unbelievably humbled, unbelievably grateful, unbelievably touched by this strong woman who gave herself over into his sexual keeping without question.</p><p>He peeled her jeans to her knees, in effect hobbling her. Jack knelt on the bed, his eyes eating up the red marks he\u2019d placed on her ass.</p><p>Fuck that was hot. He swept his palm over the marks. Literally hot. He kissed the lips tattooed on her butt cheek. Then he ran his tongue over the beautifully pinkened flesh.</p><p>\u201cOmigod.\u201d</p><p>He laved every swollen spot. Blowing on her heated skin until she arched into him for more. Bathing his marks of possession until he smelled her arousal and saw the sweet cream dotting her inner thighs.</p><p>Jack stripped her jeans off. He placed his hand between her shoulder blades and pushed her upper body to the mattress, leaving her ass in the air. Taking a butt cheek in each hand, he lifted her up and spread her open for his mouth.</p><p>Keely gasped.</p><p>He licked her slit, from her clitoris to that sweet little asshole. He rimmed the pucker with his tongue, relishing the sexy moans of consent she didn\u2019t bother to hide.</p><p>A thrill shot through him. Keely liked his raunchy side. Her complete wantonness increased Jack\u2019s determination to please her beyond her wildest dreams.</p><p>\u201cIf this is your idea of punishment, I plan on being bad all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and continued to torment her. He fucked her ass and her cunt with his tongue until she shook with need, whispering please, please, please in a husky rasp that caused his dick to jerk against his zipper.</p><p>\u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>The second Keely was on her back, Jack buried his face in her pussy. He zeroed in on her clit, sucking relentlessly until Keely bucked against his mouth and came in a rush of wetness all over his face. He didn\u2019t release her juicy sex until her legs stopped twitching.</p><p>Again, Jack was humbled, seeing Keely utterly boneless, beautiful in abandon. He kissed her damp mound. The ticklish skin between her hipbones. The strange looking tattoo on her hip he suspected was a brand. The cute indent of her belly button. He looked at her, hoping she saw how much she meant to him at that moment.</p><p>No smile. No teasing eyes. She just said, \u201cFuck me, Jack. However you want. On the bed. On the floor. Over the chair. Hanging from the damn ceiling. I don\u2019t care. I just need to see that wild look in your eyes and know I put it there.\u201d</p><p>Her honesty floored him. Jack took her mouth in a brutal kiss. He slid his hands under her butt and lifted her, eating at those full lips. He staggered back, spun and pinned her against the wall.</p><p>He ripped his mouth away. \u201cHelp me get these jeans off.\u201d</p><p>They depantsed him. Her hot, naked skin against his drove him out of his freakin\u2019 mind. He grabbed a handful of her warm ass, canted her pelvis and plunged his cock in deep.</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh God. Yes.\u201d</p><p>With her legs wrapped around his waist, she ground down on him every time he thrust up. Slam slam slam. No kisses. No caresses. No talking. Nothing but hard, fast fucking.</p><p>Her head fell back against the wall and she moaned, \u201cHarder,\u201d tightening her fingers in his hair as she bore down on him with her pussy muscles.</p> <p>Slam slam slam.</p><p>Keely suddenly snapped upright, a stricken look on her face. \u201cWait. Did you hear someone walking down the hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Jack. Stop. I think my parents are home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? We can\u2019t do this if my mom and dad are downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Jack had just uttered the words, \u201cYou\u2019re paranoid,\u201d when Keely\u2019s mom called out, \u201cKeely, hon? You up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just answer her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop.\u201d</p><p>He got right in her face. \u201cNo fucking way. Answer her now before she comes hauling ass in here.\u201d</p><p>Keely half-glared at him and shouted, \u201cYeah, Mom, I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cIs Jack in there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Jack began to thrust again. Damn. Had sex ever felt this good? He muttered, \u201cAnswer her, buttercup,\u201d</p><p>against her throat and sucked on the spot that turned her inside out.</p><p>\u201cYes! I mean, Jack is here and we\u2019ll be done\u2014I mean out\u2014in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll be in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hell, my dad is out there too!\u201d she whispered furiously.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d His thrusts picked up rhythm.</p><p>\u201cDammit Jack, stop. I can\u2019t have an orgasm now.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d He fucked her without pause, using his teeth on her throat until she came gasping, cursing his name, which bizarrely enough, turned him on even more. Keely pulled his hair, her orgasm was so intense. He muffled his raw shout against her shoulder as hot burst after hot burst shot out the end of his dick.</p><p>That\u2019s when he realized why the sex was so good.</p><p>\u201cShit. We forgot a condom.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him sleepily, wearing the sated expression of a well-fucked woman. \u201cHmm? What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019ll admit I prefer ridin\u2019 bareback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pecked him on the mouth. Twice. \u201cNo worries. We\u2019re safe. I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve told me that last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been lovers less than twenty-four hours. It would\u2019ve come up.\u201d She shrugged and tried to cover a yawn. \u201cLet me down so I can at least fix my hair so I don\u2019t look like I\u2019ve spent the last hour being fucked silly by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Jack withdrew and set her on her feet. \u201cDo you want to go downstairs one at a time so they don\u2019t suspect? Or can we walk in together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to get caught screwing in my old bedroom as an adult when they never caught me when I was a stupid kid.\u201d</p><p>Jack zipped his pants. \u201cYou never got caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I caught them plenty of times and that wasn\u2019t any less awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarson and Carolyn doing the nasty? I\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I had no clue what a ball gag was until one weekend I came home from college for a surprise visit, and I saw one in my mother\u2019s mouth and my father had her tied to a dining room chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Maybe your dad can share tips about which brand is better, since I\u2019ve often wanted to gag you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Donohue, don\u2019t you dare bring it up! I swear to God, if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smashed his mouth to hers, cutting off her protest. But his kisses didn\u2019t placate her. She pulled back and glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, cowgirl. I\u2019ll behave. But I sure am hoping we\u2019re sitting in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn McKay slanted them both a knowing look and blithely offered them a slice of peach pie.</p><p>Carson McKay\u2019s glare could\u2019ve set Jack\u2019s hair on fire. But his grin for Keely was genuine adoration.</p><p>Mr. Tough Rancher was absolutely whipped for his daughter. Whipped.</p><p>Jack was beginning to understand the feeling.</p><p>\u201cI see you cleaned up the barn again, girlie. Thanks. You and Rosa have a good ride?\u201d</p><p>Keely wiped her mouth. \u201cIt was a great ride. We must\u2019ve been gone three hours. I thought after all the party preparations and being around family yesterday you\u2019d do something just the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say we didn\u2019t?\u201d Carolyn winked. She addressed Jack. \u201cDid your mother and Justin get off all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We had brunch before they started home. My mother was upset she\u2019d ended up with your cake server. She made me promise I\u2019d hand deliver it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it ended up on the floor in the living room...how?\u201d</p><p>Keely wouldn\u2019t look at him, the coward.</p><p>Jack smiled at Carolyn. \u201cAn oversight. I got busy doing something else and must\u2019ve dropped it.\u201d</p><p>Carson harrumphed but didn\u2019t demand details.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next for you two lovebirds this week?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we find out if Jack got approval on the remodel plans from historical committee. Then he\u2019ll do his thing and I\u2019ll do mine. I\u2019m working at the clinic Tuesday through Friday.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at Keely. \u201cNot Friday. We\u2019re flying to Milford early Friday morning. Technically we\u2019re landing in Salt Lake City and then making the two hour drive to Milford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you about it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWe had a fight before you left. You were gone right up until the party started last night and when we got home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do a whole lot of talking, did we?\u201d he murmured, ignoring Carson\u2019s low snarl.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Jack, that\u2019s not funny. You said we were going to Milford at some point, but you never said when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, buttercup, it is this weekend. Friday night they\u2019re having a dinner for us. Saturday I\u2019ll do one last run through before giving them my final set of suggested updates. There\u2019s another dinner on Saturday night. However, I am hoping we can sneak out of town Sunday morning before they drag us to church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><p>Jack warned her, \u201cYou\u2019ve known about this \u2018commitment\u2019 from the very start, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound to me like Keely\u2019s too keen on goin\u2019,\u201d Carson mused.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. She is going.\u201d</p><p>Keely sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna have to wear a long dress and some kind of freaky head covering, am I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carson laid his hand over Keely\u2019s. \u201cDarlin\u2019 girl, if you ain\u2019t comfortable goin\u2019, then don\u2019t go. Just</p><p>\u2019cause you\u2019re engaged to him don\u2019t mean you gotta do everything he says.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? Jack couldn\u2019t believe Carson was encouraging his daughter to blatantly oppose him.</p> <p>He was her fianc\u00e9 for Christsake. Keely had better realize early on that their relationship took precedence over every other relationship in her life.</p><p>What relationship? This engagement isn\u2019t real, remember?</p><p>Ah hell. With the intensity of the last twenty-four hours, somehow Jack had forgotten that.</p><p>Keely squeezed her father\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I want to go with Jack. This is a big potential client and he\u2019s talked about everything so much I\u2019m looking forward to it. It\u2019s just...the timing caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>Keely smirked at Jack. \u201cMy man and I tend to fight first before we figure things out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like someone else I know,\u201d Carolyn muttered.</p><p>Carson\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll reschedule my Friday clients. No big deal. Daddy, can you ride Rosa for me this week?</p><p>Since it doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019ll be here next Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, punkin, whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re the bestest evah.\u201d</p> <p>Carson grunted, but Jack knew he was pleased.</p><p>Jack forced a smile. \u201cCarolyn, thanks for the pie, it was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You two taking off?\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cYes\u201d the same time Keely said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other. Measured each other.</p><p>\u201cI have work to finish before tomorrow,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSo go. We have two cars. I need to redeem myself from the last cribbage game we played, where Daddy skunked me twice, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, girlie. I\u2019ll get the board and the cards,\u201d Carson said and vanished from the table.</p> <p>Carolyn and Keely chatted as they picked up the pie plates and headed into the kitchen.</p><p>Jack took the shortcut out the back door. He paused on the porch, propping his elbows on the railing to drink in the view. The scenery really was spectacular. No wonder Keely loved it so much.</p><p>The porch boards squeaked and Carson appeared in his peripheral vision. Jack felt like a teenage boy about to get \u201cthe talk\u201d from his girlfriend\u2019s father. \u201cNice night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna say this flat out, Donohue. That girl in there means the world to me. She\u2019s been the light of my life since the day she came into this world. I\u2019d do anything to make her happy. I always have, I always will. I trust her judgment, but son, I don\u2019t trust you. And I most definitely don\u2019t trust you with her.</p><p>So if you do anything to hurt her? I swear to God I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014gut me? Yeah, I got this warning five goddamn times last night from your sons,\u201d Jack said curtly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d expect nothin\u2019 less from my boys and neither should you. But they\u2019re not the ones you oughta worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Guttin\u2019 you would be too easy and not nearly painful enough. Think about it, son, because I guarantee I have been.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s stomach muscles involuntarily clenched. Rather than let the threat go unanswered, he faced Keely\u2019s father head on. \u201cI appreciate the warning, Carson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, Jack.\u201d The door slammed and Carson was gone.</p><p>Engrossed in a new project bid, Jack paid little attention when Keely returned to the apartment a few hours later and headed to the shower.</p><p>But his focus was shot to hell when the scent of lilacs drifted from the bathroom. He looked up just as Keely sauntered by in her birthday suit.</p><p>She gave him a little finger wave before she shut the bedroom door.</p><p>Yeah. He was supposed to get any work done now?</p><p>Maybe Keely\u2019s naked stroll was a hint. Maybe she was waiting for him, spread out on the bed, touching herself in anticipation of him coming to her.</p><p>The door opened and out she flounced in day-glo plaid pajamas. Flannel pajamas. Pajamas that covered her from head to toe. What a freakin\u2019 waste.</p><p>With her body, Keely should wear peek-a-boo nighties crafted from sheer material that showed off her stunning curves. Lace gloves that buttoned at the wrists he could rip off with his teeth. Thongs made of silk. Sky-high heels. Or better yet, boots that came above her knees. In black patent leather. And fishnets.</p><p>No, fishnet stockings that hooked to lace garters. Oh, yeah, and leather boy shorts, topped with a blue velvet bustier that matched her eyes. And a collar. Just once he\u2019d like to see how she\u2019d react if he slapped a slave collar on her.</p><p>\u201cI oughta slap you, Jack, for the disgusted way you\u2019re eyeballin\u2019 my favorite jammies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m...stunned. More flannel? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold. And I like to be comfy when I\u2019m lounging around. I\u2019m just a simple country girl with simple tastes.\u201d She pointed at his laptop. \u201cYou about done working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could call it a night if I had the right incentive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf incentive is a euphemism for sex, keep right on pecking away on those keys and forget about your pecker. I need some recovery time from your raw thrusting power.\u201d</p><p>That admission startled him. \u201cWas I too rough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I loved every second of it. I\u2019m just not used to eight instances of sexual contact in less than twenty-four hours, stud.\u201d She expelled a dreamy sigh. \u201cAnd to think I didn\u2019t believe your claims about not needing Viagra.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to toss off a smart comment, but it bugged him that he might\u2019ve taken it too far with her on their first day as lovers.</p><p>Like you should be surprised. Everything you do is balls to the wall, full acceleration, no breaks, no prisoners.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Keely climbed onto his lap. \u201cMy soreness is because I haven\u2019t been in a steady sexual relationship for a while.\u201d</p><p>Jack was absurdly pleased Keely wanted to reassure him. He looped her damp hair around his palm.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry for any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo since your poor pussy needs recovery time, does that mean anal sex is out?\u201d</p><p>Keely whapped him on the arm. \u201cDuh. I thought I could distract you from thoughts of raunchy sex by...\u201d She grabbed his chin. \u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>He looked in her eyes. \u201cWhat? I lost any logical train of thought the second you said raunchy sex.\u201d</p><p>Keely rolled her eyes. \u201cSex is off the list of things we can do tonight. Want to play cribbage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to play cribbage. Do you play chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Ky and Anton and Hayden are obsessed and keep begging me to learn. But truthfully, they\u2019d whip my ass and that would be totally demoralizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheckers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to play Chinese checkers with Carter but that was years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could watch TV.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cAnything but TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have against television?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of time. I\u2019d rather be hanging out with my family or my friends or doing something fun or interesting instead of sitting alone in front of the TV night after night.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that pretty much described Jack\u2019s life of late. \u201cIndulge me. Let me prove to you there\u2019s something on worth watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But you have to indulge me tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d walked right into that one. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA junior rodeo. My nephews are competing. I promised I\u2019d cheer them on.\u201d She gently smoothed her hand down the side of his face. He had the overwhelming urge to purr. \u201cBesides, it\u2019ll reinforce our \u2018cover\u2019 as a newly engaged couple wildly in luurrve, if you go along with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill your dad be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Why?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019ll probably try to throw me under a bull. \u201cNo reason. Sure I\u2019ll go. Hand me the remote.\u201d</p><p>Keely shut off the lights while he powered down his computer. She plopped right beside him. Wasn\u2019t five minutes later and she was asleep, sprawled across his lap. Not that he minded. He stretched out and she curled into his chest, not facing the TV. He didn\u2019t mind that either.</p><p>The hell of it was she was absolutely right. There wasn\u2019t a damn thing to watch. So he watched her sleep for the longest time before he carried her to bed.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>She attempted to roll away from the deep, sexy, husky morning voice disturbing her sleep.</p><p>Tenacious kisses moved down her neck. Her nipples tightened into hard points when her chest was exposed to cool air.</p><p>Whoa. How the heck had he unbuttoned her top so fast? A rough, callused hand slid from her lower belly between her breasts. Clever fingers pinched and teased her nipples. Hot breath tickled the fine hairs on her nape.</p><p>As amazing as it felt, she\u2019d been happy in dreamland. Maybe if she pretended to sleep...</p><p>An impressive erection poked into her lower back.</p><p>No rest for the wickedly horny.</p><p>Jack whispered, \u201cI know you\u2019re awake. I want you. Just like this. Warm and sleepy and sweet.\u201d</p><p>Talk about melting her resistance. She angled her head and blinked at him. \u201cI thought my flannel PJs turned you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could wear a burlap sack and I\u2019d be turned on. I was just surprised by your choice of flannel.\u201d</p><p>Jack rolled her flat and brushed the hair from her face. \u201cI\u2019m finding many things about you surprise me, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m keeping you on your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had my way, I\u2019d be keeping you on your back all the damn time.\u201d He scattered kisses down the center of her body. \u201cAre you still sore? We can go slow. I just...want you, like this. First thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keely stared at his dark head trailing kisses south. She was as shocked by his sweetness as how easily he\u2019d verbalized his need for her. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, the flannel is starting to itch. While you\u2019re down there take them off.\u201d She felt him smile against her stomach.</p> <p>He held a tube of K-Y. She watched him ready his cock and squirt a huge dollop on his fingers, warming the slick gel before he used it on her.</p><p>Such thoughtfulness gave her pause. But not for long because Jack was on her.</p><p>Jack\u2019s mouth covered hers as he gently smeared the lubricant inside her sex. Two fingers sliding in and out didn\u2019t hurt, but she wondered if he\u2019d be able to go slow once his cock took control of his brain.</p><p>He levered himself over her and eased his shaft in a little at a time, watching her for any signs of pain.</p><p>Once he was fully seated, he murmured, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery okay.\u201d Keely brought her knees up by his hips and ran her palms over his muscular arms.</p><p>Damn, she loved his body. She hadn\u2019t had nearly enough chances to play with it.</p><p>He kissed her as he moved in unhurried strokes. The kisses were lazy and unbelievably sweet.</p><p>As they rocked together, intimately connected, the bed seemed a magical place. Dark and hot and...comforting. Keely existed in this moment of perfect intimacy. No rush to the finish. No power plays.</p><p>Nothing but the feel of skin gliding on skin. Of sliding tongues and gentle kisses, soft sighs and broken breaths.</p><p>\u201cKeely.\u201d He moaned and his orgasm released a burst of heat inside her, which triggered her own climax. He kept a steady pumping of his hips as the delicious throbbing faded. He kissed her forehead, her eyelids, the corners of her mouth.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s tenderness undid her. She could deal with the snarky Jack just fine. She welcomed going toe to toe with the hotheaded Jack. But this Jack? A loving Jack? She\u2019d been better off believing he didn\u2019t possess a loving side.</p><p>He looked into her eyes and smiled oh so softly. \u201cGood morning.\u201d After flustering her with another lingering kiss, he sailed out of the room.</p><p>Keely realized things had been much simpler when she\u2019d hated him. Now she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt. That could lead her to big, big trouble with this unpredictable man.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ky! Get \u2019em down. That\u2019s it. Hold on. Yes!\u201d Keely turned and high-fived AJ. Foster, sitting on Keely\u2019s lap, knew the drill and lifted his little hand for a high five. \u201cMan, he\u2019s fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord has been helping him. Ky\u2019s gotta be fast to keep up with Anton. That kid has such natural talent, plus he trains like a fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronic that Cam, who prides himself on not being a cowboy, has a son who is a total cowboy. And a rodeo cowboy to boot.\u201d Keely squinted at her brothers behind the chutes who were helping the boys get ready. Cord patted Ky on the back. Cam doled out last minute advice before Anton\u2019s turn at goat roping.</p><p>Gib and Braxton stood on the metal fence rails beside the chutes. Colby was explaining something to his sons and they hung on his every word.</p><p>\u201cGib is chompin\u2019 at the bit to get into the arena.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s only six!\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cSix goin\u2019 on twenty-six,\u201d Keely said dryly. Colby\u2019s oldest boy was whip-smart and redefined determined. Poor Channing had her hands full with that one.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a wild guess. Working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d</p><p>Keely glanced at AJ. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>AJ shrugged. \u201cYour answer was snippy, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Keely had a right to be snippy. After spending the day using muscles she\u2019d forgotten she had hauling shit out of the building, she\u2019d considered staying home. But disappointing her nephews wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>When she\u2019d asked Jack what time he\u2019d be ready to go to the arena, he\u2019d replied he had work to finish.</p><p>But Keely suspected he was avoiding spending time with her and her family. He was probably watching TV.</p><p>Domini barreled down the stairs, three kids in tow. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t gone yet, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s next after this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. We got a late start. Again.\u201d She unbuttoned Dimitri\u2019s coat, then Oxsana\u2019s. Both kids plopped on the bench below them. Foster scrambled off Keely\u2019s lap to sit with his cousins. \u201cMiddle of the puddle\u201d Liesl inserted herself right between Keely and AJ.</p><p>\u201cHey, Aunt Keely, guess what I got?\u201d</p><p>Keely unwound a long blonde curl that\u2019d gotten trapped beneath the collar of Liesl\u2019s coat. \u201cYour daddy bought you a spaceship.\u201d</p><p>Liesl giggled. \u201cNo, silly. I got an award at school today!\u201d She turned so Keely could see the star pinned to her shirt.</p><p>\u201cCool beans. What\u2019s the award for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpelling. And math. And citizenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp top, girlfriend.\u201d She and Liesl high-fived. \u201cAll three classes? I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are too,\u201d AJ said. \u201cKy shared the good news after he got off the bus today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what else?\u201d Her pale blue eyes danced with glee. \u201cGrandpa is taking just me out for ice cream tomorrow after school to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Keely bit back a smile. Grandpa Carson was such a sucker for Liesl. \u201cSpeaking of...where are my mom and dad tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching Hudson for Colt and India, and Miles and Austin for Channing. Colby said she needed a night off since he was taking the older boys to the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s Anton\u2019s turn. Everyone watch,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>Anton raced out of the chute, piggin\u2019 string hanging from his mouth. He launched himself at the goat, tackled it to the ground, flipped it on its side and tied all four legs together. Then he hopped up, threw his hands in the air and took three steps back, waiting to see if the tie held. The judge nodded and held up the time. Three point five seconds, which beat Ky\u2019s time of three point eight seconds.</p><p>They whooped and hollered, watching as Ky and Anton bumped fists. In the last two years Ky and Anton had become inseparable. Add Hayden to the mix and Keely was looking at the next generation of McKay hellraisers.</p><p>Liesl leaned toward AJ. \u201cCan I feel the baby kick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. He\u2019s really restless tonight so you oughta be able to feel him kickin\u2019 real good.\u201d</p><p>Liesl put her hands on AJ\u2019s belly. \u201cCan\u2019t you have a girl? There aren\u2019t enough girls in our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, short stuff. I was the only girl for a really long time. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019ve got a little sister and three girl cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have more girl cousins, sweetie. Macie\u2019s having a girl,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>Keely\u2019s head whipped toward her. \u201cShe is? How come I didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. She just told us this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there this weekend. Why didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d</p><p>AJ patted Keely\u2019s knee. \u201cK, I know how much you hate being the last to know family stuff, but it was your engagement party. She didn\u2019t want to take focus away from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your handsome husband-to-be?\u201d Domini asked.</p><p>\u201cScrewing off.\u201d</p><p>Both Domini and AJ frowned at Keely for her word choice.</p><p>\u201cI meant he\u2019s working, screwing off...the bad light bulbs in the building and screwing new ones in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLame cover up, cowgirl,\u201d Jack whispered in her ear.</p><p>Keely jumped and spun around. The sneaky man sat right behind her. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d He dazzled AJ and Domini with a charming grin. \u201cGood evening, lovely ladies. I arrived just as Anton was up. He did great. I\u2019m sorry I missed Ky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>Liesl peered around Keely\u2019s shoulder at Jack. \u201cAre you and Aunt Keely gonna kiss again?\u201d</p><p>Jack pretended to give her question serious consideration. \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d Jack\u2019s gaze swept over Keely\u2019s face. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate? You said you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said I had something to finish up. Then you left in a huff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a surprise,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d Keely snapped.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not at all. Go ahead and fight in front of us. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t heard it before.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood and offered her a hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s spare young ears our squabble and have a beer.\u201d</p><p>Keely admitted a beer sounded good. As soon as they cleared the bleachers, she led the way to the beer stand. But everyone in the entire county was there and wanted to meet the man who\u2019d \u201ctamed Keely McKay\u201d.</p><p>\u201cTwo Bud Lights,\u201d Jack said and handed the cashier a ten, waving off the change as a tip.</p><p>Keely saw the women nudging each other and waggling their eyebrows. No denying Jack stood out, not just because he wasn\u2019t a cowboy in an arena filled with them. His forest green mock turtleneck and blue jeans accentuated his eye-catching physique and his dark good looks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scowling at me. These boots are the closest I\u2019ll ever come to wearing a pair of shitkickers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming and I\u2019d worked up a really good mad. Now you\u2019re here and there\u2019s no reason for me to be mad, but I still am.\u201d</p><p>Jack crowded her against the wall, bracing his forearm above her head. \u201cAnd just how were you hoping to use that good mad against me, buttercup? By throwing something at me so we end up fucking right where we stand?\u201d</p><p>She blinked innocently. \u201cIs that a possibility?\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparked lust. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. I went easy on you this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have I mentioned how awesome it was?\u201d She managed to sip her beer even with Jack right in her face. She didn\u2019t look away. He didn\u2019t look away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw, for Christsake, you two are adults. Get a freakin\u2019 room. Don\u2019t make me arrest you for lewd behavior.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t acknowledge Cam. Neither did Jack.</p><p>Getting no response out of them, Cam stalked off in a huff.</p> <p>They grinned at each other. Then Jack brushed his lips over hers until her mouth opened and he teased her with a flirty kiss. He tasted like beer. And Jack.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer does this go on?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat kiss could\u2019ve gone on a lot longer as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>He gently bit her bottom lip. \u201cI meant this event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMutton bustin\u2019 is next. It\u2019s the last event because it\u2019s the most popular. Gib and Braxton are entered.\u201d She smooched his chin. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s probably about to start.\u201d</p> <p>They held hands and made their way back into the stands.</p><p>Cord and Cam were sitting with their wives. Both Dimitri and Oxsana sat on Cam\u2019s lap while Cord held Foster on his. Liesl had inserted herself between Domini and Cam. Ky and Anton were hanging over the Plexiglas partition, trying to see into the chutes.</p><p>A number of kids stayed on and rode their sheep, but the only one who crossed the finish line was Gib.</p><p>\u201cThat kid is a natural bull rider. Channing ain\u2019t gonna keep him outta the chutes when he gets old enough to ride bulls,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>Anton piped up, \u201cJust wait \u2019til you see me\u2019n Ky ride bulls. We\u2019re gonna be world champs.\u201d</p><p>Domini shook her head. \u201cNo way am I letting you get on the back of a bull, Anton McKay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, but Mom, if I get hurt Aunt Keely can fix me up, can\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>Way to put her on the spot. \u201cWow. Look at the time. And you guys have school tomorrow.\u201d Keely pushed up and threw her arms open. \u201cWho\u2019s givin\u2019 me some love?\u201d</p><p>Liesl was the first one in line for a hug. Followed by Ky and Anton. The twins were cranky and refused to let go of Cam, but sweet Foster peppered her face with kisses. She reluctantly handed Cord his youngest son. When Keely looked over at Jack, he wore the oddest expression.</p><p>Colby and his boys were waiting at the bottom of the stairs. After more congratulations were passed around to Gib and Braxton, Colby said, \u201cKeels, you still on for tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll be there with bells on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, boys, let\u2019s get your brothers so we can go home and see how Mama is farin\u2019 in an empty house.\u201d</p><p>Everyone dispersed. Keely and Jack were stopped a dozen more times as they walked through the crowd. They finally reached Keely\u2019s truck and Jack leaned against it with a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou hated coming to the junior rodeo that much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You know everyone in town, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I have lived here most of my life, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you kept purchasing the Brewster Building under wraps. Not only from the community, but from your entire family. From what I\u2019ve seen, the McKays live in each other\u2019s pockets.\u201d</p><p>Did that bother him? \u201cIt isn\u2019t like we don\u2019t have secrets from each other within the McKay family, but we do spend a lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy choice?\u201d</p><p>Keely bumped him with her shoulder. \u201cYes, by choice. I\u2019ve always hero-worshipped my brothers, even when they weren\u2019t around. For years we followed our own paths, but it\u2019s no surprise our paths converged back here. They drive me crazy sometimes and treat me like I\u2019m twelve, but it\u2019s fun even when it\u2019s total chaos with all the kids.</p><p>\u201cI love bein\u2019 the cool aunt who takes them to the park. Or brings them to my place for a sleepover. Or buys them gifts that annoy their parents. I pinch hit as a babysitter whenever they need me. But I mostly like being around them all the time. Watching them grow and change. Watching how marriage and parenthood has changed my brothers. Seeing them happy...\u201d Her voice caught and she turned away. Jack wouldn\u2019t understand the struggles her brothers faced to wind up where they were. How thrilled she was every damn day she got to watch them living their lives and being a part of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy, Keely?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happier now than I\u2019ve been in a long time. Most days I don\u2019t think about it. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Wondered if you\u2019d heard that biological clock ticking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly over the hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m curious. Since your brothers have so many kids, does that mean you want a bunch of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI like kids. I just never really thought about having them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019ll change when you find the right woman.\u201d</p><p>Jack gave her that odd look again. He pushed off the truck. \u201cI\u2019ll see you back at the apartment.\u201d</p><p>Weird dismissal. But nothing new when it came to Jack\u2019s moods. She\u2019d just opened the door, when Jack said, \u201cKeely. Wait.\u201d</p><p>She half-turned toward him, hating his face was obscured by shadows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever change. Not for your family. Not for your career. Not for the community. Not for a man.</p><p>Definitely not for me. You\u2019re perfect just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>How had Jack beat her home?</p><p>Because you sat in your truck for a good fifteen minutes trying to figure out what Jack meant.</p><p>Was that little speech Jack\u2019s way of telling her he liked her? Or worse, he respected her even when she wasn\u2019t his type?</p><p>Pointless to fret about now. She trudged up the stairs, not knowing which Jack she\u2019d find. Angry?</p><p>Demanding? Sweet? Aloof?</p><p>The apartment was dark. No TV. No blue glow from his laptop. She wandered to the small bedroom, wondering if he needed alone time. She honestly couldn\u2019t blame him; her family was overwhelming, especially to a loner like Jack.</p><p>Nope. Not there either.</p><p>Her bedroom was pitch black. He\u2019d even closed the curtains, cutting off the lone sliver of light from the streetlights at the front of the building.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Rather than risk waking him by turning on a light, she rummaged in her pajama drawer in the darkness and grabbed the first thing she\u2019d found. She stripped and yanked on the oversized T-shirt. As soon as she\u2019d crawled between the sheets and situated herself, Jack spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as wiggly as a worm.\u201d</p><p>Keely spooned behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re as hot as a furnace. You feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feeling a little...melancholy. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Stoic Jack confessed a crack in his emotional armor. \u201cWas it something I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how the hell to explain it.\u201d</p><p>Keely kissed the middle of his back. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for the longest time. Finally, he said, \u201cBeing around your family makes me miss my dad. Mostly it reinforces my regret of all we missed out on. Granted, we never had an easy relationship, but I thought we\u2019d have time to change that. Your family makes it look so effortless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. In fact it\u2019s hard living so close. Seems I\u2019m always overstepping boundaries. Or they\u2019re overstepping mine. I hated when my brothers were gone and I can\u2019t imagine only seeing them once a year.</p><p>But sometimes I wonder if distance isn\u2019t better. Makes the heart grow fonder and all that jazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you really see yourself living someplace else?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s non-response spurred Jack on.</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, Keely. I never saw myself living on the farm permanently. Not even as a kid. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and establish my own identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it that awful growing up there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI hated the constant backbreaking work. I watched my dad toil, year in year out. For what? He and my mother lived hand to mouth. It wasn\u2019t like he spent quality time with us. He liked his whiskey and he liked his quiet. He didn\u2019t have a great relationship with us kids because he couldn\u2019t be bothered to make the effort. So as I watched your brothers, with their kids, how they\u2019re all such great fathers, I wondered if I\u2019d inherited my father\u2019s worst qualities. If I was ever lucky enough to reproduce, if I\u2019d be a shitty father because that\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>She had to tread lightly, since this was the first time Jack had opened up to her. It was as enlightening as it was heartbreaking.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to be like my dad. It\u2019s sobering when I consider I am just like him. I\u2019m not a farmer, but what I do for a living is my personal measure of who I am as a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even now, I don\u2019t make the effort with my mother. Or Justin. Or anyone else. I\u2019m stuck in this fucked-up cycle and can\u2019t seem to change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to change it?\u201d</p><p>His body stiffened. \u201cLook. Just forget I said anything and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ooh. Dismissed again. Luckily she\u2019d gotten used to mood swings when she lived with Cam. Keely pushed away from his warmth and sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p>Jack rolled over. \u201cSorry I snapped. You don\u2019t have to go. Stay.\u201d</p><p>Keely ignored his assumption she\u2019d leave when he finally reached out to her. No way. She was sticking. She was annoying that way. She rooted round in her nightstand drawer until she found the pouch at the back. Palming it, she slid back between the sheets. \u201cI\u2019m not goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d She traced the frown lines on his forehead. The rise of his sharp cheekbones. The tensed line of his jaw. The grooves bracketing his sinful mouth. When he closed his eyes and sighed, she knew tonight he needed her to soothe him.</p><p>She straddled his pelvis and knocked the pillows aside, pinning his arms above his head.</p><p>His eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d Keely urged his lips to part, allowing her to direct the openmouthed kisses she craved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tested his reactions as she explored his mouth. Sucked on his tongue. Licked and nibbled and bit as long and as methodically as she pleased. Jack was an active participant, but he didn\u2019t try to wrest control.</p><p>She slid her lips up and down his neck. Tasting. He arched when Keely hit a sensitive spot with her tongue. He groaned when she sucked on the tendons straining for attention. She scattered kisses across his pectorals, relishing how the downy chest hair teased her cheek. Mmm. He smelled terrific too.</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, Jack.\u201d The tip of her wet tongue flicked his nipple. \u201cOr do you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be good, bad boy, or I will stop.\u201d</p><p>Jack slumped into the mattress with a terse, \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She bent to her task of mapping his pecs with her mouth. She traced the cut muscles with her tongue between lapping at his nipples. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you working out, so how is it that you maintain such a studly body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work out at home while I\u2019m watching TV. I\u2019ve used the weight room in the community center several times since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. So\u2014\u201d she licked his right nipple, \u201c\u2014very\u2014\u201d she licked it again,</p><p>\u201c\u2014very\u2014\u201d and she blew across the wet skin, watching that already taut nipple tighten further, \u201c\u2014glad.\u201d</p><p>His hips shot up. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me with that mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>Keely painted wet swirls on his abdomen, paying meticulous attention to that luscious six-pack. She dipped her tongue into his belly button; his cock jerked against her neck. She swept the pearly bead from the head and placed a smacking kiss on the middle of his shaft. \u201cScoot up and spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>He moved so fast she suspected he\u2019d gotten fabric burns on his ass.</p><p>For a minute, Keely admired the bounty before her. She\u2019d seen her share of cocks, but she admitted Jack\u2019s cock was beautiful. Big. Long and thick. The shaft itself was wide enough she couldn\u2019t circle her index finger and thumb around the girth. His black pubic hair wasn\u2019t too long or too short. She appreciated his manscaping.</p><p>She nuzzled his groin, inhaling the ultimate masculine scent that was as familiar as it was unique. She brought the pilfered pouch within reach and angled her head to suck his sac.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Man, she loved the way he groaned as she rolled his balls over her tongue. Sucking both together, then one at a time. She released them and flicked her tongue up the ridged vein of his cock until the tip reached the sweet spot below the head.</p><p>Keely half-expected he\u2019d be watching her intently with those sexy hooded eyes, but his head was on the mattress. His eyes were closed. He wasn\u2019t relaxed, but he\u2019d probably forgotten their entire conversation.</p><p>As much as she\u2019d enjoyed taking her time, Keely ended the sexual teasing. She wanted Jack\u2019s orgasm.</p><p>She\u2019d earned it. She swallowed that velvety heat into her mouth, just holding it there.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t grab her head. He didn\u2019t force his hips up. He stayed still and emitted another rough-edged moan.</p> <p>She slipped the Fukuoko 2000 onto the tip of her finger. She brought more of his cock into her mouth, letting the wetness guide him deeper. She sucked hard as she released the length back, letting her teeth nip the upper rim of the head as her tongue fluttered below it. Keely did this over and over.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before he rasped, \u201cGoddamn. Keely. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her head bobbed faster, keeping the strokes shallow. She flipped the tiny switch on the mini</p><p>\u201cmassager\u201d and placed the vibrating tip on the strip of skin behind his balls in front of his anus.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d</p><p>And Jack was toast. The instant his balls constricted, his cock hit the back of her throat and she swallowed each hot spurt. He came so violently, the bed shook. When she figured she\u2019d sucked every last drop and most of his brainpower, he slipped free from her mouth.</p><p>Several minutes passed. He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t reach for her. And Keely suddenly felt very unsure of herself and almost...shy. She pushed onto her knees, ready to flee.</p><p>But Jack hauled her against him so she sprawled across his chest. He took her mouth in a savage kiss.</p><p>After he finally relinquished her lips, he buried his face in her neck.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess you liked that after all?\u201d</p><p>He swatted her ass. Hard. \u201cYou even have to ask?\u201d He dusted delicate kisses on her cheek. \u201cThat was fucking amazing. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell.\u201d He breathed in her ear. \u201cDid having my cock in your mouth turn you on? If I slip my hand between your legs will I find you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrenched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should take care of that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could take care of it myself and you can watch.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s entire body went rigid. Then he growled, \u201cShow me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Keely straddled him again, staying up on her knees. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d She smiled naughtily and brought the Fukuoko to her mouth. She watched Jack\u2019s face as she licked it.</p><p>A dark hunger shot through his eyes and he growled again.</p><p>She set the plastic tip directly on her clit, flicked the switch and closed her eyes. Because she was primed from blowing Jack, that tightening, tingling sensation didn\u2019t build; it sideswiped her. Immediately.</p><p>Keely climaxed with a sharp gasp.</p><p>His slow, sensual smile brightened his face. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding about fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy as hell. Next time I\u2019ll be in charge of the vibrator selection, as I know you\u2019ve squirreled away a whole box of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Keely shoved the Fukuoko in the pouch, threw it on the nightstand and crawled into Jack\u2019s arms.</p><p>Before she drifted off, he whispered, \u201cThanks, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Due to a light schedule, Keely left work early. She drove to Moorcroft to check on the building process before she headed out to Colby and Channing\u2019s.</p><p>Jack was in a foul mood. He wasn\u2019t yelling, but speaking in clipped tones, wearing that don\u2019t-fuck-with-me look. Eyes hard, mouth flat, eyebrows drawn together. Plus, his hair nearly stood on end from jamming his hands through it.</p><p>Might make her a chickenshit, but she steered clear of him.</p><p>Chet and Remy were covered in dust and grime, leaning against the wall by the back door. Keely approached them cautiously. \u201cHey guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask how it\u2019s goin\u2019, \u2019cause I\u2019ll tell ya right now, it ain\u2019t goin\u2019 well, cuz. Not at all,\u201d Chet said.</p><p>A knot formed in her belly. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Remy took a long pull off his water before answering. \u201cNothin\u2019, that\u2019s the problem. Before we can get to the actual remodeling part you\u2019ve contracted us for, we have to tear down all the ruined materials and haul them out. That\u2019s what\u2019s taking the bulk of time you\u2019ve allotted. Jack ain\u2019t happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? That\u2019s part of the process, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no. We worked all damn day clearing out the lathe and plaster in the first room upstairs.</p><p>One room. Out of all these rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t slacking either,\u201d Chet added.</p><p>Her confused gaze moved between them. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t, sweetheart. But the truth is, you need to hire a demolition team to come in here and get it ready for us to start. We\u2019ve done our best to work around it, but the truth is...\u201d</p><p>Chet and Remy exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is: that\u2019s not their job, Keely.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and faced Jack. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been busting ass hoping it\u2019d get easier, but it hasn\u2019t. Neither the work nor the fact they should\u2019ve told you from the start that teardown wasn\u2019t configured in the contract.\u201d</p><p>Keely stared at her cousins with total mortification. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>Remy blushed. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s true. We didn\u2019t want you to feel bad. You\u2019re family and we wanna help you. Like Jack said, we thought we might be able to do the teardown easy, but we can\u2019t. And now we\u2019ve fallen behind, not only on Jack\u2019s timetable for this project, but on our other construction projects.\u201d</p><p>Not only was she fucking up her own project with her ignorance, but Jack\u2019s, as well as those West Construction had committed to. Keely had the overwhelming urge to hide her face in shame.</p><p>Buck up. This is what big girls do. Own up to their mistakes and make amends.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you guys finally telling me. I hate to think how much longer this might\u2019ve gone on if Jack hadn\u2019t forced the issue.\u201d She attempted a smile. \u201cSince we\u2019re being upfront with each other, I\u2019ll need timesheets for you both for the last week so I can pay you for the teardown you\u2019ve already done.\u201d</p><p>Chet protested. \u201cKeely. That\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. You work hard. I won\u2019t screw you out of money because you\u2019re too nice of guys. It ain\u2019t your fault I\u2019m just your clueless little cousin, okay? I can pay you.\u201d</p><p>Another silent communication passed between the brothers. Remy said, \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll have the paperwork filled out and here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You guys know any companies I could hire to come in and finish the teardown? So you can get started on your end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of one outfit from Meeteetsee, but last I heard they were starting a project in Livingston, Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they ain\u2019t cheap,\u201d Remy pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHow much money we talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Chet shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m guessing...about fifty, sixty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty or sixty what?\u201d Keely asked.</p><p>\u201cFifty or sixty thousand dollars. I believe that\u2019s a low number, even for around these parts,\u201d Jack inserted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keely\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of her head. Holy shit. That amount would eat a huge chunk of her budget for the first year. But if she didn\u2019t get it done...the clinic couldn\u2019t open. As it looked right now this dream of hers was nothing more than a pipedream. Her eyes burned hot with unshed tears.</p><p>Bawling wouldn\u2019t solve a damn thing. She needed to think this through. Like she should\u2019ve done from the beginning. It embarrassed her she\u2019d gone off half-cocked, believing she had the construction portion of the project under control.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help in whatever way we can, Keely, you know that,\u201d Remy said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI do know that.\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cI also know I\u2019m late for my babysitting gig with Colby and Channing\u2019s hellions. I\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t chase Keely down because she needed time to process her mistake. Later tonight they could discuss solutions like rational adults. He pointed to Chet\u2019s cooler. \u201cGot anything stronger than water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He pulled out a bottle of Coors Light. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jack cracked the top, tempted to drain it in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cSo can me and Remy ask you something, Jack, without you getting all pissed off at us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive it a shot, but no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t tell Keely she needed to budget separately for teardown? Especially since you were helping her figure out what it\u2019d take to get this place up to snuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn oversight. We\u2019ve all made them,\u201d he lied. \u201cI\u2019m kicking myself same as you guys are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fiery, independent woman. This oversight will drive her crazy. She\u2019ll blame herself, lose confidence, close down...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then she\u2019ll pull up her bootstraps and do what needs done,\u201d Remy added. \u201cShe ain\u2019t the type to stand around, wringing her hands and waiting for someone to rescue her. Which is damn amazing when you think about it. She could\u2019ve turned out so much differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen, bro.\u201d</p> <p>That startled him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve\u2014her brothers and cousins on both the McKay and West side\u2014looked out for her. She wouldn\u2019t have had to do nothin\u2019 but stand around and look pretty and helpless. But that\u2019s not what Keely is made of. That\u2019s not who she is now, or who she was even when she was a girl. She don\u2019t want nothin\u2019 handed to her. She learned to do things for herself. If she didn\u2019t know how to do something, she found folks to teach her. We admire the hell outta her for standing her ground when it\u2019d be easier to give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo her family?</p><p>\u201cYeah. God love our McKay cousins, but they would\u2019ve put the kibosh on her buying the building straight away. They would\u2019ve accidentally made Keely feel stupid for trying to do something without their help.\u201d</p><p>Jack scowled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong,\u201d Chet said. \u201cThey ain\u2019t cruel to her. And hell, I don\u2019t even think they realize they\u2019re doin\u2019 it. But because they\u2019re all older males, they don\u2019t see Keely in an adult role. They treat her like a little girl. And they\u2019d see purchasing this building as another one of Keely\u2019s whims. We knew how much it meant to her, fulfilling this lifelong dream. We also know that if this clinic project falls through, her family will act like it\u2019s no big deal, when it will crush her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is also why if she don\u2019t have the money to hire someone to do the teardown, she absolutely will not ask anyone in her family for financial help,\u201d Remy pointed out. \u201cHell, she\u2019ll be here with a crowbar and do the whole thing herself.\u201d</p><p>They were lost in their separate thoughts until Jack felt Chet and Remy\u2019s curious gazes on him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you and Keely are gonna get married, if she finds a company that\u2019ll do the teardown, would you be willing to pay for it?\u201d Chet asked carefully.</p><p>Another tricky question. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to help her. But we all know she won\u2019t take money from me. It\u2019s not because I can\u2019t afford it, but it\u2019ll be a matter of pride to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she wasn\u2019t none too happy to find out you owned the Sandstone Building, was she?\u201d Remy mused.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m living with her and she\u2019s still paying me rent. So as much as you guys didn\u2019t want to see her brothers crushing her dreams, I won\u2019t play a part in making her feel beholden to me. She hired me. She\u2019s paying me. In her mind when it comes to the building stuff I just work for her. Period.\u201d</p><p>Remy and Chet exchanged a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cYou saw how Keely acted. Did she fly in here and lay a sloppy kiss on me? No. Did she cry on my shoulder when she discovered she\u2019d made a big mistake that would cost her a pile? No. She bucked up, offered to rectify things with you two and she treated me like she would\u2019ve any other employee.\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, her behavior stung like hell. But this situation wasn\u2019t about him.</p><p>\u201cI get what you\u2019re sayin\u2019, Jack, I really do. I just wish there was some way to help her without any of us trying to sneak her money.\u201d</p><p>A solution started to form. \u201cHow many guys are on that crew out of Meeteetsee?\u201d</p><p>Remy scratched his chin. \u201cProbably a dozen. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they had a dozen guys on the clock, how long would it take to teardown this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days. But that\u2019d probably be milking it. Customers would freak if they thought the company could make fifty thou in a single day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we could get a dozen guys here, say tomorrow. For all day, would you two be willing to help me supervise what gets torn out and what stays?\u201d</p><p>Chet and Remy nodded at each other. \u201cAbsolutely. What did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but you\u2019ve got to promise me that Keely won\u2019t ever find out.\u201d</p><p>Jack called Carson McKay. He was actually relieved the ornery SOB answered with a gruff hello.</p><p>\u201cCarson. Jack Donohue. Got a minute to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly about that long. I gotta get Caro pretty quick. What did you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, Keely can\u2019t know I called you about this.\u201d</p><p>Carson harrumphed, which Jack took as assent.</p><p>Jack spun a tale about the company Keely hired for the teardown backing out. How it could jeopardize the entire clinic project because of time constraints. Keely was mightily upset, but she didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone in her family by asking for help.</p><p>\u201cThat girl. Don\u2019t she know we\u2019d do anything for her?\u201d Carson said with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I called you. If you show up at the building tomorrow with a bunch of guys ready to work, under the direction of me and Chet and Remy, Keely won\u2019t lose a single dollar, or a day on the timeframe of getting the building up to speed.\u201d</p><p>Carson was quiet for a minute or so but Jack suffered through it. Finally he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.</p><p>But I wanna know why you ain\u2019t takin\u2019 credit for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you Keely McKay is stubborn and filled with pride. If I arranged to fix it she\u2019d see it as me meddling in her business. And trust me, when it comes to that building, my relationship with her is all business.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cIf you show up with her brothers and assorted cousins wanting to help her out of a jam...she\u2019ll see it differently. Plus, all of you will have been involved in some part of the process, of this project that means everything to her.\u201d Jack paused. \u201cShe helps out her brothers all the time. In fact, she\u2019s watching Colby\u2019s kids right now. It\u2019d be good for your family to pay back that kindness when Keely needs it the most and expects it the least. And trust me, she needs it.\u201d</p><p>Another bout of silence.</p><p>\u201cYou got all the bases covered, son, and I can\u2019t fault you for lookin\u2019 out for her, in fact, I appreciate it. But how\u2019s that snoopy girl gonna believe I just happened to hear about her building troubles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. Chet and Remy. Just tell her you stopped by last night to see the progress after talking to her on Sunday. Chet and Remy mentioned issues with the teardown process. You went home, made a few calls and set up an old-fashioned barn raising in reverse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you ain\u2019t a politician, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, Carson, you sure know how to throw an insult like a damn dagger.\u201d</p><p>Carson chuckled. \u201cSee you tomorrow. But if this scheme backfires? I\u2019m rolling on you first, guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>Jack said, \u201cI\u2019d expect nothing less,\u201d to the dial tone.</p><p>Although Jack was restless, he dragged his laptop into the bedroom and caught up on paperwork. He figured trying to sleep was pointless, so it shocked him to wake up at one in the morning completely disoriented. He stacked his papers, powered down his laptop and wandered into the living room.</p><p>There she was, fully dressed, asleep on the couch.</p><p>A protective feeling expanded in his chest. He wanted to take care of her. And not just tonight. Jack lifted her into his arms.</p><p>She blinked her eyes sleepily. \u201cJack? What are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucking you in bed. You fell asleep on the couch, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got home and thought about watching TV but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn it on. I\u2019m hopeless with everything today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I\u2019ll show you tomorrow.\u201d Jack kicked the bedroom door shut.</p><p>\u201cI swear I just closed my eyes for a minute. Those kids of Colby\u2019s wear me out.\u201d</p><p>He set Keely on her feet by the bed. He undressed her down to panties and a tank top. She crept under the covers.</p><p>Once Jack was in bed, she wrapped herself around him. \u201cYou know, GQ, I\u2019m kinda starting to like you a little bit.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cSame goes, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>The next morning Keely started her day with less enthusiasm than usual. Jack had made coffee but he was already gone. He\u2019d left a note by her favorite mug, reminding her she\u2019d promised to pay Chet and Remy for the teardown work today. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last thing she wanted was to drive to Moorcroft and face her failure. She\u2019d thought about the problem and hadn\u2019t found a viable solution besides hiring a demolition company and trying to keep on schedule. Jack had allotted six weeks. They\u2019d nearly burned through two already.</p><p>Jack. He\u2019d been so sweet again last night. Carting her off to bed. Tucking her in hadn\u2019t made her feel like a child; it\u2019d made her feel cherished. Yesterday when she learned she\u2019d fucked up big time, Jack hadn\u2019t belittled her for her ignorance. He hadn\u2019t swooped in and offered to fix it for her.</p><p>Would you have taken his help if he\u2019d offered?</p> <p>No. No matter how good his intentions were, Keely couldn\u2019t take money from him. It was her mistake; she\u2019d find a way to fix it.</p><p>When she pulled up to the building an hour later, trucks were parked everywhere. Ten industrial-sized Dumpsters lined the parking lot. What the hell was going on?</p><p>She cautiously entered the building amidst the banging and hammering. Male voices echoed. Inside the main room, she gasped. The entire upper floor was an empty shell.</p><p>Keely called out, \u201cChet? Remy?\u201d</p><p>And whose head popped out first? Her father\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy? What on earth are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>He wiped his hands on a bandana and ambled toward her. \u201cNow hear me out, Keely, before you go getting that look on your face.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to demand, \u201cWhat look?\u201d but settled for, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night I stopped by to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked a bit with Chet and Remy. They indicated you were havin\u2019 issues with getting this place tore apart. So I went home and got to thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways dangerous,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He flapped the bandana at her. \u201cSmarty pants. Anyway, destroyin\u2019 stuff is what many of the McKays do best.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI made a few calls. And here we are, doin\u2019 our best to tear this place down so the West boys can build it back up.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t say a word. She was absolutely stunned. And touched. And about to break down and sob.</p><p>\u201cGirlie, it scares me when you get all quiet.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak around the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cAw, hell, you ain\u2019t pissed off are ya?\u201d He sighed softly, nervously wiping his hands with the bandana. \u201cI just wanted to help out. Seems like you don\u2019t need me now that you\u2019re all grown up.\u201d</p><p>No way could she stop the tears, or from launching herself at him. \u201cDaddy. I-I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby girl,\u201d he soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>Keely breathed him in, sun-warmed cotton and honest sweat, coffee and Red Man tobacco, English Leather cologne and the hint of her mother\u2019s perfume. Scents that offered her comfort, security and assurance like nothing else in her life. She whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll always need you. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d He squeezed her so strongly she could scarcely breathe. She cried harder when he gruffly said, \u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>After her dad released her, Keely wiped her tears with her fingers. He handed her a hankie with a crusty, \u201cHere. Don\u2019t understand why the sex that\u2019s always cryin\u2019 about something never remembers a damn hankie.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThanks, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, punkin. You ain\u2019t gonna believe all they got done already. Chet and Remy are supervising.</p><p>So\u2019s Jack. He\u2019s a damn taskmaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well I know that.\u201d</p><p>Inside the building, she could barely hear above the sounds of progress. Cord and Colby worked upstairs with Carter. In the backroom, Chet and Remy pulled out wiring while Trevor and Edgard gently pried off mopboards.</p><p>Colt, Quinn, Ben and Kade were ripping out lathe and plaster in the front room. Buck, Cam, Brandt, Dalton, Tell and her uncles Calvin and Charles were removing sections of ceiling. Whoa. Carson McKay had called everybody. Her assorted male relatives smiled at her and returned to the grind.</p><p>Her dad started toward the front door and Keely snagged his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He winced.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p><p>He showed her the inside of his left forearm. Beneath the rip in his shirt was a bloody scratch.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Jack were bustin\u2019 a cabinet outta the bathroom. Damn thing sliced me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll fix you up.\u201d Outside, Keely unearthed the first aid kit from underneath the front seat of her truck. She swabbed the area with a disinfectant pad, smeared on antibiotic cream and covered it with a square bandage. She even placed a healing kiss on it. \u201cThere. Good as new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Your mama\u2019s gonna give me hell for rippin\u2019 my shirt.\u201d</p><p>Keely rolled her eyes. \u201cMama never gives you hell about nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He bussed her forehead. \u201cHow little you know, girlie.\u201d He ambled around the corner.</p><p>That\u2019s when Keely saw Jack waiting on the steps. Buoyant, she made a beeline for him and he caught her in a tight hug. She swallowed his surprised laughter with a deep kiss that turned unexpectedly gentle.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor tucking me in last night. For making coffee this morning. For supervising this teardown even though it isn\u2019t part of your job description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stick around and help since I rescheduled my Friday clients for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. With this many guys, it\u2019ll be done fast.\u201d Jack rubbed his lips over hers. \u201cAnd for being McKays, they take direction surprisingly well.\u201d</p><p>Keely rested her forehead to his, feeling all choked up again.</p><p>\u201cBaby. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I ever supposed to repay them, Jack? Thank you isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s above and beyond even for family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for them, it\u2019s not. They\u2019re doing it for you, because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you are so nice I can\u2019t believe I ever hated you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. Longer. Deeper. Sweeter.</p><p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d Cam yelled out.</p><p>\u201cGet back to work,\u201d Remy added.</p><p>Male laughter echoed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna give you crap for the rest of the day for that lip lock, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for the challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Lucky for Keely the day didn\u2019t drag as much as she\u2019d feared. She finished at the clinic and drove back to Moorcroft, anxious to see the changes.</p><p>Dusk had fallen. The vehicles were gone. She unlocked the back door and ventured inside. She didn\u2019t need a spotlight to see the differences; the place was empty. Completely empty. Walls gone. Ceiling gone.</p><p>Plumbing gone. Electrical gone. The space was a blank slate. A clean canvas.</p><p>For the first time it felt like hers.</p><p>Keely tried to envision where the spaces would be divided into patient rooms. What the refurbished woodwork would look like. If the tin ceiling would gleam after one hundred years of grime was removed.</p><p>Giddy, she spun around on the wooden floor, arms flung open wide, laughing. Trying to capture the moment\u2014her dream was finally within reach.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Jack was ready to walk out the door when Keely whirled in like a tornado. Her mouth ran a million miles an hour.</p><p>\u201cSo I drove back to Moorcroft after I got off work and I\u2019m stunned. I cannot believe they finished all of it today. I\u2019m peeing my pants I\u2019m so pumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a visual I needed, Keely.\u201d</p><p>She took in his appearance. \u201cWhere are you goin\u2019 all duded up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut with Carter. Wearing clean pants and a sweater hardly qualifies me as duded up,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, GQ.\u201d She bussed his cheek. \u201cYou look nice and smell even better. What\u2019re you guys doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating first, then hashing through details for a couple projects I\u2019ve lined up for him.\u201d</p><p>Keely looked at him quizzically. \u201cYou Carter\u2019s pimp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking. He\u2019s greatly underappreciated in the western art world.\u201d He adjusted his sleeves. \u201cNo big deal. I do what I can to get his name out there. Pass along commercial contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew you were so invested in Carter\u2019s career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t tell anyone, either,\u201d he warned. \u201cHe\u2019d be pissed as hell if he thought I\u2019d blabbed to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re in luurrve. You\u2019re supposed to tell me everything.\u201d Keely left a smacking kiss on his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my lips are sealed. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dart league starts at eight.\u201d</p><p>Jack narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou play in a dart league? Why didn\u2019t I know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d think it hopelessly lowbrow so I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d She hopped from foot to foot as she took off her boots. Then she sailed into the bedroom.</p><p>He followed her and leaned against the jam as he watched her undress. \u201cHow long have you been playing darts?\u201d</p><p>Keely whipped off her shirt. \u201cIn a league? Six months. But Colt taught me to play when I was a kid. I was a lousy shot with a bow and arrow. He thought darts might teach me hand-eye coordination, but I just ended up liking darts more than shooting bow.\u201d She flipped through the hangers in the closet.</p><p>\u201cWhat other hobbies do you have that I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarts ain\u2019t exactly a hobby. It\u2019s an excuse to hang out with my friends and drink beer. They\u2019ve been trying to get me to join a volleyball league but it doesn\u2019t interest me. I\u2019m in a book club, but half the time I don\u2019t read the damn \u2018literary\u2019 books they pick because they\u2019re total downers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat would you rather read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErotic romances.\u201d Keely winked. \u201cAs far as other activities? I\u2019m on the volunteer list for the community center and fill in when someone\u2019s sick or on vacation. Oh, and I like to dance.\u201d</p><p>Jack wondered if her excessive social calendar was because she didn\u2019t like being alone. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever stay home and relax? Kick off your boots and stay a while?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. But my idea of relaxing and yours are way different.\u201d</p><p>Why did he bristle? \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI relax when I\u2019m asleep. Reclining in front of the TV as a way to relax? No thanks. I\u2019d rather do things with real live people instead of pretending what happens on a sitcom or dramedy or reality show matters. Connections matter to me. And there\u2019s nothing more relaxing than laughing with family and friends.\u201d Keely buttoned the last button of the India\u2019s Ink dart league shirt.</p><p>For Christsake. This woman played in a dart league sponsored by a tattoo shop. She had tattoos. She drove a dirty pickup. She had fifty different colored pairs of shitkickers. She had a social life to rival Paris Hilton\u2019s. Did he have a single thing in common with her besides phenomenal sex?</p><p>Yes. You need each other to get your careers on track.</p> <p>Sometimes Jack forgot the big picture. Sometimes he forgot their relationship wasn\u2019t real. What really pissed him off was sometimes he even forgot Keely wasn\u2019t his type.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of families. Last night Channing dropped the bomb she\u2019s having a girl! No one tells me anything important these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s important you don\u2019t make plans for tomorrow night because we need to talk about the Milford trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Thursday night is my night to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack held up his hand stopping her protest. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your night to shoe horses or to craft quilts or to can pickled beets. I need you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Keely brushed past him. In the doorway to the bathroom she turned. \u201cHave fun with Carter.</p> <p>But don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t wait up for me.</p><p>Jack ground his teeth together. Three hours had passed and her parting shot still rankled.</p><p>\u201cJack? Buddy? You\u2019re gonna have an embolism if you keep scowling like that. So tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister drives me fucking crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s news?\u201d Carter laughed. \u201cThe fact you two haven\u2019t killed each other by now is newsworthy. Never in a million years would I have predicted you two as a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me...what did my little sis do to piss you off? Earlier at the jobsite you guys were goin\u2019 at it hot and heavy. I thought my dad was gonna get the hose out and spray you down.\u201d</p> <p>Jack scraped his hands over the razor stubble on his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she has to be doing something all the time. Why can\u2019t she just stay home? It\u2019s like she can\u2019t stand to be by herself.\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>At first, Jack wondered if he\u2019d overstepped his bounds. Then he worried Keely had kept something important from him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely didn\u2019t tell you how she\u2019s spent the last five years?\u201d</p><p>Jack squirmed. He should\u2019ve kept his mouth shut. He should know all about his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s past. If he showed his ignorance, Carter would get suspicious.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt figures she didn\u2019t fill you in.\u201d Carter signaled the waitress for another round.</p><p>When Carter didn\u2019t start talking, Jack got both worried and pissed off. \u201cYou can\u2019t drop something like that into conversation and leave it there to fester, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not festering, Donohue. I\u2019m debating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>That blue gaze identical to Keely\u2019s pinned Jack in place. \u201cOn if I should keep my big mouth reputation in the family and just flat out tell you, or if I oughta let it fester so you\u2019re forced to ask Keely about it. Part of me thinks if she would\u2019ve wanted you to know, she would\u2019ve told you herself. But part of me thinks it\u2019s your right to know.\u201d</p><p>When the waitress swung buy with more beer, Jack ordered two shots of Wild Turkey.</p><p>Carter leaned back in the booth. His posture wasn\u2019t lazy, but challenging. \u201cIf you think getting me drunk will make me spill my guts, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree, pal.\u201d</p><p>What was up with this family and the colorful colloquialisms? \u201cThe shots are for me, not you.\u201d</p><p>The silence stretched between them until the waitress brought the whiskey shots. Jack drained one and set the other aside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze shot to Carter\u2019s. \u201cKeely?\u201d He snorted. \u201cRight. Talk about oil and water. Fire and ice.</p><p>Concrete and glass.\u201d</p><p>His comment must\u2019ve alleviated Carter\u2019s misgivings. He set his elbows on the table. \u201cIf I tell you this, Jack, I need your word that you will not tip off Keely that you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Cam and Domini got married we were all together for some family holiday. The kids were watching a movie in the family room, the babies were asleep and it was just adults around the dining room table, which rarely happens. We\u2019re bullshitting, teasing one another, like we always do, when someone, I don\u2019t even remember who, tossed off a comment about Cam not pulling his weight with the ranch\u2014a total joke, right? I mean, we\u2019d just gotten Cam interested in being part of the family again and none of us wanted to fuck that up. So they start picking on me and I volleyed it back, and the next thing we were all ragging on Keely.</p><p>\u201cEven before she\u2019d moved into Domini\u2019s apartment she\u2019d disappear for days\u2014sometimes weeks on end. As far as we knew, she worked part time at the VA in Cheyenne a couple days a month and that was her only job. We wondered if she had a guy on a string keeping her away from home. So we teased her about being too busy chasing tail to get a real job, or to help out at the ranch. I\u2019ll admit we were total dicks to her, bringing up stupid shit she\u2019d done in the past. Treating her like she was a bratty preteen.</p><p>Questioning her work ethic after living in the big city. Normally Keely would fire insults right back, but she got quieter and quieter. We were so busy ribbing her we didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s gut knotted\u2014not from the shot of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cEventually we pushed her too far. Keely stood up and said the reason no one in our family knew what she\u2019d been up to during her trips to Cheyenne was because we were all a bunch of self-absorbed pricks and hadn\u2019t bothered to ask about her life. We all sort of looked at each other in shock and realized she was right.</p><p>\u201cWhen she wasn\u2019t working at the VA or private hospitals in Cheyenne and Ft. Collins, she was moonlighting on the rodeo circuit as a sports med tech for extra cash. The reason she didn\u2019t have energy to expend on her measly portion of the testosterone ranch was because she was exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeasly portion of the ranch?\u201d Jack repeated.</p><p>Carter stopped to sip his beer. \u201cLong, involved legal gibberish I won\u2019t go into.\u201d</p><p>But Carter did detail the personal sacrifices Keely made for Cam to get him back on track after his discharge from the army. Putting her schooling on hold, keeping her assorted relatives at bay at Cam\u2019s request, even angering them and shouldering the blame. Jack was beyond stunned, listening to the depth of Keely\u2019s commitment to her family, hearing about her generosity and her determination\u2014to the exclusion of fulfilling her own dreams.</p><p>\u201cThe hell of it was after we all compared stories, we realized as well as Keely knew all of us, we didn\u2019t know her as an adult at all. That\u2019s what hurt her the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it did.\u201d Jack knocked back the other shot, struggling to control his emotions, mostly his admiration for the woman who acted out of love with no expectation but to be loved in return. It was damn humbling to realize he\u2019d never had that deep connection with any one person, let alone the sheer number of people Keely connected with on a daily basis. The sheer number of people who benefited just from having Keely McKay in their lives.</p><p>What would it be like to be on the receiving end of such devotion? Or to have the balls to give it back in return without fear?</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Carter prompted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Everything. \u201cNothing. Just trying to wrap my head around all this about Keely. AJ didn\u2019t know what she was up to? What about Chassie? Or Ramona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess is Ramona knew what Keely was doing. AJ and Chassie are wrapped up in husbands and kids, whereas Ramona is single and probably understands Keely\u2019s drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe groveled. Big time.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed softly. Even when his heart broke a little for the woman who gave so much.</p><p>\u201cShe cried a lot and called us names, but she forgave us because she\u2019s just that way. Girl\u2019s got a heart as big as Wyoming.\u201d Carter rubbed his chin. \u201cMy point is, you are more like her than you realize, Jack.</p><p>You both work hard to keep your personal and professional lives separate. I figure she\u2019s entitled to be out every night of the week if it makes up for all the years she didn\u2019t get to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun? Weren\u2019t you the one who told me she was such a wild child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn high school,\u201d Carter scoffed. \u201cThat was a decade ago. She might\u2019ve mixed it up a little when she first went off to college in Denver, or cut loose when she came home, but her life changed after Cam was injured.\u201d</p><p>That made sense. But why hadn\u2019t Keely shared any of this? Didn\u2019t she trust him? Especially after he\u2019d opened up to her about his family issues? He took a deep breath, trying to relieve the tension distorting his muscles. \u201cI appreciate you telling me.\u201d</p><p>But Carter wasn\u2019t paying attention to him. His focus was beyond Jack\u2019s shoulder. He muttered, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. I\u2019m getting tired. Now that we\u2019re done with business we oughta hit the road.\u201d</p><p>Jack squinted at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s ten. You don\u2019t have the wife and kids here. I\u2019m not all in for getting shitfaced, but why are you so eager to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>Then Jack knew. Keely was here. The question was: who was she here with? \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the dance floor.\u201d</p><p>He wished he had another goddamn shot to suck down. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>Carter shook his head.</p><p>Jack snarled.</p><p>Before he bolted, Carter grabbed his forearm. \u201cIt\u2019s just her friend Michael. Don\u2019t go after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Michael I\u2019m going after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait around.\u201d He tore his arm from Carter\u2019s grip and exited the booth.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t barrel up and pull Keely off the dance floor. He watched from the shadows, planning to ambush her. If she fought, he\u2019d drag her out of the damn bar by her hair.</p><p>When had he started giving into his caveman mentality?</p><p>The fast song ended. Some crap with too much slide steel guitar and a mournful fiddle started. His ears threatened to bleed. He hated country music. But he wouldn\u2019t stand by and let another man hold his woman.</p><p>Jack stalked to the dance floor. The guy with his hands on Keely leapt back.</p><p>\u201cKeely and I are just friends. We were just dancin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Keely whirled around. \u201cJack? What are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised to see me, buttercup?\u201d He gave Michael a feral smile. \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><p>The guy left skid marks he dashed off so fast.</p> <p>\u201cOh. My. God. You did not just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack grabbed her, plastering their bodies together. He put his mouth on her ear. \u201cI warned you. The only man allowed to touch you is me. That includes dancing. So make nice or I will make the rest of your night a living hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOh, cowgirl, that was the wrong thing to say.\u201d He spun them and in the process slipped his thigh between her legs. Every time he moved, he ground the hard muscle into her pussy.</p><p>She hissed, \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You aren\u2019t scared of me, remember? You aren\u2019t scared if I keep this up I\u2019ll make you come right out here on the dance floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want it. Your body is quivering.\u201d Jack nuzzled her cheek. \u201cI feel your nipples poking into my chest. You\u2019re excited. If I wiggled my hand into your jeans right now, would I find you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doin\u2019 this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can. And you\u2019ll be goddamn lucky if making you come out here is all I do to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>In a fit of pique, Keely attempted to turn her head away.</p><p>Jack was having none of it. He forced her chin up and sealed his mouth to hers. She reacted as he expected: she fought him for five seconds and kissed him back with equal abandon.</p><p>Throughout the kiss and the slow dance he kept grinding his thigh into her clit. Rubbing back and forth the way that set her off. Her sex was fire hot riding his leg. His heart pounded as hard as hers.</p><p>Keely clenched her shaking thighs around his, a signal she was close to exploding.</p><p>He slid his leg away, allowing his lips to cling to hers for several heartbeats before he broke his mouth free.</p><p>\u201cJack. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will let you come on one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will follow me as soon as this song is finished. No questions asked. No saying goodbye to your friends. Just you and me, Keely, settling this my way, however I see fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight answer.\u201d Jack shoved his thigh back to where she most needed it. \u201cClose your eyes. Feel the friction of the fabric on your clit. Is your pussy hot and throbbing? Wishing my cock was riding you instead of you riding my leg? Do you know how hard my dick is right now? You do that to me. Make me so fucking hard I can\u2019t see straight.\u201d Jack\u2019s mouth returned to her ear. \u201cCome on me. I want you so wet and hot that you soak through your jeans and leave a wet spot on mine.\u201d</p><p>She started to come and he swallowed her cry in another hungry kiss.</p><p>As Jack felt the pulsing and tightening of her cunt around his thigh, he clenched his quad harder, increasing the pressure. He stroked her hair. To anyone watching, they appeared to be a couple lost in a sweet moment.</p><p>Keely finally unlocked his leg, dropping her forehead to his chest as she tried to level her breathing.</p><p>The song ended. Jack led her off the dance floor, past the bar and down a deserted hallway. He checked both ways and dragged her into the men\u2019s room. Better bet than the always-busy ladies room.</p><p>Inside, he flipped the lock.</p><p>Panic flitted through Keely\u2019s eyes. \u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word.\u201d He faced her body toward the door. In no time he unhooked her rhinestone belt and unzipped her jeans. Flattening his palm on her abdomen, he followed her damp mound until his fingers met creamy wetness. Fuck she was hot. He jerked her jeans out of his way. \u201cHands above your head.\u201d</p><p>Jack loosened his pants and yanked his boxers to his knees. Pressing his left hand over her pussy, he angled her pelvis and aligned his cock. Her warm, wet heat beckoned him. He flexed his hips and impaled her.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast and dirty, cowgirl.\u201d Jack plunged in and out, gritting his teeth against coming immediately. The incessant pleasure of fucking her was almost too much. \u201cI wanted to ream your sassy little ass. But I\u2019ll save that for when I have you bound, at my mercy.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered.</p><p>Jack hammered into her without pause. Sweat dripping into his eyes. Snaking down his spine. His primal side urged him to use his teeth to mark her. On her shoulder. Her neck. So when she saw the symbol of his passion she\u2019d remember who had the right to touch her. To pleasure her. He rotated his hand and stroked her clit with his middle finger.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t stop. Faster.\u201d</p><p>She was so wet keeping hold of that slippery nubbin proved difficult. He curled his fingers and pinched her clit with his knuckles. Squeezing as his cock rammed into her.</p><p>Blessed release teased him. His muscles tightened from the base of his neck clear down between his legs, yanking his testicles up. He shot like a rocket. \u201cJesus, fucking Christ.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s pussy convulsed around his cock, every rhythmic pull brought him deeper into her slick feminine heat. He couldn\u2019t stop pumping his pelvis because her climax triggered a second one for him.</p><p>Holy fuck. That\u2019d never happened before. He let his head fall back as he rode out another set of hot pulses.</p><p>His mind blanked. Finally the drip drip drip of the faucet and the tick tick tick of the heater roused him, the sounds mingled with their broken breaths.</p><p>Jack eased out and Keely\u2019s legs buckled. He wrapped his arms around her waist, holding her upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d He stroked her hair, soothing her. Petting her until she found her equilibrium. \u201cYou okay to get dressed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>As Jack righted his own clothes, he considered apologizing to her for his obsession with needing to nail her, right fucking now, in a bathroom of a honky-tonk. But Keely didn\u2019t appear to have any regrets.</p><p>God knew he didn\u2019t. He kissed the back of her head and whispered, \u201cYou need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just...\u201d Her body shook. \u201cJack. We\u2019re gonna kill each other if we keep this up.\u201d</p><p>That was putting it mildly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt freaks me the hell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Come on, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Keely gazed at the vast nothingness. Dirt in shades of orange, tan and dusty gray. Scraggly trees. An endless horizon with mountains too far away to trust the vista would improve.</p><p>And people thought Wyoming was ugly? Had they ever been outside Milford, Utah?</p><p>\u201cI heard that sigh.\u201d Jack rubbed his rough thumb across her knuckle. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No. As strange as it was to be heading into Jack\u2019s territory, so to speak, convincing his clients they were madly in love, it was stranger yet to be holding Jack\u2019s hand. Just because they both wanted to. Or maybe they needed to.</p><p>After the \u201cbathroom incident\u201d Jack had started acting proprietary all the times, not just in public. Part of her believed his response was in preparation for this event. Another part understood Jack had staked an invisible claim on her. A claim he wasn\u2019t ready to verbally own up to even when he\u2019d physically left his mark on her.</p><p>Keely had no clue how to feel about that.</p><p>After she\u2019d returned home from the bar that night, Jack whisked her off to bed. His solicitous caresses lulled her to sleep.</p><p>Then last night, he\u2019d picked up dinner and they\u2019d detailed the Milford trip. Afterward, he coaxed her into wearing a hat as she rode him cowgirl style on the couch. The sexy, fun romp had shown a playful side of Jack. When they\u2019d tucked themselves in for the night, Jack insisted on twining his body around hers.</p><p>It was enough to make a girl think he loved her.</p><p>It was enough to make a girl fall completely in love with him.</p><p>Only a foolish girl would believe this situation is more than a business arrangement. Once you both have what you want, the Jack and Keely show will be over forever.</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t consider herself a foolish girl, but she\u2019d never been so confused about love before, mainly because she\u2019d never been in love like this. It scared her to death.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about twenty miles out,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me the topography improves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even slightly. They set a town in the middle of this because there\u2019s water nearby and the railroad goes through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why my great-great grandfather landed in Wyoming territory. Being tied to the land for generations is an incentive to stay. But what would make someone move to Milford now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do people move to Sundance?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cNot many do. They\u2019ve got more money than God and can afford the outrageous land prices, and don\u2019t have to rely on earning a living locally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a harsh assessment for your beloved hometown.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true. We are reverse snobs. Any of those \u2018new-age\u2019 types who try and gain a foothold in the community have a hard time. Most don\u2019t stick around long. We don\u2019t like change. We like our guns, we like our beef, we like the money from coal and oil. We like to challenge anyone who tries to take it away from us. If you don\u2019t embrace all that is our western way of life...well, we ain\u2019t got time for ya.\u201d</p><p>Jack tapped his fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cSo when Henry asks where we\u2019re going to live after we\u2019re married, you\u2019ll say...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll split our time between Colorado and Wyoming for now, but after we start having babies, we\u2019ll settle in Sundance because it\u2019s a good place to raise kids and I have lots of family around the area.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a sideways glance. \u201cThat sounded a little rote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s what you want me to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019d say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it didn\u2019t matter where we lived because anywhere you are is my home.\u201d</p><p>Jack sent her another look, a softer one. \u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be morbidly sappy and embarrass you.\u201d She pulled her hand from his, needing to distance herself. \u201cThanks for not making me listen to that jazz crap for the last two hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame might be said for you saving my ears from the noise pollution that passes for country music.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t seem to mind it the other night when you gave me an orgasm on the dance floor during</p><p>\u201cYou Look So Good In Love\u201d.</p><p>Yeah, she wasn\u2019t bringing up that reminder.</p><p>Jack pointed. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>They crested a rise. The town spread looked like any ordinary small town. But as soon as they hit the city limits, Keely could see the difference. It was...clean. The houses were well maintained. No rusted swing sets or broken down bicycles. Once they passed into the commercial area, there was more diversity.</p><p>No regular billboards, say nothing of flashing billboards.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. It\u2019s like...the flashback to the town\u2019s past in the movie Back to the Future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Jack grinned at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll freak when you see the clock in the town square. It\u2019s right outside our hotel.\u201d</p><p>Keely gawked at everything. Jack pointed out the architectural details he liked and loathed. He waxed poetic about the potential, meshing visions with reality, style with modern amenities. Happy as she was to hear his excitement about his work, he lost her a couple times. She half-feared Jack would blame her if he wasn\u2019t awarded this job. But he wouldn\u2019t have a shot at the project at all if it wasn\u2019t for their fake engagement. Yet, she had an uneasy feeling.</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>Her attention returned to him. \u201cWhat? Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I boring you?\u201d</p><p>A dutiful fianc\u00e9e would lie and make him feel good. \u201cMaybe some.\u201d Shit. She waited for him to toss an insult back at her.</p><p>But Jack released a resigned sigh. \u201cI\u2019m told I ramble on sometimes. If it appears my client\u2019s eyes are glazing over when I\u2019m talking, could you give me a sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Got a sign in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTap on your chin with your index finger?\u201d</p><p>She thrust out her chest in a sex kitten move. \u201cOr I could just flash them my tits, baby.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Jack said, \u201cI\u2019m the only one who gets to read that sign, buttercup.\u201d He kissed her. The quick peck morphed into something...more.</p><p>A rap sounded on the window.</p><p>They broke apart guiltily.</p><p>A middle-aged bellman in a spiffy red tasseled hat smiled through Keely\u2019s window. \u201cMay I help you out, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Sure. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jack popped the locks and the trunk. The bellman lifted the bags out and wheeled them to the front desk. Another red-hat-wearing bellman held the door and Jack slipped him the car keys.</p><p>Keely noticed the matronly woman at the check-in desk also wore a red uniform, complete with tasseled hat. Had she somehow stumbled into a Shriners secret hideout?</p><p>\u201cMr. Donohue, so happy to have you back at the Milford Inn.\u201d The woman behind the desk beamed.</p><p>\u201cAnd this lovely young woman must be your fianc\u00e9e? Kelly McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely,\u201d she corrected gently. \u201cTwo e\u2019s, one l. Common mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m so sorry. Such a pretty name. I\u2019ll just get that changed.\u201d Her fingers flew across the keys.</p><p>\u201cThere. Done. I have you on the second floor.\u201d She slid the key card envelope across the desk. \u201cHorace will help you with your bag.\u201d</p><p>Keely felt like an idiot looking to Jack for direction. Normally she\u2019d take the bag herself. In this situation was she supposed to let her fianc\u00e9 haul the luggage? Or let the man decide to hand the responsibility to the bellhop?</p><p>Jack smiled at Horace. \u201cYou can take my bag up to my room too.\u201d He handed the man a folded bill.</p><p>\u201cMr. Donohue is on the third floor.\u201d She passed a piece of paper with the room numbers to Horace and he rolled the suitcases to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your key, Mr. Donohue. Please let us know if we can assist you in any way during your stay.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget if you need room service, it\u2019s available twenty-four hours a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated, Mrs. Trudeau.\u201d Jack slipped his hand into hers and they strolled out the front door.</p><p>After half a block, Keely dug her heels in and faced Jack. \u201cSeparate rooms? On separate floors?</p><p>Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery old fashioned, I know, but you can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s one line we can\u2019t cross, Keely, sneaking into each other\u2019s rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad I brought my vibrator.\u201d</p><p>Jack choked out, \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re so easy. But we can have phone sex, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only two nights.\u201d He rubbed his thumb over her wrist in a lazy, sexy manner and she knew his eyes smoldered behind his sunglasses. \u201cHave you gotten so used to having me in your bed you\u2019ll miss me if I\u2019m not there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say yes?\u201d she asked coyly.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have raunchy phone sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll still have raunchy phone sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, GQ, you\u2019re easy.\u201d A total lie. Jack Donohue was the least easy man she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>In the hour they wandered, several shopkeepers came out to greet them. She counted three hair salons and two barbershops. One large drugstore. Two furniture stores. Three diner-type restaurants. Assorted boutiques, featuring purses, costume jewelry and shoes. Those fancy, exclusive shops made her break out in hives.</p><p>Keely wasn\u2019t a \u201cshopper\u201d any more than she was a girly-girl. She bought her clothes at western stores or outlet malls. She didn\u2019t spend time agonizing over what to wear, although she had a weakness for funky cowgirl boots. She managed to slather on makeup most days, but not in excess.</p><p>Her one indulgence was lilac-scented lotion and oil from Sky Blue, a company her cousin Kade\u2019s wife, Skylar, owned that specialized in naturally made beauty products. But she probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered if the store wasn\u2019t right below her apartment.</p><p>With Jack gone in meetings all day tomorrow, hopefully she\u2019d have time to explore on her own.</p><p>A horrible thought struck her. What if the wives of the committee members had planned her day for her? What would she do?</p><p>Buck up. This is important to Jack.</p><p>\u201cKeely? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cNothing. We should go back to the hotel so I can freshen up before dinner.\u201d</p><p>They parted ways in the hotel lobby. Probably so the front desk could report she and Jack weren\u2019t sneaking in a quick fuck before happy hour. Right. No cocktail hour in Milford.</p><p>Keely hung up her clothes and checked out the room. Tall windows covered in chintz and velvet draperies. Fussy furniture with spindly legs and loud fabrics. The headboard was wood gilded with gold.</p><p>Fancy place. Too fancy for her taste. She preferred a relaxed, casual atmosphere where she wasn\u2019t afraid to put her boots on the coffee table.</p><p>Maybe she should take a nap. They\u2019d stumbled out of bed at the butt crack of dawn to drive to Rapid City. After hopping a plane to Salt Lake City, they made the two-hour trek to Milford via rental car. She yawned and closed her eyes.</p><p>Her cell phone buzzing on the mattress woke her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of the country for three freakin\u2019 weeks and I come back to find out you\u2019re engaged? To Jack Donohue of all people? Jesus. What the fuck, Keels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, Ramona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It just caught me by surprise. I got the text message with the engagement picture and the engagement party invite from Aunt Carolyn. But no squealing phone call from you. No gossipy tidbits from our other relatives about you being knocked up... They all expressed the same WTF reaction I had. So tell me K, is it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was fast.\u201d She offered the condensed version of her courtship with Jack.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d At least that much wasn\u2019t a lie, but it wasn\u2019t any easier to admit. She\u2019d done the one thing he\u2019d warned her about and she\u2019d feared: she\u2019d fallen in love with him.</p><p>Ramona didn\u2019t say much. \u201cAre you at home right now with the new stud of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jack has a client thing in Utah and I\u2019m with him. Where were you gone to for three weeks?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d Ramona said with no sarcasm. \u201cI fired my travel coordinator the second I had cell service in the States. Trust me, you do not want to hear me whine about the Orient.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou okay? For being wildly in luurrve and all, you don\u2019t sound like your chipper self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous about meeting Jack\u2019s clients. I do not want to say or do anything to fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re charming, funny and you can drink any man under the table. At least you used to, but damn, you\u2019ve been dull as dirt the last few years, cuz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRamona!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidding. Sheesh. Should I build up your confidence with serious stuff since your sense of humor has vanished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with the obvious. What are you wearing tonight?\u201d</p><p>Keely rolled her eyes. Ramona lived the code \u201cclothes make the woman\u201d and truly believed all that fashionista crap. \u201cI\u2019m wearing my emerald moleskin skirt, brown boots with the orange and green butterflies, a slim-fitting, button-up shirt in dark tan and a brown bolero jacket.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. How many events do you have to dress for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more tomorrow night and that\u2019s formal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you pack?\u201d</p><p>Keely described her engagement dress.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds perfect, but showcase your personality by adding a splash of color. Look for a funky scarf in those shops you\u2019re hitting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Funky. Right. Milford, Utah didn\u2019t like funky.</p> <p>\u201cOh, and I\u2019m sending you a box of samples I picked up. One pair of jeans will make you look totally hot. You\u2019ll be a trendsetter in Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother dream realized,\u201d she said dryly. She tacked on, \u201cThanks, Ramona,\u201d lest her cousin stop sending her free, cast-off western clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta run, hon, I just wanted to send my love and give you congrats on hooking a hottie. Does he have a big dick too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And he knows how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch. Call me next week when you get the clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock \u2019em dead, Keely. I have total faith in you.\u201d</p><p>After she hung up she stared at the ceiling. \u201cAt least someone does.\u201d</p> <p>Keely swore she\u2019d make the best of the next two days, her last two days with Jack as his fake fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>She\u2019d smile and act happy, even when it hurt that this make-believe situation was nearly over.</p><p>Too bad her feelings for him were real.</p><p>Jack nearly swallowed his tongue when Keely stepped from the elevator. And he was damn glad he had a suit jacket on to cover his immediate erection.</p><p>Holy fuck. She was a goddess.</p><p>He was used to seeing her dressed casually, wearing jeans, minimal makeup and her ever-present cowgirl boots. The outfit she\u2019d chosen wasn\u2019t overly dressy. Her choice of earth tones fit her personality.</p><p>Yet the cut and color of the clothing let her natural beauty shine through, so you didn\u2019t notice the clothes, but the woman.</p><p>His woman.</p><p>Keely approached him with a cautious smile. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand and kissed her palm before threading their fingers together. \u201cYou are absolutely exquisite.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Shifted from boot to boot, apparently stunned into speechlessness.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019s a short walk and I cannot wait to show you off.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes sparked fire. \u201cI am not a show heifer, Donohue.\u201d</p><p>Jack was relieved her fit of nerves had passed. \u201cThere\u2019s my feisty fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet as they strolled to the restaurant. The hostess showed them to a small banquet room filled with people. Keely\u2019s hand tightened around his.</p><p>\u201cRelax, buttercup.\u201d Jack put his mouth to her ear. \u201cIf you\u2019re nervous, just imagine them in their underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I want to imagine that way. You really want me staring at your crotch all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! My boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned at Henry Smith, a balding, barrel-shaped man with two chins and a politician\u2019s smile. He thrust out his hand to shake Henry\u2019s hand vigorously. \u201cHenry. Great to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are pleased to have you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the second chance.\u201d He curled his arm around Keely\u2019s shoulder and brought her forward. \u201cThis is my fianc\u00e9e, Keely McKay. Keely, this is Henry Smith, the brains and power behind the Milford Historical Preservation Committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrains and power, bah.\u201d Henry delicately shook Keely\u2019s hand. \u201cA real pleasure to meet you, Keely.</p><p>Although, I\u2019ll admit to being surprised when Jack told me about your engagement. He\u2019d never indicated in his dealings with the committee that he was involved in a serious relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack keeps his personal and professional life separate, so I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Keely said with a smile. \u201cTo be fair, I\u2019d not heard of you either.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWell, I can certainly see why he\u2019d want to keep such a beautiful woman all to himself.</p><p>Have you set a wedding date yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But my parents did throw us an engagement party last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow marvelous. My wife, April, whom you\u2019ll meet shortly, will be so disappointed she didn\u2019t get to send a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry. I do have pictures of the party I\u2019d love to show her.\u201d</p><p>Jack patted her shoulder. \u201cKeely. Sweetheart. I\u2019m sure Henry and April aren\u2019t interested in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. We\u2019d be delighted to see them,\u201d Henry said. \u201cAnd we would love an invite to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still working out schedules and details. I have a large family, and naturally I want all of them to be in attendance. It\u2019s tricky trying to figure it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d Henry smiled at Jack. \u201cShall we catch up with the other committee members while we\u2019re waiting for dinner to be served?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Jack kept Keely close by because he could tell she was still nervous. These people made him uneasy too. As if they were waiting for him to fuck up and say or do something to take him out of the running for the job.</p><p>Why does this job matter to you so much? You\u2019d rather pretend to be someone you\u2019re not? Just so you can flip Baxter the bird?</p><p>No. That wasn\u2019t it... Was it?</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>He refocused on Keely, not his burst of self-doubt. \u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>The committee separated them. The men sat at one end of the table and the women at the other. Jack forced himself to concentrate on business and not how Keely was faring.</p><p>He snuck looks at her every so often. She was smiling, engaged in conversation, but she\u2019d barely eaten two bites of her meal. Dessert was a gingerbread cake, dry as dust. Keely picked off the maple frosting and drank lots of water.</p><p>On a professional level, the meal was a success. Jack pointed out permit issues other companies under consideration might\u2019ve missed. During their partnership, Baxter had left those details to Jack. And Jack had heard through the grapevine Baxter had been fined on other projects because of oversights. When he learned that BDM hadn\u2019t made a formal pitch to the Milford Committee yet, Jack kicked himself for opening his big mouth, because he\u2019d just given Baxter another advantage.</p><p>Once the table was cleared, several people left and others changed seats. Jack motioned to Keely to take the empty chair beside him.</p><p>They\u2019d barely situated themselves when Henry addressed them. \u201cSo, Jack, since you kept us in the dark about your lovely Keely, we\u2019re anxious to hear how you two ended up engaged.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs of assent sounded from around the table.</p><p>Jack said, \u201cIt\u2019s sort of complicated\u2014\u201d</p><p>Keely patted Jack\u2019s hand on the table. \u201cJack, darlin\u2019, no offense, but you\u2019re a man and you don\u2019t do this story justice. Why don\u2019t you let me tell it?\u201d</p><p>Soft laughter.</p><p>He bared his teeth at her in warning. \u201cGo ahead, sweetheart. But I\u2019ll jump in if you get something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I\u2019m up against?\u201d he said innocently to the men.</p><p>They all nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf you would\u2019ve told me a year ago I\u2019d be engaged to Jack Donohue, I would\u2019ve said you were plumb crazy,\u201d Keely said. \u201cSee, Jack and I hated each other.\u201d</p><p>A few gasps sounded.</p><p>Jack withheld a groan. Dammit. She\u2019d better not fuck this up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe hate is too strong a word. We disliked each other intensely. I\u2019ve known Jack since I was sixteen. He and my brother Carter became best friends in college and Carter dragged Jack home to the ranch one weekend. We detested each other on sight. He was rude and mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was a total spoiled brat,\u201d Jack inserted.</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say, our paths have crossed many times over the years. We never moved past the \u2018I can\u2019t stand to look at you\u2019 stage. In fact, it was worse the more time we spent around each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was much worse when you started dating my little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his brother Justin...dumped me.\u201d</p><p>Muted female murmurs of understanding.</p><p>\u201cDid you swoop in and mend the pieces of her broken heart?\u201d April Smith asked dreamily.</p><p>Keely leaned forward. \u201cNo, he did not. We ended up swapping insults at my brother Colt\u2019s wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>She took a drink of water; the tiny pause let the drama build.</p><p>\u201cFast forward to six months ago. I bought an old building in Moorcroft that needed serious renovation. It was also listed in the Wyoming Historic Register, and I don\u2019t have to explain to you all what a nightmare that is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cThe bottom line is, I didn\u2019t like Jack personally, but professionally, I knew no one was better qualified to help me with historic renovation project than Jack Donohue. I swallowed my pride and called him. He swallowed his disbelief and met with me. And miracle of miracles, we didn\u2019t exchange one insult at that first meeting. Once we hashed through the business end...well, two years of no contact gave us an entirely new appreciation for one another. We saw each other in a whole different light. Because our past history was so...volatile, we didn\u2019t tell anyone we\u2019d fallen in love. No one in our families would\u2019ve believed it.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping our feelings private allowed us time to understand and accept how deep those feelings really are.\u201d</p><p>Hell, that sweet story choked Jack up and he knew it was a damn lie. He didn\u2019t care if the committee disapproved of a PDA; he had to kiss her. He pressed his lips to hers, letting her warmth and sweetness flow through him.</p><p>\u201cOh my, that is about the most romantic thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d April gushed.</p><p>When Keely stared into his eyes, for a second, Jack believed every word she\u2019d uttered was the gospel truth. He murmured, \u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas his proposal as romantic?\u201d April interrupted, breaking the moment.</p> <p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Jack argued.</p><p>Keely lifted a brow. \u201cShall we let them decide?\u201d</p><p>April clapped her hands. \u201cOh goodie, yes, tell us, tell us!\u201d</p><p>Jack suspected April didn\u2019t get out much. Or didn\u2019t have romance in her life. He shot a sideways glance at Henry, discreetly picking his nose.</p> <p>\u201cIt was late afternoon in my decrepit old building,\u201d Keely began. \u201cWe were dusty and dirty from working all day. I was sweeping up the millionth dustpan full of mouse droppings, when Jack yelled across the room, \u201cHey, buttercup, marry me.\u201d</p><p>Female groans.</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cKeely, my love, that wasn\u2019t how it went down at all. We had been working hard all day. But when I looked at you, the golden glow of the late afternoon sun shining on your hair and face, I didn\u2019t care you were dusty and dirty. I didn\u2019t care you were sweeping up mouse droppings. All I saw was the most beautiful woman in the world. I knew right then I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>He brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her knuckles.</p><p>Keely blinked at him. Repeatedly.</p><p>Shit. Was she blinking back tears?</p><p>\u201cJack definitely wins as the most romantic version.\u201d</p><p>He broke eye contact with Keely to smile at Henry\u2019s wife. \u201cSee? It\u2019s all about perception.\u201d</p> <p>Keely set her left hand flat on the table. \u201cIt also helps he bought me a huge engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>Jack was frustrated Henry insisted on talking politics and sports, not about the restoration project.</p><p>Keely had held her own tonight, but she looked wary when April volunteered to walk her back to the hotel.</p><p>After they left he managed to sneak away to make a phone call.</p><p>Half an hour later, his cell phone rang as he entered his hotel room. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine my surprise when I heard a knock on my door. I was hoping you\u2019d snuck past the guards to have your wicked way with me. I wasn\u2019t expecting room service.\u201d He heard the smile in her voice. \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t expecting steak, a side of bacon and a gooey chocolate brownie. If you were here, Jack Donohue, I\u2019d kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Making her happy made Jack grin like an idiot. \u201cWhat else would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnarl if you tried to snatch even one small bite. Sometimes you are so sweet I can\u2019t believe...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cAnyway, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He stretched out on his bed. \u201cNow about that phone sex...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight dear, I have a headache.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Two days of us not making\u2014\u201d she paused, \u201c\u2014loud noises as we\u2019re fucking like animals would be good for us.\u201d</p><p>Had Keely almost slipped up and said...making love? It wasn\u2019t love between them, just great, raw, anything-goes sex. Just a byproduct of their deal. She knew that, right? She hadn\u2019t actually believed any of the romantic crap they\u2019d spewed tonight, had she?</p><p>Didn\u2019t you believe it?</p><p>\u201cNo changing my mind on this. And can I just say you looked absolutely yummy tonight? You sure do fill out a suit, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime tomorrow, Jack. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The second day in Milford had gone better than the first. The committee was enthusiastic about the additional changes Jack suggested. He\u2019d nailed the presentation.</p><p>Once again he and Keely were separated during the formal dinner. Afterward, she was surrounded by various women, leaving him no chance to speak to her alone. When he\u2019d finally returned to the hotel two hours after she\u2019d left, Keely hadn\u2019t answered her cell phone. He asked her about it this morning, she claimed she\u2019d forgotten her charger and the battery was dead.</p><p>Jack looked at her, sleeping in the passenger seat of his car. She\u2019d slept the entire way from Milford to Salt Lake City. Ditto for the short flight to Denver. Keely had wandered off by herself in the Denver airport to browse the gift shops. On the flight from Denver to Rapid City she\u2019d stared out the window. And she\u2019d fallen back asleep shortly after he\u2019d pulled onto I-90. Jack was frustrated because this...retreat wasn\u2019t like her.</p><p>Outside of Spearfish, he said, \u201cDo you want to stop someplace and eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You haven\u2019t eaten much today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know when I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop the goddamn car and get something to eat. You\u2019re drivin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Surly cowgirl speak. Yeah. She was pissed all right.</p><p>Jack ignored her until they reached Beulah. He exited off the interstate. The only thing open was an Exxon station. Scratch that idea.</p><p>As he stopped at the lone stop sign, he noticed a gravel road. Posted on each side with a DEAD END</p><p>sign and a Beulah Municipal Cemetery sign.</p><p>He hung a sharp right.</p><p>\u201cIf you hafta take a piss, there was a gas station right back there. You don\u2019t seem like the type to whiz in the weeds anyhow.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t answer. He drove past the cemetery to where the road ended. He shut off the car, pocketed the keys and climbed out.</p><p>A few minutes later Keely bailed from the car and lashed out at him. \u201cWhat the fuck is goin\u2019 on, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who drove us out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t said more than two dozen words to me since we left Milford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou complain when I don\u2019t talk as well as when I talk too much? I guess there really is no pleasin\u2019 you.\u201d Keely started down the road at a good clip.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long walk,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Jesus. The woman spiked his temper from zero to furious in less than sixty seconds. He took off after her.</p><p>Her body language gave no indication she noticed.</p><p>When Jack caught her, he immobilized her and widened his stance so she couldn\u2019t knock him off balance when she started to thrash.</p><p>And she fought him like a wet cat. She cursed, screamed and flailed against him. To no avail. Jack held his ground. They\u2019d have it out right here, right now.</p><p>When Keely stopped struggling, he breathed a sigh of relief, even when he suspected her submission would be short lived at best. \u201cYou done fighting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Jack. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you talk to me, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Why won\u2019t you talk to me, Keely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no point. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of this.\u201d She tried in vain to gesture with her trapped hands. \u201cThis stupid fake engagement is over. Us bein\u2019 nice to each other is over. Done.\u201d</p><p>He spun her around to face him but kept hold of her biceps. \u201cWhat in the hell ever gave you that idea?\u201d</p><p>Keely dropped her chin to her chest.</p><p>He shook her a little. \u201cLook at me goddammit.\u201d</p><p>When she finally opened her eyes, Jack saw a sheen of tears. \u201cKeely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got what you wanted, Jack. We both know the trip to Milford was a total success. They\u2019ll award you the contract, guaranteed. And after next week you can sign off on my project, with the exception of the final inspection. There\u2019s no reason for you to stick around Sundance.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. Keely really believed she wasn\u2019t reason enough for him to stay?</p><p>She\u2019s right. You don\u2019t need to stick around.</p><p>But he wanted to stay. The thought of leaving her left an ache he couldn\u2019t explain. Or justify. But he sure as hell needed more time to figure it out what the hell it meant.</p><p>\u201cSee? You can\u2019t argue with my logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me to argue with you, cowgirl, because you know how much I get off on it.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t even crack a smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done. Far from it. Have you forgotten I demanded a minimum of a month from you for this engagement? We\u2019re at what...three weeks? And don\u2019t you think it would be suspect if we broke off all contact the same week I signed off on your project? Right after we returned from Milford? You ready to deal with the explanations on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. Can we just let this...relationship fade away on its own? Spend as much time together as we can this week in Sundance?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her entire posture stayed tight. Closed off. Skeptical. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week from today there\u2019s a job I have to be on site for until it\u2019s finished. I\u2019ll be gone for three full weeks. But this week and especially next weekend, I need you to keep up this pretense.\u201d Inwardly, Jack winced at his word choice. What had developed between them hardly felt like make-believe.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvention in Denver.\u201d</p><p>Keely scowled. \u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it. A lot has happened. You can\u2019t expect me to remember all of it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll remember all of it. The way you taste first thing in the morning. The sweet scent of lilacs surrounding me last thing before I drift off at night. Your eyes glaring at me with anger. Your eyes devouring me with hunger. Your laugh. Your determination. The unquestioning love you have for your family. The way you make love with your heart and soul as well as your body. I\u2019ll never forget any of that.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore I told you. This is our annual Professional Preservationist\u2019s Society meeting; it just happens to be in Denver this year. I\u2019ve already booked us a suite at the Adam\u2019s Mark downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would I have to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy six o\u2019clock Friday night for a cocktail party and a dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we have separate hotel rooms?\u201d</p><p>Jack got right in her face. \u201cNo. Way. You will be in my king-sized bed all weekend.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted. Keely reached out and fiddled with his collar. \u201cDid you miss the sex the last two days?</p><p>\u201cNo, I missed sleeping with you.\u201d Jack slid his hand up to cradle her beautiful, but strangely sad face.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Keely not to elaborate. So he took it upon himself to fill the void. \u201cI was so horny I had to whack off. Twice.\u201d</p><p>She blinked with surprise. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing in the morning I relived our first shower. How amazing it felt shoving my cock in your mouth. How hot it was seeing my come on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the second time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second time I thought about all the positions we haven\u2019t tried yet. Sixty-nine. Reverse cowgirl.</p><p>Or in your truck, which is a personal fantasy of mine, believe it or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA truck fantasy, GQ? How rural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a crude and lewd fantasy too.\u201d He crowded her. \u201cMy dick buried in your hot little ass was the visual that sent me over the edge. Imagining you on your hands and knees with those sexy butt cheeks spread wide. Watching my dick disappear into that tightly puckered pink hole. You\u2019re not a virgin to anal sex, but I\u2019ll bet my cock is bigger than anything you\u2019ve had. The thought of how hot and tight you\u2019d be as I rammed into your back door. Jesus, Keely, I shot all over my hand. And I used the come to get myself off again, imagining you still bent over as I whacked off all over your ass. Seeing my come sliding down the crack of your butt and running into your asshole.\u201d</p><p>Lust glittered in her eyes. \u201cGraphic much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but that\u2019s three times you jacked off, not two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if I could get you so hot and bothered just from the verbal description of what I want to do to you that you forgot to count.\u201d He feathered his lips over hers, testing her response.</p><p>And there it was. Keely\u2019s hungry, unabashed need. Giving him everything, holding nothing back, she was his equal in every way. He wanted her in every way.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Keely. Right now. Up against the car.\u201d Jack dragged his mouth down her neck, leaving sucking kisses.</p><p>Keely stepped back. Way back. \u201cHuh-uh. I will let you fuck me in the men\u2019s bathroom at the Golden Boot, but I draw the line at screwing outside the cemetery in Beulah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But hold that thought until we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed her again. \u201cI\u2019m feeling very lucky.\u201d</p><p>Could Keely spend another week with him? Without Jack figuring out she\u2019d fallen in love with him?</p><p>Yeah. Don\u2019t act like a complete freak like you\u2019ve been doing all day. The no talking, no looking, no touching reaction is a dead giveaway. Fuck him, insult him and he\u2019ll never guess anything has changed.</p><p>Even when everything had changed.</p><p>She filled the rest of the drive with stories of how she\u2019d spent Saturday, a captive audience with April, Phyllis and Georgette. Shopping, lunch and a three-hour tour of the town. Fielding pointed questions about her religious affiliation. Fielding pointed questions about being a \u201cworking woman\u201d. Fielding pointed questions about what it was like to be with a devastatingly handsome, completely charming, totally put together man such as Jack Donohue.</p><p>Jack preened when Keely relayed the women\u2019s flattery.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I couldn\u2019t tell them you\u2019re the ultimate package because in addition to your stunning good looks and mouth-watering physique, you have a big cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my sarcastic cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss me?\u201d she cooed.</p><p>\u201cLike an oozing canker sore.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in three weeks, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and amazingly, with no knife wounds.\u201d</p><p>They pulled into Sundance as the sun turned the hills bronze, reflecting gold across the valley, showcasing the beautiful landscape she\u2019d never tire of looking at. Keely breathed deeply.</p><p>\u201cWhy the contented sigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m home. Every time I come back from a trip I realize how much I love this place and how I never want to leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Everything I\u2019ve ever wanted is right here. Why would I leave what makes me happy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to.</p><p>At the apartment, Jack dragged the suitcases upstairs. Then he dragged her straight into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cKeely.\u201d He framed her face in his hands and blew her mind with an infinitely gentle kiss.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him speed race them to the next level of seduction. She kept kissing him. Wetly.</p><p>Deeply. Softly. Firmly. No rush; she wanted to savor him.</p><p>\u201cNaked,\u201d she murmured between flirty kisses. \u201cCompletely buck-assed nekkid. We\u2019re usually in such a hurry we still have half our damn clothes on.\u201d</p><p>Jack leisurely undressed her. She unclothed him with equal deliberation. He stripped away the quilt and eased her onto the mattress. Kissing a path down her body, he inadvertently tickled her bared flesh with his hair. Keely adored his too-long mop of glossy black. It fit him.</p><p>His mouth proceeded straight to her pussy. He groaned and lapped at the wetness. \u201cI could taste you for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that another time. Right now, I need you.\u201d</p><p>He situated his hands by her shoulders and kneed apart her thighs. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asking? Instead of taking? You hit your head or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d Jack\u2019s thickness filled her in a slow, sweet glide that satisfied more than the sexual ache in her body. \u201cPut your legs around my hips,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Keely rocked up to meet his relaxed thrusts.</p><p>But Jack reset the pace to slow-mo, while intently peering at her face. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I don\u2019t say that enough.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t say it again or I might believe it means something.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Forever? Or just for tonight?</p><p>\u201cLook in my eyes when you come, Keely.\u201d</p><p>He flexed his hips at the end of every stroke, propelling his cock deeper, but keeping the withdrawal of his shaft agonizingly unhurried.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy. Eyes. Don\u2019t look away. Show me what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on the telltale tug in her womb. It took all her self-control not to grab Jack\u2019s ass and greedily chase down the orgasm, grinding her way to bliss via his body. Letting him bring the pleasure to her.</p><p>When Keely\u2019s pussy muscles contracted and her clit started to throb, she locked her gaze on Jack\u2019s slumberous eyes and came in silence. No keening wails or soft gasps. No arching or straining. The orgasm was no less intense for the quietness.</p><p>Heat expanded inside her as Jack came in the same intense stillness. Watching her with focus equal to what she\u2019d given him.</p><p>It was as strange as it was wonderful.</p><p>Jack buried his face in her neck. \u201cFall asleep with me like this, Keely. Just for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Another unusual request. But she wouldn\u2019t deny him. Keely was beginning to believe she wouldn\u2019t deny him anything.</p><p>The next night Keely stripped off her clothes the second she\u2019d closed the apartment door.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s what I love to see. Eagerness to get naked with me, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at Jack in his usual place on the couch. \u201cNo time for slap and tickle. I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>Thud. Boot one hit the ground. Thud. Boot number two hit. She raced into the laundry room and dumped the stinky bundle, then zipped to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cLate for what?\u201d Jack yelled.</p><p>\u201cColt\u2019s basketball game starts in fifteen minutes.\u201d Keely flipped the handles and the shower kicked on. She twisted her hair in a clip on top of her head and climbed in.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go straight to the game from work?\u201d</p><p>She shrieked. Jack stood at the end of the tub. Gawking at her. Not at her face, either. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d His eyes ate her up. The man actually licked his chops.</p><p>\u201cI repeat. No time for water games.\u201d She faced the water and rinsed.</p><p>After she finished, Jack handed her a towel.</p><p>\u201cThanks. My last patient showed up for her therapy session with a case of the flu and she barfed all over me.\u201d Keely shuddered and toweled off. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t smell it when I walked in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll I smell is my sweet Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorny bastard.\u201d She resisted snapping him with the towel after her mind glommed on to his use of the word \u201cmy\u201d.</p><p>\u201cDoes that barfing thing happen often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften enough that I keep a change of clothes in my locker. But I\u2019d forgotten to replace them because I haven\u2019t done laundry in a coon\u2019s age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long exactly is a coon\u2019s age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalfway between the twelfth of never and when hell freezes over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a mood.\u201d</p><p>So was he. She hustled to her bedroom and bent over to open the bottom dresser drawer. Down to her last pair of clean jeans. She\u2019d have to do at least one load of clothes tonight. She turned and Jack was right there. With that look. The look that thrilled her. The look that warned her she\u2019d be late for the damn basketball game. \u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>He dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have time\u2014Omigod! You so don\u2019t play fair.\u201d Her feet slid on the carpet as she automatically widened her stance.</p><p>Jack chuckled against her sensitive flesh and licked her slit from top to bottom. Then from bottom to top. \u201cTasty. Bet I can get you off as fast as your vibrator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you might say that.\u201d His thumbs pulled back the delicate skin at the top of her mound, leaving her fully open to his skillful mouth. He lashed her exposed clit with quick whips of his wet tongue.</p><p>Keely groaned.</p><p>He\u2019d didn\u2019t relent. He kept up a hot, wet vibration on that bundle of nerves until her legs trembled.</p><p>The instant her breathing changed, Jack sealed his lips around the swollen nub and sucked.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Jack.\u201d</p><p>He sucked harder.</p><p>\u201cYes. Like that.\u201d Keely splintered in a dozen directions. Black and white spots ruptured behind her eyelids. Blood rushed like a raging river through her body. Her consciousness floated to another dimension\u2014the whole nine yards of orgasmic satisfaction.</p><p>Oh man. She\u2019d needed that. Bad. How had Jack known?</p><p>She cracked open her eyes and glanced down at him.</p><p>He suckled her pussy lips, together with her clitoris, one last time before releasing her.</p> <p>\u201cThat was...mmm. A great surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t resist. I love going down on you.\u201d He stretched up. \u201cAnd we still have time to make it to the basketball game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d She froze. Jack wanted to tag along to a social event with her family? She thought after the weekend in Milford he\u2019d become a hermit.</p><p>\u201cMakes me insane to sit here alone, knowing you\u2019re watching a bunch of half-naked sweaty guys racing up and down the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother and my cousin Buck are two of the guys, so eww.\u201d She slipped on a plain pink thong.</p><p>Out of underwear. Down to one bra. The red and green Christmas bra patterned with presents and sported a big red bow in the center of her cleavage.</p><p>Jack stared at her chest with that look. \u201cI\u2019m opening my present right when we get home.\u201d</p><p>Wednesday night...</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to come.\u201d</p><p>Keely whirled around. \u201cWhy? So you can fuck me in the men\u2019s bathroom at the Golden Boot again?\u201d</p><p>Jack beamed his cocky grin. \u201cNo. But if you ask me real nice I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPervert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSticks and stones, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Argh. \u201cYou hate darts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate country bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny you hate country music, which is all they play at this country bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But watching your fine ass in skintight denim as you\u2019re bending forward to throw a dart?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze redefined lewd. \u201cButtercup, I doubt I\u2019ll hear anything over the pounding in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the blood pounding in your groin,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cThat too. You bring out the beast in me.\u201d</p><p>How well she\u2019d learned that. Twice.</p><p>Keely retreated to the bedroom, flashing back to last night.</p><p>The frantic call from India, begging her to drive out to the Sky Blue manufacturing plant and pick up three boxes of lotion she\u2019d forgotten to stock. Poor pregnant India had babbled about an A.A. meeting, Colt helping Trevor and Edgard, and her sweet baby Hudson being a brat. Keely assured her frazzled and highly hormonal sister-in-law she\u2019d take care of it.</p><p>Oddly enough, Jack had volunteered to ride along. Odder yet, after loading up the boxes he hadn\u2019t seemed eager to leave. He and Kade shot the breeze, while Keely heard all about Eliza\u2019s preschool. Peyton and Shannie, not to be outdone, talked a mile a minute about the new kitties in the barn.</p><p>Once they\u2019d started home, Jack demanded the price for his help: fulfillment of his fantasy of fucking in her truck.</p><p>After they\u2019d parked in a secluded turnout, Jack was on her\u2014all possessive, challenging male. He sprawled in the passenger\u2019s side and bid her to masturbate for him. Slowly. As soon as she got off, he hauled her onto his lap. She bounced and ground on his cock; he focused his full oral expertise on her nipples. Pinching, sucking, licking. Even the biting wound her arousal tighter.</p><p>Jack gripped her ass cheeks in both hands, pounding into her cunt forcefully. His orgasm was hot and wet and messy and it sent Keely spiraling into subspace.</p><p>As she drifted back, she was vaguely aware of Jack toying with her asshole. Teasing those blood rich nerve endings with the rough pad of his thumb. Then something slick slid into her anal passage.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he murmured against her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you just shove up my ass, Donohue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnal beads. The small set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more than one set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I planned on shopping for new sex toys. Does it feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He nibbled her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing them until I take them out.\u201d</p><p>Excitement unfurled in her belly. But she couldn\u2019t give into him so easily. \u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed in her seat on the drive back to Sundance. Jack ignored it. In fact, he barely looked at her until they were in the apartment.</p><p>But when Jack looked at her? Man oh man. Gone was the sophisticated, charming architect. The man who\u2019d loomed over her was primitive male. Wild. Intent on conquering, claiming and marking his territory.</p><p>First, he took her mouth in a savage kiss. Next, he had Keely naked, facedown on the bed. Her heart pounded crazily. Not out of fear, but out of feminine pride. She\u2019d never affected a man this powerfully.</p><p>Never. And to affect such a strong man as Jack Donohue to the point he lost all control and became a raging beast in his quest to have her? That was a heady, once in a lifetime feeling. And she was damn well going to savor it for as long as she could.</p><p>Jack\u2019s body heat scorched her back as he angled her ass in the air. \u201cDo you want your vibrator?\u201d</p><p>That was his way of saying she\u2019d have to get herself off because her pleasure wasn\u2019t his concern. This was all about him.</p><p>It was fucking hot as hell.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jack growled. Hot, wet, openmouthed kisses trailed down her spine until his mouth met the handle of the beads. Very delicately, he licked around her stretched opening.</p><p>Lust slammed into her hard and Keely locked her knees.</p><p>He eased the beads out. Then cool gel and one slippery finger pushed in and out of her hole. More gel.</p><p>Another finger.</p><p>Oh, shit it burned. She held her breath until Jack commanded, \u201cBreathe. Loosen up. Let me in. That\u2019s it.\u201d Then he screwed three fingers in deep and completely out. Satisfied by his preparation, Jack pulled her ass cheeks apart. The crown of his cock nudged her anus.</p><p>Keely breathed out as the thick head popped inside the ring of tight muscle. Before she registered the sharp pain, Jack slid the shaft into her anal passage. No stops. He fed his dick in until his balls slapped her pussy and he couldn\u2019t go any deeper.</p><p>She concentrated on the musky scent of sex and sweat. Would Jack ask if she was okay? Or give her an erotic play by play of how tight and perfect her ass felt clamped around his big dick?</p><p>Jack did neither.</p><p>He fucked her without restraint. Withdrawing the plump cockhead completely every time he pulled out. He\u2019d rest the tip on her spasming hole and slam back in. Over and over until she began to anticipate the burning scrape of retraction. Began to crave it. She braced herself for the sweet agony of pleasure mixed with bite of pain as Jack plunged back inside her clenching channel in one solid thrust.</p><p>A strange buzzing built inside her head as he reamed her. Proved he owned her.</p><p>Jack finally spoke. \u201cBear down on me. Harder. Sweet mother of God.\u201d He shoved hard, stilled behind her and roared.</p><p>She felt every hot spurt as he filled her ass with his seed. She milked every drop, until the continual clenching and unclenching of her interior muscles set off a vaginal orgasm that stole her breath.</p><p>His body shuddered as he experienced her contractions. He didn\u2019t attempt to pull out of her bowels.</p><p>For the longest time Jack let that big dick stuff her to the point she almost got used to it.</p><p>Almost. Then he growled, \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d been a little sore this morning. But Keely didn\u2019t regret a single minute.</p><p>\u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>Startled out of her vivid flashback, she faced Jack, lounging in the doorway to her bedroom. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t want me to come to the bar and watch you play darts tonight, I\u2019ll understand. I was just giving you shit.\u201d</p><p>The vulnerability Jack showed her on occasion, like now, like last night, still had the power to move her. And because he was willing to share that side of himself with her, she grinned.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You can come. But if I hear one caterwaulin\u2019 or goat-yodelin\u2019 comment about the music, you\u2019re sittin\u2019 in the truck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Two days later...</p><p>Jack paced in his condo, waiting for Keely to arrive.</p> <p>Why had she insisted on seeing where he lived?</p><p>Because you\u2019re supposed to be engaged, dumbass.</p><p>He inhaled a deep breath. For Christsake, he shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed. He\u2019d paid a shitload of money for this high-rise condo with a view of the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>Jack gazed at the jagged peaks that were covered in snow year round. As a South Dakota farm kid, raised on the flat prairie, he was amazed every time he looked at the majestic mountains.</p><p>Yet the view outside presented his living room in an even more pitiable light. He hadn\u2019t spent time or money decorating besides adding two black leather reclining Lazy Boy chairs. True, Jack had forked over serious bucks for the top of the line entertainment system with a gigantic digital flat-screen TV, and theater quality surround sound. His massive collection of DVDs was arranged alphabetically on the shelves of the entertainment center that encompassed the entire wall.</p> <p>The phrase \u201centertainment center\u201d caused a snort. He\u2019d never entertained here. Never cooked. Aside from his cleaning lady, he\u2019d never invited a woman over. He feared looks of pity or worse, calculated looks of home improvement ideas.</p><p>Working out of his home meant no water-cooler type conversations with his coworkers\u2014but after the ugly situation with Baxter and Martine, he considered that a benefit.</p><p>Since Jack had moved to Colorado from Chicago, making money took priority over making friends.</p><p>And yeah, maybe he had crawled into a hole after Martine ditched him for Baxter. No one could blame him for holing up and licking his wounds.</p><p>It\u2019s been three years. Get over it. You\u2019ve got a chance to have a better, fuller life.</p><p>With Keely McKay? Despite her sexual appeal, the sweetness she masked beneath insults, her thoughtfulness, her ambition, her sly sense of humor and her tendency to give all of herself to those she cared about, Keely was not the type of woman he expected he\u2019d spend his life with. She\u2019d never leave Wyoming, never venture far from her family, which led him to believe she had a narrow view of the world.</p> <p>Any narrower than yours?</p><p>Jack admitted spending the last few weeks with Keely and her family and friends proved his life was empty outside of working hours. No real relationships. No group of male buddies to invite over to catch a Broncos or Rockies game.</p><p>The one solid friend he\u2019d kept throughout the years was Carter McKay. Jack figured after Carter married Macie the friendship might cool. But if anything, they\u2019d gotten closer. Carter and Macie welcomed him into their life. In the last six years he\u2019d enjoyed every moment spent at their house in Canyon River with their three wild boys.</p><p>Maybe you aren\u2019t as allergic to the notion of home and hearth as you\u2019ve deluded yourself into thinking you are.</p><p>Then again, maybe Carter continued their relationship because of Jack\u2019s ability to track down art commissions. If that perk ended, would Carter still call him? Or worse, what happened after the engagement with Keely went south? Would Carter blame him and cut all ties?</p><p>That thought absolutely paralyzed him.</p><p>The intercom buzzed and his heart rate rocketed. He depressed the button. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Keely McKay here to see you sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Send her up.\u201d</p><p>He paced, feeling edgy and nervous in his own skin.</p><p>Two brisk knocks. Jack opened the door, took one look at her beautiful face and everything inside him calmed. \u201cHey. Come in. How was the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUneventful.\u201d</p><p>She skirted the plain white wall dividing the entry foyer from the living space. In the living room she wandered to the floor to ceiling windows. \u201cThe years I lived in Denver I always wondered what the view looked like from up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill makes you feel far away, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t quite know how to respond to that.</p><p>Keely meandered to the dining room, which didn\u2019t have a table, but a drafting table, a Bowflex and weight sets. She moved through the kitchen. Her gaze swept over the breakfast bar. The double sink. The double ovens. The built in dishwasher. The island with a Jenn-aire range inset into a marble countertop.</p><p>The sub-zero refrigerator. She didn\u2019t say a word\u2014good or bad\u2014as she rounded the corner and headed down the hallway leading to the bedrooms.</p><p>Jack\u2019s whole body went on full alert.</p><p>She poked her head into the main bathroom. He could almost hear her assessment: nothing fancy.</p><p>Boring white walls, white sink, white toilet, white tub/shower combo and white tiled floor.</p><p>She entered the second bedroom, which served as Jack\u2019s office. Two oversized drafting tables lined the longest wall. A mahogany desk anchored one end of the room. He\u2019d converted the walk-in closet with shelves for storing building plans and to house his collection of books on restoration as well as photographic books. The only wall not covered in shelf space was plastered with an enormous map of the U.S. dotted with colorful pins.</p><p>\u201cThese pins are where you\u2019ve done restoration projects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a cool way to see all you\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled. Keely would see it as a positive. Whenever he was frustrated with project plans, he saw the pins denoting finished projects and it motivated him to continue.</p><p>\u201cThis is a great space and all cozy with books, but where do your clients sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bring clients to my home, Keely.\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have another office someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Most of the initial business is conducted over the phone. I travel to where I\u2019m needed, hence no need for a formal office space. A PO box, an Internet connection, a phone and I\u2019m good to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I thought...\u201d Her eyes darted away. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought since you\u2019re a historic preservation specialist you\u2019d have a funky, cool office in a nifty building you restored. With pictures of the work you\u2019ve done. Nothing fancy, just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething besides an overfilled second bedroom in a modern condo in Denver?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an impressive office when I worked in Chicago. Evidently the conference table in the meeting room was a favorite place for Martine and Baxter to fuck, so I\u2019m soured on formal office suites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to snap at me, Jack, for asking a simple question.\u201d She wheeled around.</p><p>Jack caught her wrist as she stormed into his bedroom. \u201cSorry. My place isn\u2019t anything remotely cool... Basically it sucks and I\u2019m embarrassed. There\u2019s no personality and I\u2019ve lived here for three years.</p><p>It\u2019s like I just moved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr are expecting to move out,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.</p><p>\u201cIs this your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>How he wished he could lie, because this was one ugly-ass, bare-ass room too. A plain boring brown comforter on the king-sized bed. One nightstand. One dresser. Both brown wood. No chairs. \u201cAt least the shitty d\u00e9cor in here fits with the rest of the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do live here like you\u2019re waiting for your life to start someplace else.\u201d</p><p>Another perceptive, yet jarring comment.</p><p>Keely moseyed into the closet. \u201cOmigod, GQ. Do you really wear all those suits?\u201d</p><p>He squinted at the orderly line of jackets, suit pants and shirts. The dozens of ties folded over tie racks, separated by color. The pairs of dress shoes in black, light black, brown and light brown. His casual clothes were stacked on the opposite side, a considerably smaller selection.</p><p>\u201cYes. I wear them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t have clients come here, when you get up in the morning to go to work in your office, in the next bedroom over, do you actually put on...an entire suit?\u201d</p><p>That would seem ridiculous to her. Hell, it seemed ridiculous to him. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf I have to go out later I usually wear a suit. I\u2019m more comfortable in suits than I am in jeans, Keely. It\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a damn cryin\u2019 shame, because you fill out a pair of jeans very nicely. However, I can hardly see your very fine ass or your impressive junk when a suit coat covers the front and the rear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt conceals a big problem whenever I\u2019m around you, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>Keely fingered a pile of sweaters, arranged by color. \u201cI live in jeans. I hate getting dressed up. But I will, when the occasion warrants it.\u201d She jammed her hands in her pockets. \u201cDid you have help organizing your closet? It\u2019s so tidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have help choosing my wardrobe, but I manage to hang things up all by myself,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>Keely gaped at him. \u201cSomeone helps you shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with two men\u2019s clothing stores in Chicago for a few years. My personal shopper knows what I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone with a personal shopper and wardrobe consultant. My God, you must be filthy rich.\u201d</p><p>He skirted the rich issue. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a pansy-ass because I care how I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Those shoppers are worth every penny because you always look smashing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmashing?\u201d Jack groaned. \u201cFuck. That word makes me sound like a metrosexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all hunky, hot, real man, in my experience, so not to worry.\u201d Keely ducked out of the closet to sit on the bed. She wore a strangely pensive look.</p><p>Shit. Maybe she did think he was a fucking pussy because he didn\u2019t have a closet full of Wranglers, shitkickers and flannel. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out on a limb here. You don\u2019t have a revolving door to your bedroom, do you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, less self-conscious about his pathetic sex life than his dismal apartment. \u201cAs a matter of fact, you\u2019re the first woman I\u2019ve ever asked into my bedroom, Keely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The look of surprise melted into a look of pure seduction.

But I happen to know you\u2019ve got a whole closet full of replacements, so buck up and fuck me.\u201d</p> <p>Jack\u2019s dick was as hard as a steel beam upon seeing the wicked gleam in her eyes. He crawled over her and backed her into the middle of the bed. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>But Keely flipped Jack on his back. Straddling him, she said, \u201cNifty trick, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith five older brothers, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, letting the glide of lips and tongues heat them both up. Between kisses, she whispered, \u201cLet me take care of you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want. I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take you.\u201d Keely rolled off the bed, whipped off her clothes and climbed back on top of him. The woman was something\u2014all naked, soft, bouncy female parts.</p><p>Her fingers unknotted his tie. She left it undone beneath his collar and worked the buttons free, spread the shirt open, leaving his chest exposed. Next she unbuttoned, unzipped and removed his pants and boxers.</p><p>She nibbled the column of his throat. Her hands mapped every ridge and muscle on his chest.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t this feel naughty with me buck-ass nekkid on top of you, and you still wearing your shirt and tie?</p><p>Like I\u2019m your wicked secretary and we snuck off so I could take...dictation?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed softly. \u201cOral?\u201d</p> <p>Keely bit down on his left nipple and he arched up from the sheer pleasure of it. \u201cYou like the rough stuff, boss?\u201d She bent her mouth to his right nipple and did the same thing.</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a memo. If you don\u2019t zip it I\u2019ll stop touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShutting up now.\u201d</p><p>She tasted and tormented his upper body until Jack thought he\u2019d shoot like a randy teenage boy if she ever put her hand on his dick.</p><p>But she avoided his cock. Even when it was jerking, leaking and begging for her attention.</p><p>Keely kissed him all too briefly and pushed up on her knees over his pelvis. She touched his lips with her index and middle fingers. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>He parted his lips and drew her fingers deeply into his mouth, getting them good and wet.</p> <p>She murmured, \u201cYou do that so well, Jack.\u201d Then she trailed her wet fingers down her slit and plunged them into her pussy.</p><p>His cock slapped against his belly.</p><p>Keely\u2019s free hand pinched her nipple hard. She moaned loudly as she continued to fuck herself on her own fingers.</p><p>Jack watched Keely raptly, beautiful in abandon.</p><p>She locked her gaze to his and pulled her fingers out of her sex with a wet sucking sound. Then she pressed them to his lips again.</p><p>He sucked, growling at the dark, sweet taste of her juices flowing over his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAm I wet enough to take full dictation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Goddamn, Keely you\u2019re making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She slanted her mouth over his and sank down on his cock to the root.</p><p>She rode him hard. Her tits bounced sexily as she dangled above him, her head thrown back.</p><p>Repeating the motion and the rhythm, bringing them both to the edge.</p><p>Jack grabbed a handful of her ass and directed her to pump her hips faster. He couldn\u2019t hold back and as his balls tightened. The combination of arching his pelvis the same time as her cunt muscles clamped down on his shaft made him shout until his throat hurt.</p><p>A blank sense of peace floated over him.</p><p>Sweet kisses roused him. He flipped his eyes open. Shit. Had Keely come?</p><p>She pressed her forehead to his. \u201cTo answer the question I see in your eyes, yes, I got off. You didn\u2019t leave me wanting. You never leave me wanting, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I sort of blacked out there at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I was aiming for.\u201d Three more flirty kisses and Keely smiled against his cheek. \u201cBed christening complete.\u201d</p><p>Saying thank you seemed lame and pathetic, but he muttered it anyway.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Next go around let\u2019s break in the reclining chair in your living room. Oh, and for that one? I\u2019ll want you to wear a brown suit coat. And the Scooby Doo boxers.\u201d</p><p>Keely insisted on driving her truck to the hotel, mumbling about getting stuck in the city without a means to escape.</p><p>After they\u2019d checked in, Jack donned a different suit. It amused him to see Keely fussing as she readied herself for the cocktail party. She rarely primped\u2014she didn\u2019t need it, she always looked utterly breathtaking\u2014but she took extra time with her makeup.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cShould I put my hair up?\u201d</p><p>He moved behind her in the big bathroom mirror and kissed her shoulder. \u201cNo. Your hair is beautiful the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful? It\u2019s stick straight and boring and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Leave it. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What about my makeup? Should I add more eyeliner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely. Stop. Breathe. Buttercup, you look terrific.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled and let the breath out slowly. \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? This is no different than Milford. You did fine there. Better than fine. Just be yourself.\u201d</p><p>As Jack walked out of the bathroom, he thought he heard her mutter, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d</p><p>The banquet room was packed and the cocktail party was in full swing when Jack and Keely entered.</p><p>She refused a drink, as the choices were only red or white wine.</p><p>Once his colleagues noticed them, they were swarmed. The men wanted a closer look at Keely. The women were sizing her up as well, which increased Keely\u2019s nervousness. She kept tugging at her dress and fiddling with her hair.</p><p>Ten minutes into the social bullshit, the moment Jack had been waiting for arrived: Baxter and Martine approached them.</p><p>Baxter stuck out his hand. \u201cJack! Good to see you, buddy. We must\u2019ve missed each other during the seminars.\u201d</p><p>Jack returned Baxter\u2019s vigorous handshake. \u201cGood to see you too, Baxter. I made a couple of the morning sessions, but Keely was due in this afternoon so I\u2019m afraid I skipped out.\u201d He placed his arm around Keely\u2019s shoulder, urging her forward. \u201cBaxter, this is my fianc\u00e9e, Keely McKay. Keely, Baxter Ducheyne, my former business partner.\u201d</p><p>Keely smiled offered her hand. \u201cPleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine. Allow me to introduce my wife, Martine.\u201d</p><p>Martine offered her manicured fingertips. \u201cKelly. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have plenty of time to chat later.\u201d</p><p>Then Martine\u2019s lipsticked mouth bestowed a tight-lipped kiss on each of Jack\u2019s cheeks. \u201cJack. Darling.</p><p>How marvelous to see you. You\u2019re looking devilishly handsome as ever.\u201d</p><p>Jack ground his teeth at Martine\u2019s mispronunciation of Keely\u2019s name. He managed a civil smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking...rested.\u201d</p><p>Baxter chuckled.</p><p>Martine allowed a brittle laugh and addressed Keely. \u201cIsn\u2019t this awkward. I\u2019m sure Jack told you about our past relationship. Whenever our paths cross and he\u2019s so cool, I realize I miss the divine compliments he used to lavish on me.\u201d</p><p>He withheld a snort. Lavish. Right.</p><p>Keely blinked innocently at Martine. \u201cYou and Jack had a fling? Really?\u201d She half-elbowed Jack in the gut. \u201cSeems someone forgot to mention that tidbit to me.\u201d</p><p>Martine\u2019s eyes narrowed first at Keely, then at Jack, as if she couldn\u2019t believe she hadn\u2019t rated mention.</p><p>Jack leaned over to brush a soft kiss on Keely\u2019s temple. \u201cSorry, sweetheart. We\u2019ve been preoccupied, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we were all quite shocked to hear the playboy had been caught.\u201d Martine\u2019s gaze lingered on Keely\u2019s midsection. \u201cI assume since the engagement was so quick, a hurry-up wedding is to soon follow?\u201d</p><p>That bitch thought Keely was pregnant. Jesus Christ. How had he ever been attracted to her? The woman was an absolute nightmare. \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t actually set a date. Next year, maybe. She\u2019s wearing my ring. That\u2019s what matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, let me see the ring,\u201d Martine cooed.</p><p>Keely held out her left hand.</p><p>Martine scrutinized the diamond. \u201cLovely. What is it? About seven carats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly eleven,\u201d Jack said. \u201cA daily reminder that Keely ranks above a perfect ten in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Keely swallowed hard. To anyone else it\u2019d appear she was overcome with emotion, but Jack knew she was choking back a snort of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cA Tiffany creation?\u201d Martine asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry Winston.\u201d Might be petty, but he knew that\u2019d grate on Martine. She\u2019d always dropped hints about wanting jewelry bearing that exclusive name and he\u2019d never indulged her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll accept my sincerest congratulations,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you smiling again, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. I have quite a bit to smile about these days. We\u2019ll see you later.\u201d He steered Keely away.</p><p>When they were alone, Keely said, \u201cYou actually fucked her? Dude. Did her forked tongue feel exceptionally good on your dick or something?\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cShe didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 that more than once, if I recall. My taste has improved markedly, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So has your bullshitting ability.\u201d Keely peered into his eyes. \u201cA daily reminder that I\u2019m above a perfect ten? Please. Jack. I almost gagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He kissed her. Twice. \u201cWhy do you think I got us out of there so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart move. After that...I need alcohol so badly I\u2019ll even drink a shitty glass of wine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHang tight. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>After dropping off her wine, Jack left Keely in the midst of a group of his colleague\u2019s wives. She\u2019d done this meet and greet before with great success and she didn\u2019t need him holding her hand, especially when he had business to discuss. Keely was tough. Smart. She could hold her own with anyone. She\u2019d do just fine.</p><p>This party was Keely\u2019s worst fucking nightmare.</p> <p>First, she was underdressed. Way underdressed. The women in attendance wore smart, classy cocktail dresses that probably cost more than her truck. The frumpy little engagement dress which\u2019d worked in so well in Wyoming and Utah made her look like an escapee from Hee Haw in this ritzy setting.</p><p>Second, her feet hurt. She\u2019d worn heels, but checking out the other women\u2019s expensive shoes, flip-flops would\u2019ve been a better footwear choice. And would\u2019ve garnered fewer, \u201cAre those shoes from Payless?\u201d type of raised eyebrows the females aimed at her poor aching feet.</p><p>Third, no beer. What kind of party didn\u2019t have a cash bar that served beer? Which served as another reminder of how hopelessly low class she was. How out of her league Jack was.</p><p>Fourth, Mr. High Class himself had abandoned her. Completely. No looking back, no encouraging smiles from across the room. He\u2019d ditched her in a nest of snakes.</p><p>Even the women\u2019s clattering bracelets and earrings sounded like rattles\u2014but she doubted she\u2019d get any warning before they struck.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re from Wyoming?\u201d a brunette with far too many Botox injections asked.</p><p>Keep it simple. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never actually met anyone from Wyoming,\u201d another brunette with beady black eyes commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you do there? Is there anything to do there? Or is that why the state is so meagerly populated? Because no one can stand to stick around?\u201d</p><p>Female laughter.</p><p>Keely blushed.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure Kelly can regale us with plenty of quaint little tales from her life in the Wild West, Laura.\u201d Martine sipped her white wine. \u201cI imagine you have a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I have two horses. One\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have a car?\u201d Martine snarked back.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have a vehicle. A truck.\u201d</p><p>Snickers.</p><p>\u201cWith mud on the tires, a gun rack and a bale of hay in the back?\u201d a snide blonde sidekick of Martine\u2019s tossed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, Reagan, don\u2019t forget country music blaring as she\u2019s driving down the gravel road to take care of her horse,\u201d the another brunette threw in.</p><p>\u201cHorses,\u201d Martine corrected sweetly. \u201cShe owns more than one, remember? I\u2019ll bet one\u2019s a real stud.\u201d</p> <p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cHow does Jack feel about letting you ride another stallion?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, Kelly. We\u2019re pleased for you and Jack. Even if we\u2019re a bit surprised by his...choice.\u201d</p><p>Martine flashed her fangs. \u201cYou have been married before?\u201d</p><p>Keely frowned. \u201cNo. Why would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just assumed girls in your neck of the woods married early. Anyway, I\u2019m sure your family is pleased you caught a man like Jack.\u201d</p><p>Caught. Like I laid out a trap line? Give me a fuckin\u2019 break.</p><p>\u201cDoes Jack get cattle or land or pigs or something after you get married?\u201d the nasty blonde asked with mock-sincerity.</p><p>\u201cOr forty acres and a mule?\u201d another added.</p><p>Martine admonished her. \u201cTheresa! That was not nice. I\u2019m sure that \u2018bride price and dowry\u2019 nonsense is a thing of the past.\u201d She peered at Keely through slitted eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Tittering and whispers.</p><p>Keely wanted to crawl into a hole and die. This situation was beyond any horror she\u2019d ever encountered. Nothing would make these women be civil to her. They saw her as fresh off the farm meat and decided to cut her down to size, one petty, shallow little slice at a time.</p><p>Fight back.</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t embarrass Jack in front of his colleagues, which meant no firing off rude suggestions. She\u2019d suffer the humiliation with whatever dignity she could muster. But if Jack wanted to hang around with his vicious friends after dinner, she\u2019d plead a headache and return to the room.</p><p>Don\u2019t you mean slink off to your room like a whipped pup?</p><p>Backing down and biting her tongue was a new experience. These blowhards needed a serious smackdown, but Keely McKay couldn\u2019t wield the verbal paddle tonight. Or any other night.</p><p>People started drifting into the banquet room. Keely didn\u2019t budge, praying the pit vipers would slither off. Maybe she could regroup with others who weren\u2019t so incredibly vile. But mostly she hoped Jack would come save her.</p><p>So much for her feminist mantra of not needing a man to rescue her.</p><p>Martine whispered loud enough for all her friends to hear. \u201cI realize you\u2019re used to hearing a dinner bell clank as a signal for chow time, but if you follow the herd you\u2019ll realize they\u2019re starting to serve dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You miserable, tight-assed sow.</p><p>\u201cOr you can just come along with me since we\u2019re sitting together.\u201d</p><p>Sheer panic arose. She wasn\u2019t sitting with Jack?</p><p>Martine\u2019s lips curled into a sneer. \u201cOh, you poor thing. Didn\u2019t Jack tell you? Typical of him, he\u2019s so aloof and unconcerned for anyone except himself. At these events they separate the men and women. So the men can talk business and the women...well, you can imagine how fun it\u2019ll be, us getting to know you over five dinner courses.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched. She doubted she\u2019d be able to choke down a single bite.</p><p>And if Keely thought it couldn\u2019t get worse, she was sadly mistaken.</p><p>Theresa asked if she chewed tobacco.</p><p>Reagan asked if she used hay as toothpicks.</p><p>Laura asked if she hunted and killed her own food.</p><p>Martine asked if she made all her own clothes.</p><p>After they tired of making fun of her, they took great joy in ferreting out how rural Keely was. They gasped upon hearing she\u2019d never been to New York City. Or the Caribbean. Or the Orient. Or Europe.</p><p>She\u2019d never heard of any of the clothing, shoe and handbag designers they yammered on about ad nauseum. She\u2019d never attended an opera or a Broadway play or the ballet. When Keely admitted she\u2019d been to an art opening\u2014namely her brother Carter\u2019s\u2014they\u2019d rolled their eyes. \u201cWestern\u201d art wasn\u2019t real art.</p><p>Keely hadn\u2019t anticipated Martine\u2019s snideness. But it\u2019d gone beyond Jack being her former lover type of jealousy. And Keely didn\u2019t understand why Martine bothered to engage in the \u201cKelly is a low class bumpkin\u201d attack if she believed Keely so far beneath her social stratosphere.</p><p>The meal, the insults, the sheer horror of the night dragged on. And on.</p><p>During a pause in the speaker\u2019s program, Keely retreated to the ladies room, debating on whether she should cut bait and run. When she exited the stall, Martine was freshening her lipstick at the sink.</p><p>Keely couldn\u2019t muster a smile. Or even meet Martine\u2019s cruel eyes in the mirror. She washed her hands slowly, hoping Martine would leave.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>Martine waited while Keely dried her hands. Naturally, they appeared to be the only ones in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hold onto him, you know.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI know Jack told you about me. About us. I\u2019m sure he also told you I left him for his partner. But I\u2019ll bet your frumpy dress he didn\u2019t cough up the truth about why I left the gorgeous, sexy, charming Jack Donohue for an older man?\u201d</p><p>For money hovered on the tip of Keely\u2019s tongue.</p><p>Martine slithered closer and Keely forced herself to hold her ground. But she refused to look at her.</p><p>\u201cJack is a workaholic. I suspect he has something to prove because of his humble background. I didn\u2019t mind his obsession with business when we were first together. He was so dynamic I forgave him.</p><p>Eventually I couldn\u2019t continue to overlook the missed dinners. The broken plans. The ruined vacations. The last minute cancellations because he prioritized business over everything. He had few friends. He had nothing to do with his family. Jack is all about work. He will do absolutely anything to get ahead in this business.\u201d</p><p>A strange tingle worked its way down Keely\u2019s spine. Much as she hated to admit it, there was a lot of truth in that statement.</p><p>\u201cWhen he deigned to spend time with me, he expected that time to be spent on my back in his bed.</p><p>Yes, Jack was an amazing lover, but I found his sexual appetite to be rather primitive and excessive. More kinky than I was willing to give him. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s found that \u2018anything goes\u2019 dirty girl type of kink with you?\u201d</p><p>Do not blush.</p><p>Martine sighed. \u201cI can see by your stubborn silence you don\u2019t believe me. I pity you. I\u2019ve been where you are. I\u2019m lucky Baxter could see I was unhappy whenever I went to Jack\u2019s office and Jack wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Baxter treated me as I deserved, lavishing time and attention on me. He\u2019s given me everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. Baxter and I are well suited, which between us, bothered Jack far more than anything else about the situation. Jack knew no matter how much money he made or how successful he\u2019d ever become, he\u2019d always be trying to prove to everyone and to himself that he was good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s mouth fell open at Martine\u2019s completely asinine assessment of Jack. But she finally met the snake eyes in the mirror. \u201cYou honestly believe if you and Jack would\u2019ve stayed together, it would\u2019ve been because he accepted he\u2019d...married up?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were chips of ice. \u201cBetter than marrying down.\u201d Those revulsion-filled eyes raked her head to toe. \u201cGood God. Could you be any more of a country mouse? You don\u2019t even know how to properly dress yourself for a business function. How embarrassing for Jack. He\u2019s really scraping the bottom of the barrel with you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bull\u2019s-eye. Martine\u2019s maliciousness torpedoed any remnant of Keely\u2019s confidence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself he\u2019ll actually go through with marrying you. Every year, it\u2019s the same sad story.</p><p>Jack shows up at the conference with his latest piece of ass. Young. Hot. Oblivious. Everyone knows he\u2019s trying to make me jealous. Trying to prove to his male colleagues what a stud he is. We all laugh. It\u2019s so pathetic. I\u2019m sure you noticed all the staring and whispering you attracted. This is a small community, and you\u2019ll find no one will take the time to befriend you. What\u2019s the point? This time next year you\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t cry. God, do not give this woman the satisfaction of seeing your tears.</p><p>Martine rearranged wisps of her hair in the mirror. \u201cI feel sorry for you. You\u2019re as gullible as you look and you\u2019ve fallen hard for Jack\u2019s charm. My best advice is to keep that ring he\u2019s given you. It\u2019ll buy you a new horse or repairs on your truck or whatever pitiful thing you need after he dumps your mousy ass back in Wyoming.\u201d She twirled on her heel and flounced out.</p><p>Blood scorched Keely\u2019s cheeks. A sick feeling of betrayal and finality settled deep in her bones. She wasn\u2019t sure she had the strength to move. But she didn\u2019t have the strength to stay either. Not in the bathroom, not in the hotel, not in Colorado. Not with Jack.</p><p>Go home. It\u2019s where you belong. She felt like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, when the phrase \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home\u201d repeated in her head as she trudged back to the room.</p><p>In something of a daze, Keely changed her clothes and packed her suitcase. Rather than chancing running into anyone, she bypassed the elevators and hoofed it down the stairs to the garage level where she\u2019d parked her truck. Oddly, it fit her frame of mind to discover she\u2019d parked on the lowest level.</p> <p>After she\u2019d cleared the Denver city limits, she realized she was in no shape to drive to Sundance.</p><p>Holing up in hotel didn\u2019t appeal to her. She didn\u2019t want to see anyone she knew or talk to anyone she knew.</p><p>Confessing Martine\u2019s degrading remarks would be bad enough. But hearing platitudes about how she shouldn\u2019t let Martine\u2019s insecurities affect her would be much worse.</p><p>Martine\u2019s words had cut to the bone. Maybe they were just nasty barbs, but barbs stung whether the connection with them was intentional or accidental.</p><p>All Keely wanted was to reconnect with herself. To remember who she was.</p><p>On autopilot, she drove to the refuge she\u2019d fled to the years she\u2019d lived in Denver. She\u2019d always found herself here. But before she climbed out of her truck, she curled up in the bench seat and cried.</p> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Jack had tuned out the speaker\u2019s drone an hour ago.</p><p>About the last time he\u2019d seen Keely.</p><p>And whose fault is that?</p><p>His. He\u2019d been busy networking and hadn\u2019t realized Keely had gotten stuck with the coven at Martine\u2019s table until the dinner was over.</p><p>His gaze zeroed in on her empty chair again. Where the hell could she have gone?</p><p>Clapping echoed as the speech finally ended and he distractedly joined in. Immediately Jack was on his feet. When his colleagues stopped him to talk, he couldn\u2019t very well walk away, since he\u2019d attended the conference to work. By the time he\u2019d made it out of the banquet room, another twenty minutes had passed.</p><p>And still no sign of Keely.</p> <p>Jack was starting to get worried.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>He turned as Gina Arguello approached him. When Jack lived in Chicago, he\u2019d collaborated with Gina\u2019s husband Donnie on a couple of projects and he\u2019d been to their house for the occasional barbecue.</p><p>\u201cGina. Nice to see you. How are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting big and ornery.\u201d She hesitated and twisted her wedding ring around her finger. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you here. I know the last couple years were rough on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrutal. But things are looking up. Was there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my place to say this or not, but I accidentally overheard a conversation between your fianc\u00e9e and...Martine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour ago.\u201d</p><p>An odd feeling of foreboding replaced any sense of relief. \u201cWhere was Keely when you heard it?</p><p>Because I\u2019ve been looking for her.\u201d</p><p>Gina blushed. \u201cIn the lady\u2019s room. I\u2019m pregnant and I wasn\u2019t feeling well after dinner so I went to the restroom. I was about to come out of the last stall when I heard Martine start in on her.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartine went off on this tirade about you. Then she started belittling Keely. It was vicious. If I thought I\u2019d felt nauseous before, it was worse by the time Martine finished with her.\u201d</p><p>Jack forced himself to stay calm. \u201cTell me all of it.\u201d When Gina finished, Jack stared at her in absolute horror.</p><p>\u201cI know I should\u2019ve jumped in and put a stop to it, but I don\u2019t want to tangle with Martine. Ever.</p><p>Donnie needs the consulting work with Baxter, especially with another kid on the way. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to apologize. There\u2019s no way to stop the shit that Martine spews. Do you know where Keely went after Martine left?\u201d</p><p>Gina shook her head. \u201cI planned on talking to her and telling her Martine was full of lies, but when I left the stall, Keely wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed Gina\u2019s arm. \u201cThank you, Gina.\u201d</p><p>His gut was tied in a mass of knots.</p><p>Stay calm.</p><p>As he walked to the elevator, Jack dug out his cell phone and called Keely. Automatically the message kicked over to her voice mail.</p><p>Stay calm.</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the handrail as the elevator whirred up to his floor.</p><p>Stay calm.</p><p>Jack even managed not to take the length of the hallway at a dead run.</p><p>Stay calm.</p><p>He inserted his key card and called out, \u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>When he saw her key card on the dresser but no suitcase, all calmness evaporated.</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit straight to fucking hell, Keely McKay. Where the hell did you go?\u201d</p><p>Jack called her cell phone again. He left another message.</p><p>Over the next hour, Jack called her cell phone twenty-seven times. He called her home phone twenty-nine times.</p><p>After nearly wearing holes in his shoes from pacing, he called information in Sundance. His heart raced as the phone rang. An irritated female voice snapped, \u201cYou\u2019d better have a good reason for calling me this late, whoever you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ. It\u2019s Jack.\u201d</p><p>She went on alert so fast he felt her panic through the phone lines. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2019s gone. She\u2019s not answering her cell phone and I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing! I swear. We were at a business banquet, we got separated at dinner and evidently an old...girlfriend of mine said some upsetting things. Keely left without a word to me. I only know that much because a woman overheard their conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you guys weren\u2019t fighting again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt some point in the last two hours she got in her truck and took off and... Shit, I\u2019m worried because I know she\u2019s upset. Jesus. I\u2019m upset. And I will wring her neck if I find out she\u2019s driving all the way back to Sundance this time of night by herself.\u201d</p><p>AJ was quiet. \u201cLet me try calling her. Maybe she\u2019s just not answering your calls.\u201d</p><p>Jack closed his eyes. \u201cThank you. Call me right back. Please. And if you do talk to her, tell her I\u2019m sorry. So goddamn sorry and I had no idea that she\u2019d gotten stuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Calm down. Let me try her first before you start relaying all the things you want me to tell her, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He flexed and smacked his fist into the mattress while he waited for AJ to call. His phone rang five minutes later. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just ditching your calls. She didn\u2019t answer when I called from my cell, or from the house phone, or even from Cord\u2019s phone.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cEither she\u2019s really really pissed or she\u2019s driving through Wyoming where there\u2019s no cell service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your best friend. What\u2019s your gut feeling? Is she driving home?\u201d</p><p>AJ sighed. \u201cMy gut feeling is no. She needed time alone to sort things out and she\u2019s smart enough after the accidents in her family not to act rashly when she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would she go?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Jack knew AJ knew exactly where Keely had gone. \u201cAJ. I know your first loyalty is to Keely. I get that. I wouldn\u2019t ask if I wasn\u2019t losing my fucking mind. Jesus. I need to make this right. She walked into something tonight that had nothing to do with her and I didn\u2019t warn her. That part is my fault, okay? But that also means I need to fix it. Christ. I\u2019ll do anything to fix it. Please. Just help me find her.\u201d</p><p>AJ sighed again. \u201cWhen we went to school in Denver and we were missing home, we\u2019d head to the Quarter Past Midnight Stables. Keely got chummy with Darla, the owner, and exercised horses and cleaned stalls for fun. After I married Cord and moved home I know she spent lots of time there.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like Keely. Making friends all over the damn place and finding fun and solace in a damn barn. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s not there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another place she\u2019s goes, but it\u2019s much closer to home. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if it comes down to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. After you find her, make her call me, Jack Donohue, so I know she\u2019s okay. Or I swear to God I will sic her brothers on you. One at a time. Before I call Carson.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wrath of an angry pregnant woman scared him almost as much as Keely\u2019s dad. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Jack went to find his cowgirl.</p><p>Two vehicles were in the parking lot at Quarter Past Midnight Stables. A Dodge Ram with Colorado plates and Keely\u2019s dirty, beat up black Ford. Jack almost kissed the bug-covered grille.</p> <p>The office door was unlocked. A buzzer sounded and within a couple minutes a bleary-eyed woman appeared in the enclosed office space. She slid open the glass partition. \u201cHelp ya with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yeah. I\u2019m looking for Keely McKay.\u201d</p><p>The bleariness vanished and her focus turned razor sharp. She flipped her long, gray braid over her shoulder and folded her arms across her abundant cleavage. \u201cAnd who would you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of ya.\u201d She slammed the partition and turned her back on him.</p> <p>Jack rapped on the glass. \u201cDarla? AJ McKay said I could find Keely here. I saw her truck in the parking lot. I know she\u2019s here somewhere. Please. I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>Darla whirled back around but didn\u2019t open the glass window.</p><p>She studied him. \u201cYou say you talked to AJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she gave me hell too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always liked that girl.\u201d Darla shook her finger at him. \u201cKeely\u2019s in the south white barn. If she don\u2019t want you here, I\u2019ll escort you off the premises with my shotgun, we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>Darla hit the switch that unlocked the gate.</p><p>Jack forced himself not to run when he saw the white metal siding of the barn on the south end of the property. The door was already open. The pungent odor of horseflesh and horseshit blasted him as he walked in.</p><p>The dim lighting revealed little beyond twelve stalls lined up, six on each side. Very quietly he started down the center section and tiptoed past curious horses until he found her.</p><p>Keely had her back to him. Her glossy black braid hung past her shoulder blades. She wore a flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up. Faded jeans tucked into old shit-covered boots. One hundred percent country cowgirl. One hundred percent his.</p><p>Keely McKay was his. She belonged to him.</p><p>The self-admission was not the shock to his system he\u2019d imagined. He suspected he loved her all along and he\u2019d fought it, creating elaborate excuses and lying to himself that sex and circumstance made him feel this way. But as Jack looked at her, he really saw her. Her. The woman who owned him.</p><p>He\u2019d found the once in a lifetime, bone deep, straight to the soul kind of love he\u2019d never believed in.</p><p>For the longest time, Jack watched the woman he loved combing the Quarter Horse. Murmuring to it, running her hand across the withers. Keely pressed her face into the horse\u2019s neck and tried to keep her shoulders from shaking as she cried.</p> <p>Her every tear felt like a drop of acid on his heart. Jack didn\u2019t deserve her, but he took a step toward her, toward their future together anyway. Would she let him soothe her? Kiss away her tears? He\u2019d promise her the damn moon if she\u2019d stay with him. If she\u2019d give him another chance.</p><p>But would she ever love him the way he loved her?</p><p>Keely swiveled around at his approach, eyes swollen and nose red from crying. She still looked beautiful. His gut clenched knowing her misery was his fault.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t yell at him, insult him, or ask him what the fuck he was doing here, Jack knew he had an uphill climb. A spitting mad Keely he could handle. But Keely seemed...defeated. And he didn\u2019t know how to handle that. Waltzing in here and declaring his love for her would only muddy the waters. She probably wouldn\u2019t believe him anyway. It\u2019d keep.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called AJ.\u201d</p><p>She stopped brushing the horse for a second. Then she resumed the long strokes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick her ass. She shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begged her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m surprised you even noticed I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Look. I\u2019m sorry you got stuck with Martine tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Did Martine really corner you in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t miss a beat in her horse grooming. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman named Gina overheard the conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 awesome. Did this Gina laugh about it when she told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s not like that, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019d be about the only one in that lousy group of women.\u201d Brush brush brush. \u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me.\u201d</p><p>A snort. Hers or the horse\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you leave without telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t answer to you, Jack, and I didn\u2019t need your permission to leave. I needed to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>Jack dry-washed his face and forced himself to stay calm. \u201cFine. But I\u2019m here. Will you talk to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 left to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Fuck being polite. \u201cMe too, Keely. Wrong to insist you go to that stupid cocktail party in the first place. Wrong to leave you at Martine\u2019s table, subjected to her ugly whims. Wrong not to notice you were gone until it was too fucking late. If anyone is in the wrong here, it\u2019s me. Not you.\u201d</p><p>Keely spoke lowly to the horse. Gave him one last pat on the rump before she picked up a bucket and exited the stall.</p><p>Jack stood aside from the gate to let her out. She never looked at him. He was undeterred by her coolness and he followed her to the tack room.</p><p>She put away the supplies and hung the bucket on a wooden peg. Ignoring him. Killing him with aloofness.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? I went so far beyond my comfort zone tonight that I lost myself? But in some respects it only made me realize how different we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not that different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I don\u2019t live my personal or professional life in the shadow of expectations from others,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do? That\u2019s the type of man you think I am?\u201d</p><p>Finally Keely looked at him. \u201cThat is the type of man you are, Jack. Instead of being who you are on the inside all the time, you change who you are to fit the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>That stung. But it wasn\u2019t the point. Why was Keely making this about him? She was the one who\u2019d been ambushed by Martine. She was the one who\u2019d bolted from the party. And not because she\u2019d suddenly realized some startling truth about his business acumen\u2014or lack thereof. She was focusing on him, his flaws, rather than the issue at hand. How badly she\u2019d been hurt.</p><p>Clever. Sneaky. But he wouldn\u2019t let it slide.</p><p>Jack stalked her. Her spine hit the tool bench; he curled his hands around her biceps. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a total and complete fuck up. A total and complete jackass. I will let you yell obscenities and scream insults at me to your heart\u2019s content, but first I need you. I need this.\u201d He lowered his mouth to hers and kissed her. He kept kissing her until she responded with the sweetness, goodness and heat that filled the empty part of his soul. He hadn\u2019t understood the depth of the missing piece until she came into his life.</p><p>He whispered kisses along the elegant line of her neck. \u201cPlease. Come back with me, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be paraded through the hotel like a naughty child who\u2019s run away and is back to face the music. And it goes beyond me not wanting to run into Martine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it go beyond you not wanting to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Another direct hit. \u201cWell, buttercup, you can\u2019t sleep in this barn, though I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll point out as a Wyoming tough girl you\u2019ve done it more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be true. And horses are better company than people. They don\u2019t judge. They don\u2019t talk back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they smell like shit and try to throw you on your ass at every opportunity.\u201d He saw her lips twitch. \u201cBesides, I won\u2019t let you drive back to Wyoming this time of night by yourself. Whatever you do, stay here, or go back to the hotel, I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>Keely absentmindedly brushed tufts of hair from her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll stay at your condo until I can leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither I stay at your place or I hit the road. Choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place it is.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d crawled under the covers; a chasm yawned between them as wide as the bed. Close but not touching. Not sleeping. Keely faced away from him. He stared at the ceiling, a million thoughts raced in his head. None coherent.</p><p>Jack finally asked her the question that\u2019d bugged him all night. Been bugging him for years, actually.</p><p>\u201cKeely, do you think I\u2019m shallow?\u201d</p><p>She rolled over. \u201cSometimes. With some things. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as shallow as you pretend to be.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wear expensive suits, live in a swanky condo and drive a pricey car, people will think you\u2019re successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me shallow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That makes them shallow because that\u2019s all they see. Are you successful because you care about other people\u2019s perceptions? Or are you successful because you want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re successful because you love what you do, Jack. The money is just a bonus.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s easy to get trapped in that name brand mindset. To start to believe that what\u2019s on the outside\u2014what you wear, where you live, what you drive, where you\u2019ve been\u2014is more important than who you are inside those trappings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you saying appearances don\u2019t matter at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, appearances do matter, but it shouldn\u2019t define you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it define you?\u201d he countered.</p> <p>\u201cNo. What if I\u2019d tracked you down in the banquet wearing my stable-cleaning clothes? If you\u2019d pretended not to know me, that\u2019s shallow. If you\u2019d kissed my cheek and said, \u2018Darlin\u2019, next time leave the shitkickers at home,\u2019 that\u2019s caring less about appearances because you were happy to be with me.\u201d</p><p>Jack seized the chance to turn the tables. \u201cWould you be happy to be with me, Keely? If the reverse was true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay I accept your dirty boots and western quirks. Say you accept I\u2019m a suit-and-tie-wearing guy. Say I\u2019m madly in love with you. You\u2019re madly in love with me. Would you give up your way of life to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay of life?\u201d she repeated.</p> <p>\u201cWould you move away from your home in Wyoming to live with me in this condo in Colorado? Or are you so set in your ways that you wouldn\u2019t consider it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with being shallow?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s shallow that you won\u2019t consider living anywhere besides Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t look at me with pity because I live in a high rise and wear a monkey suit? The same way those women pitied you for what you wore and where you lived?\u201d</p><p>Sticky silence.</p> <p>Jack wanted to tell her he wasn\u2019t just hypothesizing. Would any kind of long term, real relationship have to be solely on her terms?</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am shallow,\u201d she said in a small voice. \u201cI never thought of it that way. You definitely gave me something to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely. You misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I did. I\u2019m happy in my own skin. I could be happy anywhere if I was with the person I loved. But it\u2019s a moot point anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t love me. And I don\u2019t pity you for the way you live as much as you pity yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 ever is. Good night, Jack.\u201d</p> <p>She jerked the covers so tightly around herself he only saw a lump on the other side of the bed.</p><p>Cocooned as she was, she wouldn\u2019t have heard his But I do love you rebuttal, but he said it anyway.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you and let you know, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jack scrambled her brain with a kiss with equal parts fire and sweet regret.</p><p>Keely watched the elevator doors close and returned to his condo. She spent a considerable amount of time staring out the window contemplating her options.</p><p>Wow. Big choices: Stay or go.</p><p>Her cell phone blared \u201cOne Hot Mama\u201d. Smiling, she said, \u201cHey, AJ. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feet. Foster is down for his nap. Ky and Anton are helping Cord. So I have time to grill you about what the hell happened last night.\u201d</p><p>Where to start? \u201cJack was too freakin\u2019 busy being a businessman to notice I was miserable with his asshole associates\u2019 wives. I got tired of being the lowbrow entertainment and left. Oh, and piss off for telling him where I went, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do, K? I\u2019ve never heard calm, cool and collected Jack Donohue that upset. I figured something major had gone down if you\u2019d bolted. So sue me. I wanted to make sure you were all right just as much as he did. You know how we all hate it when you just take off and no one has a clue where you are.\u201d</p><p>Keely closed her eyes and let her head fall into the headrest. Sometimes getting away by herself was the only way she could clear her head. Her family didn\u2019t understand, so she\u2019d stopped trying to explain and just took off whenever she needed.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s where you tell me what happened,\u201d AJ prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt was a fucking nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill doesn\u2019t explain anything, K.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to put it in a context that didn\u2019t sound hopelessly high-schoolish. \u201cRemember when you first moved to Denver? We went to that party over at Tim\u2019s house and you had an awful time? Back at the apartment you cried because you\u2019d felt totally out of place, like my hick cousin who\u2019d never been to the big city? That describes last night.</p><p>\u201cBut replace the obnoxious jocks with Jack\u2019s colleagues. Replace the snotty sorority sisters with snooty colleagues\u2019 wives. I wore the wrong clothes. I wore the wrong shoes. Hell, I think they sniffed to see if I had cowshit on me. Plus, the ringleader was Jack\u2019s old flame and she made me feel small enough to fit into a thimble\u2014before she cornered me in the can to reinforce what a total fuckin\u2019 loser I am. It was horrendous, AJ. All I wanted was to go home.\u201d</p><p>AJ paused thoughtfully. \u201cSo you ran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And I hid.\u201d And I realized I\u2019m a total idiot for falling in love with a man I can\u2019t have because he sees me the same way they do: A hick country girl who\u2019d never fit in his world.</p><p>\u201cYou never run. You always stay and fight.\u201d</p><p>Keely sighed. \u201cI know. But I was in way over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo next time you\u2019re in that situation? What happens?\u201d</p><p>It won\u2019t happen again. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely. Listen to me. Sounds like these social events are a big part of Jack\u2019s professional life. You can\u2019t run every time. You have to find a way to deal with it in a way that works for both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy way to deal? I\u2019d tell Martine and her cronies to fuck off. But I can\u2019t because it\u2019d reflect badly on Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But you\u2019ve got no reason to hide and hang your head in shame for not being good enough. So what if you wore the wrong clothes? You\u2019ve got a college degree for cripesake. You\u2019ve worked for the PBR, the PRCA and the VA. You\u2019re part of one of the oldest ranching families in Wyoming. You\u2019re on your way to being a businesswoman in your own right. Plus you\u2019re generous and funny, everyone who meets you loves you, not to mention you are beautiful inside and outside. If they can\u2019t see that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t feel like I should have to defend my life or explain who I am to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Jack know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does now. I don\u2019t want to change, AJ. I\u2019m happy with who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen screw \u2019em. What the hell do you care what some hoity-toity wives think? They don\u2019t have any power in Jack\u2019s career. Isn\u2019t that why they\u2019re called trophy wives? They\u2019re worthless ornamentation. I say show up tonight in your hottest, most flattering western outfit and flirt shamelessly with all their husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat plan, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. If they already dislike you, what\u2019re you out? They smacked your pride; hit \u2019em back where it hurts. We both know, sista, when you\u2019re on, you\u2019re on. No one can top you in the charm department. No one can top you in the looks department. Let that wild child out, Keely West McKay. She\u2019s been caged too long.\u201d</p><p>Keely laughed. God, she loved AJ. She was the best friend in the history of the world. \u201cThat\u2019d definitely stir things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill this \u2018in your faces beyotches\u2019 response cause problems in your relationship with Jack?\u201d</p><p>When she and Jack broke up, AJ could convince everyone she\u2019d seen it coming due to their divergent philosophies. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you out?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Or everything.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it. When will you be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Come over, I\u2019ll crack Cord\u2019s expensive tequila for you and we\u2019ll talk more. I love you, K.</p><p>You\u2019re the best person ever. Don\u2019t believe differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and stared out the window again.</p><p>Hell. Maybe AJ was right. If Keely McKay was going out, maybe she should go out with a bang instead of a whimper.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Keely was twenty minutes late for the pre-dinner cocktail party. Not intentionally\u2014it\u2019d been difficult finding a parking place big enough for her truck. She\u2019d wound up on the bottom level of the parking garage. Again. Not a good sign.</p><p>Wrong. You\u2019ve got no place to go but up.</p><p>True. With each step into the hotel her inner cheerleader kept up a brisk, You can do this! You can do this! She was doing it; she just wasn\u2019t sure how smart it was.</p><p>After she\u2019d sauntered in, the banquet room hushed in a collective pause she\u2019d seen in movies.</p><p>Fuck \u2019em. Let \u2019em stare. This is the real me. Proud to be one hundred percent pure Wyoming cowgirl.</p><p>If they didn\u2019t like it they could take a flying fuckin\u2019 leap. So could Jack.</p><p>Keely wore a pair of dark blue, skintight bootcut jeans with deerskin leather fringe running down the outer seam of each leg. The fringe made a cool flap flap noise as she walked. She\u2019d threaded her rainbow crystal b.b. simon belt through the belt loops and tucked in her favorite baby blue camisole to showcase the horseshoe-shaped rhinestone buckle. Lastly she\u2019d donned a vivid blue long-sleeved shirt, embroidered with cornflowers, finished off with pearl snap buttons. Her feet sported scuffed up ostrich skin Ariat boots.</p><p>Baxter Ducheyne approached her first and his piggy eyes slowly scrolled over her. She forced herself not to shudder at his leering smile. He thrust out his sausage-fingered hand. \u201cKeely. Lovely to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine, Baxter,\u201d she lied. \u201cHave you seen Jack? I didn\u2019t meet many people last night after I left the dinner.\u201d Thanks to your vomit-inducing wife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jack\u2019s here someplace. Don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019d be happy to introduce you around,\u201d Baxter assured her.</p><p>Keely oozed folksy charm. At one point, she realized a half dozen men surrounded her. A lanky man with a pronounced goiter and Fabio\u2019s flowing hairstyle had spoken to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sugar, what did you say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI-I wondered if you\u2019d like a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m more of a beer girl.\u201d</p><p>Male chuckles.</p> <p>\u201cDid the hotel provide a full service cash bar tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...no. Sorry. Just wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnooty bastards. Nothin\u2019 wrong with beer and we are in Coors country after all.\u201d</p><p>More chuckles.</p><p>Keely placed her hand on Fabio-aka-Ichabod\u2019s arm. \u201cThanks for asking. I\u2019d love a glass of ice water.\u201d</p> <p>He beamed. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disappear for a few minutes and you\u2019ve got someone else playing fetch and carry for you?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s sexy husky voice caused a ripple of desire. She turned; Jack\u2019s handsome, perfect face was right there. Green eyes rapt, full mouth curved into a smile. Without preamble, he pressed his soft, warm lips to hers, kissing her soundly.</p><p>Keely melted into him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stunning as always, cowgirl. Except I\u2019m disappointed you\u2019re not wearing your lasso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left it upstairs on the bed.\u201d She winked and hip-checked him. \u201cFor later.\u201d</p> <p>More laughter. Man. She was on a roll.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve met some of my colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaxter was thoughtful enough to provide introductions to the gentlemen I missed last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Baxter, don\u2019t you be trying to steal another woman from me,\u201d Jack chided.</p><p>The guys in the group didn\u2019t know whether to laugh.</p><p>Baxter finally grinned. \u201cIf I would\u2019ve known Keely was in your future, Jack, I might\u2019ve waited to steal her instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know I\u2019m that expendable,\u201d Martine said drolly behind them.</p><p>\u201cMartine. Sweetheart. You know we were joking,\u201d Baxter said, drawing her into the circle.</p> <p>The others in the group scattered, leaving the four of them alone together.</p><p>Martine ignored Baxter, granting Keely a head to toe inspection. \u201cHow sad you thought this was a costume party, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Keely, not Kelly, but I\u2019m sure at your age it\u2019s hard to keep names straight.\u201d Keely flashed her teeth. \u201cAnd thank you for noticing my outfit, although these are my everyday clothes. No point in wearing my best duds when there\u2019s no one here I need to impress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most impressed with you when you\u2019re wearing nothing at all,\u201d Jack mock-whispered.</p><p>She half-shoved him. \u201cYou are insatiable, Jack Donohue. Behave in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, but never in private. If you\u2019ll excuse us, I need a minute alone with my beautiful bride-to-be.\u201d Jack steered her to an alcove that wasn\u2019t private in the least.</p><p>Keely smiled. \u201cSurprised to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He curled his hand around her neck, stroking his thumb along her jawline before smooching her lips with softness and sweetness. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What is on the agenda tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner, followed by a long, boring annual meeting. Then I take you up to the room and fuck you until you scream my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling confident?\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cNever when it comes to you, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Not a response she\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s mingle so we can get the hell out of here as soon as possible when it\u2019s over,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>During dinner they sat with a couple from Chicago, as well as Jack\u2019s other colleagues who\u2019d ragged on him for his hermetic state in the last few years. Keely enjoyed herself more than she\u2019d expected. Jack was attentive, not overtly obvious, but acting as if he genuinely cared for her.</p><p>She and Gina slipped out when the business meeting started, intending to hit a downtown toy store.</p><p>Since Gina had forgotten her purse in her room, Keely waited in a quiet reception area around the corner from the main bank of elevators.</p><p>The quiet didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the wannabe queen of the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>Keely counted to ten before she deigned to glance up from her cell phone. \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Mrs.</p><p>Ducheyne.\u201d More like Mrs. Douchebag.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re brave and cool showing up dressed like that?\u201d A dismissive gaze flickered over her.</p><p>\u201cWow. You really have nothin\u2019 better to do than to try and harass me? Why do you care what I wear if I\u2019m so inconsequential to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of like your little pep talk in the bathroom was supposed to embarrass me? Did you believe your lies had the power to send me packing? Wrong. Wyoming women are made of sterner stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTackier stuff for certain,\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cOoh, and it was so classy to have your jealous rant about Jack...in the crapper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous? I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which we laughed about more, your ridiculous yarn about Jack bringing bimbos to this conference, or your bizarre belief Jack\u2019s still carrying a torch for you. Talk about being embarrassed for you, lady. Jack was over you three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d Martine snapped.</p><p>\u201cBecause Jack and I ended up together at my brother\u2019s wedding reception in Wyoming a month before you \u2018left\u2019 him for Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Yep. But it served Martine right. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jack since I was sixteen, Mrs. Ducheyne. I found it...enlightening at our engagement party last month that his mother and brother knew zilch about you. If Jack couldn\u2019t be bothered to tell his family about your relationship, really, how important could you have been to him?\u201d</p><p>Martine glared but she didn\u2019t storm off. Probably trying to formulate a snarky comment about Keely\u2019s hair or clothes, since that was the extent of her insult repertoire.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is: it bugs the living shit out of you that you made a mistake dumping him. You can\u2019t help but compare sexy as hell Jack Donohue, to the stodgy, pudgy old timer you settled for. Especially when you see Jack is happy and successful without Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuccessful?\u201d she sneered. \u201cThat\u2019s a stretch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I\u2019d bet your matronly purse Jack gets the Milford restoration project because I was there when he pitched it. They love him and they loved his ideas.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned shrewd. \u201cYou were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And besides that project, Jack is contracted for my historic building, a courthouse in Montana and two projects in Iowa. That\u2019s just through the end of this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018my historic building\u2019?\u201d Martine demanded.</p><p>\u201cJack is supervising the restoration of a historical building which will house the rehabilitation clinic I\u2019m opening in Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA freebie for you? How charitable. I doubt he\u2019s spending much time on it since he\u2019s so...busy.\u201d She made quotes in the air with the word busy.</p><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s been working out of our apartment in Sundance, it\u2019s not a long commute for him to Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re living with Jack in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know that, did you?\u201d</p><p>Martine\u2019s face darkened.</p><p>\u201cJack and I have a history. We have a future. So I\u2019ll say this as simply as I can. Stay away from me.</p><p>Stay away from Jack. If you ever corner me in a bathroom again? Be prepared for me to come out swinging.\u201d</p><p>The elevator pinged and Gina rounded the corner. Once she saw Martine she tried to backpedal. \u201cOh, sorry, I\u2019ll just wait over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m ready for some fresh air.\u201d She walked away, head held high.</p><p>Inside the elevator car, Keely laughed. \u201cWhat a pretentious bitch. I can\u2019t believe I almost let her get to me.\u201d</p><p>Gina said, \u201cShe scares me. She scares everybody in this organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>As Keely said it, she really believed it.</p><p>After she\u2019d purchased gifts for her nephews and nieces, and a surprise for Jack, Keely returned to the hotel room. She had no idea how long Jack would be stuck in the meeting.</p><p>To kill time, she filled the garden tub and added scented oil. She slipped beneath the bubbles, sighing at the rare indulgence. Nestling her neck into a towel, she sipped the beer she\u2019d liberated from the room fridge.</p><p>Keely blanked her mind to everything except the hot water caressing her skin. The soft popping of soap bubbles. The tart taste of the cold beer.</p><p>But her conversation with Martine bobbed to the surfaced like a rotten apple. She\u2019d met plenty of people in her twenty-seven years who didn\u2019t like her. But always for a reason, not simply because she existed.</p><p>No, Martine doesn\u2019t like you because you have Jack.</p><p>What a laugh.</p><p>How much did it suck she was in love with a man she couldn\u2019t have? Sure, she could have him tonight, his body, his undivided attention, his sexual expertise. But come tomorrow morning, they\u2019d say goodbye. He\u2019d be gone for the next three weeks. During which the majority of her building remodel would be completed. During which he\u2019d most likely be awarded the Milford project. During which she\u2019d have a breakdown, knowing she\u2019d never find a man who\u2019d hold a candle to Jack Donohue.</p><p>In retrospect, that\u2019s what she\u2019d always been afraid of\u2014falling in love with him. It\u2019d been easier to hate him.</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a pretty sight,\u201d Jack drawled.</p><p>Keely jumped. In the depth of her forlorn thoughts, she hadn\u2019t heard him come in. But she didn\u2019t open her eyes, not wanting him to recognize her melancholy.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s put the frown on your face, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>The thought of losing you. When I never really had you.</p><p>She absentmindedly waved the half-empty bottle at him. \u201cI figure you\u2019d be pissed when you saw me drinking a ten dollar beer out of the mini-bar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can come up with an inventive way for you to pay me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d Keely swigged and let the bottle dangle by the outside of the tub. \u201cHow was the rest of your meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong and boring. Pointless. Did I mention long and boring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow was your shopping excursion with Gina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpensive. Lord. Why do I have so many nephews and nieces? I limited myself to spending ten bucks on each kid and I still walked out two hundred dollars poorer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love them and you\u2019re not really complaining.\u201d</p><p>Keely smiled. \u201cHow true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I face you or sit behind you?\u201d</p> <p>That question made her eyes fly open. Oh wow. Jack was totally, gloriously, buck-assed nekkid.</p><p>Totally, gloriously, buck-assed nekkid and fully aroused. And holding two beers. He really was the perfect man. She scooted forward, splashing water everywhere. \u201cYou can sit behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I thought you might say that.\u201d</p><p>Jack handed Keely the beer. When he stretched out in the tub, she was enveloped in his substantial presence\u2014all muscles and heat and hot, hard man.</p><p>Definitely not getting over him any time soon.</p><p>She situated herself between his thighs. Her spine pressed into his chest. Her head seemed to fit in the curve of his neck perfectly.</p> <p>He\u2019d dimmed the overhead lights and the lamps from the bedroom offered a golden illumination. Had Jack meant the setting to drip of romance? Probably not.</p><p>Jack\u2019s free hand gently stroked her arm as it rested on the edge of the tub.</p><p>He sipped. She sipped. The water had cooled. She lifted her foot and cranked the hot water tap with her toes. After it\u2019d warmed, she slumped back against him.</p><p>\u201cWhat talented toes you have, Miz McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly trick I can do with them, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. I was hoping you could juggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, I never learned to juggle. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to juggle. Haven\u2019t tried it in years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s a lot like riding a bicycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you try to juggle for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it turn you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely. Everything you do turns me on, Jack.\u201d Dammit. Why had she said that?</p><p>\u201cThen absolutely I\u2019ll juggle for you.\u201d Jack kissed the slope of her shoulder and her skin broke out in goose flesh. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I love this section of your skin?\u201d</p><p>He repeatedly dragged openmouthed kisses over the bared flesh. Prickles of goose bumps followed in the wake of his marauding mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re so responsive to me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cJack. God. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. I really was liking bein\u2019 nekkid with you in the tub, relaxing, drinking our very tasty, very expensive beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Me too.\u201d Jack flicked his tongue up the cord in her neck. \u201cBut once the beer is gone, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Promise?</p><p>Dammit, Keely. Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>For a long while they didn\u2019t speak, just continued floating together in relaxation.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Jack said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything.\u201d He pressed a kiss by her temple. \u201cMy life is an open book for you.\u201d</p><p>Keely bit back the obvious How do you feel about me? question and blurted, \u201cHave you traveled to Europe since your career is all about studying architectural details?\u201d</p><p>He skimmed his fingers across the surface of the water. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Never really wanted to, to be real honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI travel a lot as it is. So for me, the perfect vacation wouldn\u2019t involve any travel. No sightseeing.</p><p>None of that typical tourist stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d prefer one of those \u2018stay-cations\u2019 people on the coasts talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpending a week in my condo would never be considered a vacation,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYour bed is comfy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be all over a stay-cation if you were in my bed for a solid week, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Keely nipped her teeth into his jaw. \u201cSmartass. I\u2019m serious. So...since we\u2019re pretending to be engaged, where would you take me on our pretend honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA private island. Where the sun is hot, the sand is soft, the water is warm and clothing is optional.</p><p>There\u2019s no one around but us. Two solid weeks of alone time, doing whatever struck our fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be well versed in getting sand out of my ba-jingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBa-jingo?\u201d Jack murmured in her ear. \u201cI knew you watched TV. Eliot on Scrubs is the only one I\u2019ve ever heard use the word ba-jingo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBusted. After AJ married Cord, I spent hours wallowing in reruns on TBS and figuring out what to do with my life.\u201d</p><p>His throat muscles worked as he swallowed a drink of beer. \u201cIs that when you came up with the idea for a clinic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I started traveling with the sports medicine team on the rodeo circuits. The rehabilitation aspect appealed to me, but long term, not short term. It was great practical experience. Not only did I earn college credits, it was sheer heaven putting my hands all over hot cowboys and going to the rodeo for free every night.\u201d Jack snarled softly and she loved that he was jealous. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really put it all together until after Cam\u2019s war injury.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s wet fingers trailed up her arm. \u201cI know Cam\u2019s experience was hard for the whole family, but Carter indicated it was rougher on you. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Keely swigged the last liquid from the bottle and set it aside. \u201cNot only because I lived with him and helped him get back on his foot\u2014ha ha\u2014after he returned from Iraq. See, Cam and I have always had an unusual bond in that we both knew we\u2019d never be part of the McKay ranching operation as adults.</p><p>Cam out of choice; me out of gender.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cYour dad cut you out of your ranch heritage because you\u2019re a woman? Jesus, Keely, that\u2019s archaic. And how the fuck is that fair to you?\u201d</p><p>She curled her free hand over his, surprised by his vehemence on her behalf. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain how it is. Because before my dad died, even when he knew I\u2019d never take over the farm, he gave me the choice. Sounds like Carson isn\u2019t giving you that same option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have a stake in the McKay Ranch, smaller than my brothers\u2019. Which it should be because I don\u2019t help with day-to-day operations. I draw a salary from the profits, if there are any. I take the minimum amount and leave the rest of the cash for operations. Cam is the same. So is Carter, although, because Carter lives in Sundance half the time, he\u2019s more involved.\u201d</p><p>Jack squeezed her hand. \u201cBut where does that leave you?\u201d</p><p>His sweet concern allowed her to be honest about the situation, maybe for the first time. \u201cIt leaves me looking for my place in the family and in the community. Buying the building was the first step to being on my own as an adult. As Keely McKay, proprietor of a medical establishment, not Keely McKay, unfocused wild child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that moniker bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. It\u2019s not who I am. I did what I did. Reap what you sow, blah blah blah. Some of it was stupid, but nothin\u2019 worse than anything anyone else my age was doing.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThere were bets I\u2019d be pregnant by a cowboy and married by seventeen, divorced by nineteen, remarried to another cowboy by twenty-one. I\u2019d squeeze out a couple more kids, end up divorced again, and about the time I turned twenty-five, I\u2019d settle down with a local rancher my parents approved of. Of course, no one knows the ins and outs of our family line of ranch succession. Even if I do marry a rancher, he\u2019d better have his own spread because he won\u2019t get an inch of McKay land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if he\u2019s married to a McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. All male succession, remember? So the direct descendants, my dad and uncles, had to legally change everything so the ranch stays a patriarchal line after I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you get nothing?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cI got everything,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI got to grow up on the most beautiful place on earth surrounded by all the people I love. I still can traverse any part of McKay land any time I want. But as far as me ever getting controlling interest in the McKay Ranch? Won\u2019t happen.\u201d Keely shivered because the water was getting cold. \u201cSo I always wondered if the cowboys were sniffing around me because the biggest part of my feminine appeal was my connection to the McKay land.\u201d</p><p>Jack set his beer bottle aside and curled his hand around her jaw, forcing her to look at him. \u201cRest assured. Your appeal is not due to your family name or some piece of Wyoming dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. It\u2019s you, cowgirl. Plain and simple. And I\u2019m not after your land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you after, Jack?\u201d Please say my heart.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Jack kissed her. \u201cAnd this.\u201d A deeper kiss with a lingering caress down the center of her body.</p><p>\u201cAnd especially this.\u201d His hand floated back up to circle her breasts.</p><p>The more he kissed her the more difficult the connection was to maintain. Jack flipped her to face him, splashing water up the wall and over the rim of the tub. He straddled her across his lap and wrapped her legs around his waist. Slick skin against slick skin. Mouth on mouth. The kisses were long. Slow. Wet.</p><p>Endless. And perfect. This man knew just how to touch her. Knew how to read all sides of her.</p><p>Jack unclipped her hair and combed his fingers through the strands, letting the ends drift on the water.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever cut your hair. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d She fingered the wet tips of his hair. \u201cI love that you wear it a little long. It\u2019s very bad boy sexy for such a suit and tie wearing professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen long it stays.\u201d His hungry lips slipped down her wet neck as he sipped the water from her skin.</p><p>\u201cKeely. I need you. I needed you last night, but I...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never say no to you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. You don\u2019t say no to me even when you should.\u201d More sweet kisses. More scorching kisses. More sweeping touches. More urgency. Jack said, \u201cLift up.\u201d</p><p>Keely gripped the edges of the tub and raised her body. She lowered onto his shaft bit by bit, dragging out the mutual pleasure until his male hardness filled her. When they were locked together, body to body, soul to soul, breathing the same humid air, everything seemed right.</p><p>It was rare for her to gaze into Jack\u2019s face from a higher vantage point. She couldn\u2019t stop the awed,</p><p>\u201cDamn, GQ. You are one beautiful man.\u201d</p> <p>His hand shook as he pushed damp tendrils from her cheek. \u201cNot like you, Keely. You undo me.</p><p>Every time I look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d She smoothed her hands over his neck and strong shoulders as she moved on him. Held him. Watched him. Wished he felt as...completed with her as she did with him.</p><p>Water sloshed everywhere as they rocked together. Came together.</p><p>After they\u2019d dried off and slipped between the sheets, Keely understood this really was the end.</p><p>Early the next morning, they were subdued as their parting of ways loomed.</p> <p>Jack helped Keely load her packages and luggage into her truck. Saying goodbye in the parking garage seemed anticlimactic after all they\u2019d been through. Especially since they\u2019d reached for each other twice during the night, not knowing who\u2019d made the first move, not caring, just rejoicing in every touch.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Jack said gruffly.</p><p>Keely walked straight into his arms without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jack kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll call you after I get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head and buried her face in his neck, inhaling the dark, familiar scent, wondering if it\u2019d be the last time she\u2019d ever be this close to him. \u201cDon\u2019t call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to wean myself from you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>A bewildered pause. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten too used to having you around. In my bed. In my life. We knew this wasn\u2019t permanent.</p><p>Dragging this out will just be harder for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just supposed to do what? Walk away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. I am. Go back to thinking of me as a client. Better yet, don\u2019t think of me at all. Just...go back to hating me.\u201d</p><p>Jack was silent as his hand stroked the back of her head, over and over, with such gentleness she couldn\u2019t stop from melting into him.</p><p>Keely whispered, \u201cBe safe. I\u2019ll see you on the jobsite in a couple of weeks.\u201d She kissed the hollow of his throat and turned away without meeting his gaze.</p><p>Or without looking back in her rearview mirror as she headed home to Wyoming where she belonged.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Three weeks later...</p><p>\u201cAunt Keely, how come you\u2019re so sad?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to answer Liesl with a half-truth. \u201cI\u2019m not sad. Just tired. And thinking about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Jack?\u201d</p><p>Keely froze. Uncle Jack. Man. That sounded weird. And yet, not weird at all. She managed a smile for her inquisitive niece. \u201cNo. I\u2019m thinking about how long it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve had a girl\u2019s night. You, Eliza and me. We could paint our fingernails, watch Hannah Montana now that I have cable. Eat Oreos and have burping contests. Whaddya say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right! But I still think you\u2019re sad. I think Uncle Jack needs to come home and kiss you because that always makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiesl. Leave Aunt Keely alone,\u201d Domini said. \u201cTake Oxsana outside with you and go play with your brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna go\u2014\u201d</p><p>Domini pointed to the sliding glass door. \u201cFresh air, girls. Now.\u201d</p><p>Liesl sighed and grabbed Oxsana\u2019s hand. \u201cMommy said we should make mud pies.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the door closed, Keely grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna give you guys fits when she hits her teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Cam is already nervous.\u201d Liesl smacked her floured hands into a glob of dough on the counter. \u201cBut is my intuitive daughter right? Are you sad because you\u2019re missing Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do miss him. What sucks is that\u2019s part of his job and he\u2019ll always be gone.\u201d She scowled. \u201cOr I\u2019ll have to go with him, which will be damn near impossible once the clinic is up and running.\u201d</p><p>Jack had called from wherever the hell he was late last night. She\u2019d fumbled with the phone and cursed at the dead air, until Jack\u2019s voice, barely audible, rasped, \u201cCan\u2019t believe I missed you swearing at me, cowgirl.\u201d Then he\u2019d hung up. Or maybe she\u2019d dreamed the whole damn thing.</p><p>Domini\u2019s hands stopped kneading. \u201cAre you rethinking your relationship with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Who knows? I\u2019m just tired. Although I love the work and the people in Cheyenne, the drive is getting old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer will you be working at the VA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month or two. Depending on my cash flow situation with the building.\u201d Depending on if Jack kicked her out of the apartment after they officially called it quits.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that \u2018back off\u2019 look, as your brother often wears the same one. But if you need to talk, Keely, I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d Keely snatched a cookie. \u201cSpeaking of talking...any luck convincing Cam into letting you adopt all the needy children in the world so you two can be nominated for sainthood?\u201d</p><p>Domini flicked flour at her. \u201cSmarty. He\u2019s considering it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Domini sighed. \u201cI get what Cam\u2019s saying about us having enough kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when the woman running the orphanage in Romania called me and emailed me the videos with those two poor darlings...\u201d Domini bit her lip and looked away, struggling to keep her tears from splashing in the bread dough. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam will come around, Domini. He\u2019s a softie. You guys are great, loving parents, what difference would two more kiddos make? It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have family around to help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I think the fact Markus is only six months old freaks Cam out more than that the poor baby needs eye surgery.\u201d She sighed. \u201cPlus, Markus\u2019s older sister, Sasha, is eighteen months old and if we do this, we\u2019d have two kids in diapers again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvesting in Huggies for the next three years isn\u2019t the issue, is it?\u201d Keely said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Domini slammed her fist into the dough.</p><p>A bad feeling surfaced at seeing her normally docile sister in law so angry. \u201cDomini. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong with me, but what is wrong with other people? They can\u2019t have children so they decide to adopt and then they only want perfect children? Or just one cute infant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there another couple interested in adopting Markus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But just him. Not Sasha. And the director wants to keep the siblings together if possible, but if not, she\u2019ll have to split them up. I would never demand to separate siblings and that\u2019s what will happen if we don\u2019t act on this soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Keely\u2019s eyes filled with tears when she saw the hopelessness in Domini\u2019s face. \u201cTalk to Cam tonight. If you need me to watch the kids so you two can have alone time, I will. And when you decide to jet off to Romania to bring home your new additions, I will stay here and crack the whip on your four hooligans for as long as you need me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would do that for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout hesitation. You\u2019re my family. It\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jack?\u201d</p><p>Keely frowned. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he might have an issue with you living here for a few weeks?\u201d</p><p>I may not have any other place to go. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he has an issue with it.\u201d She briefly closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be an issue at all, to be real honest, Domini. Please don\u2019t tell anyone, especially not Cam, but things aren\u2019t going well with me and Jack.\u201d</p><p>Domini placed a floury hand over hers. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I wondered if that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Liesl is right; you do seem sad since you got back from Denver. And you also seem to be filling all your free time with McKay family activities. While we\u2019re grateful, we love you and we all love spending time with you, you deserve happiness of your own, Keely, in your own life. Whether it\u2019s here or in Denver, whether it\u2019s with Jack or someone else.\u201d</p><p>Keely looked out the door at the kids playing in the backyard. \u201cI know. I just...\u201d Love him and he doesn\u2019t know it. And none of this was ever real. And even if it was, I don\u2019t think I could choose living with him over living around family, \u201c...wish Jack and I wanted the same things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p><p>Fat chance. \u201cMaybe. Thanks.\u201d Keely hopped off the stool. \u201cHave fun hosing off your kids. Liesl and Anton are having a mud fight. Ooh, and look! Now the twins are slinging slop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh good Lord. What makes me think I can handle two more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it and you guys wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>The only thing running through Jack\u2019s mind as the outskirts of Sundance shimmered in the distance was, Thank God.</p><p>Aside from his father\u2019s death, the past twenty-three days had been the shittiest of his entire life. The projects had gone all right, although none of them would make him rich. Hell, he\u2019d probably lose money when he added in his travel costs.</p><p>Which would fit in with the way his life was going. He\u2019d about lost his fucking mind when forced to say goodbye to Keely in Denver. She\u2019d turned him inside out with her teary, don\u2019t call me request. Pissed him off too. He\u2019d managed to let her go, but only temporarily. It wasn\u2019t over between them. Not by a long shot.</p><p>When Jack returned to the hotel room, he noticed the small box of Legos Keely had hidden in his suitcase. With a note,</p><p>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Remember to make time for fun. Love, your cowgirl.</p><p>He\u2019d stared at the unopened package, blinking back tears. Keely knew him down to the bone, so how could she be so damn oblivious to the fact he\u2019d fallen in love with her?</p><p>So during the last three weeks, to take his mind off all the things he missed about Keely, her fiery addictive kisses, her violation of his personal sleeping space, her uninhibited sexual response, her inventive curses, her absolute devotion to her family, her stupid country music, her gas-guzzling dirty-ass truck, her gentle insistence with her clients...he\u2019d worked. But she was never far from his thoughts.</p><p>So Jack had broken down and called her. Just wanting to hear her voice. But it hadn\u2019t been enough.</p><p>He\u2019d booked the last flight out of Des Moines. When he\u2019d landed at the Denver airport after midnight, he climbed in his car and had driven straight through.</p><p>To her.</p><p>The hell if they wouldn\u2019t have it out. They seemed to be at their best when they were fighting anyway.</p><p>Jack just had to convince Keely they were worth fighting for.</p><p>Sundance resembled a ghost town at four in the morning. He dragged ass across the alley and fumbled with his keys, only to discover the outside door to the building hadn\u2019t been locked.</p><p>After he climbed the dark stairwell and reached the landing, he tried the door handle to the apartment.</p><p>It turned easily. Dammit. Keely hadn\u2019t bothered to lock the door. Made him crazy she wasn\u2019t vigilant about security measures. Any creepy fucker could\u2019ve waltzed inside and attacked her.</p><p>In Sundance? You\u2019ve been living in the big city too long.</p><p>Jack inched the door open. No squeaking hinges. The apartment was black as pitch. He started toward the bedroom. But the hair on the back of his neck prickled, right before he caught movement in his peripheral vision. He dropped to the ground as air whooshed above him.</p><p>Keely shrieked, \u201cStay down motherfucker. I\u2019ve got a gun and I will blow your head off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely? What the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then an incredulous, \u201cJack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s Jack. Jesus Christ! You scared the living hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 sneakin\u2019 into my apartment at four o\u2019clock in the goddamn morning? You could\u2019ve called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me not to call you, remember?\u201d He pushed to his feet and squinted at the death grip she had on the item in her hand. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake. You swung a cast iron frying pan at my head? You could\u2019ve killed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the point, asshole.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cWhere\u2019s the goddamn gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the kitchen table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it loaded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No. I forgot I was out of shells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for me,\u201d he muttered. He took another step forward until he could see her face.</p><p>If Jack thought his heart was racing from the adrenaline rush of fear, it was flat lined compared to how it pounded being this close to Keely. For the first time in weeks.</p><p>The cast iron frying pan hit the floor with a thud and Keely launched herself at him. \u201cJack, you sneaky bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely, you psycho redneck.\u201d</p><p>Then her mouth was on his, making a mockery of every passionate kiss they\u2019d shared before that moment. When she twined herself around him, as if trying to climb inside his skin, Jack actually believed she might love him.</p><p>\u201cTouch me. Put your hands all over me. It\u2019s been so long. God, Jack, I\u2019ve been dying for you.</p><p>Please.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her and she circled her legs around his waist, kissing him like crazy, running her hands through his hair as he carried her into the bedroom.</p><p>Keely broke her mouth free and whispered kisses along his jaw, her hands tugging at his throat. \u201cYou and these ties, GQ. Makes it hard to get nekkid fast.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed softly. \u201cYou and these flannel pajamas, cowgirl. Makes it easy to get naked fast. I want the ugly things off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have you here to keep me warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d He flashed her a wolfish grin. \u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>She stripped. He stripped.</p><p>He tackled her to the bed. Pinning her arms above her head, he moved between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cJack. I...\u201d</p><p>His body stilled. Keely looked so serious. \u201cWhat, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I missed you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d He flexed his hips and thrust inside her.</p><p>Oh hell yeah. She was hot and wet and perfect. And his. And damn why did he feel like he was finally where he belonged?</p><p>\u201cYou feel good.\u201d She nuzzled his collarbone. \u201cYou always feel good on me. In me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth reconnected with hers. Teasing. Tasting. He fucked her leisurely, but with intent. Wanting to draw it out, but also needing that rush of unparalleled pleasure as he poured himself into her.</p><p>Keely met him thrust for thrust. Kiss for kiss. When she writhed beneath him, squeezing his cock with her pussy muscles, he slammed in, giving it to her harder. She arched her neck, gasping his name as she started to come.</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from her face, so beautiful lost in passion. He rode out the storm with her. His hips pistoning, back straining, balls tight, skating closer to ecstasy with each fast plunge...but it was Keely\u2019s openmouthed kiss on his chest that kicked him over the edge.</p><p>It was Keely\u2019s loving touches that brought him back to reality.</p><p>She murmured, \u201cNext time I\u2019ll whip out the rolling pin.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>They pulled back the covers and crawled between the sheets. Keely wiggled until they were close enough to breathe the same air. A wiggling, hot, naked woman rubbing soft, warm, sexy body parts on him didn\u2019t relax him in the least.</p><p>Jack brought her on top of his body and whispered, \u201cAgain.\u201d He took his time licking and sucking and caressing every delectable inch of her body. This climb to pleasure was longer, sweeter, but more intense as they scaled the heights together.</p><p>Afterward, spent and wrapped in each other, Jack murmured, \u201cFirst thing tomorrow we need to have a serious talk, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jack woke alone. No wonder Keely was gone; the clock read ten a.m. She\u2019d left a note, letting him know she\u2019d gone to Moorcroft.</p><p>After he showered and dressed, he checked his phone for messages. Damn. He\u2019d missed a call from Henry. The voice mail merely asked Jack to call Henry at his earliest convenience.</p><p>This was it. Jack dialed and paced until the call was picked up. \u201cHenry, Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Henry said flatly.</p><p>That didn\u2019t bode well. \u201cI received your message. I take it the committee has made a decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ve decided to go with BMD, Baxter Ducheyne\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>Jack slumped forward as if a machete had been driven into his back. \u201cI see. As I spent a considerable amount of time and money pitching this project, I am curious to know why you went with Baxter.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it came to the attention of the committee you hadn\u2019t been forthcoming about a few business things, quite frankly, that disturbed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really feel it\u2019s appropriate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. If the committee is questioning my business practices, I have a right to know what\u2019s being questioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, you were aware when you originally bid this project we interviewed morally sound, family type companies to entrust with our project. We reconsidered yours when we learned of your engagement.</p><p>However, we were not aware of your...living situation with Miss McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, Jack, aren\u2019t you and Miss McKay are living together in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>Jesus. \u201cYou\u2019re awarding the contract to Baxter solely because I stay with Keely, the woman I plan to marry, in the building I own, rather than in a hotel, when I travel to Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not solely on that, but it is a fact we can\u2019t ignore, nor can we condone. It\u2019s also been brought to our attention that there is some...shall we say, nepotism at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Henry. You\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, or are you not, supervising a remodeling project for Miss McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But what bearing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, Jack, you can\u2019t expect us to believe it wouldn\u2019t be in your best interest, as well as your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s, for you to automatically sign off on all building changes for her project, regardless if those changes meet the state historical standards?\u201d</p><p>Fury shot through him. \u201cWhere in the hell did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not curse at me, young man. I am merely relating the facts as they\u2019ve been presented to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy whom?\u201d Jack asked through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat is irrelevant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy whom,\u201d Jack repeated. \u201cIf my professional reputation is being examined, I have a right to know who is attempting to malign it. It is your moral obligation to tell me, is it not?\u201d</p><p>Henry sighed. \u201cBaxter Ducheyne\u2019s company pitched to us. In the two days Baxter and his lovely wife Martine spent in Milford, she revealed a few disturbing things, including your past relationship with her.</p><p>Martine questioned whether you\u2019d follow through with your wedding to Miss McKay, given your inability to commit to her during the year you were together in Chicago. She also mentioned you immediately dissolved the partnership with Baxter and moved across the county before she married your partner.\u201d</p><p>Jack seethed. Too angry to speak.</p> <p>\u201cBaxter brought up the ethics of your company signing off with the Wyoming Historical Society on Miss McKay\u2019s building, especially since the two of you are intimately involved.\u201d</p><p>Unreal. This was a fucking nightmare.</p><p>\u201cImagine our surprise when Mrs. Ducheyne asked if we\u2019d agreed to consider western artwork projects from Miss McKay\u2019s brother. I believe you mentioned him to us as a possible sculptor for our city square project, did you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But Carter McKay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill possibly be your brother-in-law, so you can see the committee\u2019s point of view about another case of nepotism, Jack. With all of these...incidences staring us in the face, I\u2019m sure you understand why we had concerns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can understand why I would feel Mrs. Ducheyne\u2019s information to you would be biased, based on my past history with her. How she came across information about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you speak with your fianc\u00e9e, Mr. Donohue,\u201d Henry said coolly. \u201cMrs. Ducheyne stated Miss McKay freely relayed this information to her, during a business conference in Denver a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Jack froze.</p><p>\u201cIn addition, your fianc\u00e9e boldly claimed you had this restoration project wrapped up. Baxter was mightily upset, understandably so, as he hadn\u2019t the opportunity to pitch us his ideas yet.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of damn thing to say.</p><p>\u201cRest assured, this information about your company will stay confidential among the committee members. Good-bye Jack and good luck.\u201d</p> <p>Henry hung up.</p><p>That big-mouthed cowgirl had fucked him over.</p><p>What goes around comes around.</p><p>Infuriated, he headed for Moorcroft.</p><p>Keely couldn\u2019t believe how fast the building was shaping up. In another month, the clinic could open for business.</p><p>The door slammed and Jack barreled in.</p><p>Speaking of dream fulfillment...Keely intended to tell Jack she loved him, hoping the last piece of the puzzle of her life would fit into place.</p><p>But Jack wasn\u2019t wearing the soft look of a man in love. Jack was absolutely infuriated. And he got right in her face.</p> <p>\u201cDid you tell Martine we were living together?\u201d</p><p>Weird way to start a conversation. \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you also tell her I had the Milford restoration project \u2018wrapped up\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I said \u2018wrapped up\u2019 but I told her the committee liked your concept\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ, Keely, do you have any idea what the fuck you\u2019ve done to me? You\u2019ve torpedoed my goddamn career!\u201d</p><p>Before Keely defended herself, Jack went off on a tangent.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you. And how did you repay that trust? By fucking me over. Big time. Because Martine somehow hurt your poor little feelings, you just had to open your big mouth and one-up her, didn\u2019t you? By telling her we were living together. By telling her I had the Milford project in the bag. By taunting her that I offered to marry you, when I hadn\u2019t offered to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, guess what, cowgirl? That offer of marriage is off the fucking table for good.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s stomach roiled.</p><p>\u201cNow, not only did I lose the goddamn Milford project, my ethics are in question.\u201d Jack jabbed a finger at his chest. \u201cMy ethics. Do you know how fucking hard I\u2019ve worked to keep my reputation impeccable? Now I\u2019m being accused of nepotism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNepotism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid. Baxter and Martine are questioning whether I should even be allowed to sign off on this project for you since we\u2019re intimately involved. What do you think the odds are the next call they make is to the Wyoming Department of Historic Preservation? I could get my fucking certification pulled!</p><p>And if I\u2019m pulled in one state, what do you think the odds of me getting pulled in every other state are?</p><p>Pretty much fucking guaranteed.</p><p>\u201cNot only that, you told Martine about Carter? How the fuck do you think that makes me look? Not to mention your brother? Yes, I suggested the Milford committee consider hiring Carter to do a couple of bronzes. Now, I\u2019m being accused of nepotism again, and Carter is going to lose out on a potentially huge fucking commission. Because of you. How do you think he\u2019ll react when he finds out you fucked this up for him? You think he\u2019ll be so goddamn eager to leap to his baby sister\u2019s defense every fucking time I turn around?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. Jesus, Keely, stay Wyoming tough.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have anything to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. Her voice came out softer than usual. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Jack?</p><p>You\u2019ve got it all figured out. Got all the blame placed. Good for you. Must be nice to be so fucking perfect.</p><p>So goddamn...smug and self-righteous. But the main thing you\u2019re forgetting? Maybe the Milford committee had every right to call your ethics into question.\u201d</p><p>He bit off, \u201cWhat. The. Hell. Are. You. Babbling. About.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou set up a fake engagement with me\u2014a woman you professed to hate\u2014just to get a crack at their project. And blame me all you want for your ex-girlfriend having such a big mouth and blabbing your sordid past personal history so your ex-partner could fuck you over in front of a supposed professional organization, but it\u2019s bullshit and you know it. The bottom line is this: you\u2019d already lost any chance at the contract before you decided to shitcan your ethics and pull one over on the committee. You were so fucking desperate to spit in their eye when they didn\u2019t consider you good enough or moral enough to even be considered for their precious fucking project. Did I go along with this charade because I wanted something from you? Yes. Do I feel guilty? No. Because of me and this stupid fake fucking engagement you concocted, you actually had a shot at getting that all-important, career-boosting, fucking over Baxter and Martine project. Whereas, before, you didn\u2019t. And maybe it\u2019s irony or poetic justice or whatever you wanna call it that you\u2019re exactly in the same fucking position now as you were two months ago: no chance in hell of getting what you want.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed harshly. \u201cListen up and listen good. I won\u2019t be the only one who doesn\u2019t get what I want in this fucked up situation, because there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m ever signing off on this building project, Keely. No. Fucking. Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected nothing less of you, Jack-off.\u201d In angry, jerking movements, Keely tugged off the engagement ring and whipped at his feet as hard as she could. \u201cYou\u2019ve got ten minutes to get the fuck off my property or I will call the cops.\u201d</p><p>Keely spun on her bootheel and left without looking back.</p><p>Jack picked up the ring and stared at it. He felt none of the vindication he\u2019d expected. In fact, he felt sick to his stomach. Like he\u2019d lost more than a job. He\u2019d lost his dignity. His purpose. His morals. His way.</p><p>You lost your way a long time ago, buddy. And now you\u2019ve lost the best thing that ever happened to you. Happy?</p><p>No. Fuck no. What was wrong with him?</p><p>Jesus. When had his life become such a fucked-up mess? Just when it\u2019d seemed like everything he\u2019d ever wanted was within reach? What kind of fucking moron slapped it away with both hands and harsh words?</p><p>He curled his fingers around the ring, half wishing she\u2019d broken the damn thing and shards of metal would dig into his skin. Maybe then he\u2019d feel something besides the utter desolation weighting him down like an anvil.</p><p>You did this to yourself. Everything word she said was true and like usual, you didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>Go to her. Go after her. Make it right. For both of you. Plead your case. Plead insanity. Just don\u2019t let this get any more out of hand.</p><p>The enormity of Jack\u2019s mistake sucked the breath from his lungs. And he\u2019d accused her of having a big mouth? Jesus. Profound shame paralyzed him to the point his damn feet wouldn\u2019t move. He knew he needed to chase Keely down right fucking now. Apologize, grovel, cry, beg, crawl. He\u2019d have his mouth surgically sewn shut to stop from ever spewing such vile bullshit again. He\u2019d devote his life to worshipping her as she deserved. He\u2019d show her a hundred times a day he loved her. If only she\u2019d give him one more chance.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the lady. Get the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s head snapped up.</p><p>Chet and Remy West were standing side-by-side, fists clenched, postures screaming, We\u2019re gonna kick your ass, dumb fucker.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cFucking great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy my estimation you\u2019ve got six minutes left. And trust me, you don\u2019t wanna be here when Cam McKay gets wind of this,\u201d Chet warned.</p><p>\u201cOr Cord,\u201d Remy said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Colby is one mean bastard,\u201d Chet added with a sneer.</p><p>Remy shrugged. \u201cMy money is on Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2019s no slouch either. It\u2019s them quiet ones ya gotta worry about, huh bro?\u201d</p><p>Jack got the warning loud and clear: quiet ones like Chet and Remy, not to mention Keely\u2019s father, would be gunning for him. Soon. \u201cLook. If Keely comes back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hand your sorry ass to her on a silver fuckin\u2019 platter if you\u2019re stupid enough to stick around,\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remy snarled.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d Chet snapped.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that you care about her, but don\u2019t kid yourselves for a second that I don\u2019t care about her too.\u201d</p> <p>They snorted in stereo.</p><p>Which just pissed him off. \u201cAnd honestly, this is between Keely and me, no one else, so I\u2019m gonna say this once, and feel free to pass this on to all the McKays: back the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour minutes,\u201d Remy announced.</p><p>Chet leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. Part of me wants you to stick around.\u201d</p><p>Fuck this.</p> <p>His body heeded the message to scram. He stormed out the door, half-shocked he hadn\u2019t felt a crowbar whacking him in the back of the head.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the West boys\u2019 style. Nor the McKays\u2019. No, that psycho bunch of cowboys would come for him with a full frontal attack, no backstabbing bullshit like Baxter.</p><p>Jack welcomed it. In fact, he had half a mind to make some calls and get the whole fucking thing underway.</p><p>He had nothing else to lose.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t hang around to ensure Jack vacated the premises. Her tires spit gravel as she zoomed off in her truck. The cold, cutting wind from the open window cooled her face, but she couldn\u2019t blame the icy air for the numbness inside her.</p> <p>Tempting, as she whizzed past the Golden Boot, to belly up to the bar and drown her sorrows. Too public. She\u2019d deal with this humiliation in private.</p><p>She drove without direction, lost in her misery. She couldn\u2019t return to her apartment, which was really Jack\u2019s apartment. Neither would she burden her family. Part of her feared her brothers wouldn\u2019t let this situation with Jack slide, but an equal part feared her brothers were all male bluster.</p><p>Leaning on her parents wasn\u2019t happening either. Her mother would talk her ear off and her father wouldn\u2019t talk at all, so it was best to split the difference and avoid going home to the ranch.</p><p>Truthfully, it\u2019d be best if she disappeared for a day or so to decide the best way to deal with the Jack issue.</p><p>Issue? What issue? You weren\u2019t in the wrong.</p><p>Not about the Milford situation. Jack had lashed out at her because he\u2019d made a mistake and got caught. It sucked Baxter and Martine were so damn vindictive, but Keely figured they\u2019d move on now, after giving Jack the smackdown. Besides, if Baxter called Jack\u2019s ethics into question, his might be questioned. From what Keely ascertained from other architects at the conference, Baxter\u2019s methods were already under scrutiny.</p><p>So despite the stinging accusation, Keely hadn\u2019t ruined Jack\u2019s professional reputation. But had she ruined any chance of them being together permanently? His claim the marriage offer was \u201coff the table\u201d</p><p>confused her, now that she thought about it. Had he intended to make the offer for real? Jack had been purposely vague last night when he told her they needed to have a serious talk this morning.</p> <p>Her grandmother\u2019s warning, Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today, rang in her ears.</p><p>Good advice, but Keely feared it was too late.</p><p>She loaded up on camping supplies at the grocery store, successfully avoiding anyone she knew. Like any Wyomingite worth her salt, Keely already carried what passed for Wyoming emergency gear\u2014a tarp, a knife, ammo, matches, jerky, a Chris LeDoux CD and a shovel, as well as an old sleeping bag\u2014in her truck.</p><p>As she followed the twisty roads leading to the campground at the base of Devil\u2019s Tower, Keely realized it\u2019d been months since she\u2019d spent the night under the stars. She had no qualms about camping alone in a remote area. She had food. Water. A pistol. Most importantly, a don\u2019t-fuck-with-me attitude.</p><p>The campsite she\u2019d chosen was far enough away she could see the entire monument rising up out of the trees like an ancient skyscraper. No wonder the laccolith had been\u2014and still was\u2014worshipped by the Native Americans as a holy place. The quiet power of the rock formation always gave her chills.</p><p>Keely set up camp. She had nothing but time on her hands and a whole lot to think about. But bone deep she knew what she wanted. She just needed to gather up the courage to go after it.</p><p>The next morning Jack was past crazy, on his way to certifiable. When he\u2019d first pulled up to the apartment after he\u2019d left Moorcroft, he half-expected to see his personal shit strewn in the alley from where Keely had heaved it out the window in a fit of rage.</p><p>As hours passed and she didn\u2019t come home and she didn\u2019t answer her phone, Jack paced to the point he pissed himself off. But he couldn\u2019t sit around with his thumb up his ass when he had no fucking clue where Keely had run off to.</p><p>Call her family; they\u2019ll know where to find her.</p><p>True, but the fact her brothers hadn\u2019t shown up guns blazing meant her family wasn\u2019t aware she\u2019d taken off. Maybe he had a chance to correct the biggest mistake of his life, without any of the crazy-assed male McKays knowing Jack Donohue had done Keely wrong.</p><p>So, with nothing else to do but wait, Jack worked out. He did crunches until his stomach hurt. Then he did pushups until his arms wouldn\u2019t hold him up. He ran in place until his legs gave out. Covered in sweat, body aching, he fell on the floor and waited until the worst of the muscle cramps passed. Then he started all over again, adding chin ups to the mix. The third go around he added squats to his routine. He planned to add jumping jacks to the fourth set, but he laughed until he cried, knowing Keely would\u2019ve gotten a big kick out of the play on words. Jack. Doing jumping jacks.</p><p>At that point in his delirium last night, he\u2019d considered drinking until he passed out. But he feared Keely would come home and think he was a drunk as well as an asshole, so he\u2019d scratched that idea.</p><p>When his stomach rumbled, he realized he hadn\u2019t eaten for over twenty-four hours. He shuffled to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. What he saw on the top shelf almost made him weep.</p><p>A meatloaf. Mixed up in a glass baking dish, wrapped in tinfoil, ready to be popped in the oven. She\u2019d gone out of her way to prepare his favorite food. He didn\u2019t know why he was so surprised. She was sweet.</p><p>Funny. Thoughtful. Absolutely perfect for him. Keely McKay was everything he\u2019d never wanted and everything he needed.</p><p>The enormity of his mistake increased exponentially with every minute of her absence. He\u2019d do anything to spend his life with her. Move to Wyoming. Become a cowboy. Work on the family ranch. Hell, he\u2019d even listen to that shitty country music she loved. Take her line dancing. Join her dart league.</p><p>Impregnate her with all the kids she could handle. If she\u2019d just come home.</p><p>Jack was so goddamn tired, physically from punishing his body to the point he could barely move.</p><p>And the emotional beating he\u2019d given himself was way worse.</p><p>Man up.</p><p>He dialed the only person who could help him. He barely heard the phone ringing over the thumping of his heart. When the line was picked up, Jack blurted, \u201cI did a dumb, stupid, asinine thing, which is all my fault and I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Talk about making him sweat. He\u2019d made the phone call three hours ago. When he heard footsteps on the stairs, he forced himself to stay focused on the paper in front of him.</p><p>No knocking. The apartment door crashed open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about fucking time,\u201d he snapped, without turning around. \u201cI know you\u2019re pissed at me, but Jesus, I\u2019m worried about her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a fucking clue how pissed we are.\u201d</p><p>We.</p><p>Jack turned around.</p><p>Holy fucking shit.</p><p>Cord, Colby, Colt, Cam and Carter McKay were spread out like a bunch of goddamn gunslingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think we\u2019re doing here?\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cTrespassing on private property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo call a cop,\u201d Cam shot back.</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that in your hand, Donohue? Your last will and testament?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking hilarious. Why don\u2019t you all trot home to your wives because this doesn\u2019t concern you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong fucking answer. If it concerns Keely, it concerns us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Jack warned. \u201cI\u2019m handling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how the hell are you \u2018handling\u2019 it?\u201d Colt demanded. \u201cNear as we can tell, she ain\u2019t here.</p><p>She ain\u2019t been here all goddamn night, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her?\u201d he asked Colt.</p><p>\u201cWe talked to Chet and Remy. We know what went down.\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell us why Keely threw her engagement ring at you and vanished?\u201d Colby demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened is between Keely and me. Period.\u201d His tired eyes sought Cord\u2019s. \u201cAJ hasn\u2019t heard from Keely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s between Keely and AJ,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cBesides, it ain\u2019t like you weren\u2019t warned about what we\u2019d do to you if you fucked with her. We\u2019re here to make good on our promise.\u201d</p><p>The room seemed to shrink to the size of a dollhouse. Jack\u2019s whole body hurt. If even one of these psycho brothers came after him, he couldn\u2019t put up a decent fight, say nothing of taking on five pissed-off cowboys.</p><p>You deserve to get your ass handed to you. And it\u2019s going to happen either way.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know where the hell Keely is. I\u2019ve been going crazy waiting for her to show up and yell at me or kick my sorry ass or something.\u201d He met each of her brother\u2019s gazes, one at a time. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right? To kick my ass? So go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Carter stepped forward. \u201cRemember you asked for this, Donohue.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Jack heard was a cracking sound as Carter\u2019s fist connected with his jaw...and then the lights went out.</p><p>Dusk started to fall when Keely recognized the crunch of tires on gravel. She kept the pistol within arm\u2019s length until she determined whether friend or foe approached. The smoke from the campfire switched direction, making her squint at the vehicle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A truck. She quelled the disappointment it wasn\u2019t a BMW. Her pulse leapt when she realized it was Cord\u2019s truck.</p><p>AJ had come looking for her.</p><p>But all four doors of the quad cab opened. Colby emerged first. Followed by Colt. Cord and Cam came around the front end of the truck. Carter was the last one out.</p> <p>Keely gaped at her brothers. All five of her brothers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to find,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>Her gaze moved from face to face. She expected Cam would chew her out for taking off alone. Colby would comment she needed a babysitter. Colt would threaten to whup her butt. They did none of that. She finally looked at Carter, who\u2019d stepped forward. \u201cHey, little sis. Looks like you need a friend or five.\u201d</p><p>The tears she\u2019d kept at bay streamed down her cheeks. Keely ran straight into Carter\u2019s open arms. He caught her and squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys came.\u201d She sniffed when Cam grabbed her from Carter and hugged her tightly.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought we\u2019d just let you be when you\u2019re hurting.\u201d Cam gave her a soft head butt and set her back on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019d never let any of us get away with hiding, so what goes around comes around, little sis.\u201d</p><p>Then Colt scooped her up and swung her in a circle, like he used to do when she was little. \u201cWe ain\u2019t that easy to get rid of, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d Colt practically tossed her to Colby.</p><p>\u201cWe McKays stick together. Although you ain\u2019t got a stem, you were born with balls. You\u2019re truck tough.\u201d Colby kissed her forehead and dropped her in front of Cord.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think you\u2019re the toughest of us all. God knows you\u2019re the smartest.\u201d Cord hugged her and then smacked her ass. Hard.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn lucky we didn\u2019t all swat you. You scared the crap out of us, Keely West McKay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry. I needed time alone to think. A family trait you\u2019re all familiar with.\u201d She wandered back to the fire pit.</p><p>Her brothers followed and crowded around the fire. Colt and Colby crouched by the fire. Cord perched on a log. Cam and Carter stood, hands in pockets as they stared at the burning embers and the flames licking the pale night sky.</p><p>Cord spoke first. \u201cWhat happened between you and Jack that sent you runnin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you, did he?\u201d This from Cam.</p><p>\u201cNo. We both said some pretty nasty, hurtful things to each other. Sometimes that\u2019s worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is it over?\u201d Colby asked.</p><p>Keely stirred the embers, glad the heat in her cheeks could be attributed to the flames. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want it to be over?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze connected with Colt\u2019s after he voiced that question. \u201cNo. God no. I think he probably does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already established he\u2019s a fucking idiot if he walks away from you,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d Colby warned.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m glad we figured out he\u2019s just as stubborn as her, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>A weird feeling rippled through her. \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. And Jack. Stubborn as all get-out, both of you. Didja ever try talkin\u2019 to each other? Instead of throwing insults and stompin\u2019 off mad as a wet hornet?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s mouth dropped open. She stared at Cord, who couldn\u2019t be considered chatty on his best day.</p><p>\u201cShe threw the engagement ring at him this time, not an insult, which tells me it\u2019s over for good.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze whipped to Cam. \u201cHow did you know I threw my engagement ring at Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChet and Remy.\u201d</p><p>And they claimed their word was their bond. She snorted. They\u2019d gone tattling to her brothers fast enough. \u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you didn\u2019t show up at the building today. Doc Monroe told \u2019em you weren\u2019t at the clinic. You weren\u2019t answering your phone. They called everyone... Who\u2019d they call first?\u201d</p><p>Cord lifted his hand. \u201cI reckon they started at the top of the birth order and worked their way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey called all of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. Or thereabouts.\u201d</p><p>Damn. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ,\u201d they all said in unison.</p><p>\u201cSo what have you guys been doin\u2019 the last six hours?\u201d</p><p>Guilty looks.</p><p>Her pulse spiked. \u201cOh. My. God. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Keely. You gotta understand. We warned Jack not to mess with you,\u201d Cam said amiably.</p><p>\u201cHe knew the risks and he hurt you anyway, which pissed us off,\u201d Colby added.</p><p>Colt nodded. \u201cYou know we ain\u2019t gonna let something like that slide.\u201d</p><p>Fear, anger and shock all warred inside her. She forced herself not to scream to get to the bottom of what her crazy brothers had done to Jack. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>Carter studied her a minute before he spoke. \u201cWould you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! How could you think I\u2019d...?\u201d She inhaled, exhaled, amidst awful, bloody, violent scenarios racing through her mind. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little tied up at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Every single one of her brothers started laughing.</p><p>Not good. Not good at all. \u201cTell me where Jack is right fuckin\u2019 now or I will call every one of your wives and round up my own McKay posse to track him down. I ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>More exchanged looks. Something passed between Cam and Carter. They stood, along with Colt, and walked to the back of Cord\u2019s truck bed.</p><p>The grunting noises were loud in the stillness. Dragging, scraping sounds echoed. Hissed breaths.</p><p>Keely couldn\u2019t see the action. She gasped when her brothers struggled into her line of sight carrying a bulky form. A six-foot-four, muscular form they dropped on the ground, none too gently. A form that was blindfolded, gagged, with arms and legs tied.</p><p>Holy fucking shit. That trussed up form was...Jack.</p><p>\u201cOmigod! Please tell me you didn\u2019t kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Keely. Give us some credit. If we woulda killed him, you never would\u2019ve known,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we definitely wouldn\u2019t have brought the body here,\u201d Cam scoffed.</p><p>She glared at him. Before she could move or speak or do anything, another pickup barreled up and skidded to a stop. When the dust cleared she realized it was her father\u2019s pickup.</p><p>Carson McKay got out of his truck. His impassive gaze swept over his sons and then landed on Jack.</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cWhat in the hell is wrong with you boys?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cCut him loose. Now.\u201d</p><p>Cord crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cDad, we were just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He whipped out a Bowie knife and knelt in the dirt to saw off the binding around Jack\u2019s ankles. Then he cut the ties around Jack\u2019s wrists. Colt swore and helped her father pull Jack upright when he couldn\u2019t move the big man by himself.</p><p>When Keely started toward Jack, Carson stepped between them. \u201cYou can go to him in a minute, okay?\u201d He threw up his hands as he addressed his sons. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of shit you boys are pullin\u2019, but I raised you better than that. What were you thinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were thinkin\u2019 it was his goddamned fault she was gone,\u201d Cam snapped.</p><p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t gonna stand by and let him treat her that way,\u201d Colt said stubbornly. \u201cYou raised us to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, Keely ain\u2019t exactly six years old anymore. She\u2019s old enough to make up her own damn mind about when she needs protection and who she wants it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking Jack\u2019s side?\u201d Carter demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m takin\u2019 Keely\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s head spun. Was she having an out-of-body experience? Or was she just in the throes of a bizarre dream? Had her brothers really kidnapped Jack? And dragged him out here like some kind of trophy for defending her honor? Instead of her father high-fiving them, he was chewing collective ass?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I understand where you\u2019re all comin\u2019 from. I thought about flaying the skin offa Jack a piece at a time myself. But the bottom line is Keely chose Jack. He might not be the one you\u2019da picked or I\u2019da picked for her. Jack might be dumb as shit, but we\u2019ve all been there. Complete and total dumbasses when it comes to the women in our lives. None of us can claim we didn\u2019t make a mistake or two. But we\u2019ve managed to figure out how to fix \u2019em on our own, and I\u2019ve gotta give Jack the benefit of the doubt and allow him the same chance with Keely.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, surprised she had the urge to weep within this cloud of testosterone.</p><p>\u201cGirlie, tell your brothers goodnight.\u201d He turned his back on his sons and crouched by Jack.</p><p>Grumbles. Curses. But Carson McKay had said his piece and his word was law.</p><p>Cam gave Keely a hug. \u201cIf you change your mind and decide to shoot him, I can get you off on a self-defense charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cam. But that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>Colby pressed a jar into her hand as he kissed her forehead. \u201cThis\u2019ll help with his sore muscles. Not much good on bruises, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruises? What the hell did you guys do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we thought was right,\u201d Colt said, holding her tight. \u201cCan\u2019t blame us for looking out for you, Keels, because we love you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they\u2019re happy tears, I don\u2019t mind. I mostly recognize the difference now.\u201d Cord wrapped her in a one-armed hug and mumbled, \u201cCall AJ tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Keely faced a hangdog Carter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou deserve the best, K. We\u2019d do anything for you, don\u2019t you know that? I feel so damn guilty because Jack is my friend. I brought this on you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Keely wrapped her arms around him and whispered, \u201cNo, Carter, you brought him to me. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He pecked her on the cheek. \u201cIn that case, you\u2019re welcome. And tell him I\u2019m sorry about his jaw.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t even ask what the hell that was about.</p><p>Her heroic, but slightly misguided brothers loaded up in Cord\u2019s truck and were gone. She didn\u2019t move until after the dust settled.</p><p>The fire had died down. Keely stoked it, gathering her thoughts before she wandered to where her dad and Jack sat, speaking in low tones.</p><p>Jack wouldn\u2019t look at her. His elbows rested on his knees. He\u2019d aimed his face at the ground.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, how did you know\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout your brothers goin\u2019 all vigilante? I didn\u2019t. \u2019Cause I sure wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve condoned it. Jack called me earlier this morning and admitted he\u2019d screwed up with you big time. He asked if I\u2019d help him find you.</p><p>Evidently, before I made it to your apartment, the boys showed up and took matters into their own hands.</p><p>AJ called me because she knew something was up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also felt guilty because she told Cord where she thought I might be hiding out, huh?\u201d Keely asked.</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLook. I\u2019ve given Jack a hard time since you came home wearin\u2019 his ring. I stopped questioning how he felt about you after he asked me to see to getting up a teardown party for your building.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cJack set that up? Not you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. He didn\u2019t want credit. He just wanted it done and wanted you happy. That told me a lot about the kind of man he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a little about picking good men, since I\u2019ve been surrounded by them my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted how you felt about him, punkin, I just never thought he could handle you. Now I see he handles you just fine.\u201d</p><p>Keely heard Jack snicker.</p><p>\u201cAnd I also realize you ain\u2019t a little girl and I oughta butt out of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you did, you did out of love, Daddy, not spitefulness, not meanness. I hope the day never comes that you butt completely out of my life.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d hear you say that.\u201d He looked over at Jack. \u201cTakes a big man to admit his mistakes and ask for forgiveness, Keely. Remember that. Jack might be dense, but he ain\u2019t dumb.\u201d He gathered her in a fierce hug and whispered, \u201cDoes he make you happy?\u201d</p><p>She whispered back, \u201cWhen he\u2019s not making me crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I reckon everything will turn out fine.\u201d</p><p>Carson McKay climbed in his truck and roared off, leaving her and Jack alone.</p><p>Her nerves were strung tight as she erased the distance between them.</p><p>Finally, Jack lifted his chin and looked at her.</p><p>Keely\u2019s heart turned over with love and her belly knotted with pain. She dropped to her knees in the dirt in front of him. \u201cHoly hell, GQ. What did they do to your beautiful face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter punched me.\u201d Jack ran his fingers across the lump that hurt like a motherfucker. \u201cHit me hard enough to knock me out so I don\u2019t know what the hell else the McKay posse did to me while I was at their mercy. I will say it took all five of them to take me down.\u201d His eyes searched hers. \u201cIs it bad?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s soft fingers traced his stubbled jawline. \u201cNo. You\u2019re a sight for sore eyes, Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>He circled his hand around her wrist and kissed her palm. He touched her cheek. \u201cKeely. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t appear to breathe. Neither did she look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had no right to yell at you for telling me the truth about my shortcomings, personally and professionally. I had no right to blame you for anything. Or to embarrass you. I don\u2019t know if I can ever apologize enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Cowgirl speak. She was nervous, which surprised him, because he was nervous as hell too. \u201cYou were right about so many things. I never should\u2019ve gone after the Milford project. I was compromising who I was to make a lousy buck.\u201d He smiled and winced when it hurt. \u201cOkay, it was a lot of lousy bucks. But my personal life should have no bearing on whether I measure up in the restoration arena. I\u2019ve been living in that shadow of bitterness and one-upmanship for years. But you\u2019ve taught me it doesn\u2019t matter as long as I can look at myself in the mirror every morning and be happy with the man I see. At the risk of sounding incredibly fucking sappy, when I look in your eyes, I see the man I\u2019ve always wanted to be.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t bother to hide her tears.</p><p>\u201cSo, as sorry as I am that we went through all that fake engagement stuff so I could make a deal, I\u2019m not one bit sorry because it led me to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. I love you. I\u2019ve been happier these last two months than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. For the first time in my life, my happiness doesn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with work. It has everything to do with you. Being with you has changed me. Changed my life. You are my life, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him in a fiery melding of lips that made his mouth ache. Wait. His mouth really did ache.</p><p>He pulled back and whispered, \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be gentle, okay? I\u2019m a little more fragile right now than I\u2019m used to.\u201d</p><p>Keely placed tender kisses on his swollen lips. The bump on his jaw. The scrapes on his neck and cheek. She leaned back to look in his eyes. \u201cI oughta kill my brothers for messing up this pretty face I love so much, but I\u2019m glad they brought you to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it just my face you love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s all of you I love. Your smart side. Your smartass side. Your sweet side. Your sour side. Your take charge side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as much as you\u2019ve had time to reflect, so have I. I want to be with you, Jack, no matter where you are. If that means a move to Denver, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never ask you to move away from your family, Keely. I know how big a of part of your life they are. I love that they\u2019re part of your life. They\u2019re a very large part of who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my life now, Jack. Remember when I said anywhere you are is my home? I meant it.\u201d</p><p>Jack was almost more choked up about Keely\u2019s willingness to follow him anywhere than he\u2019d been when she\u2019d told him she loved him. \u201cYou\u2019re finally achieving your dreams here; I won\u2019t yank you away from them. We\u2019ll figure it out. It\u2019ll take lots of compromise, but I admit...I\u2019m finally seeing the appeal of living in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But you\u2019ll never get me in a pair of cowboy boots. Never.\u201d</p><p>Keely smoothed her hand up his thigh. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you nekkid except for a pair of fringed chaps, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto, cowgirl mine. Come up here.\u201d His muscles protested when he lifted her and settled her on his lap. Her legs dangled behind him on the log.</p><p>\u201cDid my brothers really beat the shit out of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I beat up on myself. I was frustrated about how I mishandled everything and I worked out to the point of muscle exhaustion. Which is probably why I didn\u2019t defend myself when Carter came after me. I couldn\u2019t even lift my damn arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. I\u2019ll give you a deep tissue massage.\u201d Keely toyed with his hair. \u201cSo since Chet and Remy overheard our fight, does everybody know our engagement wasn\u2019t real?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cIf they overheard that part of our conversation they didn\u2019t say anything to anyone. Trust me, your brothers would\u2019ve brought it up when they were grilling me. For hours.\u201d He smiled with pure male cockiness. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t break. I just told them to butt the fuck out and let us work it out ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we worked it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, except for one thing.\u201d Jack curled his hands around her face. \u201cWill you marry me? For real this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He grumbled about being the last to know important shit, which strangely enough reminded me of you, but I think he\u2019s okay with it now. Because he did give me his blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...seein\u2019s we\u2019ve already had the engagement party, you bought the ring and everyone already thinks we\u2019re in wuv, twue wuv, I suppose it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d She gave him a smacking kiss on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cPlus, I love you like crazy, Jack-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, buttercup, same goes.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Two months later...</p><p>Keely suspected she resembled a ghost more than a bride.</p><p>She leaned closer to the lighted mirror and scrutinized her reflection. Scratch that. Maybe the Bride of Frankenstein. Yikes. Why had they gobbed so much gunk on her face? Especially when her face was completely covered? She batted at the frothy white veil, knocking the headpiece off-center. Again.</p><p>\u201cStop fidgeting,\u201d Chassie hissed, smoothing the gossamer fabric back in place.</p><p>The door to the bedroom opened. Women scurried forward in case Jack might try to sneak in.</p><p>Keely smiled, hoping he would attempt to infiltrate the inner sanctum and cart her off.</p><p>But a collective sigh echoed as the minister waltzed in and asked, \u201cHas anyone seen the ring bearer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one? I have six.\u201d Keely had drafted her oldest nephews for the wedding party. They\u2019d drawn straws to decide which unlucky sucker got stuck carrying the \u201cgirly\u201d satin pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for the ring bearer with the rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGib is missing?\u201d</p><p>No one answered. Maybe because no one had heard her over the din of giggles and gossip?</p><p>Seizing the opportunity to escape, Keely muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll find him.\u201d She tried to stand; her butt was firmly shoved back down on the tufted velvet chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice try, missy, but park it. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d India jammed more pearl-coated bobby pins in her hair.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a baby. You didn\u2019t whine this much when I tattooed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop gnawing on your lip too, or you\u2019ll smudge your gloss,\u201d Domini added as she shifted Markus on her hip, directing his grabbing hands away from the veil.</p><p>Just wait until the minister pronounced them husband and wife. Keely planned to smear the carefully applied gloss all over Jack\u2019s lips. Then she\u2019d rip off the ridiculous headpiece and stomp on it with the equally ridiculous pointy-toed satin shoes.</p><p>Temper temper.</p><p>Love aside, why did people go through this rigmarole? No wonder couples eloped. She and Jack could\u2019ve skipped this part and gotten straight to the good stuff: the island honeymoon.</p><p>She blew out a frustrated breath, twisting away from the array of beauty products, which ensured she didn\u2019t look one bit like herself on the biggest day of her life. Would Jack even recognize her?</p> <p>A tiny hand tugged on her sequined sleeve. Keely sucked in a surprised breath at the unyielding fit of the wedding gown when she bent at the waist. \u201cYes, Eliza,\u201d she said, squinting at the beribboned flower girl through the gauzy veil.</p><p>\u201cI know where Gib is.\u201d</p><p>At least someone was worried about the missing ring bearer. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe threw up in the bathroom \u2019bout five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Panic escalated along with her voice. \u201cIs he sick?\u201d</p><p>A sneer wrinkled Eliza\u2019s pert nose. \u201cHe\u2019s not sick, he\u2019s stupid. Kyler dared him to drink\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened, she clapped a gloved hand over her mouth and started to back away.</p> <p>But not fast enough. Keely grabbed her spindly arm. \u201cWhat did Gib drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPickle juice,\u201d Eliza blurted.</p><p>\u201cPickle juice?\u201d Keely repeated. \u201cWhere on earth did he find pickle juice?\u201d</p><p>Eliza debated, then said in a rush, \u201cThere\u2019s empty pickle jars all over Auntie Caro\u2019s kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t find Kool-Aid or something better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Eliza leaned closer and confided, \u201cKnow those hot kind with red peppers in the bottom?\u201d Keely nodded warily. \u201cKyler bet Gib a dollar he wouldn\u2019t take a drink.\u201d A grudging sort of admiration lit Eliza\u2019s blue eyes. \u201cBut Gib showed him. He drank the whole jar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s barfing,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>Eliza shrugged her delicate shoulders, staring with acute fascination at the grass-stained toes of her white Mary Janes. One gloved finger twisted a springy ribbon on her flower basket.</p> <p>Keely hated to play hardball with Kade and Skylar\u2019s stubborn daughter, but if Gib was lost, then so were the wedding rings. She whispered, \u201cYou\u2019d better spill it, Eliza Belle, or I\u2019ll tell your mom about the plate of mints you stashed in your backpack.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, Eliza rattled off, \u201cHe\u2019s hiding in the empty closet at the end of the hallway with Thane, Braxton, Kyler, Hayden and Anton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter that than knocking back shots of Wild Turkey in the gazebo with the other groomsmen,\u201d</p><p>Ramona added with a snort.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamona!\u201d Jessie McKay gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to tell her that her brothers and male cousins are giving Jack very detailed advice on how to handle her?\u201d</p><p>India, Jessie and Domini vehemently shook their heads no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick Trevor and Edgard\u2019s asses if they\u2019re in on it,\u201d Chassie assured her.</p><p>\u201cSame goes for Carter,\u201d Macie promised.</p><p>Why had Jack needed a stiff drink? He wasn\u2019t stuck wearing a feather duster on his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find my oldest wayward son,\u201d Channing said, shifting Austin on her hip away from her pregnant belly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Pickle juice is nothing. Gib has an iron gut.\u201d She offered Keely no such promise about Jack\u2019s condition. \u201cI hope you and Jack have all girls.\u201d She sighed and kissed Austin\u2019s dark head. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotta be easier than McKay boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgetting Keely took hellraising to a whole \u2019nother level?\u201d her Aunt Kimi prompted. \u201cWhat goes around comes around. She\u2019s gonna get stuck with a quartet of girls exactly like her, you mark my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to her, Keely,\u201d Skylar said. \u201cShe predicted Kade and I would have twin girls.\u201d</p><p>Her family was already discussing when they were going to have kids? She and Jack weren\u2019t even married yet.</p><p>Keely froze.</p><p>Married. Oh. My. God. She and Jack were really getting married. Today. In front of all these people.</p><p>In\u2014she gaped at the clock\u2014eighteen minutes.</p><p>Keely\u2019s stomach pitched like a horse trailer caught in a prairie windstorm. The room was too hot.</p><p>With too many people. Why did she have so damn many brothers? And cousins? And why had her relatives populated the place with all these noisy kids?</p><p>Sweat broke out on her brow. Her skin dried and drew tight over her bones. Muted laughter, the rustle of silky fabrics, the click of high heels on the tile; it was all too loud. The heavy scent of hairspray, perfume and flowers burned her nostrils, stuck in her throat and made it impossible for her to breathe.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t anyone see she was suffocating?</p><p>Heedless of wrinkling the satin and lace, Keely yanked up the dress, dropped her head between her knees and sucked air deep into her lungs.</p><p>The room became momentarily still, then the crowd circled her. Gentle female hands patted her back.</p><p>The feminine buzzing began again, siphoning every available ounce of oxygen and sanity.</p><p>A voice boomed, \u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake, give her some air.\u201d A round of annoyed female whispers and grumbles gave away to eerie quiet as her well-meaning relatives were shooed out.</p><p>In a soothing tone, AJ said, \u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>Keely lifted her head. Her BFF-sister-in-law\u2019s pregnant belly protruded in her lavender bridesmaid\u2019s gown. \u201cYou look like an anemic grape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing Cord likes grapes. But this isn\u2019t about me and my latest McKay baby bump, so cut the crap. Is your dress too tight?\u201d</p><p>Maybe the bodice was cutting into her oxygen supply and making her lightheaded. And paranoid.</p><p>Nope. The minute Keely sat upright, panic set in again. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed AJ\u2019s hand, pleading, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would you go?\u201d AJ asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Keely leapt to her feet and began to pace in the large, sunny bedroom. \u201cNone of this is real. These aren\u2019t my real clothes. This isn\u2019t my real face.\u201d Her voice caught on a sob. \u201cWhat is Jack gonna think when he sees me?\u201d</p><p>AJ clasped Keely\u2019s hands. \u201cIt is you. Maybe a fancier you, but it\u2019s still Keely McKay under the layers of chiffon and silk. Jack will think the same thing he always has\u2014you are the woman he loves and wants to spend the rest of his life with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere deep inside I think I know that, I just...\u201d Keely trailed off, her heart threatening to beat right out of the lace-trimmed sweetheart neckline.</p><p>She loved Jack. Jack loved her. Simple. When had their simple declaration of that love turned into a three-ring circus, complete with clown makeup and funny shoes?</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve made a break for Vegas like you and Cord did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve hurt your dad not to walk his baby girl down the aisle, K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of me understands. But I still need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you need, sweetie, and I\u2019ll be right back with it.\u201d AJ disappeared.</p><p>Keely hoped AJ planned to dose her with Wild Turkey. After several minutes passed by, Keely realized she\u2019d been left alone for the first time in hours. She didn\u2019t waste time contemplating her options.</p><p>She needed fresh air. She cracked open the door and peeked out.</p><p>The coast was clear.</p><p>Grabbing the billowy folds of her ivory wedding dress, she took off, the cushiony carpet muffling her footfalls. At the end of the long hallway stood a narrow set of stairs, which led to the first floor and her temporary freedom.</p><p>Hallelujah.</p><p>Keely\u2019s hand had just connected with the antique brass handrail, when a deep voice behind her inquired, \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Jack.</p><p>Everything inside her jumped for joy.</p><p>Yet, Jack didn\u2019t sound particularly overjoyed to see her. In fact, he sounded downright furious.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>She stammered, \u201cUh, don\u2019t you know it\u2019s bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s even worse luck for the groom to see his bride making a break for it ten minutes before the ceremony is set to start.\u201d</p><p>Jack was close enough she felt his hot breath teasing her sweat-dampened neck.</p><p>\u201cKeely, are you having second thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She spun around so fast the veil whapped him in the face. \u201cI just\u2014\u201d The words died in her mouth at his stunned expression.</p><p>Jack stayed absolutely still. Then he smiled the wicked smile that was hers alone. He captured her hand, bringing it to his lips for a gentle kiss. \u201cYou\u2019d think by now I\u2019d be used to the way you take my breath away every damn time I look at you, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Speechless didn\u2019t begin to explain Keely\u2019s emotions. Before she could articulate a single one, voices echoed up the main staircase at the other end of the hall.</p><p>Jack read her panic and pulled her into the first available room\u2014which wasn\u2019t a room at all, but the closet Gib and his cohorts had hidden in. As soon as they were inside, Jack tugged at the string attached to the light bulb, plunging the space into darkness.</p><p>He enfolded her against his hard body and Keely sank into him, inhaling his familiar scent, subtle expensive cologne and warm man. Her man. She sighed. Her heart rate returned to normal. Everything returned to normal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ tracked me down. But truthfully, I\u2019d been lurking in the hallway hoping to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t slamming shots of Wild Turkey with the groomsmen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you need liquid courage at the thought of tying yourself to me for the rest of your life, GQ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, buttercup, I had one to be polite and to keep me from ripping the damn hinges off the door to get to you.\u201d</p><p>To get to you. \u201cYou never follow the rules. Why didn\u2019t you just barge in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith all those pregnant women throwing nasty looks my way?\u201d Jack shuddered. \u201cNo thanks.</p><p>Besides, your damn sisters-in-law and assorted crazy female relatives locked the damn door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Tradition\u2019 they said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d care what they said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. But my immediate response isn\u2019t worth repeating.\u201d His large hands tightened around her waist. \u201cI was going crazy without you.\u201d Jack\u2019s warm lips tracked kisses across the slope of her shoulder. \u201cI hardly slept last night, the bed seemed so big and lonely without my bed hog.\u201d</p> <p>Amazing, how quickly they\u2019d melded into one unit. Sharing living space and office space. Sharing their lives, their hopes, their dreams, their fears, their love. The only thing left was to make it legal. Seeing Jack, touching him, knowing he was as anxious as she, set her world right again.</p><p>She twisted in his arms to face him. \u201cJust so you know, I wasn\u2019t running from you just now, I was running to you.\u201d The veil fluttered with her every exhalation. \u201cHere it is, my wedding day and I feel like I\u2019m playing dress up.\u201d Her voice dropped even lower. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll wake up and find it\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hands slipped up under the veil and tenderly cupped her face. \u201cI\u2019m very real. It is real this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it. Kiss me. Please, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hands dropped to her shoulders. \u201cNot until my ring is on your finger and I know you\u2019re mine forever.\u201d</p><p>Forever. She liked the sound of that.</p><p>He paused. \u201cBesides, I have no idea what I\u2019m supposed to do with the veil.\u201d</p><p>Keely laughed at his wariness. \u201cYou think the veil is bad, wait until you get a load of the hundred or so buttons on the back of this dress.\u201d</p> <p>Jack groaned.</p><p>\u201cBut what I\u2019ve got on underneath will be worth learning how to work a buttonhook.\u201d</p><p>He actually whimpered.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is probably wondering where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019d say let them wonder, but I\u2019m ready to do this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Keely stepped out of the comfort of his arms, giddy in the knowledge in a few short minutes, she could take comfort in those strong arms every day for the rest of their lives.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jack.
