The witching hour, some say. Since it was 12:07 A.M. and I was standing over a dead body, I had to agree.</p><p>The victim, William H. Steele, a thirty-six-year-old Caucasian male, six feet four, approximately two hundred and thirty pounds, brown hair, brown eyes, lay naked across a bed of crisp winter leaves. Moonlight spilled in every direction, and withered foliage mockingly framed his muscular physique. He bore no open wounds, no bruises. In fact, not a single blemish marred the perfection of his skin. He was only recently dead; heat still radiated from him and curled into the icy night sky.</p><p>Alien Investigation and Removal agents, also known as A.I.R., were scouring the area, meticulously searching between every blade of brittle grass, every grain of dirt. The faint murmurs of their chatter echoed in my ears. I tuned them out and intensified my focus on the body. The man\u2019s legs were slightly spread and bent at the knees. One of his hands rested behind his head, and the other was bound to his penis with a\u2014what the hell was that? I crouched down. Eyes narrowed, I reached out with a gloved hand and slid one finger under the material. A pale blue ribbon, tied in a perfect bow.</p> <p>I scowled. Was he supposed to be a gift?</p><p>Yes. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what he was, I realized, my scowl deepening. Frost gleamed in his hair like diamonds against dark velvet, yet he hadn\u2019t been outside long enough to acquire the frost from nature. He was a gift that had been posed to look carnal, seductive. Alluring. To the average citizen, he would have appeared eager for a long night of sexual gratification.</p><p>To me, he just looked like the corpse that he was.</p><p>His eyes were fixed straight ahead, his lips slightly blue, and he wasn\u2019t shivering from the cold. A dead giveaway, if you will. Besides that, his testicles were as smooth and shiny as marble, not shriveled like I supposed every other man\u2019s out here were.</p><p>With a wry shake of my head, I pushed to my feet.</p> <p>Perhaps my assessment was callous and indifferent; perhaps my humor was misplaced. Dead bodies were the norm in my line of work, and I couldn\u2019t allow myself to view this man as an actual person. If I did, I\u2019d have to acknowledge that he once had hopes and dreams, thoughts and feelings. I\u2019d cry for the family he left behind, wonder about the life that had once pulsed through his veins.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do that and still hope to function. With tears came distraction, and with distraction came death. My first year of fieldwork, I had spent more time crying for victims than hunting for their killers, and I had almost become a victim myself. I glanced down at my wrist. The inky blackness of my glove didn\u2019t quite meet the cuff of my jacket, leaving a small patch of skin visible. That skin boasted a tattoo of the Grim Reaper\u2019s scythe and was just one of my many reminders to remain unemotional.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten the tattoo after recovering from a nasty beating, courtesy of a pissed-off other-worlder. While I\u2019d been lost in my grief for a victim I couldn\u2019t even remember now, an energy-absorbing Rycan attacked me from behind\u2014and kicked major huntress ass.</p><p>I had vowed never to cry again. And I hadn\u2019t. Tears were a weakness only civilians could afford.</p><p>I am an alien huntress. I am part of the A.I.R. team, working with or against the New Chicago PD\u2014whichever suits me at the time. Every night I stalk and kill other-worlders, and whether I\u2019m investigating a death or causing one myself, I have to shove sentiment aside, find humor where I can, and concentrate on the facts.</p><p>I love my job despite the blood and gore\u2014or maybe because of it. I love solving puzzles, fitting each piece of evidence together. I love that one by one, I\u2019m ridding Earth of our unwanted visitors.</p> <p>Yes, some aliens are peaceful and are allowed to live and work among us. Those, I leave alone. But the others? The rapists, the thieves, the killers? I despise them.</p><p>Alien sympathizers often ask me if I, a hunter, a legalized killer, live with guilt. My answer: Hell, no. Why should I feel guilty for destroying a predator? I\u2019m proud of my work. I\u2019m privileged to do what I do. Other-worlders who survive on human carnage deserve the sting of my pyre-gun.</p><p>A glacial blast of wind whirled past my shoulders, scattering a thin sheen of snow powder in every direction. The hem of my long black leather jacket danced around my calves. Four inches of snow had been predicted, so I needed to work quickly. Twenty minutes ago, I\u2019d received a call from my boss, Commander Jack Pagosa. He\u2019d briefed me on the situation. He\u2019d also informed me I had until morning to present him with a suspect, or I would spend the next year behind a desk.</p><p>William Steele, a happily married father of one, had been abducted from his home four weeks prior. His wife and newborn child slept peacefully throughout the entire ordeal, unharmed and unaware. Abductor\u2019s point of entry: undetermined.</p><p>Four other dark-haired, dark-eyed men disappeared soon afterward. One had been taken from his workplace, and two had been snatched straight from a crowded street during their lunch hour. Oddly enough, there had been no witnesses and not a single shred of evidence left behind at any scene. Because of the enigmatic nature of each disappearance, aliens were the prime suspect.</p><p>Just half an hour earlier, a hunter on patrol had found Steele in this deserted Southern District field. Thankfully, the hunter had preserved the scene until my team arrived. The first thing I\u2019d noticed was that Steele\u2019s body showed no indication of torture, no sign of having been restrained.</p><p>Second, I\u2019d realized his death had nothing to do with impulse or rage\u2014just as I knew the murder had nothing to do with stupidity or amusement. The scene was too precise, too perfectly planned. Mr. Steele had been killed for a reason.</p><p>What? I couldn\u2019t yet fathom.</p> <p>I drew in a deep breath\u2014and stilled. Slowly, I drew in three more breaths. As I exhaled the last, I smiled. Since the first kidnapping, no one had dared guess which of the forty-eight alien species were responsible, but I had just narrowed it down to three.</p><p>The victim had been killed by poison. Onadyn, to be exact. A deoxygenating drug used by the Zi Karas, Arcadians, and Mecs for survival on this planet. They couldn\u2019t breathe our air without it. To oxygen-breathers, the substance was lethal. Worse, it was virtually undetectable. Virtually, but not completely. A rare few could identify Onadyn by its scent, a subtle fragrance similar to a dewy breeze during a summer storm.</p><p>I was one of the rare few, and I smelled it now. The scent filled my nostrils, intoxicating and sweet, as lovely as it was deadly, and somehow suddenly more obvious to me than the scent of waste, rotting food, and charred leaves that made up so much of this domain. My observation wasn\u2019t as solid as a neon sign blinking over the killer\u2019s head that read I DID IT in bold red letters, but it did point us in the right direction.</p><p>Still, I wanted more.</p><p>I scanned the area to my right, paused, then scanned the area to my left. Except for the occasional twinkle from regulation halolights, the task force blended into the night.</p><p>I dragged my focus farther back, taking in the tall oaks that knifed the sky. The trees were sparsely scattered, their branches naked, their bark weighed down by dripping ice. Situated between the trees were homes and businesses. I use the term businesses loosely, of course. Nice people referred to this seedy, neglected district as Whore\u2019s Corner. I\u2019d once been fined for publicly saying what I called the place.</p><p>Had any of the residents seen anything unusual? Would they tell us if they had?</p><p>I\u2019d already dispatched the most charming of my agents to question every citizen within a one-mile radius. But this late at night, civilians tended to be cranky and distrustful. Besides that, the Southern District was notorious for its hatred of law enforcement\u2014human or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Mia?\u201d Dallas Gutierrez, my right-hand man, strode to my side. He wore a black leather jacket and black combat boots that fit the hard planes of his body to perfection. At times, I thought he was too handsome to be real. His hair was dark and thick, and the inky locks hung in sexy disarray over the wide, muscled length of his shoulders. Perfect eyebrows arched over perfectly shaped eyes. Perfect cheekbones framed a perfect nose.</p><p>For some reason, he was smiling\u2014revealing perfect white teeth, the bastard\u2014yet even as the brown depths of his eyes glinted with mischief, he still possessed the razor-sharp edge of a hunter.</p><p>I admired him for that.</p><p>On more than one occasion, Dallas Gutierrez had flipped Death the bird and come out alive. He was a man who rushed into the middle of danger without hesitation. He considered his friends\u2019 safety before he considered his own, and he never regretted his choice, even when he lay wounded and bleeding. He\u2019d saved my life so many times, I should have tattooed his name on my ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhich group of aliens is responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZi Karas, Arcadians, or Mecs.\u201d</p><p>A little of the sparkle left his eyes. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>I tossed him an are-you-kidding-me frown. \u201cCan a woman lose one hundred and seventy-five pounds of unwanted fat by divorcing her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He chuckled, the sound rich and husky in the twilight. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re still single. You\u2019re vicious.\u201d</p><p>Damn right I was. I had to be. I was a woman in a man\u2019s profession, and just because I carried a pyre-gun did not mean I was taken seriously. Not even Dallas had taken me seriously at first.</p><p>His first week on the job, he fought to have me relocated. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t hunters,\u201d he\u2019d said so many times I wanted to brand the words on his chest\u2014while he was awake and tied to his bed.</p><p>I stand at five feet five, weigh one hundred and twenty pounds. I\u2019m only twenty-eight years old, but I have an indomitable will. I do not take shit from anyone, especially when it comes to my job. The first time Dallas and I practiced hand-to-hand combat, I had him on the ground in three seconds flat, my palms wrapped around his windpipe while he gasped for air.</p><p>Funny enough, we were best friends after that, and he never again mentioned my relocation.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure of yourself?\u201d he asked, folding his arms over his chest and pinning me with a frown of his own. A plastic bag dangled from his fingers.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cEver heard of Occam\u2019s razor?\u201d He blinked over at me, and I took that for a no. \u201cOccam\u2019s razor is a nineteenth-century principle that states the simplest explanation for a mysterious event is most likely the truth.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed, and his eyes flashed dark fire. \u201cHow in the hell did you decide the most likely suspect was from an oxygen-intolerant group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell Onadyn,\u201d I said, biting back a grin.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI was excited that I knew something you didn\u2019t. Thanks for ruining it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Now what\u2019s in the bag?\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words left my mouth, all traces of emotion drained from his expression. Silently, he studied me, as if trying to measure my inner strength. I knew what he saw. Straight black hair pulled tight in a ponytail, though several wisps had already escaped confinement. Wide blue eyes that had seen more evil than good, and an oval face that boasted delicate cheekbones better suited to a ballerina.</p><p>My appearance worked well for me at times. Suspects expected me to be feminine and delicate, and I was able to take them by surprise. At other times my appearance worked against me, bringing out all kinds of protective instincts in men. This was one of those times I wished I had a mustache and a long, hideous scar.</p><p>I kept my gaze locked on Dallas\u2019s.</p><p>A sigh slid past his lips, leaving the words You win unsaid, though he didn\u2019t answer my question right away.</p><p>\u201cNotice any footprints around the body?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I peered at the ground, studying, searching. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did we. And we\u2019ve analyzed every inch of dirt in this godforsaken shit hole. At first we thought someone performed a beam-me-down-Scottie.\u201d</p><p>I tossed that idea through my mind. \u201cMaybe. But most aliens arrived here through interworld portals. Not spaceships. So they wouldn\u2019t have access to the kind of technology required for a molecular transfer. Besides, the killer is cocky. What better rush than placing the body here, in full view of witnesses, and still getting away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us some credit, Mia. I said at first. We soon changed our minds.\u201d Smug now, he dangled the plastic bag in front of my face. Inside were six strands of white hair. \u201cFound them snagged on a branch.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, studied the hair more closely. They were thick and coarse and...my frown deepened. There weren\u2019t six individual strands of hair; in actuality, there were only two. Three strands per follicle.</p><p>\u201cArcadian,\u201d I said, confirming my Onadyn suspicions. Only the Arcadians had three strands of hair attached to one follicle.</p><p>Dallasnodded, his features suddenly tense, determined. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Dread prickled along my nerve endings, and my stomach twisted into a thousand tiny knots. Why couldn\u2019t the Zi Karas or Mecs be responsible? Of all the aliens to invade our planet, Arcadians were the strongest, the deadliest. The hardest to capture. Their psychic abilities proved a sufficient weapon against us, helping them evade capture. And their talent for mind control...Damn. I didn\u2019t even want to contemplate that right now.</p><p>No wonder there were no footprints around the body. An Arcadian could very easily use telekinesis to wipe them away.</p><p>\u201cGood luck to us,\u201d Dallas said, his voice punctuating the sudden silence. \u201cFinding the other men alive doesn\u2019t seem likely now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find them,\u201d I said, pretending I didn\u2019t have my own doubts.</p><p>He pushed out a breath and motioned to the corpse with a tilt of his chin. \u201cOne thing I can\u2019t figure out. Why only men with dark hair and eyes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure I knew the answer. \u201cOur killer is an Arcadian female who\u2019s only attracted to men who are the exact opposite in appearance to her kinsmen.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched. \u201cOccam\u2019s razor again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant deduction.\u201d Another blast of wind pushed around us, causing tendrils of hair to momentarily shield my vision. I hooked them behind my ear. \u201cI think she wanted Steele and the others as her kinky new sex toys, but couldn\u2019t obtain them through legal means.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, though. No woman is strong enough to force poison down a man this size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better than that,\u201d I said, patting the gun at my side, reminding him that I could force a steel pipe down his throat if I wanted. I knelt down and pulled at the bow tied to Steele\u2019s penis. \u201cLook at this. Is this something a man would do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dallas shook his head slowly. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Snow,\u201d one of the men called just then. I recognized Ghost\u2019s deep baritone; he was a man I enjoyed working with. He possessed a heart of honor and courage unlike anyone else I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered and released the ribbon. I shoved to my feet, searching the darkness for his rich, chocolate-colored skin. He stood several feet away, his grin a beacon in the night.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over here and do that to me? I\u2019ll enjoy it so much more than Steele there,\u201d he teased with a wink.</p><p>Of course, Ghost also possessed a warped sense of humor. \u201cThe last breathing man who let me near his goods dropped to the floor in a fetal ball and begged for his mommy.\u201d</p><p>He gave a good-humored chuckle. \u201cYou stay the hell away from my goods.\u201d With barely a breath he added, \u201cYou want us to erect the force field and protect him from the weather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d I wanted to view him exactly as he\u2019d been left for a little longer. I returned my attention to Dallas, who was scrubbing a hand over his jaw stubble. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer went through some pretty elaborate measures to pose the body,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intelligent thing to do is destroy all the evidence, leave nothing behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur girl\u2019s into showmanship, but more than that, she\u2019s into punishment. She took her time here, labored over every detail. See how the victim\u2019s body is perfectly aligned? See how the frost is perfectly sprinkled in his hair?\u201d</p> <p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he did something to really piss her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn me,\u201d Dallas said, \u201cbut I think you\u2019re onto something here. Punishment equals humiliation, and there\u2019s nothing more humiliating than going down in history as the man found in a dirty, diseased field with one hand tied to his dick.\u201d He snorted, his mouth quirking up at one corner. \u201cMaybe we should interview a couple of my former girlfriends. Sounds like something they might do.\u201d</p><p>Over the years, I\u2019d met many of Dallas\u2019s girlfriends. Some of them had needed icicles surgically removed from their veins\u2014a sentiment I\u2019d voiced aloud on more than one occasion. Not that he\u2019d ever appreciated the genius of my insight.</p><p>I shook my head and said, \u201cAll we\u2019re likely to get from your leftovers is frostbite, so we\u2019ll forgo the pleasure of interrogating them for now.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a teasing grin. \u201cOh, oh, Miss Snow. Is that jealousy in your tone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, with pleasure, Mia.\u201d</p> <p>He was kidding, I knew. Our relationship had never been sexual. And would never become sexual. Sex destroyed more male/female partnerships than death, and God knows it would completely negate my authority, something I would not allow.</p><p>I stared down at the body for a long while, a new crop of questions running through my mind. \u201cI want you and Jaxon to interview the victim\u2019s family in the morning,\u201d I said. Jaxon was another member of my unit. Whereas Dallas was all intimidation, Jaxon was a man who could ask the most private of questions and somehow convince interviewees they were happy to answer. \u201cI want to know every sexual secret Mr. Steele possessed, every woman he ever glanced at. I even want to know the brand of underwear he preferred.\u201d</p><p>Dallas\u2019s handsome face twisted in a wince, his full lips pursing in feigned pain. \u201cThat should be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d prefer, I\u2019ll assign you to PADD.\u201d Paper and Desk Duty.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, smiling like he was about to do me a huge favor, \u201cyou want me to talk to Steele\u2019s family in the morning, I\u2019ll talk to Steele\u2019s family.\u201d Before I could comment, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s next for tonight?\u201d</p><p>I cast another glance around the scene. It was about to start snowing again, the night suddenly thicker than before. \u201cBoys,\u201d I loudly called, \u201cgo ahead and erect the force field, then call homicide. They can finish searching the area. We\u2019ve found what we need.\u201d</p><p>To Dallas, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the car.\u201d I pivoted toward our unmarked black sedan. I only set my feet in select places, using the same path I\u2019d taken to get here. \u201cI want to search the database.\u201d</p><p>He fell into step behind me. When we reached our destination, I placed my index finger on the passenger ID scanner. After recognition the door popped open, and I slid inside. With a tug of my wrist, I slammed the door. Moments later, Dallas occupied the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cStart,\u201d he commanded, and the vehicle immediately roared to life. \u201cHeat. High.\u201d The heater kicked into action.</p><p>I glanced out the window and watched Ghost and the other men assume positions around the edges of the crime scene. Each man withdrew a small box, placed it at his feet, and pressed a button. Blue lights sparked from every box, and the air around them appeared to solidify, becoming liquid and spreading upward and out, until meeting and creating a protective dome.</p><p>\u201cWe need names,\u201d I said, turning to Dallas. \u201cSpecifics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can do.\u201d Features tightening with concentration, Dallas unfolded his computer console, located where steering wheels were once positioned. Within seconds, he was plugging away at the keyboard.</p><p>Pensive, I removed my gloves and massaged the back of my neck. \u201cPull up a list of every Arcadian hunted, questioned, or wanted for interrogation in the last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMales, too?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done.\u201d He punched a few more buttons, and twenty-six names popped onto the screen.</p><p>Ignoring the names, I scanned the crimes committed. Prostitution. Robbery. Vandalism. \u201cCross-reference this list with all Arcadians questioned for sex and human hate crimes. Delete those that have already been exterminated.\u201d</p><p>His fingers again flew over the keyboard. Mere seconds passed before the names dwindled to five. I nodded in satisfaction. Very few aliens linked to violent crimes ever lived long enough to gloat. Since alien supporters had yet to push through a law stating that other-worlders were entitled to a trial, hunters were often judge, jury, and executioner.</p><p>Instead of thanking us for keeping them safe, however, the supporters continued to fight us. Didn\u2019t they realize that if aliens weren\u2019t controlled, if their numbers weren\u2019t kept to a minimum, they could overrun us? That they might one day have the power to wipe us out completely? Didn\u2019t they realize that species with extraordinary powers like weather control, levitation, and the ability to absorb energy needed to know they would be punished if they harmed a human?</p><p>When the aliens first arrived more than seventy years ago, we would have destroyed them all if we could have. From all the reports I\u2019d read, panic had spread worldwide, and we immediately engaged them in war. Instead of causing them to flee, we came very close to destroying our own planet.</p><p>In desperation, our world leaders finally met with the commanders of each species, and it was agreed that the aliens could live here as long as they remained peaceful toward us. However, as with humans, there are those who are innately good and those who are innately evil. When several other-worlders placed humans on their dessert menu, both aliens and humans agreed something needed to be done. A.I.R. was quickly established, granting us free license to kill those who proved evil.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll question each one,\u201d I said, \u201csee what they know.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his gaze on the front windshield, Dallas adjusted the pyre-gun hooked to his shoulder holster. The lines around his mouth were taut. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he said, his voice just as taut, as if he were embarrassed by his words, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be much help to you on this case. I\u2019ve only hunted two Arcadians since joining A.I.R., and I had no luck either time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen consider tonight your lucky night. We\u2019ll split the unit into five groups of two, and each group will hunt one Arcadian.\u201d I shifted to my left, facing him more directly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be with me, and I\u201d\u2014I winked\u2014\u201calways get my alien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bit cocky, are we?\u201d His lips widened into a full-fledged grin, and he radioed the others and told them our plan. \u201cJaffe, Mandalay, you\u2019re searching for Cragin en Srr. Ghost, Kittie, you\u2019re searching for Lilla en Arr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, cutting off his words. The moment he\u2019d spoken Lilla\u2019s name, cold fingers of apprehension had crawled up my spine. \u201cI want the woman.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cThere are two females listed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this woman.\u201d My instincts rarely proved wrong.</p><p>His eyes gleamed with curiosity, but he nodded, corrected Ghost and Kittie\u2019s target, then continued his litany. When he finished, he returned the radio to its receiver and faced me. \u201cSo you think Lilla\u2019s our girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d I motioned to the computer with a tilt of my chin. \u201cPull up her voice frequency.\u201d When an alien was interrogated, no matter the crime, their voice was recorded and filed, and through voice recognition we were able to monitor their whereabouts for the rest of their stay on Earth. Alien voice was much like human fingerprints, and since high-frequency recorders decorated every street corner and were constantly monitored, we\u2019d have the information we wanted in seconds.</p><p>\u201cHer voice isn\u2019t listed,\u201d Dallas said, confused.</p><p>\u201cShe was questioned, so it has to be. Try again.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>No damn way. \u201cSee what else you can find on her. Every little detail.\u201d</p><p>He positioned his fingers onto the keyboard and jumped back into work. One prolonged heartbeat of time passed. Two. \u201cShit, take a look at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I straightened in my seat and eyed the screen.</p><p>\u201cFirewall. All records for Lilla en Arr are deemed confidential, and no one, and I do mean no one, is allowed entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrests and interrogations aren\u2019t confidential.\u201d The words rushed from me, ripe with displeasure and confusion.</p><p>He shot me a narrowed glance. What little I saw of his eyes blazed with irritation. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, access is denied. This is one hell of a block.\u201d</p><p>Dark curiosity pounded through me because there was only one logical explanation. Someone on the inside didn\u2019t want authorities poking into Lilla\u2019s life. \u201cGet into that file,\u201d I commanded.</p><p>\u201cWant me to pull a rabbit out of my ass, too?\u201d he muttered, his tone heavy with sarcasm. But he turned back to the screen, his fingers working furiously.</p><p>\u201cIf you can show me that rabbit at the same time you get into that file, I might think you\u2019ve got talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Mia.\u201d</p><p>Minute after minute dragged by, the click of the keys the only sound. I was not known for my patience, and tapped my foot against the floorboard.</p><p>Finally Dallas laughed, threw his hands in the air, and shouted, \u201cCouldn\u2019t block that, could you, you bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find?\u201d Excitement blended with my impatience, each emotion feeding off the other.</p><p>\u201cStill no voice recording, but she\u2019s been questioned twice. Once for soliciting sex from a human, and once for beating the shit out of a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho arrested her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor solicitation\u2014George Hudson.\u201d</p><p>I filed that information away. I didn\u2019t know the agent personally, but I would. \u201cWhat about the assault charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. The arresting officer was\u2014\u201d He scrolled down the screen, then whistled between his teeth. \u201cThe name\u2019s been erased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense. Alien assault is punishable by death, and only death, yet Lilla was released and her record buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bury it?\u201d Thoughtful, Dallas worried a hand over his shadow beard. \u201cI mean, someone obviously wants her information to remain hidden, so why not destroy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail, maybe?\u201d I turned my head and glanced outside. Several agents were packing their gear and loading their vehicles. Pieces of this puzzle just didn\u2019t fit, and I pinched the bridge of my nose, trying to make sense of what I was learning. I returned my attention to Dallas. \u201cDoes the database list who Lilla solicited and who she trashed?\u201d</p><p>Another pause, then, \u201cShit, Mia. You\u2019re not going to believe this. The man Lilla beat within an inch of his life was William Steele. And the man she propositioned was none other than\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shot me a glance, and we said in unison, \u201cWilliam Steele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a connection,\u201d I breathed, brushing a hand down my face.</p><p>Slowly, he nodded. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve got our killer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, it looks that way, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Yet suddenly something didn\u2019t feel right, and my mind whirled with probabilities. Here was an Arcadian female who\u2019d desired Steele enough to try and seduce him. When that failed, she beat him. This was a female perfectly capable of murder, and the simplest answer to our investigation.</p><p>Occam\u2019s razor.</p><p>Except...everything inside me was screaming Too easy!</p> <p>Oh, I was willing to bet my savings account she was involved. Had to be. But...</p><p>\u201cGot anything else on her?\u201d I asked, hoping to assuage my concerns. \u201cIs her name linked with any of the other missing men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I can see. The only other bit of info here is the fact that she works at Ecstasy, and is dating the owner.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips and flipped through my mental files. \u201cThat name sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out more, woman. Ecstasy is the most exclusive nightclub in New Chicago, and host to a slew of alien sympathizers. Mark St. John, the owner, is a hard-ass bastard with more money than God.\u201d</p> <p>So the boyfriend had money and power, probably kept a few officials in his pocket. That explained Lilla\u2019s confidential file and the fact that she was still alive. \u201cLet\u2019s go after Lilla first,\u201d I said, \u201cand then Hudson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty before brawn, eh?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThink she\u2019s working tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to this, she works every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTending bar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damn good thing I wore my dancing shoes, then,\u201d I said, leaning back in the seat, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to crash the party. And don\u2019t kill her, Dallas,\u201d I added quickly. \u201cI want her alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you have to worry about me. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s trigger-happy.\u201d Grinning languidly, he programmed the club\u2019s address into the console. \u201cI do believe this night is about to get interesting.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Ecstasy perched atop a perfectly manicured hill in the upper East District. Moonlight cast an unholy frame around the three-story building, illuminating the deceptively virginal white walls, stained glass windows, and hanging pottery filled with bright green faux foliage. A cross rose from the roof like a direct antenna to God.</p><p>A fucking chapel, I thought. A nightclub infamous for illegal drugs and made-to-order sex was housed in a fucking chapel. I shook my head, marveling at the defiance such an act required. It was like saying, \u201cScrew you, God.\u201d</p><p>Something about the place prodded at the corners of my memory. I stared at the silk flowers twined around the tall alabaster columns, searching my mind for...what? What was I forgetting?</p><p>It hit me in the next instant, and I almost groaned. I\u2019d forgotten my brother\u2019s memorial was tonight.</p><p>My parents had me in their late thirties. My mother ran off not long after, but my dad stuck around. For many years, he\u2019d been a wonderful father. Loving, supportive. It was only after my oldest brother\u2019s death that he became an indifferent, sometimes cruel bastard.</p> <p>The only thing that seemed to give him joy was this annual midnight vigil on the eve of Kane\u2019s death. So what that my brother had died twenty-three years ago. So what that Kane had been seventeen, and I\u2019d been five and therefore didn\u2019t remember him. My dad expected me to be there.</p><p>Anger spun a treacherous web inside me as I considered the situation. I was still alive, but my dad basically treated me as if I was dead; Kane was dead, but he still lived and breathed in my dad\u2019s heart. Maybe that was because Kane\u2019s body had never been found. I didn\u2019t know and tried not to care. I was going to take a lot of shit for missing.</p><p>Had the service been for my other brother, Dare, I would have obliterated any obstacle to be there. Dare had been my hero, my lifeline. Whenever Dad punished me, it was Dare who comforted me. Dare who made sure I had enough food and blankets.</p><p>And he\u2019d been tortured and killed by a group of aliens on his eighteenth birthday. The date of his death was stamped in my mind like a physical brand.</p><p>Had my dad ever once held a memorial for him? Hell, no.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re gonna have ourselves some trouble,\u201d Dallas said, capturing my attention.</p><p>I realized my hands were clenched, almost snapping the bones. Thinking of Dare\u2019s death always had that effect on me. \u201cNothing we can\u2019t handle,\u201d I said absently. My dad hadn\u2019t called yet, but it was just a matter of time before he did. This was the only night of the year he acknowledged me.</p><p>While I usually (secretly) looked forward to his call, I didn\u2019t need the distraction right now. I slipped out my cell unit and switched the tone to silent. I forced my body to relax and my mind to clear. No thoughts of my dad tonight, and certainly no thoughts of my brothers, either. I had to focus on here and now. Human lives depended on me.</p><p>At the gated entrance, Dallas eased his sedan toward the security booth. Before the wheels came to a complete stop, a uniformed guard appeared at the driver\u2019s-side window. The guard had dry, yellow skin, almost reptilian. He had no nose, and his cheekbones were so sharp they could have cut glass. Ugly as putrid water, with a smell to match, he peered into the car with wide golden eyes.</p><p>An Ell-Rollis. He was definitely an Ell-Rollis. Their race wasn\u2019t known for creativity; they rarely possessed an original thought, so they relied on the exact directives of others. And those directives were usually nefarious. Except for their physical strength, they didn\u2019t have any special powers. That I knew of. Perhaps one day there would be a manual outlining every alien species and their abilities, but until then, we operated on what little knowledge we possessed.</p><p>Dallas lowered his window, and suddenly all that shielded him from the alien was air. And that wasn\u2019t a good thing, since the alien was built like two WWE wrestlers fused together, muscle stacked upon muscle. He\u2019d probably been ordered to kill whoever defied him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have invitation?\u201d the guard asked, his voice low, gravelly, and heavily accented.</p><p>Before Dallas could utter a single word, I leaned across the seat and flashed my badge. \u201cOpen the gate.\u201d</p><p>The Ell-Rollis kept his gaze locked on my partner, assuming he was the bigger threat. Unimpressed, the alien crossed his arms over his chest. His expression darkened with disdain. \u201cNo invitation. No enter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I replied pleasantly. Deceptively. And I did understand. He saw a badge and automatically assumed I was an average cop with no alien jurisdiction. \u201cMaybe this will help.\u201d With a fluid, lightning-fast motion of my wrist, I unsheathed my pyre-gun and leveled it at his face. \u201cOpen the gate, or taste fire.\u201d</p><p>Pyre-guns caused maximum pain with lethal results, and that was something even a Ell-Rollis could understand, the dumb bastard. These guns were standard issue; they emitted thin talons of fire that exploded upon impact. The wielder controlled just how much fire\u2014just how much pain. Certain alien breeds were impervious to bullets, but I had yet to meet a breed resistant to fire.</p><p>Dallas flipped on the cab light, and two glowing circles flooded the front seats, chasing away the darkness. The Ell-Rollis tugged his gaze from Dallas to my gun. He flicked my face a nervous glance. When he saw me, his eyes widened, and his mouth formed a small O. He recoiled three steps back.</p><p>\u201cMia Snow,\u201d he breathed on a horrified gasp.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d My gaze remained as steady as my gun.</p><p>\u201cI let you inside, yes?\u201d He tried for an easy, I-only-want-to-please-you chuckle that sounded more like a misfiring pyre-gun. His limbs trembled, and he edged his way toward the guardhouse.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are,\u201d I said, keeping my tone casual. He froze so quickly, I almost laughed. Almost. \u201cI want my friend to open the gate. You blew your chance.\u201d No telling how many alarms the bastard would kick if I allowed him inside his booth.</p><p>He swallowed, the action followed by a jerky nod. \u201cWhatever say you.\u201d</p><p>Dallas emerged from the sedan, always careful to stay out of my line of fire. He stepped inside the guardhouse, and moments later the thick metal bars blocking our entrance were groaning in protest as they split.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked the Ell-Rollis.</p><p>\u201cI called Bob,\u201d he offered hesitantly.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Why couldn\u2019t he have picked a human name that fit his appearance? Biff? Or Hulk? \u201cWell, Bobby,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling generous tonight.\u201d I holstered my gun, but his expression remained tight with fear. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you live, and in exchange, you\u2019re going to escort me to Lilla en Arr. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. I understand.\u201d The lines of tension finally eased around his mouth. \u201cMia Snow always keep her word, just as Bob do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your sake, I hope so.\u201d My gaze remained on Bob, but I spoke my next words to Dallas. \u201cFollow in the car and meet me inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he replied with an easy smile. He always enjoyed watching me, the dainty little flower, intimidate such enormous creatures. Warped humor, if you asked me, but then we all had our quirks.</p><p>\u201cYou try anything, Bobby,\u201d I said, exiting the sedan, \u201cand I swear to God I\u2019ll use you for target practice.\u201d The predicted snow chose that moment to pour from the sky. In seconds. Thick white flakes fell and swirled around us, descending like glitter inside a water globe.</p><p>\u201cI no try nothing.\u201d He shook his head violently, causing his dark brown braids to swing around his temples. \u201cNo, no. No try. I your friend.\u201d</p><p>Friend, my ass. He\u2019d kill me if I gave him the opportunity. With a tilt of my chin, I motioned him inside the gate. I kept him three strides in front of me. I didn\u2019t trust him at my back, and I didn\u2019t want him at my side.</p><p>Cars littered the grounds, all strategically placed for easy departure. One by one, we maneuvered around them, each step taking us closer to Ecstasy. Finally, we stood at the large, intricately carved double doors. Thunderous rock music boomed so loudly, the walls and floor vibrated.</p><p>I wiped the snow from my face and wondered at the lack of entrance security. Yes, they had Bob posted at the front gate, but as I\u2019d just proved, he wasn\u2019t insurmountable. I doubted they relied on cameras. Unlicensed surveillance had been restricted years ago because even the average citizen knew how to splice \u201ctamper-resistant\u201d film, and after numerous false claims, the courts had decided to restrict all video usage. This nightclub had never been issued a license. Sure, they could have hidden cameras, but why gamble on the loss of a business over something so trivial?</p><p>I wondered again at the reason for only posting one guard. Stupidity on the owner\u2019s part? Or simple cockiness? Or maybe he was just too cheap to spring for more. I voted for all three.</p><p>Just get this over with, Mia. I silently palmed my gun and adjusted the control to stun. I\u2019d said I wouldn\u2019t kill him, and I wouldn\u2019t. But I never promised not to immobilize him for a few hours. Hand steady, I aimed at Bob\u2019s back.</p><p>As if sensing my intent, he turned and cast me a glance over his shoulder. His expression was comical, really, since he had no nose. His sharp, yellowed teeth were chewing on his bottom lip. I stupidly paused for a second too long, allowing his expression to distract me.</p><p>Panicked, he slapped my arm. The gun went flying and skidded across the porch. He dove for it, but only managed to push it farther away. Cursing myself, I jumped onto his back and pressed my fingers against his temples, preventing his fishlike gills from raising and lowering. The action cut off his air supply. He soon forgot all about my gun as oxygen was denied him. He fought me, legs flailing, hands tearing at my fingers. When that didn\u2019t work, he jabbed his elbow into my stomach, and though breath exploded from my lungs and pain rocked me, I held tight.</p><p>Finally he went still. His body collapsed, and he thumped to the ground. I jumped to my feet, but remained doubled over as I sucked in a deep, much needed breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me later, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>Dallas barreled up the stairs, his gun cocked and aimed at Bob as I picked up my own gun and fired a round of stun lasers at the sleeping giant. My hand fell to my side, and I sucked in another round of air.</p><p>Dallas pinned me with a concerned gaze. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, but damn it, my stomach felt like an overused punching bag at boxing practice.</p><p>\u201cWant me to kill him? He assaulted an officer, after all.\u201d</p><p>I thought it over, then shook my head. \u201cNah. Too much paperwork. He\u2019s not who we came for, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Dallas\u2019s lips twitched at the corners. \u201cYou going soft on me? First you allow a Ell-Rollis to disarm you, and then you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he slipped his gun back into place. With his hands free, he locked his arms under Bob\u2019s armpits and began tugging the giant out of the way. \u201cI\u2019ll hide him beyond the edge. No need to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a frown. That frown quickly changed to a grimace as he strained under Bob\u2019s weight. \u201cDid I tell you I\u2019ve got a date tomorrow?\u201d he asked conversationally, changing the subject just to annoy me.</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane Marlow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. The porn star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe prefers the term professional sex advocate,\u201d he replied, huffing from exertion.</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cAt least with this one you\u2019ll know there\u2019s more than ice in her panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent that. Especially from you, a woman who hasn\u2019t gone on a date since the Great Heat Wave.\u201d</p><p>My back straightened, and my shoulders squared. \u201cI had dinner with Kedric Coners last week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t count. His legs are so skinny, I could use them as chopsticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that skinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny he\u2019s got no heart, though. Hell, I bet he tosses widows and children out of that fancy apartment building he owns and into the cold, wet streets.\u201d</p> <p>Dallas rounded the corner, out of sight, and I heard a thud as he dropped Bob to the ground. Within seconds, my partner was striding toward me. When he reached me, he leaned down until our noses were only inches apart.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you only date men like that? Men you can walk all over? There\u2019s no way in hell you can respect someone like that.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. Anger rushed through me, growing hotter and hotter, darker and darker. I liked being in control. So what? I liked things done my way, when I wanted, where I wanted. I rarely dated, but when I did, I picked men who took what I gave them and didn\u2019t ask for more. If I were a man, Dallas would be slapping me on the back and offering me a beer instead of chastising me. \u201cWhat I like is solving a case,\u201d I said with false calm. \u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted enough time outside, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw, but he held up his hands and shrugged. \u201cWhatever you say. You\u2019re the boss, right?\u201d</p><p>The entry doors swung open.</p> <p>In unison, Dallas and I spun, weapons drawn. From the open doorway, smoke billowed like a thick morning fog. Amid the haze, two Delensean females emerged. Both appeared to be in their mid-twenties, with flowing azure hair, azure skin, and four handless arms. Both wore only drunken smiles and wraparound chains. The thin silver links wound around their curves, hiding mere inches of skin.</p><p>The women giggled when they saw us, not the least concerned by our presence. We allowed them to pass without a word, then each turned and fired, stunning them. They froze in place.</p><p>All Delenseans acted like rebellious teenagers, anyway. Throw drugs into the mix, and no telling what kind of havoc they would create.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna help me this time?\u201d Dallas asked me.</p><p>We each dragged one around the corner and dropped her beside Bob. If we didn\u2019t get inside soon, no telling how big the pile would become.</p><p>I strode to the front door and pushed inside, Dallas right beside me. Music blasted my ears, a fast rhythm that lured in the unwary. The mingled scent of sweat, sex, and alcohol filled my nostrils, almost obscene in its headiness. Illegal cigarette smoke, too. Shadows and light constantly battled for control, blending together at times, illuminating, then hiding each other, but all the while creating a dreamlike atmosphere.</p> <p>The foyer possessed no furnishings, yet still overflowed with half-dressed, undulating bodies, both human and alien. One man was bound to the wall by thick ropes, and he moaned in rapture as the woman standing behind him spanked him with a spiked, wooden paddle.</p><p>Another group was in the middle of a dog-and-pony show. Three naked human women were on all fours, a spiked collar wrapped around each of their necks. A glowing male Mec paced them up and down the walkway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little overdressed,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen so many people getting off in so many different ways. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s find Lilla before we lose our concentration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for me, but go ahead and lead the way.\u201d</p><p>As I strode in front of Dallas, a man latched his fingers around my wrist, trying to draw me into his waiting embrace. I attempted to jerk myself free, but found my efforts were paltry compared to his determination.</p><p>I was just about to introduce the man\u2019s groin to my knee when Dallas slammed his fist into the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>I was suddenly freed. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said with a half grin.</p> <p>\u201cNo prob.\u201d</p><p>We continued toward the main room. My boots stuck to the floor in several places, and I shuddered at the thought of just what was making them stick.</p><p>Once in the center of the action, I cataloged the entire scene. Crosses decorated the walls, and moonlight dappled through red velvet curtains. Pillowed chaises in brilliant golds and purples snaked around the far corners. Sashaying in every direction were waitresses dressed as slutty nuns, each holding a tray piled high with drugs, alcohol, and sex toys. Amid the moans of titillation that rivaled the music\u2019s volume, bodies bumped and writhed.</p><p>\u201cThink I can get a membership?\u201d Dallas asked, the warmth of his breath fanning my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perverted enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he answered proudly.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cDo you see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d He slowly smiled. \u201cI haven\u2019t been looking. There are too many other, more interesting sights.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t chastise him, since I\u2019d been distracted as well. I slid my gaze to the bar. Lilla\u2019s file claimed she was a bartender, but I didn\u2019t see her peddling drinks. Determined to find her, I studied every individual, every corner, every hollow. I counted two Arcadians, both female, neither Lilla.</p><p>Then suddenly...joltingly...</p><p>My gaze connected with the seductively uptilted violet eyes of an Arcadian male. Breath froze in my lungs, and everything around me receded. Time slowed. The music faded from my ears. My vision tunneled to this one man as a foreign energy sizzled under my skin. I rubbed at my arms, trying to rid myself of the odd sensation.</p><p>The Arcadian was taller than anyone else in the room, his shoulders broad and muscled like a savage Pict warrior from long ago. His cheekbones were high, his nose straight, his lips full, lush, and sensual. He wore danger like a cloak, erotic danger, lethal danger, and there was a hard, granite edge to his expression. It was the same expression cops and hunters wore, one that proclaimed he\u2019d seen the darkest life had to offer and had survived. I couldn\u2019t see his clothing, couldn\u2019t tell if he wore traditional earth clothing or something more daring. I only knew he looked like living power.</p><p>At last you arrive whispered so clearly across my mind, I almost turned to see who had spoken. I watched a knowing\u2014and perhaps a little mocking\u2014smile half-curl the corners of his lips, and then he was gone, his warrior body somehow hidden in the crowd. I searched, but couldn\u2019t find him. Besides the energy flowing through me, there wasn\u2019t a single indication of his presence.</p><p>Where was he? Who was he? And how the hell had he disappeared so quickly?</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mia,\u201d Dallas said, slicing into my preoccupation. \u201cYou okay? You were in a trance or something. I had to call your name several times to get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I offered weakly. Disgusted with myself, I scanned the masses again. Lilla. I\u2019m looking for Lilla. The man didn\u2019t mater.</p><p>I resumed my search and was quickly rewarded. There, at the back altar, was a black overstuffed lounge that curled at the end like a lover\u2019s palm. Atop the cushions, I saw a cascade of white hair and a perfectly sloped back. Anticipation zinged across my nerve endings. Sometimes I just knew, knew things without any explanation why, and I knew this was Lilla, though I couldn\u2019t see her face.</p><p>She was poised above a human male. His legs were bent and spread to offer her a libidinous cradle. I couldn\u2019t make out his features. On Lilla\u2019s left and right sides were two catlike Taren females; both wore flimsy white robes and were licking and kissing Lilla\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>As if she sensed my gaze, Lilla tossed her hair over one shoulder, turned, and met my stare. I felt a slight hum of energy whiz through me, the same type of odd hum I\u2019d felt with the Arcadian warrior. It was...bizarre, something I\u2019d never encountered before today. I had no idea what it meant, and I didn\u2019t have time to analyze. Lilla gave me a slow smile before returning her attention to her lovers.</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cThis way,\u201d I said to Dallas, giving his shirtsleeve a tug. Side by side we strode across the dance floor, ignoring wandering hands and gyrating bodies.</p><p>When we reached our destination, I received my first full look at the man beneath Lilla. He had thick red hair and freckled skin, big ears that probably flapped in the wind. His eyes were spaced too far apart, but the color was nice, a mixture of green and brown.</p><p>\u201cMark St. John,\u201d Dallas supplied. \u201cEcstasy\u2019s owner.\u201d</p><p>I had a few questions for Lover Boy, but knew those would have to wait. A man with a hard-on had trouble concentrating on facts. Besides, interrogations worked best with one suspect at a time.</p><p>I shifted my gaze to Lilla. She wore a flesh-colored halter top and skirt that almost made her appear naked. I reached out and tapped her on the shoulder. \u201cLilla en Arr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, not sparing me a glance.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Languidly, deliberately, she turned to face me, and our gazes collided again. As if on cue, the music tapered to silence.</p><p>\u201cMia Snow,\u201d she said, her tone as soft as a caress, each syllable well modulated and punctuated precisely with an almost hypnotic rhythm. \u201cI am so glad you have, at last, joined us. We have been expecting you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>We have been expecting you.</p><p>The words reverberated in my mind amid the unexpected silence.</p><p>We.NotI. Kind of like the words that had whispered through my mind only minutes before. At last you arrive.</p><p>I stared down at Lilla. Her features were as delicate as butterfly wings, incandescent and angelic. Pale. Wholly innocent. And somehow the absolute essence of sexuality. On the surface, she was beauty personified. Yet there was an underlying hardness to her gaze, a tightness to her lips that gave her an emotionally untouchable veneer.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to glance at Dallas to know he was foaming at the mouth for a taste of this woman. He was a sucker for ice queens.</p><p>I fought the urge to grab her by the shoulders, slap a pair of laserbands on her wrists, and haul her ass down to A.I.R. headquarters. I had questions, and most likely, she had the answers. However, taking her to the station might have the same results as her former arrests\u2014swept under a nice, tidy little rug\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t risk that. I didn\u2019t want Lilla released, her file once again buried. Maybe even destroyed this time.</p><p>I\u2019d interrogate her here, in front of God and every pervert present if needed.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak with you, Lilla,\u201d I said, my tone as hard as her expression.</p><p>\u201cThen speak,\u201d she replied. Still watching me, she traced a fingertip down the center of her flesh-colored top. She was the very picture of carnal seduction, and I was amazed by just how human she appeared. \u201cI have nothing to hide. No secrets lurking about, waiting to nibble on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish to discuss, we will discuss here, with my friends. Or...\u201d Her gaze swept over me. \u201cPerhaps you would like to join us first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in dying like William Steele,\u201d I said.</p><p>Lilla\u2019s smile lost some of its arrogance, and something dark flickered in the depths of her eyes, turning the violet to deep purple. I almost regretted that I\u2019d punctured some of her casual disregard. After all, I admired strength in a woman. I admired the courage it took to look a hunter in the eyes and casually dismiss him. Or her. Still, I found it interesting that she\u2019d betrayed such a reaction to my words. There were definite emotions here.</p><p>Uncaring of the happenings around him, St. John snaked his arms around Lilla and caressed her bare stomach. Lilla regained her easygoing facade.</p><p>With one wave of her hand, she dismissed the two Taren women. Or cats. Or whatever they were. They hopped down on all fours without protest and slinked to the bar. Lilla whispered something in St. John\u2019s ear. He shook his head, intent on getting his piece of ass. She whispered something else. I couldn\u2019t make out the words, only the fierceness of her tone. This time, he gave an abrupt nod. His expression dark, he pushed to his feet, the action causing Lilla to bounce on the couch. St. John stalked away.</p><p>\u201cSmart move,\u201d I said, the mechanics of their relationship suddenly clear. Lilla was the puppet master, and little Markie was her puppet. Whether she controlled him through simple feminine wiles or Arcadian mind control, I didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want St. John to hear about your dealings with another man, would we?\u201d</p><p>Keeping her gaze locked on mine, Lilla rose, her movements slow and elaborate, somehow making the simple act of rising a seductive dance. Her eyelids lowered in an enticing, come-hither blink. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said on a breathy murmur. \u201cFollow me. We will chat somewhere private, just as you wished.\u201d</p><p>The music kicked up, filling the club with a syncopated beat and claiming the attention of the patrons. Lilla turned, flicking her luxuriant white hair over one shoulder, and strolled toward guarded double doors. Dallas followed right behind her, as if it were perfectly natural to follow a murder suspect wherever she might lead.</p><p>Were they pumping drugs through the ventilation system? I thought sarcastically. Dallas wasn\u2019t usually this foolish. Lilla was beautiful, yes, but the only thing worthy of such blind adoration was a giant vat of fresh, steaming synthetic coffee.</p><p>Ever watchful and guarded, I remained five steps behind. When I found myself searching for the Arcadian male who\u2019d caught my eye earlier\u2014for reasons that had nothing to do with safety\u2014my lips curled back involuntarily in a scowl. I was as bad as Dallas. I forced my gaze to focus straight ahead.</p><p>We were led into an empty hallway and up a flight of creaking stairs. The long, narrow corridor we entered next had dancing nymphs painted on the walls and soft, wine-colored carpet. Finally, we entered a small office. There were no windows adorning the plain white walls. A desk crowned the center, and four chairs formed a half-moon at the front. The air was clean, devoid of smoke. In fact, the air smelled faintly of dried rose petals and lavender sachet, a scent any grandmother would have applauded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lilla settled on the edge of the honey oak desk. No papers were on top, I noticed.</p><p>\u201cWould you like the door open or closed?\u201d she asked. The seductress was gone, and in her place was a polite but formal hostess.</p><p>\u201cClosed,\u201d I answered.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent choice.\u201d She pushed a small button on a remote control, and the door snapped shut, cutting off all traces of music. \u201cWe are more intimate this way.\u201d</p><p>I refused to have my back to the door, so I claimed the high-backed swivel chair behind the desk. Dallas stayed beside the entrance, just in case someone tried to enter\u2014or Lilla tried to leave.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lilla said with a little laugh. She hopped off the desk and eased into one of the seats facing me. She folded one leg over the other, the action slow and sensual. \u201cYou certainly have my full attention now.\u201d</p><p>I placed a voice recorder on the desk\u2019s surface and pushed record. Then I waited, allowing silence to stretch around us like long fingers of ice. I wanted Lilla to wonder, even stress, about what I had to say. An old trick I\u2019d learned my first year of duty.</p><p>\u201cI am patient,\u201d she said with a knowing smile. \u201cI can wait as long as you can.\u201d</p> <p>Fine. \u201cDid you murder William Steele?\u201d I asked, my voice steady and clear.</p><p>Her eyes widened, and I knew she hadn\u2019t expected me to be so direct. \u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam Steele was found in an abandoned field, stripped and dead. We\u2019re here to give you a chance to clear your name,\u201d I lied. I truly doubted she could clear her name; she was involved somehow, some way, I just didn\u2019t know the specifics. But I would. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to ask one more time. Did you murder William Steele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, no,\u201d she said with a shake of her head. \u201cI did not kill William.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to prove that by giving me a detailed list of your whereabouts today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt him,\u201d she continued as if I hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cEver.\u201d</p> <p>I arched a brow. \u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is right.\u201d</p><p>I glanced to Dallas. \u201cNow correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but wasn\u2019t it Lilla en Arr who beat the shit out of William Steele six weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be correct,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Lilla\u2019s already pale skin grew more pallid. \u201cI do not have to respond to that. Nor do I have to answer any more of your questions.\u201d She held out the remote, intending to open the door. I grabbed it and slammed it onto the desk.</p><p>\u201cLet me break it down for you,\u201d I said. \u201cOther-worlders are allowed to live and work among humans as long as all of our laws are obeyed. The moment a law is broken, aliens lose all rights. My job is to enforce and punish. The fact that I even suspect your involvement in a human murder grants me the authority to kill you. You\u2019re alive now only because I allow you to live.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Silence so thick it cast an oppressive fog throughout the room.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt him,\u201d Lilla finally whispered, each syllable ragged and broken, giving her tone an underlying pain, a deep hurt that was totally at odds with everything I\u2019d concluded about her. She gazed down at her hands, and locks of white hair fell forward, shielding her face. \u201cI loved him.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d loved him so much she hadn\u2019t looked for him or helped the police find him before he died. But I had to give two thumbs up for her performance. She deserved an Academy Award for best actress during a hunter interrogation.</p><p>\u201cI still need that list,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI did not murder him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you this afternoon?\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cAt the club.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI was here at the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were here all evening? You never left? Always had someone around you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need names of the people you were with and the times that you were with them. And Lilla?\u201d I added, blinking over at her. \u201cI will verify this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will find I have spoken the truth.\u201d Without glancing my way, she clicked off the names and times I wanted.</p><p>\u201cI did love him,\u201d she said, almost absently. \u201cHe simply would not listen to my warnings. I tried to force him to my will that night, but he refused to heed me. I used physical force, yes, but I did not mean to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you trying to force him to do?\u201d Give people enough rope and they\u2019ll hang themselves.</p><p>She eased up, her hands wringing together. \u201cI tried to make him leave. He thought he could handle them. He thought, as all humans do,\u201d she added bitterly, \u201cthat nothing bad could happen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWho is them?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, as if she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d given so much away. She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWho is them?\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your concern.\u201d She arched her brows. \u201cAnd you, I think, will not ask me such a question again. I won\u2019t hurt you; that would anger my brother. But there are other things I can do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother? Why would he care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more questions.\u201d</p><p>Phantom hands shoved their way into my mind, grasping, reaching. I went on instant alert, using all of my strength to erect a mental block. \u201cMind control is a crime,\u201d I ground out. A sharp ache pounded in my temples, growing deeper and more intense with every second that passed, and I wasn\u2019t sure if the pain stemmed from her attempt at mind control or my attempt to block her powers.</p><p>When I thought I might cry out from the strain, she whipped around, and the dynamism of her gaze was broken. All of a sudden my pain ceased, and dizziness overtook me. Unable to focus, I dropped my head into my waiting hands.</p><p>The air began to spark with electricity, and the intensity only increased.</p><p>\u201cDallas,\u201d I said, forcing myself to glance at him.</p><p>He ignored me. He was focused completely on Lilla...and he was opening the goddamn door for her.</p><p>\u201cDallas!\u201d</p><p>Still no response.</p><p>I had the sense of mind to grab my voice recorder before lunging to my feet. My knees buckled. By the time I regained my balance, Lilla was gone. I raced around the desk, saw that Dallas was slumped against the wall, eyes closed. I flew into the hallway, but only emptiness greeted me. Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>I stomped my foot, and the weight of my boot caused a heavy thud. Inside the office, I slapped Dallas across the face, hard, putting all my strength behind the blow. \u201cDamn it, why did you let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d His expression bemused, he shook his head, blinked his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cI felt like I had to open the door for her, or I\u2019d die.\u201d A moment later, his eyes darkened with anger. He rubbed three fingers over his reddened cheek. \u201cWhy the hell did you hit me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the better question is, why didn\u2019t I slap you twice?\u201d</p><p>He left that alone, because he knew I was angry enough to follow through. \u201cDo you know where she went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smart, and she knows we\u2019ll find her here. My guess is she\u2019s run to another location\u2014or to someone,\u201d I added as an afterthought. Then I swore under my breath. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we let her get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he offered. \u201cNow the true fun begins. We\u2019re going hunting.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Side by side, Dallas and I pounded down the steps, taking them three at a time. Still dizzy from Lilla\u2019s mind control, Dallas wasn\u2019t as agile as he normally was. He stumbled once and had to grip the banister to keep from tumbling face first.</p><p>A group of men, obviously hired muscle, waited for us at the bottom. They were human, which meant we couldn\u2019t kill them without a shitload of consequences. Too bad, too. A little killing might have worked off some of my tension.</p><p>We ground to a halt in the middle of the staircase. We either had to arrest them or fight them, and I didn\u2019t have time to take them to A.I.R. headquarters. What\u2019s more, anyone who attempted to hinder an alien investigation deserved an ass kicking.</p><p>I counted five idiots, all grinning because I probably looked like I\u2019d never been dirty, never perspired, and never said a naughty word in my life, and Dallas was only one man. What harm could these two do? they were thinking.</p><p>A slow grin played at my lips. I\u2019d spent my childhood in one fight or another, trying to prove to my dad that I was strong, capable, and fearless, just like my brothers had been. Living in the Southern District, the poor side of town, I hadn\u2019t been able to fight like a cop or a sweet little lady. No, I\u2019d learned to fight dirty. And mean.</p><p>Maybe if my mom hadn\u2019t run off when I was a kid, she could have instilled some feminine qualities in me. But she had, and I wasn\u2019t a \u201clady.\u201d A tide of anticipation was already rushing through me at the thought of putting these men in their places\u2014at my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d I asked Dallas. I knew how to inflict damage, yes, but I couldn\u2019t do this alone.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He sounded completely sure of his ability.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be fun,\u201d one of the idiots said.</p><p>The speaker was a handsome man, probably only twenty years old, and he had a hard-on the size of a police baton. Impressive, but it wasn\u2019t going to save him from a beating. He wore a come-and-lick-me smile, and I noticed he had a mouth of straight white teeth. Too bad he was about to lose some of them.</p><p>To the beat of the music rocking in the next room, Dallas and I darted into action. The moment I neared them, I kicked out one leg and struck one of the men in the balls with the heel of my foot, all without missing a step. He screamed in pain. The starting bell, you could say, because the fight had just begun.</p><p>Another man came at me, and I let my fist fly forward. Bone crunched against cartilage. Blood squirted from his nose. Never pausing for breath, I elbowed two throats, broke one man\u2019s kneecap, kneed a couple groins, and jabbed a pair of eyes before slamming a guy\u2019s head into the wall. One of the men recovered sufficiently to grab me by my jacket lapels. I brought my arms up hard and fast inside his grip and quickly ground my palm into his trachea. Eyes wide with horror, he struggled to scream, the sound broken. He released me as if I were radioactive waste and clutched at his throat, unable to breathe.</p><p>He\u2019d probably die, and I\u2019d be written up. Oh, well. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back for seconds, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Beside me, Dallas fought like a champion boxer. He punched, ducked, then punched again, intermittently landing solid blows. Finally all five men lay unconscious at our feet. Blood pooled from some of the bodies, a crimson river of pain. A tooth lay next to the far wall\u2014it probably belonged to the guy who\u2019d thought this would be fun. Ha!</p><p>I had endured several fists to my stomach and now had a cut lip, and a bruised thigh. One of the men had actually pulled my hair and scratched my cheek, like a sissy girl who hadn\u2019t gotten her way. What a pussy.</p><p>I ignored the fact that I was doubled over and panting like a sissy myself. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked Dallas.</p><p>\u201cMy side and face hurt like hell, but other than that, I\u2019m fine.\u201d He gently fingered his swollen, blackening eye. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same.\u201d I took a moment to catch my breath, dragging each intake into my lungs as if I was on life support. Smoke had seeped inside this little alcove, so the air wasn\u2019t fresh and left an ashy taste in my throat.</p><p>\u201cIf we go through there,\u201d Dallas said, pointing to the double doors that led into the club, \u201canother fight will break out, and I\u2019m not sure my body can go another round right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig baby,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t going to admit that I felt the same way. My bones throbbed, and my muscles burned. \u201cThere\u2019s a window on the north wall. If it opens, we might be able to get outside without drawing any attention to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s worth a try,\u201d he said.</p><p>We limped to the window in question and paused. Our curses mingled together in a long, heated sputter as we surveyed the potential exit. The thick stained glass was welded to a copper frame, which was welded to the wall. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if the wall was welded to a steel support beam.</p><p>Dallas shifted his attention left, then right. Not a single piece of furniture, not a single decoration, occupied the hallway. Muttering more curses under his breath, he removed his left shoe. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe have to go through the club. Start praying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave up prayer a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it anyway.\u201d He placed the boot over his fist and hit the glass, dead center, using all his strength. Nothing. He punched and punched and punched. Finally, thankfully, the glass gave way and shattered. The sound blended with the booming music like wind chimes on a blustery day. I\u2019m sure we tripped some sort of alarm.</p><p>I removed my jacket and threw it over the jagged threshold. Dallas gave me a hand up. He came through behind me, tossed me my jacket, and we were on our way. I welcomed the cold, fresh breeze as darkness and snowflakes swirled all around us.</p><p>\u201cI hear footsteps,\u201d Dallas said, grabbing my hand. \u201cMove faster.\u201d</p><p>Together, we dashed to his car.</p><p>Two hours later, we were no closer to finding Lilla than we had been when we first left the club. We now had her voice on tape, but wherever she was, she wasn\u2019t talking, so we couldn\u2019t pinpoint her location. We\u2019d tracked down and spoken with several people she\u2019d listed as contacts, but had no luck with any of them.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks ass,\u201d Dallas said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I agreed.</p><p>I sat in the passenger seat of his sedan. We were maneuvering down the East District\u2019s winding streets, made slick from the snow. Though the car guided itself, Dallas kept his eyes on the road, ever conscious of our surroundings. Music rocked softly from the speakers, and heat trickled from the vents, both as oppressive as my thoughts.</p><p>Someone close to me was going to die before the night ended.</p> <p>The premonition took me by surprise. I blinked, and just like that I saw a scene unfold in my mind, though I could not make out all the specifics. I saw the blast of a pyre-gun, the fall of a man. I couldn\u2019t see his face, nor could I see who had fired the shot; I only knew the shooter was a woman, the victim was my friend, and every fiber of my being was screaming of the approaching death.</p><p>Dallas sometimes teased me about being psychic. I always denied it, said my instincts were simply better than most. But I lied. I was able to predict certain events.</p><p>I was fourteen years old the day of my first vision. In my mind I had seen my youngest brother lying in a crimson river, three aliens standing over him, laughing and pointing. I\u2019d pretended then that what I\u2019d seen hadn\u2019t been real, had only been a figment of my imagination. But the next day I found Dare unconscious, his body drained of blood.</p><p>My next vision came a year later. I saw my dad get drunk and step in front of an oncoming car. Vehicle sensors hadn\u2019t been as sensitive as they were today, and the front end slammed into him. Of course, I immediately told him what I\u2019d seen. He\u2019d laughed, waved me away with an indifferent sweep of his hand. Two days later a sedan barreled into him. He broke his hip and leg and had to endure bone replacement surgery. He\u2019d never spoken of it, but I know my ability scared him.</p><p>That\u2019s when I began to realize just how different I was. I realized, too, that I had to push myself harder than everyone else, had to be better, stronger, and smarter if I wanted to be seen as one of the boys.</p> <p>I rubbed a hand over my face. With this new vision, I was going to take measures to prevent it from coming true. I had to. Yet with each second that ticked by, dread churned inside me, growing colder than the glacial snow whipping outside the windows.</p><p>Just what could I do? Delay our hunt until tomorrow, perhaps? Radio all of my men and send them home?</p><p>As soon as those thoughts entered my mind, I discarded them. Civilian lives depended on me. On us. I wouldn\u2019t abandon my job, even for one night. And my men wouldn\u2019t either, even if I begged them. Our jobs came before our emotions. Always.</p><p>So what could I do? My teeth ground together as helplessness claimed me. Over the years, I\u2019d lost my brother Dare and many, many friends to rogue aliens, and I wouldn\u2019t lose another friend without a fight. I didn\u2019t have many left, and those I had meant something to me.</p><p>\u201cStop the car,\u201d I managed on a shaky catch of breath.</p><p>Dallas cast me a quick glance. \u201cWhy? We\u2019re almost\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop the fucking car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he commanded the vehicle. The sound of squealing tires filled my ears, and I was suddenly thrust forward with the momentum of our skid and ultimate stop. Another car honked and swerved around us.</p><p>Dallas leveled me a frown. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to tell him, so I simply said, \u201cI need a moment to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?How to find Lilla?\u201d He lost some of his anger. \u201cI\u2019ve already loaded her voice frequency, but she\u2019s not goddamn talking, so there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get on the computer and see what else you can dig up about her.\u201d I didn\u2019t spare Dallas another glance. \u201cOpen,\u201d I commanded the door, and the hatch slid open. I stepped into the bitterly cold night.</p><p>I strode a few paces away, my boots crunching snow with every step. I realized I stood at the edge of</p><p>State Street</p> <p>, alone, silent, the cloak of twilight and stars all around me. Several snowflakes floated onto my lashes, and I blinked the crystals away, hoping to blink my fears away, as well.</p><p>Both remained.</p><p>Maybe I had missed something in the vision, some obscure detail that would help me prevent the death from occurring. There was only one way to find out....</p><p>I closed my eyes, manipulated my consciousness until I stood at the periphery of my thoughts, and allowed the gruesome scene to replay in my mind, along with a deep, pounding ache.</p><p>Through a thick, gloomy fog, I see two women; one is a human, the other is alien. They are facing each other. I can\u2019t make out their coloring, can\u2019t make out anything except the shape of their bodies. A man bursts into the room, behind the alien. I know this man, his scent, his energy, but his identity escapes me. He shoves the alien aside. The human woman fires a pyre-gun. The man falls in a puddle of his own blood.</p><p>The vision left me in the next instant.</p><p>I cracked open my eyes. My hands clenched at my sides as my helplessness intensified, more real than the aches and pains of my battered body. I didn\u2019t know why the man had pushed the alien aside, or why he\u2019d taken a blast of fire for her. Nor did I know why a human would want to hurt him. And I still didn\u2019t know the identities of the victim or the killer.</p><p>I drew in a deep breath, then slowly released the air through my lips. No friend of mine was going to die tonight. I simply wouldn\u2019t allow it. I would suspect every human female I encountered, and I would save this man.</p><p>If we could just find Lilla, we could lock her up, and Dallas and the others could go home, away from danger.</p><p>My movements were clipped, jerky, as I spun around and strode back to the car. The passenger door was still open, so I slid inside and slammed it shut beside me.</p><p>Dallas was plugging away at the computer console. He shot me a glance. \u201cBetter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I didn\u2019t explain further.</p><p>The edges of his month twitched. \u201cYou always have PMS this bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is actually a light case,\u201d I replied dryly.</p><p>He chuckled, the husky timbre of amusement mingling with his next words. \u201cGod help us all when it\u2019s bad, eh?\u201d</p><p>I opened up to tell him to go to hell. Before one word emerged, however, his expression sobered, and he cursed under his breath. He pounded a fist into the keyboard. \u201cI\u2019m having a hell of a time getting back into Lilla\u2019s file. Damn it! If I could match her voice frequency, we\u2019d be set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget voice. We\u2019re missing something,\u201d I said on a frustrated breath. In my mind, I pored over everything I knew about her, everything I\u2019d learned from our meeting. \u201cThe woman isn\u2019t very discriminating. Is she linked to any more men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of. She\u2019s been seen with William Steele, of course, and Mark St. John, but no one else. Well,\u201d he added, \u201cunless you count George Hudson, her arresting officer.\u201d</p><p>The moment Dallas spoke those words, several pieces of the puzzle connected in my mind. \u201cYou\u2019re a freaking genius, Dallas.\u201d I flopped back against the headrest and laughed with excitement. \u201cHudson. We haven\u2019t yet talked to Hudson. He\u2019s involved somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did Lilla allow him to arrest her? Her capacity for mind control is staggering, as we both found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Remember what she said? That she couldn\u2019t force Steele to do what she wanted? Maybe she can\u2019t control everyone. Maybe she can\u2019t control the men she screws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s very good. Since she couldn\u2019t convince Hudson to forget her arrest, she must have clocked in a few hours between the sheets with him.\u201d</p><p>I was intrigued\u2014and disgusted\u2014by Hudson\u2019s supposed behavior, which didn\u2019t fit with A.I.R. standards. Agents did not sleep with other-worlders. Ever. For any reason. \u201cIf they were sleeping together, though, why didn\u2019t he simply let her go? Why go to all the trouble of taking her down to the station, booking her, and then burying her record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was jealous of her association with Steele and wanted to teach her a lesson: obey me or pay the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways to teach an alien a lesson. Ways that don\u2019t include incriminating himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitnesses,\u201d Dallas said, slapping his thigh. \u201cThere would have been witnesses to her crimes, and Hudson had to make her arrest appear real.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cGod, this all seems so clear now,\u201d I said, and with that, relief hammered through me. Knowing exactly who had hidden Lilla\u2019s file wiped away my worries about the station house. I could take Lilla into custody now; I could interrogate her on my turf.</p><p>This didn\u2019t mean my friends were completely safe, of course. It just meant I had one less worry on this shit-filled night.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about Hudson?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dallas punched some keys. A picture of George Hudson filled the screen, his information posted beside his smiling face.</p><p>\u201cForty-one.Brown hair, brown eyes.\u201d Dallas paused. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten his coloring. A perfect match for our missing men.\u201d He rolled his neck, and the bones popped. \u201cDo you really think she\u2019d go to him? That she\u2019d go to the man who arrested her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. She\u2019d feel safe with the A.I.R. agent who\u2019s protected her twice already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I call for backup?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHave Ghost and Kittie meet us at the old warehouse on Water.\u201d</p><p>Dallas radioed the two agents, then programmed the address into the car. Our tires squealed as the vehicle veered onto the street, high-tech sensors guiding it and keeping it from crashing into objects. \u201cI told you the night was going to be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s about to get ugly.\u201d</p><p>A flash of movement captured my attention. My eyes narrowed, and I intensified my focus, my head turning as the car sped farther and farther away. When I saw a second flash, a peculiar, familiar energy washed over me. Just like at the club. And I knew. It was the male Arcadian.</p><p>\u201cStop the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>\u201cPull over,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>At his command, the car once more jerked to a stop, and I propelled forward in my seat, then back. At this rate, I would have whiplash by morning.</p><p>\u201cStay on your guard,\u201d I told Dallas, then said, \u201cOpen,\u201d to the car. As the hatch lifted, I added, \u201cI spotted someone I want to question.\u201d I jumped out, my weapon already drawn, my feet already moving, causing me to leap into a run the moment my shoes touched the ground. This was not the setting of my vision, so I had no compulsion to guard Dallas.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell\u2014\u201d I heard Dallas shout behind me, his voice traveling with me. I didn\u2019t slow down to explain. Couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d follow. He always followed when I took off. His protective instincts wouldn\u2019t allow him to wait passively behind.</p><p>My eyes continually searched the area around me. Damn, where had the Arcadian gone? I kept running, following his Onadyn scent.</p><p>With each pump of my feet and arms, with each jagged rock that beat into my boots, it became more and more clear that this man meant only to taunt me. When Dallas had ground the car to a halt, I had seen the Arcadian smile\u2014smile, damn him\u2014before sprinting away at full speed.</p><p>My footsteps continued to pound into the pavement. My heated breath mingled with the icy wind. Buildings towered on both my left and right sides, causing even greater darkness to swell around me. My senses were alert, my nocturnal vision excellent, and I finally caught another glimpse of him. I watched a trench coat whip around a corner and followed.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I shouted. \u201cA.I.R.\u201d</p><p>His laughter floated to me, rich and smooth, like warm brandy during a summer storm, unbelievably, suggestively sensual.</p><p>I\u2019d catch him, the bastard, if for no other reason than to cut out his voice box so he\u2019d never laugh again. As I ran, I adjusted my pyre-gun to stun, aimed, and fired off several rounds. With each shot, blue lights blazed a trail in front of me, illuminating the shocked faces of the alley\u2019s inhabitants. The lights quickly faded.</p><p>I\u2019d missed him. Every time. He dodged each round as if he knew exactly where they would land. Faster, Mia, I commanded myself. Don\u2019t lose him. Ragged breath burned in my throat and lungs and clanged in my ears, but I forced myself to keep moving.</p><p>Abruptly my run came to a stop, for reasons that had nothing to do with stamina. A wall blocked the end of the alley. Turning, panting, I eyed every inch of this bricked enclosure. The Arcadian was nowhere to be seen. How the hell had he gotten past that wall?</p><p>In the next instant, something soft brushed my ear. I whipped around, fired. Hit only the wall. The same softness brushed my other ear, renewing my awareness, propelling that odd thrill of energy through me. I spun, fired, and cursed. Still, nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou are being followed,\u201d a husky male voice said. His voice. The warrior. He sounded serious and grave now, and I couldn\u2019t tell which direction his voice came from. He was moving too fast.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m being followed,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. \u201cBy you.\u201d Steady. \u201cAre you a coward? Reveal yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother has already been taken, Mia Snow, and another will soon become a victim as well.\u201d He continued to move around me so swiftly I couldn\u2019t get a lock on him. \u201cWill you protect these victims,\u201d he said, \u201cor will you help the killer?\u201d</p><p>What kind of question was that? One so stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to answer it. \u201cWho has been taken, and who will be taken? Give me the names,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cWill you protect these victims?\u201d the Arcadian demanded in the same hard tone I\u2019d used.</p><p>Where the hell was he? \u201cOf course I will protect them. That\u2019s my job. Now give me their names.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A long pause surrounded us. Finally, he said, \u201cWhat do you know of Rianne Harte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan Heart,\u201d I echoed, committing the name to memory. \u201cNothing. What do you know of him?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, the sound dark rather than amused. \u201cSurely you have gotten further in the case than this. Surely you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMia,\u201d Dallas called behind me.</p><p>\u201cAnd so our time together ends,\u201d the alien said.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d I demanded of him. \u201cI\u2019m not finished with you.\u201d</p><p>The Arcadian didn\u2019t respond. In fact, I no longer felt his presence. The gentle charged hum of his electrical output was gone. Damn it. Obviously his powers were exceptional. Maybe that was why I\u2019d felt his energy twice now. To escape as quickly and easily as he had, he either levitated or walked through that brick wall.</p><p>God help us if aliens could now mist through solid objects.</p> <p>My free hand fisted. Had he told me the truth? Had someone else already been abducted? Was another man soon to die? If so, the Arcadian might even be the one responsible. He could have been bragging. I found myself nodding. That made sense and fit part of the killer\u2019s profile.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the Arcadian?\u201d Dallas asked, panting. \u201cI got a look at him and then he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>I pivoted and faced my partner. \u201cI lost him. Fucking lost him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell was he, anyway?\u201d He bent over and sucked in a breath. \u201cAnd why the hell were we chasing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him at the club.\u201d</p><p>Dallas\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cYou think he knows something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d With my hands on my hips, I searched the alley one last time. Nothing. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the car, and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>We strode briskly to the vehicle, ever alert to the happenings around us, and managed to settle inside the car\u2019s warmth without incident.</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned a name,\u201d I said. \u201cRyan Heart, male. Check for a missing person\u2019s report.\u201d</p><p>Dallas typed the name into the console, then glanced at me. \u201cNada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry Ryan Hart,\u201d I said, changing the spelling. \u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, try Harte.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed before Dallas uttered a dark chuckle. \u201cI hate to break this to you, Mia, but there are two Ryan Harts. One is sixty-eight, not the appearance of our victims. The other is his ten-year-old grandson. They both have blond hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p> <p>The Arcadian had lied to me. My muscles tightened with simmering fury.</p><p>\u201cGet both Harts on the phone,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to personally hear that they\u2019re safe in their beds.\u201d</p><p>It took Dallas fifteen minutes, but he finally confirmed that both Grandpa and the boy were safe.</p><p>\u201cI want a guard on both of them,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to know who they talk to, where they go. And keep it low-key. I don\u2019t want anyone to know, not even the commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a couple of humans who owe me a favor.\u201d Dallas made the necessary calls.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like this. I didn\u2019t like this at all.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>When we arrived at the warehouse, Ghost and Kittie were already there.</p><p>They stood beside their cruiser, each loaded down with multi-sized guns, knifes, and ammo. They were wearing typical hunter attire\u2014black leather pants, black shirts, and black jackets. Where Ghost was tall, with chocolate-colored skin and a well-muscled body, Kittie was short and as pale as vanilla ice cream. His spindly arms and legs hid a dangerous strength and an ability to take down the most menacing of suspects.</p><p>Kittie\u2019s real name was James Vaughn, and on his first day at A.I.R. he roamed the halls, introducing himself as Mad Dog. He deserved a tough nickname, he\u2019d said. I decided then to call him Kittie.</p><p>The name had stuck.</p><p>Dallas commanded the car to park next to them, and the vehicle smoothly obeyed. We exited.</p><p>\u201cEvening, boys,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Kittie said with a grin. His lips were almost imperceptible, only two thin slashes of pink, and he had a chin that pointed like a leprechaun\u2019s shoe, but damn if he didn\u2019t have a beautiful pair of eyes\u2014two brilliant emeralds framed by spiky black lashes. He dragged one last puff on his cigarette, then tossed it to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nasty habit,\u201d I said, my gaze following the glowing orange butt as it rolled across the pavement. \u201cAnd completely illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly way to control my advanced schizophrenia and narcissistic rage.\u201d Those green orbs glowed with amusement as he lovingly patted the cigarette pack in his coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cMia, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 as fine as always,\u201d Ghost said, \u201cbut Dallas...man, that\u2019s one hell of a shiner. Did you piss Mia off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Dallas shrugged. \u201cThis time she hit me for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a reason,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He only chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDid you have any trouble finding your first target?\u201d I asked the others.</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Kittie said, his deep voice a vivid contrast to his physique. \u201cWe put the little bastard in lockup. But I gotta tell you, he couldn\u2019t find his ass with a miner\u2019s hat, the stupid son of a bitch, and it was pretty obvious he knew nothing about Steele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the Arcadian we\u2019re about to apprehend does know about Steele, so listen up.\u201d I clapped my hands to make sure I had everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cHudson\u2019s house is only a block away. We do this quietly and as quickly as possible. And I want all of you, all of you,\u201d I stressed, my earlier vision suddenly filling my mind, \u201cto be careful around any and all women we encounter. Got it?\u201d</p><p>They all just stared at me with narrowed eyes, like I\u2019d just called them stupid-ass morons. Maybe I had. They knew to take care with everyone they encountered. I held each stare for a few seconds, then crossed my arms over my chest and waited. I wasn\u2019t going to apologize.</p><p>Finally, Ghost broke the silence. \u201cYou want this girl Lilla dead or alive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlive. I have questions, she has answers. Now enough talk. Let\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>We stealthily maneuvered on foot to Hudson\u2019s backyard. Our black clothing was like a neon sign set in the paleness of the snow, so we stayed crouched low to the ground, trying to stay in the shadows. At some points we crawled. Others we ran. The lights were out throughout the entire house; all of the curtains were drawn. Our heated breath misted the frigid air, and the only sound was the gentle patter of falling sleet.</p><p>I doubted Hudson was stupid enough to leave a hideaway card for the guest scanner outside, but I searched anyway. Unfortunately, I found nothing more than a few shiny rocks and a fistful of dirt.</p><p>Kittie spent a few minutes at the power receiver, cutting the alarm and backup battery. A risky move, really, because the stilling of a ceiling fan or the flicker of a clock could alert the residents of our presence. Risky, but necessary.</p><p>Ghost crouched down in front of the doorknob and extracted a black velvet pouch from his side pocket. He removed a tiny saw blade and fit the shiny silver metal into the scanner. Wireless systems were still uncommon among the middle class, thank God, but even the most basic of houses used print IDs or guest cards for entry. In this Hudson was no different. I couldn\u2019t pick an ID unit to save my life. I didn\u2019t have the patience.</p><p>Smiling, I said softly, \u201cI love it when you do this.\u201d His ability to break past any barrier gently and efficiently, without anyone the wiser, was how he\u2019d earned his name. \u201cI swear to God it turns me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just one of my many talents with my hands.\u201d</p><p>I already had my weapon drawn, so I lined up behind him and covered his back while he worked. Moments later, the ID was disarmed and the door popped open.</p><p>Quick as a snap, I spun and placed my back against the wall, preparing for entry.</p><p>Which one of these men would die tonight?</p><p>Unbidden, the question flashed in my mind. For a moment, I couldn\u2019t move, could barely breath. No. No! I would not let them die inside this house. I would protect them, with my own life if necessary. With that thought, I calmed. I would keep them safe with my own life. Shaking my head, I cleared my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I asked, not voicing the words, just moving my lips.</p><p>Dallas got into position on the other side of the door. He nodded.</p><p>Ghost and Kittie stepped back, guns drawn. They, too, gave a short but sweet nod.</p><p>Every nerve in my body on alert, I silently stepped inside. My gaze darted, and my gun moved with it. Clear. I stepped deeper inside, careful to place my boots exactly to prevent any type of squeak. I paused, absorbing the silence. Dallas entered behind me, followed quickly by Ghost. Kittie stayed at the door, guarding our rear.</p><p>Legally, we didn\u2019t have to announce our presence like PD had to do. We were hunting a predatory alien, and that gave us the right to enter any home we wanted without advance notice. So we didn\u2019t give any. Lilla was a slippery creature, and I wasn\u2019t going to give her any warning.</p><p>I scanned the immediate area. A kitchen. Broken dishes littered the floor. Chairs were upturned. My heart sped into over-drive. There had been a fight in this room, and my gut told me Lilla was the instigator. Just like in the club, just like with the Arcadian warrior, I felt her energy, caught a lingering trace of her scent, sensual and exotic. My guess: I felt her because she was as powerful as the other Arcadian. I\u2019d have to be careful with her.</p><p>I might not know what had suddenly allowed me to sense Arcadian energy today, but I was damn glad for the ability at the moment.</p><p>I motioned for the men to remain behind me, and I didn\u2019t have to see their expressions to know I\u2019d just pissed them off royally. Usually they moved ahead and cleared the way before I took the next room. Not this time. I wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Screw their egos.</p><p>Noiselessly, I entered the moon-washed living room. A big bay window decorated the far wall, and the curtains gaped slightly down the middle. Couch cushions were strewn across the floor, the television was smashed to bits, but no life.</p><p>My heart slammed inside my rib cage, and I had to fight to keep my adrenaline rush under control. This was just like my vision. Total chaos, angry energy. Then death. I shivered and forced myself to breathe. I had to keep my mind cool. Calm. I paused a moment and simply listened. Silence.</p><p>No. No, there was a muffled sound, low and hurried, erratic, but there all the same. I waited, breath bated. There were three open doorways in the hall, no light emanating from any. Which room was the sound coming from? Damn it, I didn\u2019t like this. The best course of action would be to check one myself and allow Dallas and Ghost to check the others, all at the same time.</p><p>I rejected that idea as soon as it formed and skirted around the wall ledge, the men close to my heels. I moved into the first room. Almost immediately, I noticed a woman sleeping on the bed. Pink silk sheets draped her from toe to shoulder. I was able to make out blond hair, but nothing more.</p><p>Four steps later, I stood at the side of the bed. Keeping my weapon locked on her chest, I freed a pair of laserbands from my waist and locked her wrists around the headboard. The bands pulsed with a slight, golden light as they bonded to her skin. She muttered something as she stirred. Her eyelids slowly opened.</p><p>The moment she spotted me, her jaw dropped, and she prepared to scream. I covered her mouth with my free hand, cutting off any sound. A second later, Ghost was beside me.</p><p>Someone moaned, and it wasn\u2019t the bound woman. The sound had been too deep, too far away. Ghost put his hand over the woman\u2019s mouth to replace mine. I spun, ready, and watched the doorway. The sound had come from one of the other rooms.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re A.I.R. agents, ma\u2019am,\u201d Ghost whispered to the woman. \u201cBe quiet, and you\u2019ll be fine. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She was glancing from one to the other, trembling so violently I feared she was having a seizure. Tears were filling her eyes, but she nodded. Shit, I inwardly cursed, as I looked at her more fully. She was just a kid. Probably eighteen, give or take a year.</p><p>Behind me, I heard a woman groan and shout, \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>I spun again and saw no one. And that\u2019s when it hit me. We had been so careful, so discreet, and in all likelihood, we wouldn\u2019t have been heard if we\u2019d blown a trumpet to announce our presence. Hudson and Lilla were too busy screwing.</p><p>\u201cStay behind,\u201d I told Dallas.</p><p>He gave a quick, jerky nod in the affirmative. Fury burned in his eyes.</p><p>Since the bedroom door was open, Ghost and I took opposite sides of the frame. Kittie made the end of the hallway his focal point. I concentrated on the couple. They were crouched on the floor, and Hudson gripped Lilla from behind. Her pale hair swayed each time his naked ass pounded forward. His hands roamed all over her, through her hair, over her breasts.</p><p>I had to admire his technique.</p><p>\u201cOn my count,\u201d I mouthed silently.</p><p>I raised my index finger. One.</p><p>Middle finger.Two.</p><p>Another finger.Three.</p><p>We burst inside.</p><p>\u201cHands up,\u201d Ghost shouted. \u201cA.I.R.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it now,\u201d Dallas yelled. Of course, he hadn\u2019t stayed behind like I\u2019d commanded.</p><p>Lilla screamed and jolted to her stomach. Hudson didn\u2019t even turn. He was too busy reaching for his gun on the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cTouch your weapon, and you die,\u201d I told him calmly. \u201cYou\u2019re fucked, Agent Hudson. And I don\u2019t meant that literally.\u201d</p><p>With his back still to me, he held his palms up and out as he eased back on his ankles.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands where I can see them,\u201d I said. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave one almost imperceptible nod.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. Now turn toward me. That\u2019s right.\u201d I arched a brow as he sat himself next to Lilla. I couldn\u2019t help myself. My gaze was between his legs and I almost smiled. \u201cAt ease. I\u2019m not that impressed with your equipment.\u201d</p><p>Hudson scowled.</p> <p>Lilla was crying, her sobs echoing off the walls, and I switched my attention from Hudson to...\u201cFuck!\u201d I shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s not her. That goddamn isn\u2019t her.\u201d Hudson hadn\u2019t been screwing Lilla, after all. This woman wasn\u2019t even an Arcadian. She had long blond hair, yes, but her eyes were dark blue, and her skin was perfectly sun-kissed.</p><p>I almost blew Hudson\u2019s face apart just to appease my growing rage.</p><p>But I paused and took stock. Okay. So this woman wasn\u2019t Lilla. Didn\u2019t matter. Lilla was here. I still felt her presence.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Hudson?\u201d I demanded. When he didn\u2019t respond immediately, I leveled my gun at his dick, so proudly displayed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I swear to God I don\u2019t.\u201d He licked his lips and tried to scoot himself behind the woman\u2019s back.</p> <p>\u201cUsing a civilian to shield yourself,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re practically the Antichrist, you know that?\u201d</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>\u201cIn A.I.R. training, did you watch instructional halograms of my work?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he hesitantly answered.</p><p>\u201cThen you know I have no conscience, and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get what I want.\u201d I gave the trigger of my gun a little pressure, not enough to grind off a shot, but enough to make my target squirm a little. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you about Lilla again. I\u2019m just going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go to jail if you hurt me.\u201d Sweat beaded on his forehead, and he worried a shaky hand back and forth across his brow. \u201cAssaulting an agent of the law is a federal offense, and there are too many witnesses here.\u201d</p> <p>One by one, my men turned around and faced the wall. Hudson\u2019s face grew paler and paler. A cruel laugh pushed past my lips. \u201cWrong answer,\u201d I said, and switched my gun\u2019s setting to its highest level. I aimed.</p><p>\u201cShe was here,\u201d he rushed on, hands up to ward me off, \u201cand she tore my place apart. I kicked her out. I swear.\u201d</p><p>He was lying.</p><p>Lilla didn\u2019t control him, but he cared enough for her to risk his career and his freedom by burying her file. I truly doubted he would have kicked her out for trashing his place.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d I asked, motioning to the crying female. My men turned back and faced us. We\u2019d made our point.</p><p>Hudson glanced at each man. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>He was lying. Again. His record said he was single. Most likely, he didn\u2019t want us to be able to question the woman about him. \u201cGeorgie, Georgie, Georgie,\u201d I said, holstering my gun, \u201cyou\u2019ve really pushed me too far this time.\u201d With that, I closed the distance between us and slammed my palm into his nose. The cartilage snapped on contact. Amid his shrieks of agony, I turned and said, \u201cThree noses in one night. Not my record, but not bad either.\u201d</p><p>Behind me, I heard Dallas give a short bark of laughter. I pivoted, but wasn\u2019t quick enough to catch his smile. He frowned at me, still angry with me for not letting him lead. I could handle his anger, though, because that meant he was still alive.</p> <p>I turned back and knelt in front of the woman. Her body was violently trembling, and her eyes were slits of fear. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d I assured her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Watching me, still unsure, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSherry. Sherry Galligher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid an Arcadian female come here tonight, Sherry?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cIs she here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was the hesitant reply.</p><p>\u201cShut up, bitch,\u201d Hudson spat, slamming his fist into her stomach with such force she banged against the nightstand.</p><p>My eyes narrowed on the bastard, and I held out my hand toward Kittie. \u201cHand me your lighter. I think I\u2019ll light a cigar.\u201d I glanced pointedly at Hudson\u2019s dick. \u201cWell, a cigarette, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Hudson growled, his anger and desperation making him forget his fear. \u201cYou\u2019d do it too. Well, if you want to light up my cock, why don\u2019t you try sucking it first? Because that\u2019s the only place you belong. On your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Dallas said, suddenly behind me. \u201cHe\u2019s dead now.\u201d</p><p>Kittie slapped the lighter into my outstretched hand. \u201cThanks.\u201d I kept my attention on Hudson. I held the flame close to his nose and slowly moved downward. He tried to scramble backward, but the bed frame stopped any form of retreat. \u201cYou want to rephrase your last words?\u201d</p><p>His lips compressed in a tight line as his ball hairs singed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d I stopped the flame but kept the lighter within his view. \u201cSherry,\u201d I prodded, returning my attention to the woman, \u201cwhere\u2019s Lilla?\u201d</p><p>She answered only after Ghost had grabbed Hudson by the leg and dragged him beyond reach.</p><p>\u201cGeorge locked her in the basement,\u201d she said. \u201cLilla threatened to tell the police about him if he didn\u2019t help her.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her hand in reassurance. \u201cYou did good. Real good.\u201d I\u2019d find out more about the Antichrist\u2019s \u201cactivities\u201d later. Right now, I had to take care of Lilla.</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2014I, I mean, may I get dressed now?\u201d Sherry asked hesitantly, tearfully.</p><p>Pity welled inside me. I hated to see a human woman so beaten down. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d But I watched her all the while, making sure she didn\u2019t make a move toward my men. I didn\u2019t think she would, but still...</p><p>As fast as her hands would allow, she gathered up her clothing from the floor and dressed. I didn\u2019t want to, but I banded her afterward\u2014just in case.</p><p>My vision was making me damn careful.</p><p>That done, I pocketed Hudson\u2019s gun. Then, just for the hell of it, I strolled over to where Ghost was holding him and kicked the bastard in the stomach. His breath whooshed out of his mouth on a pained cry. \u201cYou like how that feels?\u201d I girt out.</p><p>His only answer was a muttered, \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBand him,\u201d I said to Ghost, \u201cbefore I kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d Ghost answered.</p><p>\u201cI need clothes first.\u201d</p><p>Ghost hefted him up and pinned him against the wall, his arms stretched behind his back. Blood dripped from Hudson\u2019s nose in a red river. \u201cI can\u2019t go outside like this,\u201d he cried. \u201cYou can\u2019t fucking take me downtown until I\u2019m dressed. I want my attorney. Get me my attorney, goddamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get you a damn thing,\u201d Dallas retorted. \u201cWe\u2019re A.I.R., not the local PD.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. The situation was completely under control, and I was able to relax my vigil\u2014well, I slightly relaxed my vigil. I wouldn\u2019t be totally relaxed until it was morning and I knew all of my men were alive and well. Now, at least, I felt free enough to leave them here with Hudson and Sherry while I took care of some much-needed business downstairs.</p><p>\u201cDallas, get him some clothes and lock him in the car,\u201d I said. \u201cGhost, you and Kittie see to the women. I\u2019ll handle Lilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need backup?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. After I\u2019ve dealt with her, I\u2019ll meet you at the car.\u201d With that, I strode from the room and prepared myself to descend into hell.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>I brandished my own personal ID pick\u2014my pyre-gun\u2014as I inched down the creaking steps to the basement. Once there, I proceeded to blast the scanner to hell and beyond. Boom. The scent of burning wires filled my nostrils. My methods were swifter than Ghost\u2019s. Messier and louder, too. But then, I didn\u2019t have to be subtle anymore.</p><p>Lock taken care of, I kicked the seam in the center of the door with one solid strike of my foot. Wood chips rained to the floor as the door split open. One lone halolight hung from the ceiling, swaying, casting thin beams around the small room.</p><p>Lilla occupied the far left corner of this small space. She was huddled on the bare ground, her knees drawn to her chest, her fingers locked over her shins. The air here was as cold and damp as it was outside, yet she was dressed only in the half-shirt and skirt she\u2019d worn at the club. At least she was wearing boots.</p><p>She calmly turned her chin until she faced me, and I saw a thick streak of dirt across her right cheek. \u201cYou do realize you are wasting your time?\u201d were the first words she spoke, her tone matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Stand up.\u201d I kept my gazed focused on her face, watching for any sign\u2014a twitching eye, teeth nibbling on her lower lip\u2014that she planned to bolt. \u201cHands against the wall.\u201d</p><p>She slowly stood. \u201cMy brother will punish you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t hear me. Hands against the wall.\u201d</p><p>With a long, drawn-out sigh\u2014hell, she was acting like a martyr here\u2014she did as I\u2019d commanded.</p><p>\u201cDo you care so little for your life, Miss Snow? My brother will find me, and when he does, you will suffer greatly for all you have put me through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStory of my life. He\u2019ll have to take a number.\u201d My motions expeditious and efficient, I frisked her with one hand while holding my gun at her temple with the other. I found a sharp little blade strapped to her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying yourself?\u201d she asked as I confiscated the weapon.</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d I holstered my weapon and banded her wrists behind her back.</p><p>She protested weakly but allowed me to lead her back upstairs and outside without fighting. I kept one hand on her arm as we trekked up a hill. The snow was deeper than I remembered, and with every step, powder shifted onto my boot tops, freezing my toes.</p><p>The closer we came to the warehouse, the more she talked about her brother. On and on she went. \u201cHe will kill you,\u201d she threatened. \u201cKyrin has killed more humans than any of our kind,\u201d she boasted. By the time we reached Dallas, I longed to cut off my ears and give them to anyone who would take them, just so I wouldn\u2019t have to hear another word about her brother.</p><p>I gazed around expectantly, and discovered Ghost and Kittie were missing. Only Dallas remained, with Hudson situated in the back seat of our car. Dallas leaned against the door with his arms crossed. His eyes shot daggers at me while Hudson, who was inside with his hands still banded behind him, valiantly tried to remove the blue tape covering his mouth by rubbing his face against the headrest in front of him.</p><p>I raised a brow in curiosity.</p><p>Dallas shrugged. \u201cHe was too chatty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyrin will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d I said, cutting Lilla off. \u201cShut the hell up and get into the car.\u201d</p><p>Dallas commanded the door to open, and I stuffed Lilla inside. A bulletproof shield separated the front and back compartments, so I had no fear she\u2019d try to jump into the driver\u2019s seat and speed off without us. When the door slammed shut, locking her in next to Hudson, I glanced up at Dallas. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took the women in for questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have left without my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour permission?\u201d Dallas laughed, the sound cruel and laced with rage. \u201cWho gives a shit about your permission right now? What the hell were you thinking in there? That you knew better than we did? You took each goddamn room by yourself.\u201d His tirade echoed through the darkness, as black and lethal as the night. \u201cNot only is it dangerous, it\u2019s stupid. You could have gotten us all killed.\u201d</p><p>I had to swallow my first reply, the truth. He wouldn\u2019t acknowledge the fact that he was as susceptible to death as every human, that he was only a mortal, not a superhero, without serious damage to his ego. So I simply leaned against the car and said, \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he barked, incredulous. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you did your job, and I did mine. It worked out. So drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mia.\u201d He slammed his fist on the hood of the car, then leaned down until his breath mingled with mine. \u201cI did not do my job. You wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, I shouldered him out of my way and took my seat inside the vehicle.</p><p>Dallas remained outside for what seemed an eternity. Finally, he plopped into the driver\u2019s seat and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already phoned Pagosa. He\u2019s waiting for us at the station.\u201d His tone was distant, the way he\u2019d speak to a hated ex-wife.</p><p>He was pissed, yes, and felt betrayed. While I hated the distance between us, I\u2019d rather deal with those emotions than with his death.</p><p>I gripped the tops of my thighs. Heavy silence filled the car as we wound down the roads. Blissful silence. And in that silence, a thought occurred to me. I almost grinned. Dawn was only an hour away; Dallas and the others were alive. He was going to be okay. They were going to be okay. We\u2019d soon be at A.I.R. headquarters. Nothing bad could happen there.</p><p>Suddenly Dallas began reprogramming the car, giving it a new destination. It jerked to the side of the road. We fishtailed before a snowy embankment abruptly stopped our spin.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I demanded, glaring at Dallas.</p><p>His brow was smooth, his lips relaxed. He blinked once, twice, but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>What the hell was going on? \u201cDallas?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to free her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to free her,\u201d he said again. His tone was as expressionless as his features.</p> <p>Mind control.</p><p>Shit, shit, shit. I threw Lilla a furious glance. She was staring intently at Dallas, watching as he stepped into the night, skirted around the vehicle, and paused beside her door.</p><p>I shoved my way out of the car and positioned myself just in front of Dallas, blocking his way to Lilla. \u201cLook at me,\u201d I commanded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Dallas.\u201d I waved my hand in his face and even snapped my fingers.</p> <p>Again, it was as if I weren\u2019t even there.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll just look at me, I can help you through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in the car, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I knew by the coldness in his eyes that he would kill me to free Lilla. I was left with no other choice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dallas,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t wait another second. I wrapped my hands around his neck and squeezed, pressing against his carotid artery, cutting off the supply of oxygen to his brain. In his altered state of mind, he didn\u2019t realize what I was doing until it was too late. His eyes widened, and he wrapped those large hands of his around my windpipe. Before he could do any damage, his knees collapsed, and he sank to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>Getting his muscled frame buckled into the passenger seat required more strength than I thought I possessed, but I was somehow able to do it. \u201cGo on a freaking diet,\u201d I bit out. My body was already sore, and this just intensified every ache.</p><p>Damn, but I\u2019d be glad when this hellish night was over.</p> <p>I plopped in the driver\u2019s seat while Dallas slept peacefully, his features as relaxed as a child\u2019s, his snore as loud as a freaking foghorn. Lilla and Hudson\u2014who needed to share a little of my pain\u2014remained still and silent. They probably realized I was about to snap. All it would have taken was one gesture\u2014one damn gesture!\u2014from either of them, and I would have beat some ass.</p><p>I programmed the station house back into the console, and the car leaped into motion. Soon the A.I.R. building came into view. The outside was plain, brown, and nondescript. No windows, no landscaping. A towering eyesore, really, that boasted flame-resistant walls and bulletproof glass.</p><p>As we eased into the parking garage, I noticed Commander Jack Pagosa waited impatiently at the head of my parking space. Once the car had stopped, I emerged. I stood beside the open door, relieved that I was finally here. \u201cHey, Jack. You ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell took so long?\u201d he demanded in that gruff voice of his. \u201cAnd why the hell is Gutierrez sleeping on the job?\u201d</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I watched Lilla shift her body and attention toward Jack and I knew what she was planning. My fists clenched. Damn it. That woman was a menace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain in a minute,\u201d I told the commander. Right now, I had to neutralize Lilla before she brainwashed the entire force.</p><p>I freed my pyre-gun, shifted the lever to stun, and flopped back into the driver\u2019s seat. This time, I was facing the back. Lilla\u2019s eyes widened as I lowered the separation shield and levered the barrel of my weapon at her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck your brother.\u201d I squeezed the trigger.</p><p>A single blue beam blasted and paralyzed her, slicing her words to a halt. God, that felt good. I nodded with satisfaction. I should have done that when I found her in the basement, but I hadn\u2019t wanted to carry her. The downside now was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to question her until tomorrow night, when the stun wore off. Oh, well. That\u2019s the price I paid for peace. And I was now very willing to pay it.</p><p>Beside Lilla\u2019s motionless form, Hudson blubbered like a baby. He\u2019d somehow removed the tape over his mouth. The moment he realized I was watching him, he uttered a high-pitched, girlish scream that resounded through the sedan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mia. So sorry,\u201d he babbled. \u201cI swear I am. I\u2019ll do whatever you want, tell you anything you want to know\u2014just put the gun away.\u201d</p><p>I longed to squeeze a round at him, but the stun only worked on aliens. Something about their chemical makeup. The fire beam, however, killed everything in its path, and I knew that\u2019s what he feared. \u201cWe\u2019ll chat a little later, Georgie boy,\u201d I said, tapping his cheek with the side of my gun, \u201cdon\u2019t you worry. And I\u2019ll expect this same eagerness from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d His already pale cheeks became even more pallid. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I think he wet his pants. I didn\u2019t want to look too closely to find out.</p><p>\u201cNow, Commander,\u201d I said, once again exiting the car. \u201cWhat was it you asked me?\u201d</p><p>His mustache twitched\u2014I knew the sign. He wasn\u2019t amused; he was furious. He didn\u2019t like being brushed off, didn\u2019t like being treated like one of my lackeys. His dark brown eyes were ablaze with emotion, and the lines around his mouth were taut. Just then, with his thick head of silver hair, his round belly, and his red flannel shirt, he looked like a psychotic Santa Claus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m this close, Snow. This close.\u201d He pinched his index finger and thumb together, leaving only half an inch of air between them. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m this close to doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKicking my ass into next week, sir?\u201d I said, because he\u2019d made the threat a thousand times before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He straightened his shoulders and adjusted his collar, most of his bluster deflated by my lack of concern. \u201cYou have to follow the rules, Snow, and that means answering your phone like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned it off. Didn\u2019t need any distractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery member of my unit is issued a phone so I can distract each one of you any damn time I want. Remember that.\u201d He pushed out a breath. \u201cGhost and Kittie are inside, but they haven\u2019t told me anything. I\u2019m the head fucking commander of this team, and they want to wait for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to do any ass-kicking yet, Jack. I brought you a present.\u201d With a sweep of my hand, I motioned to Lilla and Hudson. \u201cA suspect and one of the A.I.R. team\u2019s finest. George here has been a naughty boy and I think he can help us with the Steele case.\u201d</p><p>Dallas moaned.</p><p>He was finally coming around. Both of his hands massaged his neck as his eyes slowly opened. He blinked, focused. I knew the exact moment he remembered the evening\u2019s events\u2014our little jaunt into Hudson\u2019s, my refusal to explain...the fact that I\u2019d almost choked him to death. Fire kindled to life in his eyes, making those perfect brown orbs blaze.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>I backed away from the car, my hands up in a gesture of defenselessness. \u201cI had to do it, Dallas. You know I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for my explanation,\u201d Jack interjected darkly.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get the prisoners in isolation, and I\u2019ll explain everything. To both of you,\u201d I added.</p><p>One at a time, they nodded.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Jack had his explanation\u2014minus a few of the seedier details. I breathed easier because daylight was quickly approaching. Hell, I even felt like gloating. I\u2019d thwarted my vision. I\u2019d won this time. Dallas was still furious with me, but he was alive. Even Ghost and Kittie were healthy and whole.</p><p>Nothing else mattered.</p><p>Life was good.</p><p>Lilla and Hudson had been separated and placed in isolation chambers. While Hudson complained during the trek to his cell, Lilla had thankfully remained silent, locked in the stun as she was. Sherry and the other woman from Hudson\u2019s\u2014I now knew her name was Isabel Hudson, George\u2019s seventeen-year-old daughter\u2014were being questioned by Ghost and Kittie.</p><p>The only thing left to do was talk with Dallas, but at the moment, that was impossible. Jack wasn\u2019t finished with us yet.</p><p>The commander leaned forward in his high-backed gray leather chair. He was seated behind his large oak desk, the picture of authority as he shuffled papers to the edge of the cluttered desktop. The walls around dripped with pictures of Jack\u2019s twenty-three-year-old daughter. His wife had left him years ago, so the only picture of her was the one decorating his trash can.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done good work tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cGood work. Both of you. You found the break in the case we needed, and you brought in suspects for questioning. Albeit damaged, but at least they\u2019re alive. Unlike last time.\u201d His eyes lit on me when he emphasized his last words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I muttered with a shrug.</p><p>Dallas and I were seated side by side. We hadn\u2019t looked at each other since we\u2019d entered Jack\u2019s office. Tension radiated between us.</p><p>\u201cProblem is,\u201d Jack added, \u201cwe\u2019ve had another disappearance. Victim\u2019s been missing since last night. The roommate only filed a missing person\u2019s a hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t we notified immediately?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAt first, the officers in charge weren\u2019t sure this one had any connection. However, I had Jaffe review the notes, and he\u2019s one hundred percent sure this case is connected to the others. Too many similarities, and too little evidence\u2014which adds a bitch of a ripple to our case. This latest victim is female.\u201d</p><p>Dread rolled through me, dark and dangerously sharp. I glanced at Dallas for the first time since stepping inside this office. Dallas glanced at me. This wasn\u2019t good news we were getting. In unison, we both turned back to Jack.</p><p>\u201cA female?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jack blinked over at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d I shifted in my seat, hating and loving every moment that passed and he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cRianne Harte,\u201d he said, glancing down at his papers.</p><p>\u201cSpell it,\u201d I said, ice crystallizing in my blood.</p><p>He did.</p><p>My stomach churned, and I closed my eyes. The Arcadian hadn\u2019t lied. He had said Rianne Harte, but he hadn\u2019t spelled the name, and he hadn\u2019t specified that the victim was female. I\u2019d misheard and assumed. A dangerous combination.</p><p>He\u2019d also mentioned that someone else would soon be dead.</p><p>At least I could take the guard off Grandpa Ryan and the boy. A real fucking silver lining.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Dallas said, \u201cMia and I chased down\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gave Dallas a barely imperceptible head shake that said, Do not mention the Arcadian male.</p><p>\u201cChased down a bottle of tequila earlier,\u201d he finished lamely. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I mouthed. I wasn\u2019t sure why I wanted to keep Jack in the dark, but I did. I wasn\u2019t sure who this Arcadian was, or which side he was truly playing for. I just knew I was going to be stingy with the information I shared until I figured out exactly what motives lay behind those amethyst eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than to drink on the job,\u201d Jack said, eyes narrowed. \u201cFirst I catch you napping, and now you confess to drinking. What the hell is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a description of Miss Harte?\u201d Dallas asked, quickly getting us back on track.</p><p>\u201cRed hair.Green eyes. About five foot six.\u201d Jack shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s a lab tech with Kilmer, Peterman, and Nate Pharmaceuticals. They specialize in fertility drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat similarities did they find between her abduction and the others?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cArcadian hair laid on the woman\u2019s kitchen counter like a rose. As with the others, there are no witnesses to her abduction. No sign of foul play. She simply disappeared from her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Jack said with a dark chuckle. \u201cShe had contact with two of the men before their disappearances. SullivanBay and Raymond Palmer. She was seen with each on two separate occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is getting complicated, Jack,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I need these missing people found ASAP. Alive,\u201d Jack added. \u201cIf you fail, well, you might as well prepare your assess for PADD.\u201d There was no humor in his tone. \u201cI\u2019m getting pressure from the top. They\u2019re afraid the story will break soon, and they want answers.\u201d</p><p>Fabulous. We were working as fast as we possibly could. Being ordered to work faster was fucking-tastic.</p><p>\u201cRight now, I want you to go home, get some rest,\u201d Jack continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll debrief at noon tomorrow with Ghost, Kittie, Mandalay, Johnson, and Jaffe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing, Commander,\u201d I said. I\u2019d worked under Jack for nine years. He was old and mean, but honorable. \u201cKeep everyone\u2014and that includes yourself\u2014out of Lilla\u2019s chamber. Her powers for mind control are staggering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she can penetrate my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe government has yet to produce a workable mind shield, and until they do, you\u2019re in danger from her.\u201d</p><p>He tapped a pen on his desk. \u201cIf I stay away from her and command everyone else to do the same, you\u2019ll owe me. Big.\u201d</p><p>He should be grateful for my warning, should be telling me how sensible I was. But no, the sneaky bastard wanted a favor, so he was pretending this was some big hardship. Last time I\u2019d owed him a favor, he\u2019d made me teach his daughter\u2014who reminded me of Barbie on drugs\u2014how to shoot an old-fashioned Road Kill .48. For my troubles, I\u2019d spent a few nights in the hospital, having a bullet removed from my ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cI need you to work next weekend. We\u2019ll be short several agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d I said, and felt a keen sense of relief. Working extra hours was no problem. It wasn\u2019t like I actually had a life. I had no hobbies. No friends outside of work. Never attended family gatherings. That was...sad, I realized with a frown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one enters,\u201d he promised, stroking his beard. \u201cNot without your permission. I\u2019ll even have her meals delivered by mechanical tray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow get out of here,\u201d he said, waving a hand through the air. \u201cThe sight of Dallas\u2019s beat-up face is turning my stomach.\u201d To Dallas he said, \u201cA word of advice, sport. The next time you\u2019re in a fight\u2014duck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try to remember that,\u201d Dallas said, his gaze darkening on me.</p><p>We pushed to our feet and filed out. The door closed behind us with a click. Then, silence. Benches and desks were empty, and only a few agents milled about. Most of the A.I.R. teams were patrolling the streets.</p><p>\u201cDallas,\u201d I said, then paused. I noticed Ghost standing down the hall, motioning me over with the crook of his finger. His bald head gleamed in the overhead lighting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave this building,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He\u2019d reached his bullshit tolerance, and I didn\u2019t even try to stall. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me to talk with Ghost, then we\u2019ll go to Trollie\u2019s for coffee.\u201d</p> <p>He stared down at me, his expression hard, determined. \u201cAll right,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got ten minutes. No more.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow at his I-am-commander-of-the-universe tone and vowed to take eleven minutes, even if I had to sit in the corner and pick my nose for most of those. We strode down the hall, the sound of our footsteps pounding in my ears. The air was sterile here, as if someone had doused the walls with cleaning solution. Ghost led us into a small private room.</p><p>\u201cThat girl is a certifiable whack job,\u201d he said the moment the door snapped closed.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, stepping toward the large two-way mirror that dominated the side wall and offered a secret glimpse into a smaller room. I had my answer before he replied.</p><p>\u201cIsabel Hudson, the Antichrist\u2019s daughter,\u201d I said, at the exact moment he said, \u201cSleeping Beauty, the Antichrist\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>I studied her. She sat at a scarred wooden table, her hands hidden in the folds of her clothes. Her hair was long and blond and as straight as mine. Her skin was sun-kissed, porcelain smooth, though it was her eyes that truly drew attention. They were faultless ovals, a rich, deep violet framed by long, sooty lashes.</p> <p>\u201cShe looks like an Arcadian,\u201d I remarked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be,\u201d Ghost said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a wig, and dye doesn\u2019t take to their hair, and if you hadn\u2019t noticed, she\u2019s got a head full of blond locks, not white, not silver.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a thanks-for-stating-the-obvious frown.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued with a shrug, \u201cthere isn\u2019t room in her body for alien blood. She\u2019s twenty percent human and eighty percent insane.\u201d He threw up his arms in a the-things-I-do-for-my-job gesture. \u201cInsane, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dallas chuckled. \u201cDid you make a pass at her, and she said no?\u201d</p><p>Ghost shuddered, and his face wrinkled in horror.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seventeen,\u201d I reminded Dallas. \u201cIf he had made a pass at her, I\u2019d have him arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she do that was so bad?\u201d Dallas asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment I stepped into the room, she began mumbling under her breath about mind control. One of her hands made continuous stabbing motions. And when I questioned her, she threatened to cut off my balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she mumbles and likes to cut things,\u201d Dallas said, trying hard to hide his grin. \u201cBig deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t see you rushing in there.\u201d Scowling, Ghost gestured to the door. \u201cBy all means. Go ask the little darling a couple of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to talk to her. Girl to girl.\u201d</p><p>Ghost\u2019s shoulders slumped in relief. \u201cIf anyone can deal with that psycho, it\u2019s you. You\u2019ve got panties of steel, Mia Snow. Me? I\u2019d have pissed in my pants if I hadn\u2019t had my gun.\u201d He patted his jacket under his left pec. He paused. Patted again. His smile fell inch by inch, and he gave a disbelieving gasp.</p><p>I was already at the door, had already turned the knob, stepped out of the observation room, and inside interrogation, when I heard Ghost say, \u201cMy gun! She has my fucking gun!\u201d</p><p>I barely had time to react, didn\u2019t register that this was my vision coming to life. Isabel held a pyre-gun, and the barrel was aimed at my heart. She had a blank look on her face, the same look Dallas had worn when he\u2019d been mind-controlled.</p><p>No. No!</p><p>Behind me, someone shouted, \u201cMia!\u201d as I reached for my own weapon. Suddenly I was shoved out of the way and felt myself falling in slow motion. Isabel fired. A blast of sound and light enveloped the room. A scream of frustration, fury, and fear lodged in my throat, and I ground off a round of my own before landing on the floor with a thud. Air abandoned my lungs in one mighty heave, and my vision became a spiderweb of black and white.</p><p>Dragging in a breath, I shook my head to clear my thoughts, realizing Isabel\u2019s shot had missed me. I was unharmed.</p><p>Then a male body fell on top of me, bleeding and lifeless.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>The drip, drip of an IV harmonized with the beep, beep of a heart monitor, creating a symphony of sound\u2014an opera of death. My head rested in my upraised palms, and my elbows perched on the hospital bed in front of me. I was tired, so very tired. The chair I occupied was made of hard, uncomfortable wood, but I couldn\u2019t force myself to move.</p><p>When I was younger, after my dad stopped loving me, he\u2019d punished my every indiscretion by forcing me to sit in a chair very similar to this one. Of course, he locked the chair and me inside a small, dark room. I\u2019d sit there, terrified and lonely, silently sobbing, sometimes screaming until my voice went hoarse. The memories always left me ripe with loathing, but because of them, I could now remain motionless for hours and not utter a single complaint. That little talent came in handy right about now.</p><p>Dallas lay on the bed, his eyes closed, a machine breathing for him, slowly inflating what was left of his right lung, expelling the air, then repeating the action again and again.</p><p>Only an hour ago, he\u2019d been declared dead. Yet one of the surgeons assigned to his care had refused to give up and had stood over him, beating on his chest, pumping him full of drugs. Incredibly, Dallas had been resuscitated. I\u2019d never had faith in anything I couldn\u2019t aim or fire, but when the heart monitor sprang to life, I began to believe in miracles again.</p><p>A.I.R. agents had come and gone throughout the morning, just as doctors and nurses had. Not a single person that entered this room had left a ray of hope behind; they\u2019d left only dismal condolences. Dallas\u2019s injuries were fatal. Most of his internal organs had been scorched, and there was a six-inch hole in his chest, the surrounding flesh burned beyond repair.</p><p>No, they\u2019d offered no hope.</p><p>But Dallas was a fighter. He was hanging on to his life with every ounce of strength he possessed.</p><p>Right now, I was alone with him, trying to force my life force inside him. I wished to God he had family here, someone to cry over him, pray for him. Unfortunately, his parents had died years ago, and he had no brothers or sisters, no aunts or uncles, that any of us knew of.</p><p>Helplessness overwhelmed me, helplessness so intense my body trembled with the force of it. Morning had come and gone, and now an afternoon storm beat outside. I hadn\u2019t slept, hadn\u2019t eaten. I couldn\u2019t. My stomach was a painful knot of fear, dread, and grief. Dallas was my best friend. My rock. He was an extension of Dare, I guess, the brother I\u2019d worshipped and lost. We balanced each other in a strange sort of way, and my life without him...</p><p>A shudder racked my spine, compounding the burn in my throat. I gulped. Squeezed my eyes tightly shut.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Dallas,\u201d I whispered brokenly. I wanted to slap him, to scream at him. I was furious, so furious, that he had pushed me aside and taken the hit himself. I should have been the one to fall, the one to suffer. The one to ultimately die.</p><p>I\u2019d failed him.</p><p>My shoulders slumped from fatigue as the surge of anger abandoned me. My eyelids slowly opened, and I reached out with trembling fingers. The pads of my fingertips stroked his cheek, along his jaw. He was cold, and his once bronzed skin was now pallid, an almost translucent white. If I\u2019d had tears to give, I would have cried until my ducts burst from the strain. As it was, I could only sit here, helpless, and watch him die.</p><p>My hands fisted so tightly my nails bit half-moon crescents into my palms. Isabel Hudson was dead. In my mind, I saw the continuous flash of my gun, the girl\u2019s horror-filled expression as multiple rounds of fire exploded in her chest. Saw her slowly slump to the floor. I\u2019d killed her, killed a young girl who\u2019d had yet to experience adulthood. On some level, I hated myself for what I\u2019d done, yet that didn\u2019t dull my desire to kill her all over again, this time slowly, lingering over every painful detail.</p><p>Damn it, how had this happened? Who had controlled Isabel\u2019s mind? Not Lilla, she\u2019d been deep in stun. That left...no one.</p><p>I must have missed subtle details in my vision. God knows I\u2019d gotten some of them wrong. I\u2019d had the human and the alien in the wrong places, thinking a human killed Dallas. How could I have known it would be a humanoid alien? I didn\u2019t know what species Isabel had been, I just knew she couldn\u2019t be Hudson\u2019s daughter, as reports claimed.</p><p>\u201cHow could this have happened?\u201d I whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Mia,\u201d a masculine voice said from behind me. Jack.</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn to face him. \u201cI can\u2019t leave. I won\u2019t leave. You know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re no good to me like this. No good to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I can\u2019t leave him. He needs me. He has no one else.\u201d</p><p>Jack paused a moment, and I knew what was rolling around inside his mind. Always business first with Jack. \u201cWant me to reassign your cases?\u201d he asked. \u201cGive you a week or two off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Steele?\u201d I asked, though I was unable to summon true curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put Ghost and Kittie in charge. They\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d</p><p>With those few words, Jack sparked the first stirring of ire within me. He\u2019d made it sound as if I couldn\u2019t get the job done. \u201cThat case is mine,\u201d I said with a trace of bitterness. Still, I didn\u2019t spare him a glance. \u201cI\u2019ll finish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. It\u2019s almost wrapped. Lilla\u2019s in custody, and once she\u2019s released from stun, I\u2019m sending Kittie inside her cell. Hopefully, we\u2019ll know where the missing men are by evening.\u201d</p><p>I gazed past the bed, past the far window, my eyes listless as swaying trees and glistening pavement came into view. \u201cYou promised me no one would talk to her without my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a big mistake. If you allow Kittie near her, you can kiss Lilla good-bye. She\u2019ll be gone before you can pull your head out of your ass. Besides, I doubt she knows where the missing men are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying she\u2019s innocent?\u201d he choked.</p><p>\u201cNot innocent.\u201d I pushed out a breath. \u201cJust not the mastermind behind the murder or the abductions.\u201d</p><p>His brows winged up. \u201cAnd you think this because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives by her emotions, doesn\u2019t think things through. Steele\u2019s murder was emotionless, thought out to the last detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia\u2014\u201d he said, then stopped himself. He uttered another sigh. \u201cIf you want to close this case,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you. If you want to interrogate Lilla, I\u2019ll let you do that, too. But you gotta get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosing faith in me, Jack?\u201d I asked with a humorless chuckle. My head arched back, and I blinked up at the sterile, white ceiling. I didn\u2019t blame him. I\u2019d lost faith in myself.</p><p>\u201cNo. Never,\u201d he said, shoving his hand into his coat pocket. \u201cThere\u2019s no one I trust more than you. Hell, you\u2019ve never let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I let you down last night. I let everyone down. Dallas wouldn\u2019t be here if I\u2019d acted more quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you listen to yourself?\u201d Jack scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. You didn\u2019t know this was going to happen. Dallas made his own choice, and God Himself couldn\u2019t have stopped him from protecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I could have stopped him.\u201d I pounded a fist onto the bed. \u201cI could have kept him unconscious until morning, unable to work. I could have postponed the hunt. I could have made him wait for me at Trollie\u2019s while I spoke to Ghost.\u201d</p><p>So many things I could have and should have done differently. I\u2019d known, damn it. I\u2019d known he was in danger, and still I hadn\u2019t protected him.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d Jack said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking clearly right now. You haven\u2019t slept in two nights. You gotta get some rest,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>I turned my head, and our gazes locked. His cheeks were pale, the perpetual red glow gone. His flannel shirt hung loosely over his shoulders like he\u2019d lost a few pounds. \u201cI\u2019m not a child, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are red,\u201d he continued, \u201cyour skin is colorless. Honestly, you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment, but I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, though I knew he was right. My mind was foggy, filled with thick morning dew I just couldn\u2019t seem to penetrate. My eyelids felt heavy, my body weak and shaky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to collapse. I\u2019m ordering you to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck your orders.\u201d I couldn\u2019t summon the strength to yell, so my words emerged as a small, hollow whisper. Surprisingly, though, my ire grew a bit more. I pivoted back to bed. \u201cDallas needs me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t hear Jack approach, but suddenly he stood beside me, his hand on my shoulder. \u201cStaying isn\u2019t going to make him live.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least\u2014\u201d I gulped. \u201cAt least he won\u2019t die alone.\u201d God, that hurt so much to say. I almost screamed then, screamed at God, at Jack, at the doctors who couldn\u2019t help this once vivacious man. I had to bite my cheek to keep the sound inside me; I bit until the metallic tang of blood filled my mouth.</p><p>Jack gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cHe was a good man. One of the best. I already miss him.\u201d</p><p>Shut up, shut up, shut up!my mind shouted. I covered my ears to block Jack\u2019s voice. He was talking about Dallas as if he were already dead.</p><p>Perhaps he was.</p><p>I focused on Dallas\u2019s face, so pale, so withdrawn. There truly was no hope for survival.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t say those words, however, so I said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t dead yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he\u2019ll need a miracle to survive.\u201d He gave my shoulder another squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly a man\u2019s life can change, isn\u2019t it? A blink of an eye. A snap of fingers.\u201d He paused. \u201cA heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>One of his tears splashed onto my palm. I watched as the clear liquid slipped through my fingers. I\u2019d never seen this strong man cry before. And knowing his own emotions mirrored my own...A tremor racked my spine. He had found some sort of release, yet I had none. My emotions were trapped inside me.</p><p>I scrubbed a hand down my face, resisting the urge to bang my head against the bed rail. Maybe physical pain would eclipse my emotional pain.</p><p>\u201cIs he suffering?\u201d Jack asked softly, ripping into my thoughts.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo pain. They\u2019ve got him so high, he\u2019s probably flying with the angels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t want our boy in pain.\u201d Jack released my shoulder and strode to the room\u2019s only window. \u201cJaxon is taking care of the funeral arrangements. I thought it would be too much for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said, my irritation rising another notch. \u201cAs his partner, it\u2019s my right. I want my cases, too. Don\u2019t give them to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Then, donning his usual gruff demeanor, Jack said, \u201cBe at headquarters tomorrow, one o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d He turned on his heel and strode to the door, only to stop before stepping over the threshold. Gazing over his shoulder, he pinned me with his stare. \u201cI know you\u2019re grieving. We all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off. \u201cYou asked to keep the Steele case. You asked. I didn\u2019t command you. Therefore you have a job to do, and I expect you to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, massaging my temples. I was grateful for his abruptness. I would have crumpled under pity or gentleness, and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cI need you to question Lilla and report the results at our debriefing. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, determination creeping into my tone.</p> <p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d With that, he shuffled from the room.</p><p>I was once again alone with Dallas. Clasping his cold, lifeless hand, I laid my cheek on the edge of the bed. Those two little actions caused every emotion I\u2019d experienced in the last hours to drain out of me, leaving only emptiness. Lethargy washed through my every hollow and crevice, claiming my limbs and, lastly, my eyes.</p><p>The last thought to drift beneath my consciousness before a swirling fog engulfed me was, Please God, send me another miracle.</p><p>I came awake slowly and realized three things all at once, only one of them significant.</p><p>First, I realized that I hadn\u2019t suffered through any dreams. Very unusual for me; I always dreamed. Second, I wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed since I\u2019d fallen asleep. Third, the hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end.</p><p>As my senses became more attuned, I felt an invisible pair of eyes upon me, intense, observant eyes hovering over my shoulder, watching...waiting. I knew I was inside Dallas\u2019s hospital room, and I knew it wasn\u2019t Dallas watching me.</p><p>Keeping my motions slow and deliberate, I reached for the gun at my waist. Then I froze. My gun was gone. Fucking gone. I didn\u2019t panic, though. I had a backup strapped to my ankle, though this one wasn\u2019t as competent, since it only offered \u201chot\u201d and \u201cextra hot\u201d settings. No stun. I curled my fingers around the trigger.</p><p>Fighting the urge to jolt to my feet, I allowed my eyelids to crack open a little at a time, gradually taking in my surroundings. Darkness had fallen, and muted beams of luminescence seeped through the beige hospital blinds. I kept my head and body completely immobile as I shifted my gaze around the room.</p><p>There, in the corner, a man lounged causally in a chair. I stifled a gasp when his features came into view. No, not a man. An Arcadian.</p><p>The Arcadian.</p><p>The warrior I\u2019d chased through the alley.</p><p>His energy wrapped all around me, strong, pure. Deadly. A shiver tingled along my nerve endings. His hair was thick and white and fell to his shoulders. I pictured his eyes, knew they were the palest violet, almost crystalline, with a thin veneer of calm, like nitroglycerin just before detonation. I knew his lips were full and lush, a perfect contrast against his ultra-masculine features, making him seem all the more dangerous.</p><p>He must have sensed my perusal because he blinked, a sensual sweep of his lashes, and said huskily, \u201cYour friend rests at death\u2019s door, Tai la Mar.\u201d</p><p>Angel of Death, he\u2019d called me. I jerked upright. My chair skidded behind me and collided with the wall. I had my firearm drawn and pointed at his heart before he could take another breath. I knew Dallas still lived because the gentle hum of his monitors filled my ears, and I could see the rise and fall of his chest from the corner of my eye, courtesy of the machine breathing for him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my pyre-gun?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice calm, even though my heart was tripping inside my chest.</p><p>\u201cYour weapon is safe.\u201d</p><p>Safe, my ass. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rianne Harte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you about her, did I not?\u201d He shifted slightly, creasing his black slacks. The sleeves of his white tailored shirt were rolled to his elbows. \u201cBut did you heed my warning?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him. Instead, I asked a question of my own. \u201cDid you take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered without hesitation. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove it. If you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you about her, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I switched the safety off, making sure he saw, then narrowed my gaze, focusing on which part of his body I wanted to hit first. Between the eyes, I decided, leveling my aim. One move from him, and I would fire first, ask questions later. \u201cI\u2019m left wondering if your warning was meant to help me or taunt me.\u201d</p><p>He only laughed, a rich, throaty rumble full of genuine amusement. The sound moved over me as softly as a caress. \u201cYou humans are so silly. Put your gun away,\u201d he said. \u201cHad I wanted to hurt you or your friend, I would have done so already.\u201d</p><p>Unwavering, I held my weapon steady. \u201cI\u2019m still interested in hearing why you gave me Rianne\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his stare becoming hard and gauging. \u201cPerhaps I was testing you.\u201d He paused. \u201cPerhaps you failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re here to give me another chance? Or to gloat over my failure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I am here to offer you a trade. If you are as honorable as I have heard, we can help each other.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m going to help you do is find your way into a cell.\u201d</p><p>His eyes slitted. \u201cI am Kyrin en Arr, and I have come for my sister.\u201d</p><p>Lilla\u2019s brother. I should have guessed. Automatically I applied pressure to the trigger, but stopped myself before actually firing. This man knew about the victims, and now he was connected to the case through other means. He would better serve me alive. \u201cSo you\u2019re the Arcadian who\u2019s murdered more humans than any of your kinsmen, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome would say so, yes,\u201d he said without shame or regret.</p><p>\u201cWell, guess what, Kyrin? Lilla belongs to A.I.R. now, and with her history of violence and being a prime suspect in a murder investigation, we\u2019re keeping her. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that her crimes are punishable by death.\u201d</p><p>His face paled. He was definitely aware.</p><p>\u201cI plan to see her executed,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cShe is not a criminal.\u201d Something cold and hard washed over his features, returning his color. His eyes gleamed with dangerous intent, like the sharpest of daggers, exquisite to view, lethal to touch. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not be so quick to deny my request, were I you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I,\u201d he said, studying me with an unnerving intensity, \u201ccan save your friend.\u201d</p><p>I can save your friend.</p><p>Those words beat inside my mind, causing white-hot fury to pound through every fiber of my being. Bastard! How dare he utter such a lie? How dare he attempt to offer false hope, simply to save his sister? Eyes compressed to tiny slits, nostrils flared, I began adjusting the level of power on my gun to its highest setting. I was going to have myself an Arcadian barbecue.</p><p>A nurse entered the room. I saw her in my peripheral vision, but didn\u2019t switch my position or my focal point from Kyrin. She dropped her chart when she caught sight of my gun. She froze in place, her eyes a tableau of horror, her mouth open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I heard a noise,\u201d she stammered, her features ashen with shock.</p><p>\u201cExit the room, ma\u2019am,\u201d I told her. I meant for the words to elicit calm and reassurance, but they exploded from my mouth with all the rage I felt. \u201cI\u2019ve got the situation under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014should I call the police?\u201d she stuttered to Kyrin, as if he was the one in charge here.</p><p>\u201cI am the police,\u201d I shouted. \u201cNow get the fuck out!\u201d</p><p>Nurse Idiot didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Then Kyrin gave a slight tilt of his head, and she raced from the room as quickly as her feet could carry her. My lips curled in contempt.</p><p>\u201cDo you prefer original or extra crispy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m willing to fry you up either way.\u201d</p><p>He ignored me, and instead replied with, \u201cI gave Dallas\u2014that is his name, yes?\u2014some of my blood. Only a drop, mind you, but he will live a few days more because of it. Were I to give him more, he would live out the rest of his life, healthy and whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t choose, I\u2019ll choose for you. I say\u201d\u2014I pretended to mull it over\u2014\u201cextra crispy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs his heartbeat not steadier? His color not brighter?\u201d</p><p>I flicked my partner a quick glance, and my eyes widened. Yes, on both counts, I realized, shock pounding through me. My hands stilled. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you helped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappoint me. I thought a woman of your talents would be more insightful.\u201d</p><p>I bared my teeth in a scowl. \u201cPerhaps you require a demonstration of exactly what my talents are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you require a demonstration of mine.\u201d Kyrin slowly rose. He was so tall, I was forced to look up, almost at the ceiling. I scanned his body, but I saw no evidence of weapons. Still, my heart slammed inside my chest, and my palms sweated. I didn\u2019t understand my reaction. I\u2019d squared off with aliens just as intimidating and won. I was the one in control here. I had the authority. I held the weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d say anything to save your sister,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI would say anything to free her, yes, but in this, I do not lie.\u201d He stretched out one hand and reached inside his slacks pocket with the other. Gaze locked on mine, he withdrew a small but deadly blade.</p><p>Okay, now he had a weapon.</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d I commanded. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you without a qualm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you would never know the truth, would you?\u201d Calmly he clasped the blade and placed the tip at his palm. I was too fascinated by his words and actions to follow through with my threat. His features remained expressionless as he sliced a deep incision from one end to the other. Blood sprang from the torn tissues, and the scar on my arm throbbed in reaction.</p><p>As I watched, his wound slowly closed itself, the tissues weaving themselves together and leaving the blood pooled in his hand. He wiped away every crimson drop on his shirtsleeve, a red smear against pristine white, then revealed the perfect smoothness of his hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you see?\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot die, and those who consume my blood will live, as well.\u201d</p><p>My God, this alien was some sort of immortal being.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to think of that fact. A lot of aliens had special powers, but I\u2019d never heard of one with accelerated healing. I told him so.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t so. There is only one other like me,\u201d Kyrin said with a shrug, \u201cbut you will never find her. So right now, I am your friend\u2019s only hope. My blood can save him.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when it hit me, truly hit me. Dallas could be saved. The knowledge rocked me to the core. I was almost afraid to speak my next words. \u201cIn exchange for his life, you want me to set your sister free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is all I require.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I\u2019ll set her free, I thought in the next instant. I\u2019ll slip inside A.I.R. headquarters, unlock her cell, and escort her from the building. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do. Excitement bubbled inside me. Then...the enormity of the situation slammed into me with the force of an antique 9mm Glock. I closed my eyes, lowered my gun. I couldn\u2019t let Lilla go. Six other lives were at stake here\u2014the lives of the five abducted citizens...and my own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By setting Lilla free, I would severely damage the Steele case. I might doom the very people I\u2019d sworn to protect. Breaking the very rules I worked so hard to enforce meant losing my job, my honor, the respect of my coworkers. And quite possibly gaining a lifetime of imprisonment.</p><p>I\u2019d always feared small, dark places\u2014a reminder of my childhood and a fear I had yet to overcome. The cold, the complete and utter blackness. The silence. But I wanted Dallas healed. God, I did. Desperately, I wanted my friend to live a long, healthy life. I hadn\u2019t saved Dare, but now I had a chance to save Dallas.</p><p>Opening my eyes, I gazed down at Dallas, at the helpless man who now had a single hope of survival. I tore my gaze away and faced Kyrin imploringly. \u201cWhat you\u2019re asking is impossible,\u201d I said, guilt already crashing through me because I hadn\u2019t shouted \u201cYes!\u201d immediately. \u201cMy boss would never okay such a trade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not recall suggesting that you ask your boss.\u201d</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>I chewed on my bottom lip. Damn it, what was I going to do? I couldn\u2019t allow Dallas to die now that I knew there was a chance to save him, but I couldn\u2019t release Lilla, either. \u201cThe law states I must eliminate Lilla once she is no longer useful to my case. What if I vowed to keep her alive? To let her live inside a cell for the remainder of her life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere I to say yes to that, I would be supporting the very laws I despise,\u201d he growled. \u201cLaws that were made because your people fear what they do not understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur laws were made to protect us from uninvited visitors,\u201d I replied just as darkly. Then, as quickly as my anger appeared, it vanished. \u201cPlease. Please help me. Help Dallas. I\u2019ll beg you, if necessary, to save him. I\u2019ll fall to my knees right here, right now. I\u2019ll do anything you ask. Anything...except free Lilla.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes glinted like opalescent steel. \u201cMia Snow on her knees before me? Tempting, I must say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d Currents of sexual energy sparked between us as we both pictured me doing more than begging. \u201cMe on my knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, right now I would rather have your gun.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside me shouted to deny him\u2014a good agent never relinquished her weapon\u2014but I closed the distance between us and pressed the barrel into his cheek. I lingered there for two heartbeats.</p><p>\u201cI could kill you right now,\u201d I said, staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cBut you will not.\u201d</p> <p>No, I wouldn\u2019t. Scowling, I removed the gun from his face, saw the impression I\u2019d left there, and felt a small surge of satisfaction. I turned the weapon hilt first and placed it into his waiting hand. I didn\u2019t mention that I had other weapons. Blades were strapped all over my body.</p><p>I watched as he removed the detonation crystal from its chamber, rendering it completely useless, then tossed the gun in the far right corner of the room. At least he didn\u2019t plan to shoot me.</p><p>\u201cI did as you wanted,\u201d I said, my eyes narrowed. \u201cNow you owe me something in return. Give Dallas more of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never promised you anything. I merely asked you to give me your gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d I whispered hoarsely. I longed to jam my fist into his nose, but I couldn\u2019t spill his precious blood unnecessarily. I bared my teeth in a scowl. The bastard wasn\u2019t going to give an inch. Wasn\u2019t going to negotiate. He\u2019d stated his terms, and I either met them, or he walked. \u201cI need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so I will give you some. But do not take too much.\u201d His expression stubborn and determined, he strode past me, saying over his shoulder, \u201cWithout my help, Dallas will die in four days. Remember that as you consider my offer.\u201d</p><p>As if I could forget.</p><p>He exited the room.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t think about my next actions, or the consequences they could bring. I knew what I wanted, and I was going to fight for it. I followed quietly behind him. The moment Kyrin stepped from the building and into the cold air, I sprang forward, and my leg shot out; I focused all of my anger, all of my frustration and helplessness, into the blow. Contact. My foot hit the middle of his back. Kyrin stumbled. \u201cSay hello to size seven A.I.R. special-issue all-terrain boots with my own personal cleat attachment,\u201d I growled. \u201cIn black, white, red, and camouflage, you sorry son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I was going to force him to help Dallas.</p><p>When he caught his footing, he whipped around to face me. A muscle ticked in his jaw, and his lips pressed in a tight line. \u201cYou would strike a man from behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would strike you from behind.\u201d My fists were clenched and ready for the fight I knew was to come. \u201cI want your blood, and I\u2019ll have it, by God. Every precious drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am disappointed.\u201d He tsked under his tongue. \u201cSuch a cowardly action from one so brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cowardly. Smart. You\u2019ll help Dallas whether you want to or not, and you\u2019ll help him now.\u201d I kicked out my leg, but he sidestepped the action.</p><p>He once again uttered that husky chuckle of his, renewing my irritation. \u201cWould you like to bet on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said, and like a deadly catapult of fists and fury, I launched myself at him.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>First rule of fighting: Stay calm.</p><p>Second rule: Never let your emotions overtake you.</p><p>I\u2019d broken both rules the moment I began following him.</p><p>Kyrin swept out of my way, and I flew past him. The storm had died, but the sun hid behind angry gray clouds, offering hazy visibility. Because of the sheen of ice at my feet, I had trouble stopping and turning.</p><p>Definitely not optimal conditions; however, I wouldn\u2019t back down.</p><p>\u201cYou do not want to fight me, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I whipped around. \u201cWanna bet on that too?\u201d I sprang forward again, intending to kick out my leg and knock him flat this time, but he reached me first. He grappled me to the ground, pinned my shoulders to the ice, and imprisoned me with his body. Cold at my back, pure heat on top. Neither was acceptable to me.</p><p>\u201cStill want to fight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFuck yes.\u201d I quickly landed a blow to his groin. Yeah, I intended to fight dirty. He doubled over, and I shot to my feet, slipped, then steadied.</p><p>Slow down, I commanded myself, drawing in a deep breath. I couldn\u2019t fly at him again, couldn\u2019t give him another chance to evade or capture me. A full frontal attack wouldn\u2019t work with this man; his strength was simply too incredible. I had to strike from the side, from behind, and I had to strike hard.</p><p>I relished the challenge.</p><p>Using his prone position to my advantage, I was able to land a blow to his left side and knock the deoxygenated air from his lung. He grunted in pain and sudden breathlessness. Arcadians were equipped very much like humans. Vulnerable in the groin, stomach, and head.</p><p>While he was busy gasping, I punted his left side again. Satisfied with my progress, I darted to his right and gave a booted strike. This time, he grabbed my ankle and toppled me to the ground. I lost my satisfaction, felt a moment of desperation. We struggled there, rolling on top of each other, fighting for dominance. I could smell the sweetness of his breath, the Onadyn that kept him alive.</p><p>Physically, he had me at a disadvantage, and we both knew it. He could have attempted to smother me, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d he panted.</p><p>Think, Mia, think.</p><p>I still had full use of my legs, and I made total use of them. I gave a scissor-lock squeeze around his midsection, forcing him to release my arms and focus on my legs. That\u2019s all I needed. With a four-finger jab to his trachea, his air supply was momentarily cut off in a whoosh, giving me the perfect opportunity to spring free.</p><p>My old combat instructor would have been proud.</p><p>I took stock of my options. I had to render him unconscious if I hoped to win. He\u2019d defeat me, otherwise. I would have to be merciless, but stop short of killing him. I needed his help, after all. His blood. I didn\u2019t want to spill a single drop on this cold, hard ice.</p><p>\u201cConcede, damn you,\u201d I growled, circling him like a tigress locked on her prey.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said, still on his knees.</p><p>I kicked out, aiming for his head. He swept sideways, dodging me, sending me spinning. Before I could regain my bearings, he was on his feet and coming straight at me. Just as he reached me, I linked my fingers together and swung, connecting with his temple. His head whipped to the side. He remained in place, hands balled into fists, knees slightly bent. Determination gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am almost done playing with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlay with this.\u201d I launched a flying spin punt into his side. I anticipated the crack of a few ribs, not a block. But block me, he did. I tried again. Somehow he was able to counter my every move. He was fast. Unnaturally fast. I followed the second punt through, letting my own momentum spin me again. Then I crouched on the balls of my feet and went low. My leg struck out in a hard sweep as I tried to knock his feet out from under him. He leapt above my leg like I\u2019d meant to play jump rope. Damn him. His speed\u2014no one was that fast. No one human, that is.</p><p>Quicker than I could blink, he advanced on me. He used his weight to push into me, stumbling me backward. When my body came into contact with his, the strength hidden beneath his clothing jolted me. He was made of solid muscle, easily outweighing me by a hundred pounds, but he didn\u2019t once use the power hidden in his fists to strike me down. Why? I wondered, even as I punched him hard in the nose. His head jerked to the side; he made no move to counter. Why didn\u2019t he return attack? Why did he go out of his way not to hurt me?</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to ponder the answer. Too much was at stake. The answer didn\u2019t matter, anyway. Right now I needed this man for one reason only, and his benevolence wasn\u2019t it. With some fancy footwork, I managed three successive lateral blows. The last sent him flying into the windshield of a parked cherry red Mustang. His body bounced onto the hood, denting the shiny metal on impact. He shook his head, trying to clear his vision, I\u2019m sure, since a jagged cut slashed down his forehead.</p><p>A shame about the car, but I wanted like hell to save the blood dripping off the tip of his nose. I quickly jumped him, wanting to pin him, but he rolled out of my reach.</p><p>Before my eyes, the flesh on his forehead sealed, turning from red to pink to normal. That was twice now I had watched him heal so quickly, and I was still amazed.</p><p>He shot to his feet. Studying me all the while, he wiped the blood away from his face as if it were a pesky fly. Bastard. He was taunting me.</p><p>His main blood vessel, the one that supplied deoxygenated blood to his brain, ran just below his breastbone. If I could just apply enough pressure, he would crash like a test dummy.</p><p>I circled him, intending to do just that, but he surprised me by grabbing my jacket and tugging. The ice at my feet aided him. Suddenly off balance, I tumbled into him, keeping a viselike grip. His warm breath washed over my face as he leaned close.</p><p>\u201cNow you will concede this victory to me,\u201d he ground out low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t hit me once?\u201d I said, a cocky edge to my tone. I\u2019d fought enough opponents to know Kyrin had had plenty of opportunities, but I wasn\u2019t going to admit that aloud.</p><p>His eyes darkened, revealing a hint of wickedness, and he leaned down until our lips brushed once, twice. Soft kisses, languid kisses. Innocent kisses.</p><p>And all the more searing because they lacked heat.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I hit a woman I\u2019d rather fuck?\u201d he asked raggedly. I felt the thickness of his erection between my legs.</p><p>I found myself dragging in air\u2014not from exertion, but from arousal. This wasn\u2019t like me. Couldn\u2019t be my feelings. My eyes narrowed. \u201cGet out of my head,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cI am not inside your head.\u201d He nuzzled his cheek against my jaw. \u201cYour mind simply recognizes what your body craves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re an alien. An other-worlder.\u201d</p><p>He paused and our gazes locked. \u201cWhat are you, Mia Snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pissed-off woman,\u201d I ground out, trying to push him off me. I only managed to rub him against me. I gasped, savoring and despising the sensation all at once. I positioned my hands over his pecs, meaning to give a hard shove, but I only caused his nipples to press into my palms like little needles.</p><p>I wanted him off me. Now! End it! my mind shouted. End the fight.</p><p>I had to find his weakness; that was my only chance for victory at this point.</p><p>Where was he vulnerable?</p><p>The answer sprang to life the next instant. I could use his unwillingness to hurt me to my advantage. With luck, he\u2019d leave himself vulnerable simply to protect me.</p><p>With that in mind, I pretended to go limp. As I\u2019d hoped, he released his grip on my jacket and caught me, holding me upright, leaving the rest of his body unguarded. Quick as a cat, I spun behind him, jumped on his back, and wrapped my arms around his neck. I jerked him against me, hard, holding my fists square in the middle of his windpipe.</p><p>One, two, three, I counted. He remained conscious.</p><p>\u201cI am different from my kind,\u201d he said casually, as if I were giving him a hug instead of trying to immobilize him. \u201cJust as you are different from your kind.\u201d</p><p>How did he know how different I was? I squeezed harder, but all I received for my effort was sweat running down my temples. I was struggling to breathe. My energy was quickly draining.</p><p>I had to try something. Not knowing what else to do, I slammed the back of his knee with the heel of my foot. His legs crumpled, and as he fell to the ground, I doubled my fists and cracked him in the head. His face snapped sideways and struck the slick concrete. A pool of rich blood seeped from his mouth, and a murky stream formed where the warmth melted the ice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My knuckles throbbed from the impact.</p><p>Once again he healed quickly. Almost immediately, he pushed to his feet and whipped around to face me. Our gazes locked.</p><p>\u201cIt seems neither of us will concede,\u201d he said, his tone raspy.</p> <p>I was happy to note he finally appeared winded.</p><p>Shattered glass and car parts were scattered about our feet. The cold flurry zipped and gnawed at our battered flesh, but neither of us seemed to notice or care. His hair danced in his face, but he never removed his gaze from me.</p><p>My skin felt too tight for my body; my blood sparked with newly awakened awareness. It had since the moment I\u2019d first seen him, but only in this moment of stillness did I become unable to mask the sensation. I couldn\u2019t force my heartbeat to slow. I cursed under my breath. I killed aliens. I did not desire them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Dallas to you?\u201d Kyrin asked.</p><p>What I shared with Dallas was none of his business. I knew that, but found myself answering, \u201cHe is my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrin\u2019s stare became piercing. \u201cNot your lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is good. I do not like to share.\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to sound as cold and callous as any hunter. \u201cIs that what it will take to save Dallas? Sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will sleep with me because you desire me, and for no other reason.\u201d</p><p>The surety in his voice I could have ignored, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the dark premonition that swept through me. Somehow, I maintained a neutral expression. \u201cYou\u2019re that sure of yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He gave me a knowing perusal that mentally stripped away my clothing. \u201cI am that sure.\u201d</p><p>I fought a shiver. \u201cIf Dallas dies, I will kill you. You do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I have not changed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil my sister is free, I will not help you. You have four days to decide. Then I will return.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. I closed my hands into fists and stepped toward him, ready to strike.</p><p>He only grinned. \u201cUntil we meet again, Tai la Mar.\u201d He spun around and began to stride away, his footsteps echoing in my ears.</p><p>\u201cKyrin,\u201d I called.</p><p>The sound stopped him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d called his name, didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d wanted to say. I only knew it tasted good on my lips. I said nothing else. When he began walking away for the second time, I stupidly called out again. \u201cKyrin.\u201d</p> <p>Once more, he paused.</p><p>\u201cI will hunt you down,\u201d I said this time, \u201cand when I find you, you will help Dallas.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me over his shoulder, and said, \u201cI look forward to your attempts. Your attempts,\u201d he said after a pause. \u201cAnd no other. If I learn that other agents are searching for me, I will disappear completely, and your friend will have no chance of survival.\u201d He left me then, his body swallowed up by the fog, his words echoing behind.</p><p>I stood alone in the hospital parking lot. Sure, I could have run after him. But I didn\u2019t. What would I do with him if I caught him? I didn\u2019t have my pyre-gun, so I couldn\u2019t stun him. And he\u2019d already proven we were an even match in a fight. Well, maybe not even.</p><p>Our time of reckoning would come, I had no doubt; sultry anticipation was already working through me. Now, however, was not that time.</p><p>Exhausted, I stumbled back inside the hospital. I\u2019d never been in a situation like this before, and I was unsure how to proceed. I needed\u2014God, I wasn\u2019t sure what I needed.</p><p>\u201cThis miracle sucks,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Nurse Idiot stood sentry outside Dallas\u2019s room, surrounded by security guards, as she tearfully stammered her experience with me. She dabbed her eyes with a tissue, short strands of brown hair dangling at her temples. Her face was flushed pink from her tears, the perfect offset to her bright purple scrubs. The guards drank in her every word, every expression, offering soothing murmurs of comfort each time she paused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d I said on a wave of irritation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d she cried. She pointed a finger in my direction. \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d she said again, cowering behind one of the guards.</p><p>All three men eyed me with distaste and edged toward me. I didn\u2019t bother with an explanation; I simply flashed my badge, and they backed off. \u201cGet me the doctor in charge of Agent Gutierrez\u2019s case. Now.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Nurse Idiot propelled herself to the nurse\u2019s station and shakily snatched up the phone. Five minutes later, I was about to pull out my hair\u2014and the nurse\u2019s hair\u2014because Dr. Hannah hadn\u2019t arrived.</p><p>\u201cPage him again,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho paged me?\u201d a man asked behind me.</p><p>I turned. Dr. Hannah was short, only five feet five. He had a thick head of silver hair and equally thick glasses. \u201cI need you to check Dallas Gutierrez and tell me if his condition has changed in any way.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Hannah frowned. \u201cI thought this was an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse Walden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs busy,\u201d I finished for him. \u201cI want you to do it.\u201d</p><p>Obviously exasperated, he rubbed a hand down his face. \u201cSurely this can wait. You called me out of prep. I\u2019ve got an artificial limb attachment in\u201d\u2014he checked his wristwatch\u2014\u201cfourteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better hurry.\u201d With a tilt of my chin, I motioned to room 417. \u201cUnless, of course, you want me to call my boss and have him run a crime search on your name and every member of your staff. I can return later and discuss the results with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d He readjusted his collar. \u201cDallas Gutierrez, did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d A long sigh seeped from his lips, and his eyes became heavy-lidded with resignation. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at him.\u201d</p><p>After taking Dallas\u2019s pulse and blood pressure, Dr. Hannah flashed a thin beam of light over Dallas\u2019s eyes. He uttered, \u201cHmm,\u201d then repeated the action. Brow furrowed, he cut away the bandage over Dallas\u2019s chest and inspected the wound.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, glancing at me, then back to Dallas.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I was at his side in an instant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually improved.\u201d Excitement dripped from his voice. \u201cHis pulse is stronger; his BP\u2014blood pressure\u2014is higher. His eyes dilate and contract perfectly. And look at this.\u201d With a gloved finger, he pointed to a portion of the burned tissue. \u201cSee how the flesh here appears pink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, pink indicates life. This morning, that tissue was black, dead, and completely unable to rejuvenate. Now it\u2019s alive and trying to grow.\u201d</p><p>When he began muttering about writing an article for a national medical journal, I gripped his shoulder and forced him to face me. \u201cSo Dallas will live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Grinning, Dr. Hannah scratched his head. \u201cYes, I believe so. For a while longer, anyway.\u201d</p><p>That was all I needed to hear. \u201cCall me if there\u2019s any change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he answered, distracted. \u201cI\u2019m going to order a complete blood count and an intralateral biopsy. Maybe a CAT scan to check brain activity. In all my years of medicine, I\u2019ve never seen this happen before.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to smile and frown at the same time. How could something so wonderful for Dallas be so disastrous for others?</p><p>Damn it, I only had four days to save my friend\u2019s life.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>I went home and hit the bed fully clothed. I didn\u2019t check my messages, didn\u2019t eat or shower. My weary body ached and demanded rest, and the softness of the mattress beckoned like a knowing siren.</p><p>Sleep claimed me instantly.</p><p>As always, dreams soon followed, though these were different than any I\u2019d ever experienced before. I dreamed of Kyrin. I dreamed he stripped me down, peeling away each layer of my clothing. His tongue moved against mine the entire time, his taste as warm and rich as brandy on a cold night.</p><p>Unbidden, my hands tangled in the silkiness of his hair.</p><p>He tore his lips from mine, and I moaned at the loss.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Even in my dream I tried to resist him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile teased his mouth before he crushed our lips together once again. I released his hair, ran my palms down the sleek brawn and sinew of his chest, then cupped the hard mounds of his ass. His skin felt like velvet, the hardness of his muscles a perfect contrast.</p><p>His body was as shaped and honed as any human. Better even. Bigger. His limbs were laced with sinew, so hot, so powerful. A girl could become addicted to such raw intensity.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Mia,\u201d he intoned.</p><p>I clasped my hands over his jaw and brought him down for yet another kiss. I tasted a swirling storm of hunger as his tongue swept into my mouth and attempted to conquer me. Utterly conquer me.</p><p>He groaned my name.</p><p>I awoke shouting his.</p><p>Panting, sweat-soaked, I lay there, my hands fisted in the covers of my bed. Frustration clawed at me, his heady taste still in my mouth. Cool air stroked my naked, heated skin. I sucked in a broken breath, hating that I felt seared. Branded.</p><p>Kyrin was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Only a dream, I reminded myself. Only a dream. Except, when had I stripped?</p><p>God, I need a hobby, I thought, rolling to my side. However, nothing appealed to me. I didn\u2019t have the patience to create things. Didn\u2019t like to paint, knit, or shop. My only activity in my free time was to work out or train in street combat. Sometimes I read, but that was only research for work. Maybe it was time to stop living, eating, and breathing my job, though. Maybe then my dreams would quiet.</p><p>At least I wasn\u2019t dreaming, as usual, of the aliens I had killed or the victims I failed to save in time.</p><p>I lumbered out of bed. My legs were shaky. After downing an entire pot of vitamin-enhanced synthetic coffee, I showered. I\u2019d read that our ancestors had used water to bathe. I couldn\u2019t imagine such a thing. Dry enzyme and glyceride spray was the norm now, blowing over us from head to toe in mere seconds. Water would have cost a fortune and taken too long.</p><p>Once dressed, I headed for the station house. There I picked up a new pyre-gun, replacing the one Kyrin had stolen.</p><p>I rode the elevator to level five, then underwent a retinal scan and fingerprint ID. I felt revived, centered, as I entered Lilla\u2019s small, cramped cell. The click, click, click of the triple lock resounded behind me.</p><p>I\u2019d left my gun and blades at check-in. Physically, Lilla was no match for me, and we both knew it. I could take her down without the aid of a firearm. Mentally, though...I just prayed I was prepared.</p><p>I was going to have to pump this stubborn, emotional Arcadian for every bit of information she possessed. I\u2019d probably have to lie, cheat, and threaten. Whatever I had to do, I\u2019d do it. I couldn\u2019t set Lilla free\u2014God, I couldn\u2019t believe I was even considering the possibility\u2014without finding the missing first.</p><p>Not even for Dallas.</p><p>I\u2019d admitted that much to myself already, and it still hurt like hell.</p><p>But...</p><p>If I found the missing men, as well as Steele\u2019s killer, I could set Lilla free with a clear conscience. Sure, I\u2019d be breaking the law\u2014all predatory aliens were to be executed. I\u2019d fought to put that law into place, and Lilla was definitely predatory. I didn\u2019t care, though. I\u2019d set her free and never regret it.</p><p>Urgency, and a small trace of fear, embraced me as I took stock of my surroundings. Urgency for Dallas, fear for the enclosed space. The walls were stark white, padded, and there wasn\u2019t a single window. A cot was pushed against the north wall, and a toilet occupied the south. There was nothing else in the way of furniture.</p><p>Lilla lay on the cot, her hands folded neatly over her stomach, her legs crossed at the ankles. She no longer wore her seductive clothing. Now she had on a plain blue shirt with matching pants, both made of stiff poly. Her eyes were closed, but I knew she wasn\u2019t sleeping. Serenity might radiate from her every pore, yet I knew better; I sensed her inner turmoil.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake,\u201d I said. I crossed my arms over my chest and waited. When minute after minute ticked by and still she said nothing, I added, my voice taunting, \u201cHow are your accommodations? Satisfactory, I hope. If the warden forgot to put a chocolate on your pillow\u2014\u201d</p><p>That had the desired effect.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she spat, jolting up. Her nostrils were flared, her eyes ablaze with hatred. \u201cWho are you to ruin the lives of others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI save human lives. If I must ruin yours to do so,\u201d I shrugged, \u201cso be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so smug, so sure. You will come to regret all that you have done, Mia Snow. Of this you can be sure.\u201d</p><p>A prophecy? Or merely words of hope? Either way, I suppressed a shudder.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2014\u201d she began in her familiar chorus.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. I know. He\u2019ll eat me up and spit out my bones. The fact is, Lilla,\u201d I said, casually placing my hands in my pockets, \u201cI\u2019ve already had the pleasure of meeting your brother, the procurer of human death.\u201d I emptied my expression of all emotion. I couldn\u2019t allow her to read me, to see the truth, once I spoke my next words. \u201cKyrin is in custody right now.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, she stared at me, hard, searching for any hint that I lied. When she found only a blank slate, shock and fear flitted over her features.</p><p>I had to contain my sigh of relief. Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t known the depths of her feelings for her sibling. I\u2019d only known how I would have felt if Dare had been alive and taken captive. Desperate. Knowing Lilla felt the same way about her brother gave me the leverage I needed. As long as she thought I held Kyrin\u2019s life in my hands, I could use her love against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are lying,\u201d she ground out.</p><p>Yes, I was. I held her angry stare.</p><p>\u201cKyrin would never allow himself to be taken.\u201d She gripped the edge of her cot, her knuckles quickly losing all color.</p> <p>\u201cAllow? Oh, no.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cHe allowed nothing. My pyre-gun gave me all the authority I needed. You do remember the effects of stun, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d she half growled, half sobbed. She leaned forward, anticipating my answer. \u201cIf you hurt him, I swear by your God I will destroy you and all you hold dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is unharmed.\u201d Maintaining my casual facade, I leaned against the wall. I stared her straight in the eye when I added, \u201cFor now. If he is to remain that way, however, I need an act of good faith from you. A token of your appreciation, if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Yes, I am.\u201d I slowly grinned. \u201cBut compliments are not what I want from you.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched and unclenched, and her pale cheeks brightened with color. \u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout William?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passed while she considered my offer. \u201cHow can I be sure you will release Kyrin?\u201d</p><p>For one brief second, I hesitated in my deception. I\u2019d always prided myself on my honesty, and each time I uttered a lie, a little piece of my integrity melted away. Then, like the click of a camera, an illumination of black and white, a picture of the four missing men, and now the missing Rianne Harte, flashed beneath my thoughts, followed quickly by an image of Dallas, hovering close to death.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word,\u201d I said in the next instant.</p><p>Her neck arched back as she studied the white, patternless ceiling. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d she finally said, and crumpled back onto the cot. \u201cWhere shall I begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with the first day you met William and end with you in this cell.\u201d I wanted to know everything. Knowledge was power, and in this situation, power was everything.</p><p>\u201cI met him about six months ago. He came to the club. I knew he was married. I knew his wife was pregnant, but I didn\u2019t care,\u201d she added defensively, daring me to challenge her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging you,\u201d I said. Whether the man had loved Lilla or not, he hadn\u2019t been as happily married as his wife claimed in her report. Jaxon would have to talk to the wife about that. \u201cWhen did your affair begin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few days later. He came back to the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark St. John didn\u2019t mind that you and Steele were sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d She waved a hand through the air. \u201cHis opinion matters nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you seeing him?\u201d</p><p>She gave a dainty shrug. \u201cBecause it amuses me. George likes it rough, violence excites him, but Mark likes to be dominated. Sometimes I like one way, sometimes another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid George Hudson care about the affair?\u201d I stepped forward. Her relationships were about more than sexual preferences, I\u2019d bet.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He hates William.\u201d</p><p>I closed a little more distance between us. \u201cDid he hate William enough to kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is guilty of many things, but not murder.\u201d</p><p>There was conviction in her tone. \u201cWhat are your feelings for George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a means to an end. A bastard, yes, but I must admit it was nice to have an A.I.R. agent at my disposal.\u201d Her expression frosted, and I could tell I was entering territory she didn\u2019t wish to discuss. \u201cSurely I have answered all of your questions. Will you release Kyrin now?\u201d</p><p>I ignored her. \u201cAt the club, you mentioned that you\u2019d tried to tell Steele he would be hurt if he didn\u2019t leave with you. You said you tried to warn him about them. Who is them?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed, then another.</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking about, Lilla?\u201d</p><p>She wrung her hands in agitation, twisting and untwisting the sheet between her fingers. Finally, she replied, \u201cA group of exiled Arcadians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExiled from what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArcadia. What do you think? Idiot,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>I\u2019d been called worse. \u201cWhy would these people want to hurt Steele?\u201d</p><p>More hesitation. \u201cHe had something they wanted.\u201d</p><p>I almost growled in frustration. The woman refused to elaborate without direct prodding. \u201cI\u2019m tired of prompting you, Lilla. Tell me all of it. What did he have that they wanted?\u201d Edgy tension worked its way into my voice. I was getting close, very close, to the answers I needed. \u201cWhat did he have that they wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife,\u201d she cried. She jolted to her feet and paced the length of the far wall. \u201cLife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are stupid.\u201d</p><p>My jaw clenched. \u201cDo you know any of the other missing people?\u201d One by one, I ticked off their names.</p><p>With the questions now veering away from the exiled Arcadians, her features softened, though she didn\u2019t slow her frenzied pace. \u201cI am only familiar with the last one. SullivanBay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know him. I have heard of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the exiled Arcadians?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but bring us back to them.</p><p>Her lips pursed. \u201cYes. From the leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just who is the leader?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together in mutinous silence, and her steps became wilder.</p><p>Okay, I would come back to that question. \u201cWas your brother involved in any way with Rianne Harte?\u201d</p><p>Grinding to a halt, she blinked over at me, and I could tell she was considering each of her coming words. \u201cHe spent some time with her, but what they did when they were alone, I know not. So if you want to know if he slept with her, I cannot verify that.\u201d</p><p>An image of Kyrin in bed with another woman had me fighting a crest of irritation. With Kyrin and with myself. \u201cWho is the leader of the exiled Arcadians? I\u2019ll need to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe leader is\u2014\u201d She squeezed her eyes tightly shut and drew in a deep breath. Her back was pressed against the wall. \u201cThe leader is Atlanna en Arr. A female. And the others are inconsequential.\u201d</p><p>Atlanna...the name sent a strange wave of that humming energy through me. I don\u2019t know why. My chin tilted to the side, and I watched Lilla for any sign of emotion. \u201cIs this Atlanna your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lilla chuckled, an amused sound that danced throughout the room. \u201cUnlike your people, we are not named after our parents. We are named according to class.\u201d</p><p>Interesting fact, and one I hadn\u2019t known. \u201cAnd just what class is en Arr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyalty.\u201d</p><p>She could be lying to impress me. I wasn\u2019t sure, and I didn\u2019t have the time to delve further on that subject just yet. Kyrin en Arr, however, had the bearing of a king, so that fit. \u201cLet\u2019s talk more about Atlanna. How did she know SullivanBay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere? Is he dead?\u201d</p><p>I received no response.</p><p>I tried not to let my temper overcome my intentions. Most witnesses forced me to mentally beat every bit of information out of them, so in this Lilla was no different. Usually I handled the situation with patience\u2014at least, I liked to think I handled each situation with patience. Today, I was hanging at the razor\u2019s edge of tolerance.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d I demanded again.</p><p>\u201cI honestly do not know,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Atlanna now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know that, either.\u201d</p><p>We were getting nowhere this way, so I tried another line of questioning. \u201cWho killed William Steele? Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced away from me.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re lying. I think you and your brother are involved. I think your brother needs to be interrogated. Violently.\u201d</p><p>A raging fire flared to life in her eyes. Had I been closer, she would have attempted to claw my face apart. \u201cNo matter what you discover,\u201d she growled, \u201cmy brother was not involved.\u201d</p><p>My back straightened, and my pulse leaped. \u201cNo matter what I discover, huh? That means there\u2019s evidence against him.\u201d</p><p>A gasp slipped from her, as if she\u2019d just realized she\u2019d said too much. \u201cHe is not responsible.\u201d Nostrils flaring, she pointed a vengeful finger in my direction. \u201cI\u2019m finished speaking with you. I\u2019ve told you everything I know. Will you now free my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You answered some of my questions, but not all. I want to know about Kyrin. I want to know what the exiled Arcadians desired from Steele. I want to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out. Get out before I kill you. I do not know any more. I do not remember.\u201d</p><p>My fists curled at my sides, and I remained in place. \u201cYou do remember.\u201d</p><p>She remained silent, but small phantom fingers began to pry at my mind, suggesting I leave peacefully. The woman dared to try and control me again. I ground my teeth together. \u201cYou want to be stunned again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d she screamed, and the pressure in my mind eased.</p><p>I\u2019d get nothing more from her now, that much was clear. Just how long would I be forced to wait for her to calm down?</p><p>Time was quickly becoming my greatest enemy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave,\u201d I said, \u201cbut don\u2019t think for a single moment that our conversation is over. You and your brother\u2019s lives depend on your memory improving.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>I spent an hour in the gym, sweating out my frustrations, pounding my fists and feet into the punching bag. I even utilized the virtual combat program, beating the shit out of computer-generated other-worlders. Unfortunately, my dark mood loomed even blacker when I strolled into the conference room fifteen minutes late.</p><p>I was determined to sit through this meeting and gather all the information I could. Even it if killed me\u2014or I killed someone else. I\u2019d already stuffed my car with the case files and secured documents from each abduction case. Secretly, of course. I\u2019d paid Mandalay to hack into the mainframe and add my name to the list of those allowed inside the \u201cConfidential\u201d storage area. As soon as I exited, she removed my name. She hadn\u2019t asked me why, just thanked me for the money. When I got home, I planned to go through them line by line and see if anything had been left out of the copies given to me.</p><p>See, agents were always given copies of the main file, never originals, and the main file was locked away and strictly for top brass. Supposedly, the practice was meant to preserve the original document from tampering. Pure crap. The government wanted their sticky little fingers in everything, that\u2019s all; they wanted to control what we knew. And what we didn\u2019t.</p><p>Conversation ceased as I eased into the only unoccupied chair at the table. To my left was Jaxon, and to my right sat Jack. Ghost, Kittie, Jaffe, and Mandalay, the only other female, were facing me. Behind them hung a virtual screen that contained five vertically lined pictures of the abducted. Beside each photo was the date, time, and location of each abduction. Below the photos was a map, each location pinpointed.</p><p>Jaxon gave me an encouraging smile to show his support.</p><p>I nodded in acknowledgment. Jaxon was a good man, one of the best on the force. A scar slashed from the top right side of his face to the bottom of his jaw\u2014compliments of a rogue alien\u2014yet he always managed to appear saintly. Maybe that was because he never spoke out of turn, never uttered a single sexual innuendo.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dallas?\u201d Ghost asked, his deep, rich baritone filling the space with sadness.</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d I wanted so badly to tell them the truth, that Dallas might survive. But I didn\u2019t. If they knew about Kyrin\u2019s blood\u2014and what I needed to do to get it\u2014I\u2019d be banned from Lilla\u2019s cell forever.</p><p>Silence hung in the air, heavy and heart-wrenching, as each of us became lost in our own private thoughts of Dallas.</p><p>Finally, Jack cleared his throat and said, \u201cMia, Mandalay\u2019s been telling us about the Harte abduction. She\u2019s taken over since Johnson is sick. Mandalay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said briskly, shuffling the papers in front of her.</p><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Harte was taken from her home a little after two P.M. Her roommate, also her sister, claims they were watching movies. Harte went to the kitchen to make a sandwich and never returned. There\u2019s no sign of a struggle. No indication of foul play or unlawful entry. We haven\u2019t been able to track down the boyfriend. Kyrin something or other. The sister didn\u2019t know his last name. Only that he\u2019s Arcadian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jack interjected with a raised brow. \u201cThat another Arcadian is in the picture.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t comment. My stomach was too busy churning with dread. Kyrin had known Harte, had dated her. Even Lilla had admitted to that. Having an entire A.I.R. squad know it, though, didn\u2019t bode well for Kyrin.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d Jack said. \u201cTell us what you learned from Lilla.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a calming breath, then pushed the air from my lips. \u201cShe mostly glossed over things we already know. However, I did learn that there\u2019s another Arcadian female involved. Her name\u2019s Atlanna en Arr, and she was seeing one of the abducted men, SullivanBay. She\u2019s also the leader of a band of Arcadian exiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandalay?\u201d Jack said with a quick glance to our computer expert.</p><p>\u201cAlready on it, sir.\u201d Mandalay\u2019s fingertips flew over the keyboard in front of her. Curly locks of red hair fell around her temples and brushed her wrists. By appearance, she was a commanding woman, tall, big boned. By nature, she was not a fighter. She worked better with probabilities and possibilities. She paused, faced Jack. \u201cThere\u2019s no Atlanna en Arr mentioned in our database.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about this Kyrin guy?\u201d I asked, trying to be subtle.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not listed either,\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cWe already checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Lilla give any clue as to where this Atlanna is?\u201d Jack asked me.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered honestly.</p><p>\u201cThink you can find her?\u201d</p><p>What I thought didn\u2019t matter. I would find her. \u201cGive me two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. Okay, let\u2019s recap the rest of what Snow missed.\u201d Jack shot me an irritated glance, and I hoped that would be my only chastisement for my tardiness. \u201cGhost and Kittie questioned Isabel and Sherry yesterday evening. Nothing was learned from Isabel, now deceased.\u201d</p><p>I heard several men mutter, \u201cBitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom Sherry we learned a bit more,\u201d Jack continued. \u201cAccording to her, she\u2019s known Hudson for three months. Apparently, Lilla paid her to have sex with him regularly, and the man never knew. Sherry said Lilla promised to pay her a huge bonus if she got pregnant. No luck, though.\u201d</p><p>Very interesting. \u201cWhy did Lilla want Sherry to have Hudson\u2019s baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry didn\u2019t know,\u201d Kittie said. \u201cLilla introduced the two at Club Ecstasy.\u201d He tapped his blue lighter against the table surface. \u201cHudson had no problem screwing the two women, but the moment Lilla started seeing Steele, the man flipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible motive for Steele\u2019s death,\u201d I said. \u201cHudson was jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible, yes,\u201d Ghost said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t explain the other abductions.\u201d</p><p>I said, \u201cAnyone talked to Hudson? Maybe he can help us wade through the crap and find the diamonds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t help willingly, that\u2019s for sure. But no, no one\u2019s talked to him yet.\u201d A frown marred Jack\u2019s face as he twisted a pencil between his fingers. \u201cHe had his nose repaired this morning, and only returned to his cell a little while ago. Jaxon plans to question him after this meeting.\u201d</p><p>I eyed my boss, gauging his reaction. \u201cSo Hudson doesn\u2019t know about Isabel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he knows,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThe good doc let it slip before surgery. Hudson didn\u2019t give a flying rat\u2019s ass, though. Said his life would be calmer now that the girl was gone.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids twitched at such blatant heartlessness. \u201cI want to be there when Jaxon questions him.\u201d Maybe I\u2019d destroy a little of Hudson\u2019s attitude while I was there.</p><p>Because he knew me so well, Jack shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you in the room. You\u2019re not his favorite person right now, and the sight of you may make him violent. Worse, he might refuse to talk. I\u2019m not budging on this,\u201d he added when I opened my mouth to argue. \u201cI\u2019d say the same thing to a man.\u201d</p><p>I needed to be there for that interview. I needed to know what Hudson knew\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to wait for Jaxon\u2019s formal report. \u201cI\u2019ll observe from a two-way,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>Jack studied me for a long while. I fluttered my lashes, trying to appear innocent. A sigh slipped from him. \u201cAll right. You can go, but if I find out you stepped one foot\u201d\u2014he held up one finger\u2014\u201cone damn foot out of observation, I\u2019ll kick your ass into next week. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>Jack turned his attention to Jaxon. \u201cWhat did you learn from Steele\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I reinterviewed her, the wife admitted that he was seeing another woman, but she doesn\u2019t know who it was.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cShe claimed they were happily married in her first interview. If she knew about his infidelity, why did she stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked the same question. Says she was pregnant when she found out and couldn\u2019t stand the thought of raising her baby alone. Says she loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have been lying,\u201d Mandalay said.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jaxon acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have an alibi?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Since Steele\u2019s disappearance, she\u2019s been staying with her mother. Already verified. I learned something else, though. Steele had dinner with an Arcadian male the night before he was kidnapped. Kyrin,\u201d he said, checking his notes. \u201cThe same Kyrin who dated Rianne Harte, is my bet.\u201d</p><p>My stomach rolled. This was what Lilla had warned me about. This was what she feared would implicate him. And by God, it did.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find this man,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI want him questioned ASAP.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t allow other agents to search for him, not with Kyrin\u2019s warning ringing in my head. If anyone other than me searched for him, he\u2019d slip into hiding so fast he\u2019d have wind-burn.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have for us?\u201d I asked Jaffe, hoping to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jaffe said, speaking for the first time since I\u2019d entered the room. He was a small, nervous man, with thinning ash blond hair and wide-spaced hazel eyes. Those eyes always darted left and right, as if trying to judge his escape route. He was damn good with numbers and patterns. \u201cThere\u2019s no obvious MO for the killer. There were two weeks between the first two abductions, but the third was taken only three days later. And eight days passed between the third and fourth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep searching,\u201d Jack commanded. \u201cYou\u2019re missing something. Even chaos can form a pattern.\u201d He turned his attention to Mandalay. \u201cWhat about the victim\u2019s body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Mandalay responded, \u201cthere was no blood evidence. Nor was there anything under his fingernails. No fibers\u2014alien or human\u2014to indicate where he was held or how he was transported. The voice recorders around the area have no alien recordings at any time on the day of the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rianne Harte\u2019s home?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cWhat was found there?\u201d</p><p>Mandalay shook her head, sending red curls flying. \u201cNothing, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Just fucking wonderful. I expected better than this.\u201d Jack shoved to his feet and strode to the side table. He poured himself a cup of coffee, then drained the steamy liquid in one gulp. He turned back to us. \u201cWe\u2019re no closer to finding the victims than we were yesterday. Pressure is rising, people, and will continue to do so until we\u2019re successful or we lose our jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to this Kyrin character,\u201d Ghost said. \u201cHe was seen with victim number one the night before the abduction. He was also dating Harte. There\u2019s a possibility he knew the others and had some sort of contact with them. So my question is, who\u2019s going to hunt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take care that,\u201d I said, hoping I didn\u2019t sound too eager.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finding Atlanna, remember?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>I spread my arms wide. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Super Woman,\u201d Kittie remarked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ghost said with a grin of his own. \u201cShe\u2019s Super Bitch.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rippled through the room, the kind of rough, biting laughter that came from people who encountered depravity on a daily basis. Jaxon tried to hold his amusement back, but soon gave up and burst into guffaws. Even I lost my scowl and had to smile. I was a super bitch.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jack said. \u201cKyrin\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Those words affected me on a deep, primal level. Mine, I thought. All mine.</p><p>Standing, Jack slapped his hands against the table surface. \u201cAll right, people. You know what you\u2019re supposed to do. So get it done.\u201d</p><p>I accompanied Jaxon down the long, winding corridor that led to A.I.R. sector five. Our ID cards allowed us to bypass the motion detectors, the heat sensors, and the weight-sensitive floor tiles without a single pause.</p><p>Jack had dismissed us five minutes ago, and I\u2019d already called Dallas\u2019s doctor twice. The first time, he put me on hold. The second, he didn\u2019t make the same mistake. I learned Dallas\u2019s tissues were indeed rejuvenating. Dr. Hannah had discovered a foreign chemical in Dallas\u2019s blood, a substance he\u2019d never encountered before, and he\u2019d treated both aliens and humans.</p><p>I knew the chemical came from Kyrin.</p><p>The good doctor was running more tests, but as of now, Dallas was stable. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but hear a countdown in my head. Three more days until Kyrin reappeared, demanding his sister\u2014unless I found him first.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d Jaxon asked. He gazed down at me, his features tight with concentration.</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d I forced Dallas and Kyrin to the back of my mind. I had to concentrate on the here and now.</p><p>When we reached the end of the hallway, we waited at the metal security station doors.</p><p>\u201cAfter you, Jaxon,\u201d I said.</p><p>He positioned his head in front of the blinking blue retinal scan. The computer said, \u201cScanning now,\u201d and flashed the light over his entire face. \u201cThank you, Jaxon Tramain.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon straightened his shoulders and flicked me a glance. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>God, I hated these things. I rested my chin in the recession plate, and the metal monster clamped onto my head for a full optical scan. If one of the antiquated lasers ever received a power surge, I\u2019d be sentenced to permanent medical leave and given an SGA, a sightseeing guidance automaton.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mia Snow,\u201d the computer said, releasing me.</p><p>Now that our identities were verified, we endured a simultaneous palm scan and the doors buzzed open. We entered a long white hallway. To both our left and right sides were sealed entrances, each leading to private cells.</p><p>These rooms were rarely occupied for long. Other-worlders brought in were usually interrogated within hours. Then they were either set free if exonerated, or executed if guilty. It was that simple.</p><p>I passed Lilla\u2019s cell. Thirty-two. And kept my gaze straight ahead. I\u2019d worry about her later.</p><p>Cell 66, our destination, was Hudson\u2019s location\u2014which lacked one more six to be accurate, to my way of thinking. He was human, yes, but he was involved in an alien investigation, so here he stayed. The bastard would be treated with the rights of an earth-born citizen, but he sure as hell didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>When we arrived at our destination, Jaxon placed his hand on scanner 66A, and I placed my hand on scanner 66B. A yellow light enveloped our fingertips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe anything I say, okay?\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cYou know I have to tell him what he wants to hear if I hope to get any information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t kill me afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do me a favor and ask Hudson about his daughter. Ask him why he claimed an alien as his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlien?\u201d Jaxon blinked. \u201cYou think Isabel was alien? Which species?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Ask him that, too.\u201d</p><p>He nodded just as the lock above each door buzzed, allowing our entrance.</p><p>Wiping all expression from his face, Jaxon stepped inside Hudson\u2019s cell.</p><p>I entered Observation. From the two-way, I saw that Hudson lay on his cot. A bandage covered his nose, and his eyes were swollen and ringed with bruises. As if to the beat of a drum, he moaned every other second.</p><p>Jaxon strode to the edge of the cot, squatted, and peered at the injured man. \u201cYou okay, George?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou in pain?\u201d</p><p>Hudson blinked, but didn\u2019t move. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m in pain?\u201d His voice was nasal and pinched. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>As if he wasn\u2019t laughing smugly on the inside, Jaxon uttered a sympathetic sigh. \u201cWant some meds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for you to get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon features softened. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re in trouble, George, and we both know it. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>I knew Jaxon was deliberately using his first name. Made him seem friendlier, more personable. But Hudson didn\u2019t take the bait. Hell, he\u2019d had the same training we\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cHelp me?\u201d he squeaked out, turning his head and riveting his eyes on Jaxon. He would have shouted if his nose hadn\u2019t been packed full of gauze. \u201cYou don\u2019t give a shit about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an agent. Of course I care,\u201d Jaxon said, as if that explained everything. His expression was so compassionate, I almost believed him. \u201cBesides, we have something in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, like he was sharing a great secret. \u201cWe both hate Mia Snow,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>That seemed to defuse Hudson\u2019s anger.</p><p>Jaxon, you are so good, I thought.</p><p>\u201cI thought everyone here worshipped that bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. She took my promotion. I should have become squad leader, but she slept with Pagosa, and he gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Hudson\u2019s ears perked, and his lips cocked. He propped himself on his elbows. \u201cI always figured she was blowing Pagosa to get ahead.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon flicked a glance to the mirror. To me. His eyes were sparkling with mischief, but his tone was dead serious. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl. That\u2019s the only way she can get ahead.\u201d</p><p>If anyone else had uttered those words, I would have burst into that cell and pounded some ass. But Jaxon\u2019s comment had worked. Hudson now considered him a freaking genius.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Hudson said, slamming his fist onto the cot. \u201cI could eat that bitch for breakfast, then make her beg for more.\u201d</p><p>Maintaining his friendly, casual tone, Jaxon said, \u201cMia thinks you killed Steele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Hudson jerked to a sitting position, grimaced, then sank back onto the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I told her. He\u2019s innocent, I said. Know what she did after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe laughed in my face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDumb bitch,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI swear, I\u2019d like five minutes alone with her. I\u2019d teach her a few things about men. Real men. Not those pussy-assed losers she works with.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon nodded his agreement, and didn\u2019t point out that he himself worked with me. \u201cYou have to help me here, George. I need some information so I can prove your innocence and tell Queen Bitch go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need to know?\u201d he asked, his tone dripping resignation.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about Lilla,\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cSherry says you were jealous of her relationship with Steele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry doesn\u2019t know shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDumb as a box of rocks, is she?\u201d</p><p>Hudson chuckled. \u201cI like that. Dumb as a box of rocks. Describes her perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry says Lilla paid her to sleep with you. That Lilla wanted her to have your baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t take me long to figure out that\u2019s what was going on. Use my condom, Sherry said, as if I couldn\u2019t see a hole the size of a goddamn crater in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confronted her. She told me about Lilla paying her, so I confronted Lilla too. Lilla said she couldn\u2019t have children of her own, but she wanted a baby. I think she was going to give the brat to Steele, maybe entice him away from his wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet that made you mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? Hell, I went ballistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do to punish the women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slapped Sherry around a little\u2014women need that every now and again to keep them in line. Then I arrested Lilla for prostitution. Scared the shit out of her, too,\u201d he said on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilla begged me to let her out. I thought she\u2019d see me as her hero, you know, but the bitch took off with Steele the moment I freed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you moved Sherry into your house? So you could get back at Lilla?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a man. I have needs. She\u2019s easy, and she had no place to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about her trying to trick you into getting her pregnant?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a sound full of evil enjoyment. \u201cI had a vasectomy right after Isabel was born. Neither woman ever suspected.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon muttered, \u201cSmart man,\u201d and I could tell he wanted to choke the life out of Hudson. The lines around his mouth were taut. His eyes were slightly narrowed. \u201cHow badly did you want Steele out of the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad. Real bad. But not enough to kill him,\u201d Hudson added quickly. \u201cI just told his wife he was screwing around on her. That put a stop to things real quick. Steele wanted nothing to do with Lilla after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just imagine how Lilla took the rejection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat the shit out of him. He deserved it, so I wasn\u2019t too upset with her about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen.\u201d Jaxon shook his head. He paused for effect. \u201cOut of curiosity, do you know anything about a group of exiled Arcadians? I\u2019m trying to prove they\u2019re responsible.\u201d</p><p>I loved how Jaxon so expertly wove his questions with his sympathy and his desire to \u201chelp,\u201d luring his unsuspecting victim deeper into his web of false comfort.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know them,\u201d Hudson answered. \u201cThey\u2019re led by a female. Atlanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where I can find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve only seen her once, and she didn\u2019t stay around to chat. She\u2019s real secretive. Looks like Lilla, but taller. And she\u2019s got a God complex like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Like Mia, she thinks she controls the fate of the world, and she\u2019s a real bitch, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know exactly what you mean.\u201d Maintaining his good-natured expression, Jaxon massaged the back of his neck. \u201cDid Lilla ever mention a man named Kyrin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaky.\u201d Hudson\u2019s voice was growing softer, as if he were suddenly having trouble keeping himself awake. \u201cWhen he looks at you, it feels like he\u2019s looking into your soul. He\u2019s strong, too. The man could probably crush us all with one swipe of his hand.\u201d His mouth opened wide in a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you\u2019re tired, George. I just have a few more questions, and then I\u2019ll let you get some rest. Was Isabel really your daughter, or was she alien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell kind of dumb-ass question is that? Of course she was my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, she was mine,\u201d Hudson said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. That\u2019s all I needed to know.\u201d Jaxon left the cell and peeked around the observation door.</p><p>\u201cIs it safe to come in?\u201d he asked me, his cheeks red with a blush.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe. He was lying about Isabel, he had to be.\u201d She was the alien in my vision. I just didn\u2019t know why Hudson would lie about something like that. I let it go, though. For now.</p><p>Jaxon entered fully, then closed the door behind him with a click. \u201cWhat a bastard,\u201d he said, his tone sickened and disgusted as he repeated my thoughts. \u201cThat man deserves pain. Lots and lots of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we\u2019ve confirmed Atlanna\u2019s existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kyrin\u2019s, as well. What if he, Lilla, and Atlanna are working together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I mean, I can see that for Steele\u2014Lilla wanted Steele, he rejected her, so the brother and Atlanna get angry\u2014but what about the other abductions? No motive.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll question Lilla again tomorrow and see what I can learn. Tonight\u2014\u201d I clamped my mouth shut the moment I realized I was about to tell him my plans to search for Kyrin.</p><p>Yet, that quickly, I came to another realization. I couldn\u2019t do this on my own. I couldn\u2019t search for Kyrin, search for Atlanna, read case files, study crime scene photos, endure another interrogation with Lilla, and find the missing men\u2014all in three days.</p><p>I needed someone I trusted to assist me.</p><p>Who better than Jaxon? I studied his face. Despite his scar, he was a sensually handsome man. His eyes were more silver than blue, his nose slightly crooked from being broken one too many times. Soft lips, strong chin. He wore his dark, slightly curly hair shaggy so it always looked windblown.</p><p>He was regarding me with kindness and concern.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d I continued, after dragging in and pushing out a deep breath, \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pause. \u201cWhatever I can do, I will. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that, Jaxon. I\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>I drove Jaxon to Trollie\u2019s, a caf\u00e9 and bar situated a few miles from headquarters and the only restaurant open twenty-four hours. On any given day and at any given time, the place was packed from end to end with A.I.R. agents, both on and off duty. The food was mediocre, but the atmosphere was exceptional\u2014dimmed lighting, soft, relaxing music, and raunchy agents cracking dirty jokes. A five-star meal couldn\u2019t compare to that.</p><p>During the drive, I filled Jaxon in on Kyrin, Dallas, and Lilla. I left out nothing. Jaxon never once interrupted me. When I had finished, I waited for some type of response from him.</p><p>Only silence greeted me, and several minutes ticked away.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, flicking him a quick glance, \u201cdo you still want to help me?\u201d</p><p>He stared out the passenger window. \u201cGive me some time to digest this. That\u2019s a lot to throw at a man.\u201d</p><p>Time was the only thing I didn\u2019t have. \u201cYou\u2019ve got until we\u2019re seated at Trollie\u2019s. If you won\u2019t help me, I\u2019ll have to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>He hissed out a breath between his teeth, filling the car with a soft whistle. \u201cAre you always this impatient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you drove Dallas crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could make a fortune on that bet.\u201d</p><p>We made the rest of the drive in silence. A few minutes later, we eased onto a gravel drive and parked in front of a cheap orange boxcar, elongated for space.</p><p>Outside, the air was cold and quiet, scented with car exhaust. When I pulled open the brass-handled door, a volley of drunken chatter spilled out. We cut through a thick haze of cigarette smoke\u2014like we were going to arrest each other for smoking\u2014and meandering bodies. As usual, the place was jammed. We had to shoot the shit with several agents we knew before snagging a back corner booth.</p><p>Dallas and I had spent many evenings here. Neither of us liked to cook. I tried, but the end result was always burned slop. We\u2019d laughed in here, relaxed in here. He deserved more nights like that.</p><p>We punched our order into the wall unit, and soon Molly, a cute blond, brought our drinks and scampered away. Jaxon, the consummate health nut, had requested water with a lemon twist. Me? I wanted the strongest, blackest coffee they had, laced with a shot of pure, undiluted caffeine. I\u2019m sure injecting crude oil into my veins would have been easier on my body, but I didn\u2019t care. I downed the burning liquid, then signaled for a refill. I was like a boozehound with a brand-new bottle of tequila.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Mia, you trying to kill yourself there?\u201d Jaxon asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cJust trying to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you stay so slim? Living on caffeine?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and watched him through the thick shield of my lashes. I\u2019d had enough pleasantries; I wanted to get down to business. \u201cSo are you in or out?\u201d</p><p>Jaxon understood what I was asking and stared at me across the speckled yellow tabletop. \u201cLet me see if I have this straight.\u201d Shadows and light played across his features as the lamp above us swayed, illuminating his scar, giving him a menacing quality. \u201cKyrin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo names,\u201d I interrupted, giving a pointed nod to the other agents present.</p><p>\u201cThe brother can save our friend\u2019s life. In return, he wants the sister released. And he\u2019s given you four days to free her, or our friend dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly three days left, now. But otherwise, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no agent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan search for him, or he\u2019ll disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re planning to find our victims\u2014and the brother\u2014within these next three days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now are you in or out?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cIn, of course.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he said now, as if he hadn\u2019t made me sweat the last ten minutes of his indecision. On the black vinyl seat beside me, I\u2019d tucked my briefcase filled with the stolen case files. I\u2019d already covered the Confidential sticker with a plain casing. I withdrew two and handed them to Jaxon. \u201cWe need to go over these. Study every detail.\u201d</p><p>He clasped the offered files and then, to my astonishment, set them aside. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate without food. Let\u2019s eat. Then study.\u201d</p><p>My impatience reared its head. The sooner we worked, the sooner we found answers. Still, I wasn\u2019t going to push my luck, so I forced myself to agree.</p><p>Our food arrived fifteen minutes later and was arranged in front of us. Jaxon dove into his turkey-on-wheat sandwich. No mayo. I managed a few bites of my double bacon cheeseburger and extra crispy chili cheese fries. Normally, I would have cleaned my plate and requested dessert. Dallas always made fun of my junk food addiction and constantly complained that if he ate like that, he wouldn\u2019t fit inside the car. Me? I had uncommon metabolism. Couldn\u2019t keep the fat on me. Which was good. I had no intention of changing my eating habits now.</p><p>Tonight, however, my stomach was simply too unsettled to allow me to indulge.</p><p>\u201cYou going to eat that?\u201d Jaxon asked, eyeing my burger with distaste.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not enough grease to suit me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He rolled his eyes and threw his napkin on the tabletop. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here,\u201d he said, opening one of the files, \u201csince you\u2019re not going to relax until we do.\u201d</p><p>Only moments later, he glanced at me, his features blank. \u201cOn the outside, this looks like a nonrestricted file. This should be a nonrestricted file. Yet what did I find when I took a glance at the inside? This is confidential material, Mia. What\u2019s it doing outside of A.I.R.?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019ll return everything when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d He shook his head, but I detected a hint of admiration in his expression. \u201cYou are some piece of work.\u201d</p><p>While he read on, I grabbed a file and poured over every photo, every sentence. I had just reached the third page when I paused, reread, blinked. Blinked again. A thought jumped to life in my mind.</p><p>\u201cCheck this out,\u201d I said to Jaxon and handed him the folder. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t mentioned in our file. Steele and his wife had just had a baby, right? Turns out they conceived through artificial insemination. Didn\u2019t Hudson say that Lilla paid Sherry to try and get pregnant by him? And now I discover that SullivanBay made frequent deposits at his local sperm bank.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWho are you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaymond Palmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck for\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to finish my sentence. Jaxon glanced up at me. \u201cMr. Palmer made regular deposits at Kilmer, Peterman, and Nate, too. Same place Rianne Harte worked. Why wouldn\u2019t they give us that information?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t know, but a thrill of success tingled through me. I had a common thread. Fertility. I turned my attention back to the photos and papers in front of me. A few minutes later, I was shaking my head in disbelief. \u201cLook what else I found,\u201d I said. \u201cCheck out the fourth paragraph.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the paper, looked back at his own file, then glanced again at mine. \u201cGuess what? Mine says the same thing, except the name isn\u2019t mentioned. Just the description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cWhat do you want to bet the others say the same thing?\u201d</p><p>I fought back a groan. \u201cLet\u2019s pray they don\u2019t.\u201d We knew there was a particular person connected to two of the cases, but if all of them were connected to\u2014I sliced that thought to a halt, not wanting to borrow trouble. Still, I fought a sense of impending doom as I withdrew the two remaining folders from my briefcase, handed one to Jaxon, then opened the other myself. Only two minutes had passed before we were staring over the table at each other.</p><p>\u201cGlad you didn\u2019t take my bet?\u201d Jaxon asked.</p><p>Damn it. Kyrin was mentioned in every file as a \u201ctall Arcadian male.\u201d Twice by name. Not only had he dated Rianne Harte, he\u2019d had dinner or some type of contact with every fucking man the night before they were abducted. The very night.</p><p>This was not the kind of information an agent could ethically withhold from a commander. If we told Jack, however, twenty agents would immediately be assigned to hunt and kill Kyrin. They might even write off the missing men as casualties, not stopping to question Kyrin about their whereabouts, just killing him in their fury.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t allow that. Because I didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that Kyrin would act on the threat he\u2019d made to me. If he discovered other agents were hunting him, he would vanish, and Dallas would die.</p><p>Unbidden, Kyrin\u2019s image formed in my mind. White hair. Enigmatic lavender eyes. Taut sinew and rigidly muscled body. The way he moved with such grace and fluidity; his long strides of self-assurance. The way strength radiated from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do about Kyrin?\u201d Jaxon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. God, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon rubbed his jaw with two fingers. \u201cWe could split the search. You take one half of the city, and I\u2019ll take the other. Or...\u201d He tapped his fingers against the tabletop. \u201cOr we could bring Kyrin to us.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, I tilted my chin and studied him. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe loves his sister and wants to save her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>A man strode by our table, followed by another. Jaxon waited until the two were out of range before continuing. \u201cWhat if someone alerted the media about Lilla\u2019s execution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExecution? We aren\u2019t killing her yet. We need\u2014Oh. Ooohhh.\u201d I smiled slowly. My heart kicked into overtime. \u201cA false tip. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone at headquarters will be shocked when protesters storm the doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will allow Kyrin entrance. And when the sea of reporters burst inside, every exit will be sealed, trapping everyone inside.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon nodded. \u201cThink we should tell Jack and the others what\u2019s going on? They\u2019ll be able to give us more cover, and we\u2019ll have a better chance of capturing our guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pinched the bridge of my nose. \u201cI\u2019m not taking a chance on a trigger-happy agent who doesn\u2019t care if Kyrin lives or dies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll make the call at eleven tomorrow night and say Lilla\u2019s being executed at midnight. That\u2019ll give the press one hour to spread the word, yet won\u2019t give Jack enough time to deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. If he somehow finds out what we\u2019ve done, though, I\u2019m taking full responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to cover for me. I\u2019ll take the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. No.\u201d I gave him my grittiest won\u2019t-take-no-for-an-answer glare, which he of course ignored. The male ego was not going to make me change my mind. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go down. I asked you to help me, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d The lines around his mouth firmed. \u201cDallas is my friend too. Now, do you want my help or not?\u201d</p><p>I paused. \u201cFine. If we\u2019re caught, I\u2019ll tattle on you like a whiny girl. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He grinned. \u201cReal good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home, get some rest,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it. I\u2019ll meet you here for dinner at seven.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I should have taken my own advice and gone home to rest. I didn\u2019t want to sleep, though, didn\u2019t want to dream. I ended up making the twenty-minute drive to Kilmer, Peterman, and Nate Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>I spent two hours inside, questioning employee after employee\u2014but it was wasted time. Mostly they confirmed what I already knew. That several of the abducted men had voluntarily submitted sperm samples for payment. That Rianne had worked here.</p><p>The only new piece of information I received was that each male donor had had a very healthy sperm count.</p><p>I was feeling frustrated\u2014until I stepped outside. A wave of familiar energy hit me square in the chest. I froze. Heart hammering against my rib cage, I darted my gaze in every direction, searching for Kyrin. And then I found him. He stood off to the side, his back to me. He was facing a young, dark-haired couple.</p><p>Damn, I loved this new energy-sensing gift of mine.</p><p>I slowly reached for my new pyre-gun and moved toward the group. I held the weapon at my side, not wanting the couple to see it and give Kyrin warning.</p><p>\u201cDo not come here again,\u201d I heard Kyrin tell the couple. \u201cDo not let your names be entered into their database. People in that database are dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, ET,\u201d the guy said. \u201cSomething like that would be all over the news. Now, for the last time, get out of my way.\u201d He dragged the pale-faced female along as he pushed past Kyrin and strode into the building.</p><p>I waited until they passed me before taking aim, yet Kyrin\u2019s words echoed in my mind, giving me pause. Do not come here again. Do not come here again. He\u2019d risked implicating himself by coming here. He\u2019d tried to warn potential victims away. Neither was something a bad guy would do.</p><p>That knowledge almost kept me from squeezing the trigger. Almost.</p><p>I had lucked out by finding him so quickly and unexpectedly, and I wouldn\u2019t spit in the face of that luck. I was going to stun him, take what blood I needed, then lock him up and question him.</p><p>Zeroed in on him, I squeezed the trigger.</p><p>Nothing happened. My mouth dropped open, and I squeezed again. And again. And again. Still nothing. Frustrated and growing more furious by the second, I glanced at the weapon. The crystal had somehow been knocked out of range. Shit. Shit! Had I tested the damn thing before I signed it out of A.I.R.? No, goddamn it, I realized. I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Kyrin\u2019s shoulders stiffened. He spun around, giving me a glimpse of tense features and haunting shadows under his eyes. \u201cMia.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t panic. I kept my weapon steady. He didn\u2019t know my new gun wasn\u2019t working properly. I\u2019d use it to keep him docile, then find some other way to knock him out. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d I said, holding my ground. \u201cWe\u2019ve got unfinished business.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply, but a blue beam of pyre-fire suddenly lit a path just behind him\u2014and it wasn\u2019t mine\u2014silencing his words. Someone screamed. Footsteps pounded. I caught a glimpse of a lithe, white-haired female as Kyrin shouted, \u201cGet down!\u201d and jolted forward, slamming into me and knocking me down.</p><p>The moment we hit, I lost my breath, and sharp rocks dug into my back. Kyrin rolled off me and crouched to his knees. I followed suit, and we scrambled to a car, using it as a shield as another beam flew at us.</p><p>Kyrin peeked over the hood. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>I set my gun to kill and prayed that setting would work. He ducked as another beam shot past him, hitting the ground just beyond his feet. Dirt and gravel spewed in every direction.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me why that woman\u2019s trying to kill you?\u201d I said, rising slightly and firing. Click. Click. \u201cDamn it,\u201d I cursed as I sank down. The gun wouldn\u2019t work on kill either.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she doesn\u2019t like that I wish to atone for past sins.\u201d</p><p>I slid my old kill-only gun from my ankle holster, popped up, and fired. I hit a dark blue vehicle and shattered the front window. \u201cYeah, what kind of past sins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bad kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sarcasm sucks.\u201d I flicked him a glance, but he kept his profile to me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let her hurt you. If anyone gets your blood, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suddenly feel warm and giddy inside.\u201d His tone was as dry as the air. \u201cAre you trying to make me fall in love with you?\u201d</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>He removed a pyre-gun from the waist of his pants. My old gun, I noticed.</p><p>\u201cHow appropriate,\u201d I said.</p><p>He grinned, kissed the barrel with a mocking wink, lifted it, and fired over the car. \u201cWho would have thought Mia Snow would be working with me instead of against me?\u201d A fourth shot whizzed past him, this one nearly singeing his shoulder.</p><p>Just then, I felt something...swirl inside me. Tingling inside my veins, pulsing through my entire body. I don\u2019t know what it was, or what caused it. I blinked in confusion. As I watched with wide eyes, the world around me began to slow down.</p><p>A fly entered my line of vision, its wings moving so leisurely I could see every flutter, see even the ripple of air. I had to be hallucinating, but...Frowning, I reached out and plucked the insect from the air. No, no hallucination. I could feel him. What the hell was happening to me?</p><p>Three more shots soared over our car, and as I released the fly, I watched the fire meander toward Kyrin, watched him leap out of the way, moving inch by inch. I watched that fire slam into the ground behind us. I could have danced around those rays, they moved so slowly.</p><p>\u201cFire, Mia,\u201d he shouted, the sound deep, almost distorted, and as slow as his motions.</p><p>I popped up, my every action fast. Too fast. My gaze blazed over the parking lot. The shooter was in mid-duck, her white hair floating above her head, her delicate features fixed in place. She moved like Kyrin, by gradual degrees. I took in her lavender eyes, which were radiating intense fury, her dainty nose, and her startling familiar high cheekbones. I\u2019d seen her before. I knew I had, I just didn\u2019t know where.</p><p>And then, just as suddenly as the odd swirl had hit me, it abandoned me. The tingling abandoned my veins, the pulsing left my body. Everything leaped into high gear, and for a split second, my gaze locked with the female Arcadian\u2019s and surprise darkened her face before she disappeared behind the car.</p><p>Gasping, I hunched down and eyed Kyrin. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>He was watching me with a strange, unreadable expression. I shook my head, suddenly tired, hoping an explanation for what just happened would slide into place. Nope, didn\u2019t work. Then another blast soared past us, claiming my attention. \u201cDo you know that woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlanna en Arr.\u201d</p><p>Atlanna. The hairs on the back of my neck rose, and I grinned, pushing the weird slowdown thing out of my mind. I loved when suspects made my job easy.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on that woman.</p><p>She could have waited until Kyrin left this area and tried to kill him in private, where there was less chance of capture. But no, she did it here, an action that screamed \u201cLook at me, look what I can do.\u201d That type of behavior fit the profile of Steele\u2019s killer. Perfectly.</p><p>I was going to have to trust Kyrin right now if I hoped to get close to Atlanna, and while that knowledge didn\u2019t settle well inside me, I knew I had no other choice. \u201cShe was behind the green Lexis, six cars away, straight down the middle, but she\u2019s probably running now. You go left. I\u2019ll go right. Let\u2019s find the bitch.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for his reply, didn\u2019t wait to see if he followed orders. I jolted into motion. Gravel cut past my pants and into my knees, and I wished to God I could rise up and walk, but I had to stay low. Atlanna might have come to kill Kyrin, but I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have minded getting rid of me, too.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I heard Kyrin curse. \u201cI found her.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and rounded a van as quickly as my feet would carry me, gun aimed straight in front of me. The female was running, and Kyrin was reaching out. He latched onto the long strands of her hair, but they pulled free without slowing her.</p><p>Then she disappeared completely.</p><p>I stopped and blinked, staring at the empty air where she\u2019d been. She\u2019d gotten away. She\u2019d fucking gotten away. \u201cHow the hell did she disappear like that?\u201d</p><p>He released the strands of white hair, and they floated away on the breeze. His hands dropped to his sides. \u201cShe\u2019s been practicing her molecular transportation, is my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not poss\u2014\u201d I cut my words off. More and more I was learning that I didn\u2019t really know shit about these aliens. I searched the parking lot for any sign of her and scowled. She really had transported herself away. I cursed under my breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Kyrin said, \u201cand Atlanna hates pain, so I\u2019m surprised she did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where she went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I would be here if I did?\u201d</p><p>Damn it! \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going home a failure.\u201d I returned my gaze to Kyrin. I\u2019d missed a perfect opportunity to catch Atlanna, but I wouldn\u2019t miss this opportunity to catch him. \u201cJust stay where you are, and I won\u2019t have to hurt you.\u201d I aimed my gun at his heart, very aware the weapon did not possess stun capacity. Easy on the trigger, I mentally chanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A part of me hated to do this. We\u2019d just worked as a team. He\u2019d just helped me.</p><p>But it had to be done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you two choices, Kyrin. You can willingly go to the hospital to help Dallas, then the station house, where you\u2019ll answer my questions. You\u2019ve got a lot of explaining to do. Or I can shoot you here and now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to shoot me. You need me alive.\u201d</p><p>I lowered the barrel to his leg. \u201cThen I\u2019ll simply incapacitate you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a languid grin. \u201cAs if a puny wound to the leg would even slow me. You\u2019ve seen how quickly I heal. And do you really want to waste my blood?\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward me.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are,\u201d I shouted. I didn\u2019t fire. Damn him, he was right. I wouldn\u2019t shoot him. Why had I even threatened?</p> <p>Slowly and leisurely, he closed the rest of the distance between us, and I let him come. Yes, I lowered my weapon and let him come. He stood in front of me for several seconds\u2014an eternity, perhaps\u2014without touching me. My breath became ragged as his energy surrounded me; my skin heated. I licked my lips. I knew what he planned to do. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d I growled. \u201cDo it. I can\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to stop me.\u201d His arms wound around me, and his mouth remained a whisper away. \u201cThank you for your help,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I replied grudgingly.</p><p>His lips crushed mine, and his tongue swept inside my mouth. Our teeth scraped together with the force of his invasion. I welcomed him completely. I hated myself, but welcome him I did. As he\u2019d walked toward me, need had grown inside me. Strong and hot\u2014undeniable. He tasted of heat and passion. I pressed more deeply into him.</p><p>But I forced my hands to stay at my sides. I might enjoy his kiss, might crave it, but I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to participate any more than I already was. Remaining still was the hardest thing I\u2019d ever done. I hated him. I liked him. Hated. Liked.</p><p>He tore his mouth away and we stared at each other. \u201cYou risked your life, staying with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I did. For my reward I want you to tell me everything you know about Atlanna.\u201d The words emerged breathlessly, I was ashamed to realize.</p><p>\u201cYou taste better than I dreamed, Tai la Mar.\u201d Kyrin trailed feather-light kisses around my jaw. \u201cUntil next time.\u201d</p><p>He, too, vanished.</p><p>I stood in shocked silence, trying to catch my breath and staring at the empty space where he\u2019d been. I traced a finger over my lips and frowned. Obviously, he could transfer molecularly like Atlanna. The bastard. So why had he stayed at all? He could have left this scene anytime. Had he been trying to protect me?</p><p>I holstered my gun and shook my head. Would I ever understand these aliens?</p><p>The blare of sirens registered in my ears, and I sighed. I\u2019d be here a while, explaining to New Chicago PD what had happened. Shit.</p><p>I didn\u2019t allow myself to think about losing Atlanna or kissing and losing Kyrin as I drove home hours later. I didn\u2019t allow myself to think about the strange...thing that had come over me and slowed down the world around me for those brief seconds. Thinking about it brought fear, waves and waves of fear because that kind of ability was unnatural.</p><p>Fear made a person weak. Made her lose focus.</p> <p>I trudged inside my apartment and checked my messages. There were six from my dad.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked in the first message. His voice was pleasant, almost like I remember it being when I\u2019d been a little girl.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you here?\u201d he said in the second.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you treat family?\u201d he said in the third.</p><p>Pushing a series of buttons on the wall, I skipped the other messages, yet I couldn\u2019t halt the deep pangs of regret already working their way through me. I shouldn\u2019t care what he thought about me. He was an old, pathetic man, and I was a grown woman. I\u2019d been on my own since the age of sixteen.</p><p>A small part of me, however, a part I despised, desperately craved his approval. Always had. I wanted the kind of approval he\u2019d given Kane. The kind of approval he might have given Dare, if my brother had survived. The kind of approval I\u2019d once had from him, but lost for some reason I\u2019d never understood.</p><p>He liked to toss me a bone every now and then when I killed an other-worlder, but that was about it. Even then I only received a weak smile and an unemotional, \u201cYou did okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your head examined, Mia,\u201d I muttered to myself as I picked up the earpiece. \u201cDad,\u201d I told the speaker and listened as the systematic ringing began.</p><p>My stomach churned with dread as I placed the small, fitted receptor in my ear. I could face a group of treacherous aliens and smile. Sometimes I even anticipated a fight. But I could not face my father without becoming a little girl again: nervous, desperate. Sad.</p><p>On the seventh ring, he barked a gruff hello.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. It\u2019s me.\u201d I winced at the neediness in my tone.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d he asked, his unemotional self.</p><p>\u201cI had an emergency at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disrespected your brother by not attending his memorial. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m trying to hunt down an alien serial killer.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cAny leads?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t discuss the case with him, so I said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have nothing left to talk about, do we?\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, the connection severed, and the dial tone buzzed in my ear. I held the small black earpiece in front of me for a prolonged, silent moment, blinking down at it. I shrugged off my hurt. Overall, not a bad conversation. He\u2019d taken it better than I could have hoped. Pushing out a breath, I replaced the receptor back on its wall hook.</p><p>I padded a perfectly straight course to the kitchen. No obstacles slowed my progress. Instead of a couch, I had a desk in the middle of my living room, cluttered high with papers and books. And in the far left corner perched a small screen, always displaying the local news. Two barstools and a snack bar in the kitchen completed the ensemble. All brown, all bland.</p><p>And that was the extent of my furnishings.</p><p>I was rarely here, and besides, the only thing I did here was sleep and work, so why spend the time and money required to make the place cozy? This modest one-bedroom apartment had never felt like home, anyway\u2014as if I even knew what home felt like. I\u2019d never belonged as a young girl, had always been an outsider.</p><p>I readied my coffeemaker and set the automatic timer for three hours from now. I\u2019d have a beer, catch some sleep, and when I awoke the coffee would be hot and waiting for me. I opened my fridge, and a list of needed groceries instantly printed from the side.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know,\u201d I muttered. I hadn\u2019t had time to shop in a while. Yawning, I reached for a beer\u2014but it slid across the distance and came to me instead.</p><p>Startled, I let go, and the glass shattered on the ground. I blinked down at the broken shards, liquid swimming in every direction. What the hell? First the slowdown at the shootout, and now this.</p><p>No, no. This had not just happened. I\u2019d imagined it. I was tired, that was all. The bottle had not come to me. I hurriedly cleaned up the mess, not allowing myself to think about it anymore, and strode into my bedroom.</p><p>A vivid sapphire and emerald comforter topped the bed, and a three-tiered bureau was pushed against the north wall. The comforter was my only splurge. I stripped to my panties and fell onto the mattress.</p><p>When sleep claimed me, so did my dreams.</p><p>One moment my mind\u2019s eye saw nothing; the next I saw a brilliant kaleidoscope of images. A woman\u2019s face flashed before me\u2014my face, I realized seconds later, though my hair continually changed colors. Red, white, yellow, brown. I was like a chameleon, and I didn\u2019t understand the reason for the changes. Each time I almost grasped the answer, my ever-changing image floated away.</p><p>Then I saw my hero, Dare. His arms were outstretched as I ran to him for a hug. I was only six years old. He was ten. He caught me in his arms, and we both uttered carefree giggles as we toppled onto a cushion of bright green summer leaves. On impact, they propelled high in the air, then floated down around us, a multitude of colors.</p><p>\u201cI love you, goose,\u201d he said in that nurturing voice of his.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Dare.\u201d Anticipatory and smiling, I wiggled from his embrace and pushed to my chubby legs. \u201cFind me, Dare. Find me.\u201d My laughter trailing behind me, I raced into the nearby woods.</p><p>Though we\u2019d played hide-and-seek a thousand times before, I always hid behind our towering oak, which boasted swaying branches and chirping birds.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder as he skipped after me. He had just about reached me, had just about shouted, \u201cGotcha!\u201d when the leaves scattered, disappeared, and my dream shifted. I was suddenly fifteen years old and being dragged down a dark stairwell, then a dirty hallway, by my dad. I was crying, screaming, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this, Daddy. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to learn respect, Mia.\u201d His features remained indifferent as he jerked open the basement door and shoved me into the dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the only way to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me one day.\u201d He slammed the door, cutting off all light. The click of the lock resounded in my ears.</p><p>So cold.So dark. Both consumed me almost instantly, and my chest suddenly felt too tight. I couldn\u2019t draw in a breath. My heart was pounding frantically, near bursting from the strain. \u201cI\u2019ll be good,\u201d I cried to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be so good.\u201d</p><p>I sank to my knees, the cold wall at my back. Tears froze on my cheeks, and the stale, dusty air stung my nostrils. I wished my mom were here, or Dare, but they were both gone. They\u2019d both abandoned me, though in different ways. Right now my only companion was a single rickety chair, visible for the few seconds the door had remained open. I was going to die here, my mind screamed; the darkness was going to swallow me whole.</p><p>As my body shook with terror, the room\u2019s only exit suddenly twisted, and my dream shifted again.</p><p>In the next instant, I was sixteen and holding an overnight bag. I stood over Dare\u2019s grave. The moon was high, the air warm. Fireflies flickered overhead, and crickets sang a chorus of hosannas around the headstone. Colorful faux flowers bloomed all around my feet, in direct contrast to my mood.</p><p>\u201cI will avenge your death, Dare,\u201d I vowed. \u201cI\u2019ll avenge your death and make Dad proud. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I slowly cracked open my eyes, only to realize I was panting, sucking in breath after breath as if I couldn\u2019t get enough oxygen. Sweat soaked my body, causing the blankets to stick to my skin.</p><p>Dreams usually had that effect on me, and I hated it.</p><p>With a conscious effort, I forced my breathing to slow and my bones to relax. I cast a glance at my wall clock. The numbers flashed 5:39 P.M. I had time to clean up and do a little research before my dinner with Jaxon.</p><p>I lumbered from the bed and only tripped twice on my way to the bathroom. I brushed my teeth, showered, the dry spray doing nothing to wake me.</p><p>When I emerged, the scent of freshly brewed synthetic coffee filled my nostrils, strong and intense. I donned the same type of clothing as yesterday\u2014well-fitted black slacks, black button-up shirt, boots, and a black leather jacket. My pants possessed a Velcro strip down the outer seam, allowing easy access to the weapons strapped to my thighs. Of course, I also had guns and knives strategically tethered to the rest of my body.</p><p>I twisted my hair in a ponytail, frowned when several locks slipped free, then retied the band with a scowl. Sometimes I yearned to hack off every freaking strand, but I always stopped myself before actually applying the scissors. It was the one feminine aspect of my life, and I just didn\u2019t want to give it up.</p><p>Dressed now, I trod into the kitchen and quickly drained two mugs of coffee. I poured myself a third cup and carried the steaming liquid to my desk. I logged onto my computer by voice recognition and fingerprint ID. Mandalay had mentioned that neither Kyrin nor Atlanna were in a database, but I checked again anyway.</p><p>When I typed in Atlanna\u2019s name, information about the lost city of Atlantis filled the screen instead. Atlanna\u2019s namesake, perhaps? I scrolled, found the most intriguing articles, and uttered a single command: \u201cPrint.\u201d</p><p>Holding the papers in my hand, I read, \u201cAt the beginning of history, Zeus, the god of gods, granted his brother, Poseidon, the city of Atlantis. This island lay outside the pillars of Hercules, a meeting point of all the worlds\u2019 oceans. For many generations, Atlanteans flourished in wisdom and riches, and the lands overflowed with food and wine. Yet these great warriors and scientists did not remain content with what they had, and greed soon grew in their hearts. They began to invade other lands, hoping to enslave foreign citizens. War reigned supreme. Zeus was angered by the constant battling, and rightly blamed the Alanteans. He hurled a great lightning bolt from the sky into the heart of the city. The land rumbled and shook, and in minutes, the ocean swallowed every rock, hollow, and denizen.\u201d</p><p>Brow furrowed, I placed the article beside my coffee mug and frowned. Was Atlanna like these Atlanteans? Was she greedy for slaves? If so, where did the babies come in? Did she want to raise them and make her own army?</p><p>That sounded so far-fetched.</p><p>To sell them, perhaps? I sat up straighter. Now that made sense.</p><p>\u201cFertility,\u201d I said to the computer, recalling that that had been a common thread in all of the cases. Seconds later, several sites popped onscreen. I printed each page and discovered that Rianne Harte, the lab tech, had been trying to gain government support for fertility drugs to help increase the number of children alien women could bear. Alien women, not human. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was interesting, but it didn\u2019t help my case. I was dealing with human men, which meant Atlanna had to breed them with human women. Our scientists had tried splicing alien and human DNA to create halflings, but it simply couldn\u2019t be done. Something about the different cell types being foreign and trying to kill each other.</p><p>I read the rest of Harte\u2019s article and stilled when I came across the name A. en Arr, who was helping fund the research. A. en Arr. Atlanna en Arr. So, she wanted her aliens to be able to have more babies. So what did she need with the human men? They couldn\u2019t help her with that.</p><p>I typed my notes and thoughts into a new base titled \u201cFertility Murders and Abductions.\u201d I worked for the next half hour, relieved that I had one answer, at least. Without a doubt, Atlanna was the killer.</p> <p>When I finished, I muttered, \u201cSave and close,\u201d and my computer shut down. I stood. It was time to meet Jaxon for dinner. I could barely wait to tell him what I\u2019d learned.</p><p>Just then my phone unit erupted in a high-pitched wail. My dad, was my guess, so I purposely didn\u2019t answer as I gathered the rest of my guns and knives. I didn\u2019t have time to deal with him. A few moments later, my cell unit erupted in a series of beeps. Caller ID revealed the station house.</p><p>I immediately answered.</p><p>\u201cWe found Rianne Harte,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the middle of the crime scene, cataloging the details. Unlike William Steele, Rianne Harte had not been posed to look seductive. She\u2019d been posed to look brutalized. Of course, she had been brutalized. Her eyes were still wide with terror; she lay inside a coffin, her legs and arms painfully akimbo.</p> <p>We had the casket completely open, giving us an unobstructed view inside. Naked as she was, I was able to catalog the welts, scratches, bite marks, and bruises that marred her entire body. The hair atop her head had been hacked off completely. Her nails were ragged and broken.</p><p>She was barely recognizable as the smiling woman I\u2019d seen in ID photos, yet a blood sample had revealed this was indeed Miss Harte. She\u2019d been locked inside the stifling black coffin with some sort of snake or lizard, only it was bright red and obviously not from this planet. Mandalay had found her here in Whore\u2019s Corner, in the same woods we\u2019d discovered Steele.</p><p>\u201cDamn shame,\u201d Mandalay muttered before striding to her car.</p><p>\u201cLilla couldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d Jaxon said beside me. His voice carried on the winter breeze. He stared down at the body, shaking his head. \u201cNot enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. She had plenty of time. This body isn\u2019t fresh, and Lilla hasn\u2019t been in custody long. To be honest, though,\u201d I added, \u201cI don\u2019t think she did it. Again, this crime is too methodical. Too precise. Every detail complete.\u201d</p><p>I paused as a thought occurred to me. \u201cWas Harte, or is she, pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I called to one of the agents nearby. \u201cDo a pregnancy test on her blood, pronto.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, I discovered she was not and had not been pregnant recently.</p><p>\u201cGhost found two strands of hair,\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cArcadian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were located on the same branch as before. It\u2019s highly doubtful the killer would snag their hair twice in the same spot. Either they were planted and we\u2019re on the wrong path, or the killer is taunting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being taunted.\u201d Yes, Atlanna was taunting us. I told him what I\u2019d found out about fertility, Harte, and the deadly Atlanna. \u201cShe\u2019s cocky as hell and assured of success. That much we already knew. But why not pose Harte as prettily as she posed Steele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be we\u2019re getting too close to the truth, and we\u2019re pissing her off. Could be Harte betrayed her. Or could be Steele was a gift to us, but Harte is a warning.\u201d</p> <p>All of those made sense. Atlanna had seen me in the parking lot. I\u2019d shot at her, tried to catch her. That had to have pissed her off. \u201cOnly one way to find out for sure,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBy catching our gal,\u201d Jaxon finished for me.</p><p>I nodded. Easier said than done.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>When homicide arrived, Jaxon and I gathered our notes and vacated the scene. We had all the information we needed, anyway.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s visit Dallas,\u201d I told him. \u201cThen we\u2019ll do dinner and talk.\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen him in a while, and I suddenly needed to assure myself that he was okay, that he hadn\u2019t slipped closer to death.</p><p>Jaxon must have sensed my desperation, because he opened his mouth to protest, then snapped his lips closed. \u201cGood idea,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>He drove to County without another word. I rested my head on the back of my seat and emptied my mind. Minutes or perhaps hours later, we arrived, and I found myself striding down the twisted, bland hospital hallways. Visiting hours were over in ICU, but the staff was smart enough to let us pass.</p><p>While Jaxon waited in the corridor, I stepped into Dallas\u2019s room, drew in a cleansing breath, and perched myself at his beside. I read his chart. His condition was still considered stable, though there had been no new improvement. I held his cold, limp hand. His complexion had faded slightly; his breathing was not as strong as before.</p><p>I fought back a wave of fear, wishing to God I could cling to life for him.</p><p>\u201cListen up,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to recover. Do you hear me? You\u2019re going to recover. I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d And I proceeded to tell him every detail. \u201cJaxon is going to help me. He doesn\u2019t have your flare for drama, but I think he\u2019ll provide some entertainment.\u201d</p><p>Once, Dallas actually squeezed my hand, as if he heard every word I uttered.</p><p>When I left, I felt revived, more willing to conquer the day\u2019s events.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d I asked Jaxon.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>I sped down the highway and parked at the front of Trollie\u2019s, in a no parking zone.</p><p>Jaxon and I ate a quick, silent meal, both lost in our own thoughts. I had the special, club sandwich, fries, and a bowl of steaming beef soup. Jaxon had wheat toast, plain chicken breast, and a large orange juice.</p><p>\u201cHow do you survive on so little?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cBy eating more meals than the average person.\u201d When he finished, he wadded up his napkin and tossed the crinkled paper onto the tabletop. \u201cSomething you should consider.\u201d</p><p>The time for relaxation had ended.</p><p>A hard gleam entered Jaxon\u2019s eyes, and I knew the same gleam was reflected in mine. Time for business. I leaned back in my seat. \u201cThe most important thing is to find Atlanna, but we have no leads on her. There are two people who seem to know the most about her\u2014Kyrin and Lilla. Lilla\u2019s in lockup, and I\u2019ll question her again, but we need Kyrin too. We can play them off each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have any hope of catching him, we need to talk with Lilla\u2019s boyfriend, St. John, ASAP,\u201d he said. \u201cGet our ball moving, so to speak, for the big event.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes. The fake execution. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, I found myself standing inside St. John\u2019s office.</p><p>This was nothing like the sparsely decorated enclosure Lilla had occupied. Here, plush burgundy carpet layered the floor. The desk was composed of high-gloss Moroccan wood, expensive and rare. The chairs were padded with altar cloth and mated with matching, perfectly rounded footrests. Murals of cavorting, naked religious figures covered the walls, their mocking expressions so richly detailed that they almost appeared alive.</p><p>St. John was seated behind the desk, his freckled face cold and hard. His fingers were laced in front of him. At least he was dressed, and his hands weren\u2019t filled with breasts. I noticed he didn\u2019t ask us to take a seat. I didn\u2019t want to anyway.</p><p>A tall, muscular Ell-Rollis, though it wasn\u2019t Bob, I noticed, stepped inside the room. He was wearing a shiny purple suit. \u201cYou okay, boss?\u201d he asked, eyeing us like we were ice cold mugs of water and he\u2019d been trapped in the desert for at least a year.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d St. John said. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>The other-worlder gave a quick nod, turned, and snapped the double French doors shut behind him.</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest and waited.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know my lawyers are working diligently on Lilla\u2019s case,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cShe\u2019ll be released before you can snap your fingers.\u201d</p><p>Just for the hell of it, I snapped my fingers, then glanced over each of my shoulders. \u201cThink she\u2019s been released?\u201d</p><p>Beside me, Jaxon grinned.</p><p>St. John\u2019s nostrils flared, and he leapt to his feet. His chair skidded behind him, blending with the sound of his hissing breath. I heard the tick, tock of the wall clock as St. John glared at me with hatred in his eyes, but he visibly reined in his temper. He eased back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Agent Snow?\u201d he asked, his tone all that was polite, though I caught a hint of fury in the undercurrents.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing February second between the hours of nine and twelve P.M.?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He laughed with genuine amusement, completely abandoning his anger for the moment. He even lifted a cigar from a small humidor on the corner of his desktop and ran the length through his fingers, practically daring me to arrest him for the illegal possession. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to implicate me in this murder.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><p>Still grinning, he shrugged. \u201cI was here, working. A thousand people can verify that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t at the murder scene,\u201d I said, unfolding my arms and planting my fists near the weapons strapped to my waist. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t involved in the actual killing.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, in the space of a heartbeat, he lost his good humor. He bared his teeth in a scowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were jealous of Steele, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I ignored his reply. \u201cWhat\u2019s the cost to make a hit these days? One thousand? Two? That\u2019s pocket change to you.\u201d</p><p>Silence thickened the air.</p><p>Then, \u201cYour desperation is showing, Agent Snow,\u201d St. John stated quietly, menacingly. \u201cI\u2019m not involved.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a slow, smug smile. I really liked this part of my job. \u201cMaybe. Maybe not. I think it might be fun to try and prove you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d His eyes glowed with menacing fire. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to push me. I have many, many influential friends.\u201d</p><p>I rested my foot on the edge of the closest chair and swept back my coat to display my gun. I hadn\u2019t yet had time to replace my pyre-gun, and this one was set to kill. \u201cWell, I have a temper, Mr. St. John, and I don\u2019t always follow the rules. I highly doubt you want to push me.\u201d</p><p>When he caught my meaning, he paled. His fingers were shaky as he reached for his phone unit to punch for security.</p><p>Jaxon stopped him with a quickly uttered, \u201cI think you\u2019ve gotten the wrong idea here, Mr. St. John.\u201d He kept his tone affable. \u201cWe know you\u2019re not responsible for Steele\u2019s death. It\u2019s simply standard procedure to question everyone familiar with him.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s finger stilled over the button, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cIs it standard procedure to accuse and intimidate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cI apologize if we\u2019ve offended you.\u201d</p><p>My lips pressed tightly together, preventing me from shouting obscenities. I refused to apologize to this dirty little weasel, but I wasn\u2019t going to undermine Jaxon\u2019s efforts either.</p><p>St. John gave his blue silk lapels a tug, his expression somewhat mollified. \u201cI\u2019m certainly glad someone isn\u2019t blind to the truth. Now, if you\u2019re done with your questions, you may see yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, like I\u2019d leave that easily.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m suspending Ecstasy\u2019s license of operation until further notice. Not only do you have illegal substances in plain view, you were harboring a predatory alien, and charges could be brought against you.\u201d Watching him, I sauntered to his desk, leaned over, and straightened his tie. \u201cThink about that while you decide if there\u2019s any more information you have for us.\u201d</p><p>In a seething explosion of fury, he once again jolted to his feet. \u201cWho do you think you are? You can\u2019t suspend me. You have no right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have every right.\u201d I waved my index finger in a sugary-sweet good-bye. \u201cHave a nice day, Mr. St. John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>I closed the office door with a snap and smiled up at Jaxon. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say we got his attention. Call your contacts at every media outlet in the area. I\u2019m ready to deal with Kyrin.\u201d</p><p>He held my gaze, nodded. \u201cThank God you\u2019re not my enemy,\u201d he said with a slow grin.</p><p>11:43P . M .</p><p>Our plan began perfectly.</p><p>I\u2019d almost panicked the moment I pictured Kyrin molecularly transporting himself and his sister out of the building. I calmed down, however, when I realized that wasn\u2019t something he could do.</p><p>He would have done so already.</p><p>My guess was he couldn\u2019t transport inside a building. Still, I wasn\u2019t taking any chances; I planned to erect a force field at the proper time. That could hold anything.</p><p>I\u2019d spent the last hour interrogating Lilla again and got nowhere. Afterward, I had replaced my defunct pyre-gun with one that actually worked, and now I sat in Jack\u2019s office with Jaxon. Waiting. Pretending to listen to my boss as he instructed me on the night\u2019s mission. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then, thankfully, it happened.</p><p>Tumultuous and chanting, press and protesters stormed into A.I.R. headquarters, their signs bobbing up and down like dinghies in a tidal wave. Thankfully, checkpoint guards and unsuspecting hunters\u2014who were prepared for almost anything\u2014loitered in the lobby and were able to halt any civilian progress into the actual offices or cells. Inside A.I.R.\u2019s white walls, the boisterous crowd was a sea of colors and shapes, like a misshapen rainbow that had fallen from the sky.</p><p>Jack halted mid-sentence when the call came in. \u201cPagosa,\u201d he barked into the phone. His eyes went wide, and his lips dipped into a scowl. \u201cWhat the hell do they have to protest about?\u201d</p> <p>This was it, I thought, flicking Jaxon a glance. Our gaze locked for a split second before we faced Jack and waited.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right there,\u201d Jack said, slamming the phone in its unit and blinking over at us with unparalleled shock. His cheeks beamed bright red. \u201cWe\u2019ve been invaded,\u201d he gasped out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jaxon said in mock surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d I asked. God, I needed an award.</p><p>He gave us a brief, \u201cI have no idea. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>We jumped to our feet and rushed into the hallway, weapons drawn. The alarm suddenly screeched at high volume, blending with the constant wail of code blue. Red lights buzzed on the walls.</p><p>Before we even reached the lobby, a chant of \u201cKill hunters, not aliens\u201d rang in my ears. My fingers tightened on my gun as a wave of anger hit me. These people needed a good dose of reality. Kill hunters? Please. They saw only the good aliens, the ones who now worked steady jobs and lived in their pristine neighborhoods. They didn\u2019t see the evil ones, the ones who enjoyed mutilating humans, beating and raping them. They didn\u2019t know some aliens could control their thoughts, change the weather, and transport into their homes undetected.</p><p>If they did, they\u2019d get down on their knees and thank us for what we did. But we never told them what could happen. Panic would spread, and our government preferred not to have panic. They\u2019d rather have ignorance.</p><p>We reached our destination. People paced every square inch of space; signs waved in every direction. \u201cSave Lilla,\u201d they all proclaimed. We pushed through the throng. I fought another crest of anger and forced myself to think only of the matter at hand: Kyrin.</p><p>\u201cHow did the goddamn press get the idea we were executing Lilla tonight?\u201d Jack demanded over the noise.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d I said, dragging in a breath and scanning the crowd for Kyrin\u2019s tall, handsome form.</p> <p>\u201cThe damn bastard who told that lie needs to be kicked into next week,\u201d Jaxon said.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched as I continued to gaze around, but a scowl quickly followed the action. Damn it. Where the hell was Kyrin?</p><p>Had he recruited someone else to come here in his stead? Someone we wouldn\u2019t recognize? Maybe, I thought, then shook my head. No. I\u2019d only been in his presence a short while, but I knew he possessed a hero\u2019s mentality. He would want to save his sister himself. As arrogant as he was, he wouldn\u2019t trust someone else to see to the job.</p><p>He\u2019ll be here, I assured myself. All I had to do was wait. When he entered the room, I would know it. I would feel his vibrations, just as I felt him when he\u2019d entered Dallas\u2019s hospital room. Just as I\u2019d felt the hum of his energy in the alleyway, and when we\u2019d worked together against Atlanna\u2014and when we kissed.</p><p>The memories made me shiver. So many emotions skittered through my mind. Anticipation. Dread. Uncertainty.</p><p>Desire.</p><p>As if I\u2019d conjured him, a spark of awareness pricked and sizzled along my nerve endings. Soon after, the sweet scent of Onadyn filled my nostrils. Every muscle in my body tensed. My shoulders straightened, and I went on instant alert.</p> <p>He was here.</p><p>I reached in my pocket and withdrew a small black box. On the inside was a single button. I pressed it, knowing a force field was erected outside.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone past these doors,\u201d Jack commanded me. \u201cI\u2019m calling in reinforcements.\u201d With that, he stormed away.</p><p>I leveled a glance at Jaxon and mouthed, \u201cKyrin\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>He, too, straightened. \u201cWhere? Do you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I will.\u201d I shoved my way through the crowd and waltzed upstairs, checking twice to make sure I wasn\u2019t followed. I endured an ID scan, then stepped into the main observation room. Two guards were seated in front of monitors, eyeing me warily. \u201cShut off the alarm, lock every door to every room, then broadcast me all over the building.\u201d</p><p>The guards glanced up at me in surprise. We\u2019d trained for a hypothetical situation requiring a lockdown, but this was the first practical application.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I barked.</p><p>One of the men pushed a series of buttons. \u201cDoors locked and systems ready for broadcast,\u201d he said.</p><p>Speaking into a mouthpiece, I said, \u201cAgents, arrest every citizen present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese protesters are humans,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest them unless they aid an alien in a crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an order,\u201d I snapped into the mouthpiece.</p><p>11:55P . M .</p><p>Waiting for the unknown was hell for someone like me. Impatient and anxious, tense and ready, I wanted this night over with, the victory mine.</p><p>Jaxon and I stood at the edge of the foyer, watching as hunters continued to round up and band each and every protester and reporter present. A few men and women raced to the doors in a futile attempt to escape. Others fought. But every damn one of them kept chanting, \u201cKill hunters, not aliens.\u201d Blah, blah, blah, that\u2019s what I heard.</p><p>The protesters outside the building were being arrested as well. They\u2019d thrown bricks at our metal-shielded windows and had tried to bust down our doors. And by God, they were going to pay for it.</p><p>Intermediately, the press launched questions at me. \u201cWhy are you murdering Lilla en Arr?\u201d \u201cHow many murders does this make for you? Two hundred? Three?\u201d \u201cDo you possess a heart, Agent Snow?\u201d \u201cHow are you able to sleep at night?\u201d</p><p>I ignored them all. Yeah, I\u2019d killed a lot of aliens over the years, and I wasn\u2019t sorry. I did what I had to do for human safety.</p><p>One of the reporters, who had yet to be banded, had his voice recorder pointed in my direction. \u201cSome have begun to call you and your men the Angels of Death. How does it feel to actually live up to your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d I said, then paused. Kyrin, too, had called me the Angel of Death. I had to wonder if this man had heard it from him. \u201cLock this one up separately from the others,\u201d I told one of the agents. \u201cI want to talk with him privately.\u201d</p><p>I stepped up onto the dais, straining to see Kyrin. I still felt his presence, but I had yet to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p>12:21P . M .</p><p>The crowd had been subdued, banded, and ushered into a straight line against the wall. I did a head count. There were over eighty men and women here.</p><p>Kyrin wasn\u2019t among them.</p><p>Where the hell was he? I shifted from one boot to the other. Had he fled? No, no. His energy still purred inside me. He was here; he had to be here.</p><p>I pinched the bridge of my nose. God, I was at a loss. I didn\u2019t know what to do next. I couldn\u2019t very well broadcast his name over the speaker and ask if he\u2019d like to meet me for coffee in sector twelve.</p><p>Then...the second alarm erupted at high volume, a staccato wail of disharmony. \u201cBreach in sector five,\u201d a computerized female voice calmly acknowledged. \u201cUnknown alien entry.\u201d</p><p>I froze. The blood drained from my head. Shit. Shit, shit, shit.</p><p>Somehow Kyrin had bypassed our defenses and actually made it into cell check-in.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d I shouted to the hunters trying to subdue the increasingly frightened protesters.</p><p>\u201cKeep them calm.\u201d</p><p>To Jaxon, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d We leapt into action. As we raced through the building, we remained side by side, our arms pumping in unison. The walls beside us became a white blur, an ever-constant sea of motion. A bead of sweat trickled between my shoulder blades, and the scent of fear rocked me.</p><p>The fear was my own.</p><p>Kyrin was smart. I knew that. There was also a distinct possibility that he was immortal. Yet even still, I doubted he was able to walk through metal-braced walls. So how had he slipped past security? How had he bypassed locks, motion detectors, fingerprint IDs, heat sensors, eye scanners, and weight-sensitive floor tiles? Molecular transportation? Then why not take Lilla and go?</p><p>If he actually rescued Lilla...</p><p>Only the bolts and eye scanners slowed Jaxon\u2019s and my progress. When we at last passed them, I quickened my step, flying past agents who diligently hastened toward sector five. I had to get there first.</p><p>\u201cIf he nabs Lilla,\u201d Jaxon said, putting voice to my fears, \u201cwe\u2019re in deep shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I know.\u201d</p><p>We reached our destination, the only entrance to the cells, and endured another retinal scan. The door buzzed consent, and we shoved our way inside...only to discover the thick metal entryway to the cells closed and secured, the cell guard asleep at his post. Asleep? With this noise? Not hardly.</p><p>Jaxon had the same idea and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>I checked the slumped man\u2019s pulse. Too rapid for restful slumber. Definitely not a natural sleep. Either drug-induced, or the man was under mind control.</p><p>\u201cKyrin\u2019s been here,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jaxon cursed under his breath.</p><p>A sense of foreboding swept through my veins. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d I muttered. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside and guard Lilla\u2019s door.\u201d</p><p>I reached out, just about to press my palm against the print scan to release the locks. Then I paused, hand suspended midair. My skin tingled. Another wave of foreboding, this one stronger, more intense, crashed inside me.</p><p>I needed to open the entrance, but...</p><p>Jaxon watched me expectantly.</p><p>Do it. Open the door echoed in my mind, the words spoken by that same rich male voice that always made me shiver with both dread and heat. Open the door.</p><p>I remained motionless. Was it possible...could Kyrin make himself invisible? Was he here, now, waiting for me to escort him inside?</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d Jaxon shouted over the alarm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? We need to guard Lilla. He might already be inside.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my hand back. \u201cHow could he have opened this door?\u201d</p><p>Jaxon shifted impatiently on his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter. We need to get inside. This conversation can wait.\u201d</p><p>No. No, it couldn\u2019t. A slight breeze caressed my neck, a breeze that held the subtle fragrance of Onadyn. I spun to my left. Saw nothing amiss. I spun to my right. Again, saw nothing amiss. Yet I knew, knew, Kyrin was inside this room with me.</p><p>\u201cMia, damn it,\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d He stepped forward, reaching out, waiting for me. We had to do the fingerprint scan together, or the door wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>Just before his palm hit the sensor, I closed the distance between us and grabbed his wrist. \u201cKyrin is inside this room. I don\u2019t know how, but he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He\u2019s not here. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way he could have opened this door. I think\u2014\u201d Another breeze, this one so close I felt a wave of heat brush my cheek. I didn\u2019t finish my sentence as I released Jaxon\u2019s hand and pivoted on my heel. I pressed my back against the cold steel door, dialed my weapon to stun, then pointed the barrel straight ahead.</p><p>Jaxon finally caught the truth of my words. Without another protest, he moved out of my way and stood beside me, his weapon trained, as well.</p><p>Open the door, Kyrin said, the words whispered next to my ear like a lover\u2019s entreaty. His voice was low, a menacing growl. Strangely, I wanted to obey, though I did not feel phantom fingers inside my mind trying to bend me to his will. The most feminine part of me simply wanted to help him.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d I asked Jaxon, keeping my eyes straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cThe alarm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe voice.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>I forced my ears to block the screech of the alarm and my head to block the seductive rhythm of Kyrin\u2019s timbre. I willed my breathing to slow and concentrated on the movement my physical senses could not detect.</p><p>Up ahead, a lightning swift rustle blurred my vision, and in that instant, a tingle of languid awareness rippled through me. Another blur, this one to the right. Then another, this one to the left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opening the door,\u201d I said to the air in front of me.</p><p>I felt Jaxon\u2019s silver gaze level on me.</p><p>Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Kyrin had already slipped past this door, and I was an idiot for not storming into the cells and stopping him. But I believed in trusting my instincts, and to do that, I was willing to take a chance.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how long the alarm blasts or what happens beyond this room,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not moving from this spot.\u201d</p><p>In the glass panel of the far entrance, I watched as Jack and several other agents sprinted toward the enclosure. Damn, I didn\u2019t need their interference right now.</p><p>I had to stop their progress. They might unintentionally\u2014or intentionally\u2014ruin everything I was struggling to do.</p><p>\u201cLock the entrance,\u201d I told Jaxon.</p><p>After only a slight hesitation, he darted across the small area and disabled the wires that allowed passage in and out. When Jack reached the portal, he hit the steel beams with a thud. I watched his mouth move swiftly in a stream of curses as he attempted to pry open the door with a solid kick, then with a punt of his shoulder. No luck. He shook a fist at us, his hand arcing wildly through the air in an attempt to wave me over and threaten at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gave one, swift shake of my head.</p><p>\u201cReveal yourself,\u201d I shouted to Kyrin.</p><p>He didn\u2019t, of course.</p> <p>\u201cStay alert,\u201d I told Jaxon. He didn\u2019t appreciate the warning, but I offered it anyway. He hadn\u2019t seen Kyrin slash a knife down one palm, hadn\u2019t seen the wound mysteriously close as if it had never existed. He hadn\u2019t seen the way Kyrin could move, so swiftly the human eye was unable to detect it. Hadn\u2019t felt his unnatural strength. \u201cKeep your pyre-gun on stun.\u201d</p><p>Jack disappeared for several long heartbeats, and when he returned, he and several other agents held a battering ram. How soon before they beat their way inside?</p><p>\u201cReveal yourself, Kyrin,\u201d I shouted again. \u201cI\u2019ll help you leave this place unscathed. Let\u2019s help each other, like we did before.\u201d</p><p>Again, he ignored me. I saw a hint of a shadow dancing close to me, then misting away before I could fire. How could he move like that? Frustration ate at me as I floundered to lock on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your only hope of escape,\u201d I said.</p> <p>A whoosh of air rippled. Before I could even react, Jaxon\u2019s features contorted in pain. He grunted, then collapsed onto the hard blue tile, his chest continuing to rise and fall as he drew in oxygen. Shocked, I stood frozen for a single tick of time, staring down at him.</p><p>In the next instant, my gun was swiped from my hand. I watched, horrified, as the firearm sailed through the air, only to thud next to the far wall. Fury acted as kindling in my blood, heating quickly and lethally, ready to explode.</p><p>I had managed a single step toward the wall when four feet in front of me, the air began to liquefy, becoming a dappled, upright pool of majestic azure. Mist swirled and curled like a dainty ribbon, prancing up to the ceiling. I blinked, only a sweep of my lashes, but when I refocused, Kyrin was there. Completely visible, a looming tower of danger. His scent wafted all around me, warm and exotic, with a hint of Onadyn thrown into the blend.</p><p>Black leather pants and a black shirt, much like the clothes of a hunter, hugged the thick muscles of his thighs and chest. His white hair fell loose about his shoulders, with two braids framed against his temples. War braids? I wondered. That only added to his appeal, the infuriating bastard.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d I demanded. Whatever he\u2019d done, he hadn\u2019t used his molecular transport ability. Had he?</p><p>His violet gaze pierced me with purposeful intent. \u201cDo you truly plan to kill her?\u201d</p> <p>I raised my chin a notch and remained closed-mouthed, refusing to answer. If I said yes, he might resent me for lying about her death in the first place. If I said no, I would lose any advantage I might have gained.</p><p>The alarm screeched to a halt; someone must have switched the code to silent. My ears continued to ring, and my gaze remained cinched on Kyrin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou know and I know that I need you alive,\u201d I said, tempering my voice to match the abrupt quiet, though all I wanted to do was scream. How could my plan have backfired so quickly? \u201cLeave with me. Help me, and I help you. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am as safe here as anywhere,\u201d was his only reply.</p><p>I arched my brows. My attention flicked toward the door, toward Jack and the agents clamoring beside and behind him. \u201cIf those hunters break past that barrier, they will not stop to ask you for an introduction. They will kill you. They do not know who you are, that we need you for our case or that I need you for Dallas. They only know you are an alien, and you are in a restricted area.\u201d</p><p>His lips edged up in a slow, decadent smile. \u201cTo kill me, they would have to catch me. And as you have found, that is impossible.\u201d Steps precise and carefully measured, he moved slowly toward me. \u201cYou never answered my question, Tai la Mar. Do you plan to murder my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn alien execution isn\u2019t considered murder. We at A.I.R. like to consider it a public service.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped to life in his temple, and he ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cDoes Dallas mean so little to you, that you are willing to destroy your only bargaining power?\u201d</p> <p>I softened my tone\u2014for Dallas, I assured myself, not because I hated to see this man troubled. \u201cYour sister can help our case; she can help us save human lives. She is safe enough for the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could force you to open her cell,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cTwo agents are required, Kyrin. Two. I doubt you could subdue me and prop up Jaxon at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot allow you to hurt her, Mia. Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s work something out. Tell me what you know about Atlanna and the abductions. Tell me where to find her. I know you\u2019re not the killer, but I also know you\u2019re involved somehow.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, surprise darkening his features. \u201cWhat exactly do you know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you had contact with each of the victims. That you were dating Rianne Harte.\u201d I paused. Very carefully, I flicked a glance toward my gun. Ten steps, and I\u2019d have it. I\u2019d stun him and force him to my will. Simple. Easy. Yeah, right. I inched to my right, trying to appear casual. \u201cI know that fertility is at the heart of the matter. Is Atlanna trying to make babies and sell them?\u201d</p><p>He tangled a hand in his hair and blinked up at the ceiling.</p><p>I took another step.</p><p>His gaze swung back to me, colliding with mine. His expression was unreadable. Silence wrapped around us like a blanket, thick, heavy, and oppressive. From the corner of my eye, I saw an agent hand Jack some sort of tool. Jack crouched, and I heard the grind of steel against steel. He was going to dismantle the hinges. Desperation struck me.</p><p>Another step.Another. \u201cKyrin\u2014,\u201d I said.</p><p>He waved me to silence. \u201cI refuse to cooperate with A.I.R.,\u201d he said, and before I could utter another word, he disappeared again. There was no warning, no flash of light or mist. He simply vanished from my line of vision.</p><p>Something...tart burned in my nose. I flinched from it. Tried to wave the smell away. Grew dizzy. Inky fog drifted through my mind, breaking my thoughts apart. I fought against the mist\u2019s heaviness, but a strange lethargy seeped into my bones, and I floated down, down, down.</p><p>But I never hit the cold tile. Strong, comforting arms surrounded me and scooped me into a warm, male embrace. I should have been afraid. I wasn\u2019t. I should have tried to protest. I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSleep, angel,\u201d Kyrin whispered, his sweet, heated breath fanning my cheek.</p><p>And I did.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>I awoke tied to a bed.</p><p>My wrists and ankles were bound to mahogany bedposts by thick straps of pink silk. My weapons were gone; I didn\u2019t feel their weight. My clothing felt too airy, but I knew some sort of material draped me. Slivers of light seeped into the room, yet somehow that slight bit of luminescence only increased the darkness, giving way to more shadows.</p><p>My heart tripped inside my chest, and fear sank sharp claws inside my stomach. I struggled against my bonds, trying to kick my legs, trying to loosen my hands. I only managed to tighten the restraints, and with each movement, the buttery soft silk sliced deep into my skin. Oh, God, I couldn\u2019t escape. With the knowledge came panic. Consuming panic.</p><p>A sob bubbled to life in my throat.</p><p>Air became ashes inside my lungs, burning. Couldn\u2019t...breathe. I couldn\u2019t breathe. My throat swelled, constricted with terror. A cold sweat trickled between my breasts and shoulder blades.</p><p>Childhood memories of dark closets and horrifying aloneness spilled into my mind. I squeezed my eyes tightly shut, trying to block the electrifying terror. Please, I tried to scream. Someone please help me.</p><p>Had I been left here to die?</p><p>Death did not frighten me; but I did not want to die this way. Not here. Not alone. I would fight my way out. I screamed as I bucked against the bonds.</p><p>My heart was beating so rapidly, I feared the pathetic organ would soon explode past my ribs. Even though my eyes were closed, I felt the room tilt and spin. Faster and faster. Shallow pants I recognized as my own echoed in my ears. My struggles increased, frantic. So frantic.</p><p>\u201cBe at peace, Mia,\u201d a man whispered.</p><p>Kyrin.</p><p>Kyrin was here.</p><p>Have to breathe, I thought desperately. Another scream tried to burst from my mouth, a scream so deep and intense my vocal cords strained together, raw from exertion.</p><p>\u201cYou are unharmed,\u201d he said in that ever-calm voice.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I snarled, my voice hoarse and broken. \u201cCut the bonds. Cut the fucking bonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are unharmed,\u201d he repeated, caressing his fingertips over my fevered brow, my cheeks, and my chin. His touch was gentle, like pure, liquid heat and sensation, and somehow, the simple feel of him penetrated my panic.</p><p>I was at last able to suck in a great gulp of precious air. Once, twice. As I breathed, I smelled a gentle rain\u2014Onadyn. The fragrance invaded my senses. I\u2019m not a child. I\u2019m not imprisoned inside a small, dank closet. My heartbeat slowed gradually, and my terror ebbed as realization settled inside my mind. I was inside a bedroom, and Kyrin was here beside me.</p><p>Little by little, I ceased my struggles. I opened my eyes. Kyrin loomed over me, his gaze boring into mine. His eyes were a lighter shade of violet than ever before, and they swirled with a life all their own. Concern etched the lines around his frowning mouth.</p><p>Our fingers were intertwined, I noticed, our palms flat against each other. The skin on his hands was not smooth but rough and callused, the bones thick and strong. Heat and energy flowed through me, calming me even further. Sunlight dappled through brilliant sapphire curtains covering the large window on the far wall.</p><p>\u201cLight,\u201d I said raggedly. \u201cI need more light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree shades lighter,\u201d Kyrin said. Instantly glowing bulbs dripped like crystal tears from an overhead source, brightly illuminating the spacious room. My gaze circled my surroundings. I lay atop a large, decadent four-poster bed, a crimson velvet canopy cascading around each edge.</p><p>Ebony-framed mirrors with gold-plated boundaries hung at each midsection of the wall. Bright pillows of turquoise, emerald, and ruby were scattered across a plump lounging dais, and thick floral carpet draped the polished cherry wood floors. Beside the window, a cobbled hearth devoid of any embers glistened, clean and inviting.</p><p>A place of depth and blatant sensuality, most assuredly, but at the moment, it was merely a prison.</p><p>I glared up at Kyrin through the haze of my lashes. \u201cRelease me,\u201d I snarled. My teeth were clenched so tightly, I feared my jaw might snap. Now that my fear had abandoned me, fury bubbled white-hot in my blood.</p><p>Watching me, Kyrin grinned languidly and released my hands from his grip. He eased back on his elbow and traced a fingertip over my thigh. \u201cThere. I am no longer holding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Bastard. \u201cCut the ties.\u201d</p><p>Still grinning, he shook his head. \u201cNot just yet, I think. Too much do I like you where you are. In my bed. Awaiting my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI await only your demise.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWhat an amusement you are, little Mia. Where is the passionate woman I kissed?\u201d His finger continued to dance atop my skin. \u201cDo you still lie to yourself about your desires, or just to me?\u201d</p><p>I trembled again, unable to halt the motion, then tried to mask my growing arousal and awareness of him with heated words. \u201cGet your hands off of me before I cut them off.\u201d</p><p>The wide expanse of his shoulders lifted in a shrug. But he didn\u2019t remove his hand. \u201cI meant only to give you pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps he meant only to make me scream, I realized. Perhaps he hoped to break my spirit. Well, I would not allow that to happen. Glowering, I jerked up my knee, dislodging his fingers. \u201cYou want to pleasure me? Let me go.\u201d</p><p>His head angled to the right; his gaze never wavered. \u201cWhy does being bound upset you so? Some women have found it quite exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, those women are idiots.\u201d I tried once again to tug myself free from the restraints, ignoring throbs of pain as the silk cut deeper into my skin. A trickle of blood slithered down my arm, warm against my chilled skin, then dripped off my bare elbow and onto the sheet.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he chided. \u201cYou have hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>His face strained with intense concentration as he opened his palms and circled them around my ankles. Warm, tingling heat arced up my calves, then slowly cooled to relaxing perfection.</p><p>I hated to admit it, but I didn\u2019t want him to stop. The sensations were too entrancing. Too...right. They were creating a deep hum of carnality within me. I wanted to spread my legs and invite those magic fingers inside. I wanted his mouth on the heat of me, lost in my essence.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I questioned, nearly breathless. My back arched.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>He caressed his hands up my thighs, over my belly, and to my wrists. I bit back a moan. God, he felt good. He paused a moment to study the tattoo on my wrist. He traced his finger over the black scythe and smiled slowly. \u201cHow appropriate.\u201d He deviated to the scar on my inner arm\u2014a little present I\u2019d received from a crazed Mec. He placed a light kiss over the raised, jagged flesh. Our eyes met. His lips were inches from mine. So close, in fact, I felt the sweetness of his breath on my nose. I melted in response. Soon the same drugging warmth settled in my arms, cooling all too quickly.</p><p>When Kyrin eased himself away, my wrists and ankles no longer ached. But my body did\u2014it ached for the return of his weight.</p><p>I gulped, then asked, \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d My traitorous body might yearn for him, but my mind knew better.</p><p>His features became a mask of resignation. \u201cI brought you here because we have much to discuss. Uninterrupted. Without your pyre-gun at the ready.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll talk to you here, hmm?\u201d</p><p>He gave another chuckle, that rich, rumbling chuckle that washed all over me, as intimate and inviting as the sweetest kiss. \u201cAs if you could resist.\u201d</p><p>I released a frustrated growl. He was right. \u201cJust fucking release me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere I to do that, you would lash out, and we would spend our time together fighting instead of talking.\u201d</p><p>I chewed on my bottom lip and remained silent. I couldn\u2019t deny his charge without lying, and while I didn\u2019t mind lying to this man, I knew he\u2019d know the truth, so what was the use?</p><p>\u201cA.I.R. will come for you. They\u2019ll trace you by your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, I am not in your database. And two, there are no amplifiers here. No recorders. Even if there were, my home was constructed of soundproof walls. I doubt A.I.R. even knows this place exists.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my hips atop the comforter, away from him...and for the first time saw what I wore. I was dressed in a white gauzy froth of a gown. Pleats gathered in a low circle at my neck, then split down the middle to cover my breasts, yet bare my stomach. The soft material gathered again at my waist, riding low on my hips, then draped me from leg to ankle with a thin see-through veil.</p> <p>A bejeweled armband circled my bicep. Mesmerizing purple stones, too light to be amethysts and too luminescent to be of this earth, formed an intricate pattern around the base. My nails dug into my palms.</p><p>How dare he undress me, then redress me so scantily?</p><p>\u201cWhere are my weapons? My pants and boots?\u201d</p><p>Unconcerned with my questions, Kyrin lifted a strand of my hair. The dark lock proved an erotic contrast to the paleness of his skin. \u201cI like your hair this way,\u201d he said. \u201cUnbound. Like a black thundercloud around your face.\u201d Next he trailed a finger over my breast, causing my nipple to pebble and my breath to hitch.</p><p>I quelled the urge to dissolve into his touch. When had I become so eager for a man? So needy?</p><p>When had I become such a slave to my senses?</p> <p>\u201cI want my clothes back,\u201d I said, purposefully making my tone harsh.</p><p>His gaze traveled the length of my body. \u201cDo you not like this gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Kyrin. Did you enjoy yourself? Undressing a helpless, unconscious woman?\u201d</p><p>With exaggerated movements, he leaned into me until our faces were inches apart. \u201cI doubt you have ever been helpless, Tai la Mar.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head, closing even more distance. My nose brushed the tip of his. \u201cYou have one minute to return every article of clothing, every weapon that you stole from me. Or I\u2019ll\u2014or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>His brows curved with insolence. \u201cOr you\u2019ll what?\u201d</p> <p>God, I didn\u2019t know. My head flopped onto the pillow, and I screeched.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t even seem concerned when he admitted, \u201cI have already destroyed your clothing and your weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not be angry I have dressed you so. I wanted to see you in the attire of my homeland.\u201d His voice lacked any hint of remorse, held only a husky resonance of desire. \u201cAnd I must tell you, dark angel, that garbed as you are, you look like sex. Rare, carnal sex. You are more beautiful than I had imagined...\u201d He leaned closer with every word, closing the distance between us again as if he didn\u2019t like to be separated. \u201cAnd imagine you I did. Naked, under me, over me, taking me inside your body and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I said on a wispy catch of breath. Moisture pooled between my legs.</p><p>Don\u2019t soften. He\u2019s strapped you to his bed.</p><p>His gaze fastened on my lips, then moved to my eyes. I held his stare, the air around us thickened with sexual tension. Abruptly he shook his head. \u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Breaking the strange spell he possessed on my senses, he jolted up and stalked to the window. Keeping his back to me, he said, \u201cI want to kiss you again, but I will not until I have explained some things to you.\u201d Here he drew in a sharp breath. \u201cYou cannot leave this house, Mia. The armband will see to that.\u201d</p><p>I blinked in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you stray outside of this home, a shock will begin at the band and travel the length of your entire body. The pain, intense and consuming as it will be, will only cease when you reenter my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you this not to anger or scare you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to warn you what an attempted escape will bring. You will remain here as my guest until our business is concluded.\u201d</p><p>The husky timbre of his voice was so finite, so resolute.</p><p>My God, he really was telling the truth. He thought to trap me like an animal, to take away my freedom and rights. My toes curled with the force of my distress. \u201cDid you abduct Rianne Harte and tie her this way?\u201d</p><p>He pivoted and faced me, his eyes tortured. \u201cI tried to protect Rianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way your sister tried to protect William Steele?\u201d I sneered.</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw; he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the way to woo a woman into your arms.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cIs it not?\u201d He eased beside me again, his hip pressed against mine, and lifted another tendril of my hair. He shifted the glossy strands through his fingers, watched them fall, then recaptured them, desire growing in his expression. \u201cPerhaps I should try and prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>The knowledge of my imprisonment warred with my still-swirling desire. Keep talking, I told myself. \u201cYou never told me what type of business we have, what was worth risking your life to abduct me from my own workplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first I thought to trade you for my sister,\u201d he admitted, caressing my hair against his cheek. His eyes closed in surrender, just as my scalp tingled with heady sensation.</p><p>I jerked my head to the side, quickly and efficiently tugging the inky locks from his hands. \u201cAn agent\u2019s creed is duty before emotion. A.I.R. will not negotiate for my release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour colleges would sentence you to death?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d I answered. No, that wasn\u2019t true. They would hunt him down and fight for me, just like I\u2019d do for them.</p><p>Kyrin\u2019s chin edged to the side, his eyes lit with curiosity. \u201cAnd this does not upset you?\u201d</p><p>I understood A.I.R.\u2019s policies. I\u2019d even helped make them. \u201cWhy set a killer free to save one life? The killer will then take many more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation is moot,\u201d he said with a wave of his hand. \u201cBefore you woke, I had already decided not to trade you.\u201d</p><p>Dread unfurled inside me. \u201cThen what do you plan to do with me? How long do you hope to keep me here?\u201d</p><p>He deliberated a moment, before answering evasively, \u201cI will keep you only as long as needed to gain your trust.\u201d</p><p>Trust? Was he serious? I snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou trusted me once, to help you catch Atlanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me tied to a bed. How can I ever trust you again?\u201d I trusted so few, anyway, and those I did were human. \u201cI did not think you a foolish man until just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see,\u201d was his only reply.</p><p>He eased to his feet and stepped toward the door.</p><p>A small ember of panic sparked to life. I wrenched again at my bonds. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I cried. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here.\u201d</p><p>He paused, faced me. I collapsed against the soft mattress. I had to say something, anything, to keep him here. I didn\u2019t want to be alone again. \u201cWhy are you so secretive about Atlanna?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you helping her? Is keeping me here a plan you\u2019ve concocted together?\u201d</p><p>That tortured gleam returned to his eyes. \u201cNo. I\u2019d rather die than aid her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me go and help me find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will help you, Mia. You. Not A.I.R. I detest all hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a hunter.\u201d Our gazes clashed, and I was helpless to glance away.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, \u201cI am willing to rethink.\u201d He pushed out a breath. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>My stomach knotted in protest, but I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Food always relaxed people. Made them more willing to talk.</p><p>\u201cWe shall eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to untie me,\u201d I said, making a conscious effort not to beg.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI had thought to bring you food in here, but I have decided to trust you the way I hope you\u2019ll trust me. You must give me your word that you will not fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vow I will not murder you until after our meal. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he said, \u201cAfter we eat, I will simply retie you. How is that?\u201d He approached me, slipped a small, thin blade from his pocket, and gently cut the silk that bound me.</p><p>Once freed, I reacted on instinct. Sitting up and jerking back my elbow in one fluid motion, I made a fist and punched him. My knuckles connected with the top portion of his cheekbone. His head whipped to the side.</p><p>When I made no other move to attack him, he slowly turned back to face me. He fingered the now reddened skin.</p><p>\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t kill you, and I haven\u2019t. I said nothing about beating the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever tie me up again,\u201d I growled. \u201cNow, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Guilt wound through me as I sat at Kyrin\u2019s dining table, feasting on rosemary salad and shrimp scampi. Dallas lay in the hospital, fighting for his life. Hunters were probably scouring the city limits for me. Yet here I lounged atop a high-backed gold satin chair, stuffing my face with delicacies.</p><p>Worse, I was actually enjoying myself.</p><p>Kyrin and I had formed a sort of truce. For now, this moment, we were simply a man and a woman, enjoying a delicious meal. A hand-carved Egyptian tabletop separated us, but our legs were close enough to touch, and touch me he did, caressing his thigh against mine. The softness of his pants and the thinness of my veil created an unignorable friction.</p><p>I found myself breathlessly awaiting his next touch.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for dessert?\u201d he asked, easing back on the brocade bench.</p><p>My mouth watered. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, the cool air wafting along the walls and tormenting my bare skin. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>One of his servants, who refused to meet my gaze, arranged a porcelain platter of chocolate eclairs and blackberry truffles directly in front of me. I almost purred in sheer joy.</p><p>Since the near annihilation of the cocoa plant, chocolate was considered a rare treasure. Only the most wealthy and influential of people were able to acquire it. Before he\u2019d decided he didn\u2019t like me, my father had given me a chocolate treat. I still remembered how wonderful it had been. How I\u2019d begged for more, but he\u2019d had only the one.</p><p>With shaky fingers, I placed one gently in my mouth and...my taste buds burst. Oh, my God. My eyes closed of their own accord as pure surrender dissolved in my mouth. That\u2019s what chocolate tasted like. Pure surrender.</p><p>Kill me now, I thought, because I\u2019ve finally entered the gates of paradise.</p><p>When able, I opened my eyes. Kyrin was watching me, molten fire in his eyes. I held his stare for a protracted minute. \u201cAre all Arcadians as...sexual as you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. \u201cWe are a highly sexual race, yes.\u201d</p><p>I forced my gaze away from him and watched the flickering vanilla- and cinnamon-scented candles. Shadows and light frolicked along the rose-tinted floral-painted walls, dancing with the flames. Those same shadows had danced across Kyrin\u2019s face, giving his cheekbones a stark, almost harsh appearance.</p><p>My attention veered to the surrounding furniture. A sea of vivid colors and textures, eclectic all, filled his home. Fresh flowers overflowed from end tables, and the edges of a finely woven rug were fringed with those same flower petals. Elegant ivory chairs offset a silver-flecked wall.</p><p>Such wealth amazed me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you acquire all of this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He lifted his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cArcadia is rich in the rocks your world holds dear. Diamonds, gold, sapphires, and many more. When I came through the interworld portal, I simply brought those things with me.\u201d</p><p>The more he spoke, the more intrigued I was. \u201cTell me about Arcadia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much smaller than this world and much more crowded, with barely room to breathe. Our people live so long that the population is never evened out.\u201d He fingered the rim of his wineglass. \u201cWe enacted a law years ago forbidding women to have more than one child, but many have them in secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are obviously more technically advanced than us, which explains your ability to molecularly transport outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve yet to master indoor transportation without seriously damaging ourselves. Whoever tries ends up with pieces of the wall or furniture inside them, and dies soon after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re determined to stay here, perhaps you should be working with our scientists to help advance this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps,\u201d he said, meeting my stare dead on, \u201ctechnological advancement does more harm than good.\u201d</p><p>My brow furrowed. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>Glancing down at his food, he gave another shrug. He couldn\u2019t hide or mask the haunted pall that settled over his features. \u201cInnocent people die during experimentation. Sometimes they die horrible deaths.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, keeping my gaze on him. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to figure you out, Kyrin. You\u2019ve done some things you\u2019re ashamed of. Don\u2019t try to deny it,\u201d I said when he opened his mouth to speak. \u201cFiguring people out is part of my job. You performed experiments, didn\u2019t you? Those experiments killed people. At the shootout with Atlanna, you mentioned atoning for past sins.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cListen, you can rest easy. If people volunteer for the job, they willingly accept the risk. I don\u2019t see the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they do not volunteer?\u201d</p> <p>All right, so he obviously hadn\u2019t had permission for whatever experiments he\u2019d done. I didn\u2019t know what to say to that. Was the scientist a monster for trying to advance society, no matter the cost? Did the ends negate the means? As a paid killer, I\u2019d often thought so.</p><p>\u201cDid you work for Atlanna at one time?\u201d I asked him. She\u2019d funded Rianne Hart\u2019s research, so the woman had her fingers in science.</p><p>Kyrin scooted his plate away. \u201cDinner is finished.\u201d</p><p>Bingo. \u201cWhat did you help her do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not help her abduct or kill any of the men, I assure you.\u201d His voice was strained. \u201cNow, dinner is finished.\u201d</p> <p>Fine\u2014I let it go. For now. Because, well, I believed him. He hadn\u2019t killed the men, hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>I blinked at my plate, only just then realizing that I\u2019d eaten every bite and nibbled every crumb of chocolate. I sighed. \u201cYes, dinner is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you force me to bind you now?\u201d he asked, folding his arms over his chest, \u201cor will you behave?\u201d</p><p>My teeth ground together. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><p>His gaze raked over me, and he said, \u201cYou most definitely are not a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll allow you to tie me a second time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou live for challenge, and I like that about you. It makes me feel alive. I never feel so alive as when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>The same could be said of me.</p><p>The realization hit me, and I almost made a play for the nearest exit. It was scary, the way he affected me. I forced myself to stay seated. I had Kyrin exactly where Jaxon and I had wanted him\u2014readily available to probe for information. Of course, I had three disadvantages to being here instead of the station house. One, none of my weapons were in my possession. Two, this was Kyrin\u2019s turf, not mine. And three, I was practically naked. This damn gown was made for enticement, not war.</p><p>Well, I thought in the next instant, I could actually use the gown to my benefit.</p><p>I sipped my wine and reclined in the satin-cushioned chair, eyeing him expectantly. \u201cBefore we end our truce, I have some more questions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk,\u201d he said.</p><p>So I did. \u201cYou didn\u2019t use molecular transfer at the station house. So how exactly were you able to appear and disappear so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not disappear. Not really. I simply moved faster than your eye could see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could have sped away like that before our little tussle in the hospital parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d The gleam in his eyes became wicked. \u201cIf I had, though, I never would have had full body contact with you.\u201d</p><p>I tried to hide a grin. How like a man. \u201cNot all Arcadians can do that,\u201d I said. \u201cMove so quickly, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery few can,\u201d he said, pride lacing his tone.</p><p>As I regarded him, curiosity filled me. Not just about the Arcadians, but about this one particularly. \u201cWhy is it you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite simply, it is an ability I was born with. All Arcadians are blessed with certain abilities. Lilla, for example, has a great capacity for mind control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do not?\u201d I asked, realizing he\u2019d never tried to dictate my actions with his mind. One point in his favor.</p><p>\u201cI am telepathic, able to speak my thoughts inside others\u2019 heads, but dominating that person\u2019s actions is not an ability I possess. Nor one I care to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy use mind control when you can use force, right?\u201d I patted the armband.</p><p>\u201cWhat I do, I do for the greater good. Isn\u2019t that how you do your job?\u201d</p><p>I jolted upright, leveling him with a frown. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWhat other questions do you have for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know if I\u2019m right. I want to know if Atlanna is making babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered simply. Carefully.</p><p>A piece of the puzzle clicked firmly in place. I\u2019d been right. Fertility. Babies. The bitch planned to create as many children as she could and sell them for profit. What kind of sick woman did that? And why the hell was she abducting human men? Did she have human followers and was mating them?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your involvement? You had dinner with William Steele the night before his abduction. Why?\u201d</p><p>His expression became leery. \u201cI befriended William not to hurt him, but to help him.\u201d</p><p>My brows arched. \u201cAnd did you? Did you actually help him?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cI am well aware that my aid did him no good. I do not need your reminder.\u201d</p><p>His accent was growing thicker, more pronounced, with each word he spoke. I\u2019d hit a nerve. \u201cI know you warned the men in hopes of atonement, but that makes me wonder how you knew they were in danger in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I trust you with the truth, Mia Snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to learn to trust you, you must also learn to trust me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his crystal flute to his lips and drained the rich burgundy contents. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked what Atlanna is doing with the children,\u201d he said, taking the focus off himself. His chin tilted to the side. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plans to sell them. I could guess that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a scientist at heart. The others, well, she\u2019s using them in experiments.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cYou make it sound like the children have been born, but there hasn\u2019t been time. William and the others were taken recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam and the others weren\u2019t the first. They are only the ones you know about. Many children have already been born.\u201d</p><p>My God. Revulsion for this woman\u2019s crimes and pity for the innocent babies being sold to the highest bidder, or worse, filled me. \u201cWhat kind of experiments?\u201d As I spoke, hatred\u2014pure, undiluted hatred\u2014sparked to life inside me. I wanted Atlanna dead. I wanted her to suffer. And I wanted to be the one who made her suffer.</p><p>Kyrin pressed his lips together and set his glass aside.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell me,\u201d I said, a statement, not a question. I bit my tongue to keep from spewing a mouthful of curses.</p><p>\u201cThat is correct. Not yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know.\u201d I slammed my fist against the table. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not ready for the truth.\u201d</p><p>I gripped my fork so tightly, color drained from my knuckles. \u201cYou know I will hunt her and kill her. You know I will do my best to save those babies. That is what matters here. Nothing else. Or do you want Atlanna alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want her dead, just as you, but there is more to this situation than you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>Hair swaying at his temples, he shook his head. \u201cI told you. You are not yet ready for the truth, Mia.\u201d Before I could respond to that, he added, \u201cWould you like to discuss your friend Dallas?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders straightened. I leaned forward and rested my elbows on the table, letting the subject of Atlanna be temporarily shelved. \u201cYou will heal him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>I vaulted to my feet, my gown swirling at my ankles. My chair skidded behind me, then landed on its back with a loud thump. \u201cI have had enough of your half-ass answers and youare-not-ready-to-know-the-truth shit. Our truce is over.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he stood, disappointment deepening the lines around his mouth. \u201cLet us work together, like before. Weren\u2019t those your words to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to do that, you\u2019re not. If you won\u2019t answer my questions, you\u2019re not interested in working with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is so much you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014can\u2019t. Come. I will escort you back to the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said. You\u2019ll have to fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is your wish. You will merely end up tied to the bed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink it will be that easy, do you?\u201d I laughed, the sound completely devoid of humor. \u201cIf you come near me right now, I\u2019ll drain your blood into a bowl and let you die here.\u201d I said it so calmly, so assuredly, my words left a cold pallor in the room.</p><p>He pursed his lips, looking as casual and at ease as if he were selecting which pastry to consume for breakfast, the cocky bastard. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand if I defend myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t. Will your servants interfere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. They will not disturb us\u201d\u2014his eyes shimmered with depraved anticipation\u2014\u201cno matter what sounds you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. One ass-kicking, coming up.\u201d</p><p>I moved around the table with deliberate slowness, heading straight for him. He stepped in the opposite direction. We circled each other, and impatience thrummed through me. I stopped and cocked a finger at him. \u201cCome here. If you have the courage.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI happen to like where I stand.\u201d</p><p>He was going to use his lightning-quick abilities. I could see it in his eyes, and I couldn\u2019t allow him that advantage. Before he could take his next breath, I grabbed the bowl of rosemary vinaigrette and tossed the contents in his face, porcelain and all. The liquid splashed into his eyes and mouth as the bowl thumped against his forehead.</p><p>He grunted, then he howled. I guess vinaigrette burns. Ha! I controlled the urge to grin. I leaped atop the dark, glossy table surface\u2014and almost toppled to the floor when my foot caught the hem of my skirt. My amusement faded as I righted myself. I pitched three more platters at him in quick succession. As he rubbed his eyes, he tried to dodge each missile. He only managed to bump into his chair and trip on the edge of the carpet.</p><p>While he lay there, unable to see, I paused to admire my handiwork. Noodles and vegetables dripped from his saturated clothing. My alien salad, I thought smugly.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. He\u2019d abducted me, held me captive, stripped me, and forced me to wear this flimsy porn costume. He deserved more. He refused to give me all of the answers I needed, and thought perhaps he might help Dallas. Well, that wasn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019d originally hoped to force him to my will by imprisoning him, and that plan hadn\u2019t changed. He\u2019d just changed the location of his capture.</p><p>Determined, I jumped onto the carpet and punched him with every ounce of strength I possessed. His chin swung to the side, and he rolled onto the expensive rug I\u2019d just ruined with food. He tried to stabilize himself, tried to work his way to his knees, but I kicked his stomach. His breath jolted from his lungs. I shoved his shoulder, spinning him to his back. Then I jumped on him, straddled his waist, and pinned him where he lay.</p><p>\u201cAbduct me, will you?\u201d I ground my fist into his left eye.</p><p>\u201cTie me to a bed, will you?\u201d I smashed my fist into his right eye.</p><p>\u201cRefuse to answer me, will\u2014\u201d</p><p>My words sliced to a halt when his hands grabbed my hips and jerked me down to his chest. Hardness to softness. One of his sticky palms twisted in my hair and yanked me close, until only a breath of air separated us. He smelled of rosemary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you,\u201d he warned. \u201cNot the sweet, lingering kisses of your earth men, not like last time, but the hard, thorough kiss of the Arcadians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, and I\u2019ll bite your tongue off,\u201d I told him heatedly, but I made no move to pull away. No, I sank more snugly into him, and my nerve endings burst with sensation. \u201cI\u2019m not done kicking your ass,\u201d I said, this time without any ire at all in my tone, but breathless.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t want him like this.</p><p>I know I\u2019d told myself that before, and I\u2019d probably have to give myself the reminder a thousand times more. The man was forbidden to me. Perhaps that was his allure. Like the time my mother told me not to eat that box of cookies. The moment she\u2019d spoken the words, those damn cookies had suddenly become more delicious looking. I\u2019d had to have them.</p><p>I\u2019d eaten them, of course, and earned myself a roaring stomachache.</p><p>The hand on my hip traveled down, cupping my ass. Fire simmered underneath my skin, the flames licking over me, deep and dark. My growing hunger for him was nearly as seductive as the man himself.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t be honest with me,\u201d he said, \u201cat least be honest with yourself. You want me. We\u2019ve kissed before, you know how good it can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word held a wealth of meaning.</p><p>He jerked me closer until nothing separated us. My lips parted, ready. And then he ravaged my mouth there on his dining room floor. Over and over he teased his tongue past my teeth, stroking inside, taking. Demanding.</p><p>Devouring.</p><p>My hands glided under his shirt. My fingertips kneaded his muscles, pinched his nipples, and he groaned. Such strength. Such heat. His energy hummed inside me, a potent vibrancy that ignited my blood and made every inch of me sing. I uttered a low, needy moan of my own.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>The sound slammed into me, fueling my passion. His ragged breath fanned my nose and cheek as our tongues danced and sparred. The sheer desperation in his kiss filled my head, invaded and consumed my senses.</p><p>\u201cYou taste so good,\u201d I breathed. \u201cBetter than chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been desperate to taste you again,\u201d he whispered hotly. He tried to tell me something else, but switched to a language I didn\u2019t understand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gripped my ass more tightly, fitting me snugly against the thickness of his erection. I ground into him, mimicking the motions of sex, all the while loathing our clothing. My tongue moved against his in sync with the movements of our bodies. I shook with the force of my need, oh, how I shook. My control teetered on the brink of elimination. I\u2019d never experienced anything like this, never experienced anything so intense, as if I needed him to survive.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with me? I couldn\u2019t allow this. I had to regain command of myself.</p><p>I shoved away from him, but he just rolled me to my back and fit himself more snugly against me. The apex of my thighs cradled his erection. Before I could utter a single protest, his lips once again took possession of mine. The softness of his lips...the lingering wine on his tongue...I almost caved. Almost.</p> <p>I jostled him to his back.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d I said, knowing hunger still glittered in my eyes.</p><p>His eyelids were at half-mast, and his features glowed, actually glowed, with ardor. He was elemental and raw, and the hard length of his body pressed against me, demanding attention. Duty and desire and fear warred within me.</p><p>Ultimately, duty and fear won.</p><p>I hated myself for what I was about to do, but even as I inwardly cursed myself, I reached out with my fingertips and latched on to a nearby porcelain bowl. Sometime during our kiss, I\u2019d lost my anger, and I didn\u2019t want to actually hurt him.</p> <p>\u201cI need to leave now,\u201d I said. And then I smashed the dish against his temple.</p><p>His eyes went wide, then closed. His body jerked, then stilled.</p><p>I stayed where I was for a long moment, just watching him. A bump grew on his forehead, only to quickly disappear. His color remained good. With a shaky hand, I reached out and placed my palm over his heart. A gentle thump, thump greeted me.</p><p>Guilt wound through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. I leaned down and kissed him softly on the lips. I stood. I didn\u2019t know what part of the city I was now in. I wasn\u2019t even wearing shoes, and I was 99 percent sure I looked like a porn star. Still, if I had to, I was going to drag this rock-solid alien outside and flag down a car. And if I couldn\u2019t find a car, I would drag him all the way to the station house on foot. There I\u2019d stun him, then haul him to the hospital. After that, I\u2019d lock him up until he gave me all the information I needed to find Atlanna. No more evasions.</p><p>I made a quick search for a phone unit. Didn\u2019t find one. However, I did find a Road Kill special, an antique that used bullets instead of fire, and confiscated it. I strapped the barrel to my waist.</p> <p>I stepped behind my captive and locked my arms around his chest, propping his back against my chest. Slowly I dragged him to the front door, each backward step I took requiring every ounce of my strength. The man weighed more than Dallas. Thankfully, the servants remained out of sight, just as Kyrin had promised.</p><p>Inside the foyer, I eased Kyrin to the marble floor. I turned the knob with my free hand and shoved open the front door. A cold wind immediately blustered around me, and a shiver raked my spine. Damn. I\u2019d forgotten about the snow. If I had to, I could go without a coat, but I desperately needed shoes. Kneeling in front of Kyrin, I removed his boots and socks, then fit both on my own feet. They were too big, way too big, but they would have to work.</p><p>Thankfully the closet beside me boasted an assortment of men\u2019s coats, so I wouldn\u2019t have to go without one. I tore the one nearest me from its hanger and secured the heavy wool around my shoulders, then did the same for Kyrin.</p><p>That done, I once more gathered my burden and hauled him outside.</p><p>The moment I stepped beyond the threshold, a sharp, piercing ache began at my left bicep, exactly where the armband rested, then traveled and grew in intensity throughout the rest of my body. I was able to ignore the pain at first, but that soon proved impossible. Too much pain. Sharp, prickling. Everywhere. Surely my head would burst. I doubled over and dropped to my knees, barely feeling the ice as nausea churned inside my stomach.</p><p>\u201cDid I not warn you of this?\u201d Kyrin sighed beside me.</p><p>I gasped. \u201cWhy...aren\u2019t...you...unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heal quickly, remember?\u201d He trudged to his feet.</p> <p>The torrent of agony continued to beat at me, hammering, eroding my determination with the savage intensity of a tempest. I smashed my lips together to keep from screaming. I didn\u2019t even think to protest when he draped his arm around my shoulders, helped me stand, and led me back toward the house. Along the way, he confiscated the gun I\u2019d found. I couldn\u2019t summon the energy to care.</p><p>When we eased inside, my pain instantly vanished. My head cleared. I drew in several shaky breaths. Kyrin positioned himself in front of me, and I pulled my gaze from his bare feet up his black trousers, and glared into his amused gaze.</p><p>\u201cTake this damn thing off me.\u201d I attempted to rip the cold metal away, yet it remained firmly in place, snaked around my arm.</p><p>\u201cWe still have much to discuss, so you will remain my guest. This I have already explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you who refuses to finish our conversation.\u201d My hands clenched into fists. \u201cYou will remove this band, or I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He grinned. His hair was plastered to his head and gleamed with oil. There was a noodle stuck to his neck. \u201cTry again to render me unconscious with a bowl of food?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below my eye. This situation was not amusing to me. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever kiss me again. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Grin slowly fading to a frown, he reached out and caressed a fingertip across my cheek. \u201cWe must find common ground or many of your people will die.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his jacket lapels and jerked him closer. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even care? You\u2019re an other-worlder. Why do you care about human lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live on this world, Mia. It is my home. I want peace with your people, and that will never be achieved when we are blamed for every crime.\u201d</p><p>I pushed out a sigh, losing the darkest heat of my rage. \u201cI\u2019m willing to work with you, okay, but you have to compromise with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompromise? All of your compromises aid you, no one else. You wish me to save your friend, yet remain unwilling to set my sister free.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other, both considering the other\u2019s words.</p><p>Finally, he rubbed a weary hand down his face. \u201cWe are getting nowhere with this conversation,\u201d he said, his voice turning deep, rhythmic, hypnotic. \u201cYou will sleep.\u201d</p><p>That tart, cloying fragrance I was coming to loathe engulfed me. I fought against what I knew was coming, but darkness propelled me into sweet oblivion.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>My dreams were erotic.</p><p>Kyrin slowly peeled away my clothing, and I did the same to him. His breath was hot on my skin as he licked my neck, nipped at my chin. His muscles were hard and taut, and I knew he fought for control. That he wanted to take me, claim me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I said on a moan, arching into him. Only now, in this dream world, could I admit my deepest desires. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways you command,\u201d he said on a ragged laugh, his voice heavily accented, \u201cbut worry not. I will never stop. Promise me you will never leave me,\u201d he said. \u201cI need you too badly. I crave you too fiercely.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, and I welcomed his tongue. He always tasted so good, like a forbidden drug I shouldn\u2019t have but couldn\u2019t resist. I whispered his name.</p><p>The sound awakened me.</p><p>My eyelids popped open. My heartbeat was thundering in my chest, and my breathing was ragged.</p><p>When I calmed long moments later\u2014though I didn\u2019t think my heartbeat would ever slow\u2014I scanned my surroundings. I was in Kyrin\u2019s bed. Alone. Sweat soaked my gown to my skin, but at least my wrists and ankles were free.</p><p>Had Kyrin experienced a similar dream? I wondered. That dream had been more vivid than any of the others, almost as if he truly had been there with me. I didn\u2019t know what to think of that.</p><p>I stumbled from the warmth and softness of the mattress and padded to the window. The carpet plumped beneath my feet. My shoes were missing; well, the shoes I\u2019d stolen from Kyrin. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and swept aside the velvety curtains. Moonlight spilled across the night, painting the snow-covered forest with muted gold and silver. Leafless trees sprang from the earth in a wide arch, almost kissing the heavens.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d I muttered. I\u2019d never seen so many trees or so much uncultivated land.</p><p>A lone figure caught and held my gaze as it emerged from the house. A man. He was tall, his white hair blending with the snow as he disappeared inside a two-story brick garage. Kyrin. I sucked in a breath. A moment later, a black Jag sped from the garage and onto a gravel road.</p><p>Where was he going? I lifted my hand to the window, and the chilly glass against my over-warm skin made me gasp. What was he planning to do?</p><p>For the moment, the answers didn\u2019t matter, so I wasn\u2019t going to worry about them. He was gone, and I could use that to my advantage, could hopefully find some sort of outside communication device.</p><p>Servants milled around all the rooms, going about their duties. No one said a word to me while I explored the entire house. An hour later, I still had not found a single phone unit or computer. I approached a servant, intent on questioning her, but her eyes widened in horror and she raced away. The others soon followed.</p><p>\u201cI give up,\u201d I said, throwing my hands in the air. Damn, damn, damn. I stomped back into Kyrin\u2019s bedroom and plopped onto the bench beside the hearth. I used the time alone to work at the armband, trying to somehow unwind it. The metal remained firm and unyielding.</p><p>While I was distracted, a female servant emerged from her hiding place and rushed to the door, a haze of white hair and violet froth. She slammed the heavy wood, then clicked the lock in place.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d I called, already on my feet.</p><p>Racing footsteps greeted my ears. I dropped back into my seat.</p><p>Two hours passed. Two miserable hours.</p><p>I wrote down every experiment I could think of that could be performed on babies. By the time I got to number six, I wanted to vomit. My hatred for Atlanna increased. My desire to kill her increased.</p><p>I had to find her. Stop her. Destroy her.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t Kyrin tell me more about her and her experiments? Was he afraid of her? No, the man didn\u2019t seem to be afraid of anything. Not even me. I sighed. How the hell was I going to find her?</p><p>Hinges squeaked as someone slowly opened the bedroom door. I jolted to my feet.</p><p>\u201cDo not hurt me,\u201d an Arcadian woman said, peeking inside. \u201cI come bearing food and drink. I mean you no harm.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sagged with disappointment. Had it been Kyrin, I could have beat out some of my frustrations. \u201cEnter,\u201d I said.</p><p>She did so wearily. She wore the same type of open, feminine gown that I wore, only hers was light purple, just like her eyes. She radiated youth and vibrancy, even while she trembled with fear.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a moment?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice gentle. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask you some questions.\u201d</p><p>Without a word and without a glance in my direction, she placed a tray piled high with fruits and wine atop the desk, the sweet scent of melon wafting all around her, then sprinted from the room.</p><p>\u201cMerla,\u201d I heard her say, and the bolts slid in place once again. Obviously the word meant lock.</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Just to prove how ridiculous locks were, I snatched up a small, solid sculpture and stalked to the door. I intended to slam the thick metal into the door\u2019s hinges, but before I reached it, I felt my eyes heat\u2014actually heat as I glared\u2014and the hinges shattered of their own accord, raining like broken glass onto the silver rug. The entrance fell open. I heard the woman yelp and watched her back disappear as she scampered down the hall, putting as much distance between us as she could.</p><p>Horrified, I dropped the sculpture to the floor and heard the heavy thump, thump of dismantled pieces. I rubbed my eyes, but they had already cooled.</p><p>What the goddamn hell was wrong with me? How was I doing things like that? I knew I was different, but these things were too different. These things were freaky different.</p><p>A tremor raced down my limbs. I\u2019d pretended the slowdown thing hadn\u2019t happened. I\u2019d pretended the beer incident hadn\u2019t happened, and neither had happened again. This wouldn\u2019t happen again either. Like the others, I\u2019d pretend it had never happened.</p><p>Determined, I walked back to the desk and sat. Work. I needed to work. I spent twenty minutes constructing a chart about Kyrin. If anything could consume my thoughts, it was that man.</p><p>He wanted my trust, and honestly, despite everything, I was well on my way to giving it. He desired his sister\u2019s release. That showed loyalty. He hadn\u2019t hurt me physically, even though I\u2019d knocked him around. That showed discipline. He\u2019d even helped me through my panic at being tied. That showed compassion. He wanted to atone for past sins, and saw killing Atlanna as a way to do that. That showed remorse.</p><p>He operated on his own scale of justice and righteousness. He was a law unto himself. But Kyrin wouldn\u2019t kill an innocent. He\u2019d had numerous chances to kill me, and I was far from innocent. He\u2019d always been careful not to hurt me.</p><p>I was ready to talk to him again. I needed to talk to him again. But the wall clock continued to tick away the midnight hours without his return.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>I spent several hours prowling through the house, this time searching for clues about Kyrin, about Atlanna. I learned Kyrin had expensive tastes\u2014in everything. Even underwear. He was meticulous and didn\u2019t like clutter, and he left nothing personal out in the open. He was a guarded man. And very smart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where the hell was he?</p><p>I spent the next hour running up and down the staircase for exercise. Toward the end, my arms grew shaky and my legs burned. Sweat ran down my back, and air singed my lungs. I managed to exhaust myself...and fuel my anger with Kyrin. How dare he leave me here like this, with this damn unremovable armband.</p><p>I trudged into the bathroom. The floor tile boasted burgundy and cerulean porcelain, the wall gold-plated marble. The winding, double-hinged faucet cost more than I made in a year. Had I not been a prisoner, I might have enjoyed the extravagance.</p> <p>After programming the wall unit, I stepped into the shower. I yelped when water, actual hot, steaming water, burst from the pipes. I almost jumped out of my skin, in fact. But as the water continued to rain upon me, I relaxed. It felt so...good. Odd, but good. Soothing. No wonder people used to bathe this way.</p><p>When I emerged, I was deliciously wet, my muscles unknotted. A new gown was waiting for me upon the bed, this one crisscrossed pink and creamy white. Pink, for the love of God. Scowling, I slithered my moist body into the ultra-soft material and sank onto the bed. I stared up at the vaulted ceiling. Why me?</p><p>Usually I didn\u2019t sleep at night, since I had to be on the street, prowling for predators. I slept during the day. Yet, as I listened to the wind howl outside the window, and heard the branches scratch against the glass, my eyelids began to feel heavy. The mattress was soft...so soft.</p><p>Sleep soon claimed me.</p><p>Dreams instantly overtook my mind. This time, I saw Dare, only he wasn\u2019t a child. He appeared eighteen, yet his eyes held a fountain of worldly, seedy knowledge that had never been there before. I ran to him. He didn\u2019t open his arms. He turned away from me.</p> <p>I ground to a halt, my stare boring into his back. Why had he done that? Why had he turned away? He\u2019d never done that before.</p><p>His form twisted, and suddenly I was chasing an alien through a shopping mall. A Mec. His skin pulsed green with his fear as he looked over his shoulder at me. He shoved humans aside in his haste to escape. I had my gun drawn and finally had a clear shot. I fired.</p><p>Bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>He tumbled down, taking a human female with him. She screamed. And then all went silent. I raced to the body and kicked him aside, intending to free the woman. Her features were frozen. The Mec had stabbed her on the way down.</p><p>I dropped to my knees in horror.</p><p>\u201cArise, Mia,\u201d someone in the crowd said, a lyrical vibration in the undercurrents of their voice. \u201cKyrin returns soon.\u201d</p> <p>I awoke with a gasp, my fingers gripping the sheet.</p><p>My gaze darted left and right. I was alone. Yet the words Kyrin returns soon still rang in my ears. Confusion consumed me as my dreams replayed in my mind. First, Dare rejected me. Then my vision spoke directly to me. Both were new occurrences, and I didn\u2019t know what to make of either of them.</p><p>At least, if Dream Mia was to be believed, Kyrin was alive and well and due here at any moment.</p><p>I shoved my way from the bed, dislodging my limbs from the tangle of linens. When my feet hit the carpet, I glanced down and frowned with distaste. I still wore the pink gown; the flimsy thing hadn\u2019t magically disappeared. Turning in every direction, I blinked at my image in the wall mirror. I looked too feminine, like I was weak and incapable and needed a big strong man to take care of me. I much preferred my huntress slacks and top. And boots. God, I loved my boots. Ass-kicking wasn\u2019t much fun in anything else.</p><p>I sailed past the bedroom entrance, down the polished stair-case, and into the kitchen, where the sweet scent of caffeine greeted me. Several Arcadian servants, both male and female, flittered about with morning chores. All but one sped from the room after spotting me.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d I said to the remaining woman. I plopped onto a waiting barstool. \u201cI need coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get. I get for you,\u201d she said. She possessed the white hair and purple eyes common to her kind, yet she lacked the grace and facial beauty I\u2019d seen in the others. She offered me a soft smile. \u201cYou like sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have real sugar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I usually took it as thick as motor oil, but I couldn\u2019t resist real sugar. \u201cMake it half and half, then. Half coffee. Half sugar.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her approval and dried her hands on her gauzy apron. \u201cGlennie like hers that way, too.\u201d</p><p>Pensive, I tilted my chin and watched her bustle about, shuffling through cabinets, lifting a crystal pitcher. My ears perked as she hummed a song under her breath. Here was an alien who didn\u2019t cower in fear at my very presence. She appeared calm, relaxed even. Unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cMind if I ask you a few questions, Glennie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk, ask,\u201d she said. \u201cI glad to answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known Kyrin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do not know,\u201d she said, steam wafting around her as she poured my drink into a plain black mug. \u201cLong time. By your standards, at least.\u201d</p><p>When she handed me the fragrant liquid, I gratefully laced my fingers around the offering. I allowed myself a tentative sip. Perfect, and so deliciously sweet. Not too hot, not too cold. I sucked down the rest. If I\u2019d been alone, I would have licked the cup clean.</p><p>\u201cExactly how long?\u201d I probed.</p><p>Turning back to her duties, she lifted her strong shoulders in a shrug. \u201cFifty years, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I nearly choked from fluid inhalation and pushed my cup aside. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I never kidding.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d known the Arcadians stopped aging physically after a certain point in their lives, but actually hearing the words fifty years associated with the virile-looking Kyrin astounded my mind. The man who had kissed me so passionately was...what? Eighty years old? Ninety?</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Again, the servant shrugged. \u201cThree hundred Earth years would be my guess.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. Three hundred fucking years old. I was attracted to a man, had kissed a man, who should have needed diapers and calcium supplements.</p><p>Why was I even surprised? I wondered next. Of course I\u2019d fall for a guy like that. I\u2019d never lived a normal life. Why start now?</p><p>\u201cDoes he treat you well?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Slivers of awareness stroked the back of my neck, and tingles prickled along my spine. A low heat kindled deep in my belly. A palpable surge of relief and desire swept me. The coffee mug shook in my hands as I resisted the urge to spin around.</p><p>Kyrin had returned.</p><p>How could I long to kiss him and choke him at the same time?</p><p>Unaware, or unconcerned, Glennie kept her back to me, to Kyrin. She clasped a rag in her hand and continued to scrub the counter clean. \u201cHe is a true Arcadian,\u201d she answered. \u201cProud, honorable. Courageous. He treat me very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, gauging her reaction through my lashes, \u201cyou could be saying that because he\u2019s your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah.\u201d Facing me, she leaned against the gleaming silver surface. \u201cHe bring us here when he no have to. He could have leave us in Arcadia, slave to Atlanna.\u201d She shuddered, her expression tight with fear. \u201cYet he fight for us, and bring us through the world-portals.\u201d</p><p>While I, the Angel of Death, caused not a spark of worry in this servant, the thought of Atlanna had her trembling. \u201cWas he a slave to the mighty Atlanna?\u201d He was royalty according to Lilla, but could have been under Atlanna\u2019s spell.</p><p>\u201cThat is enough,\u201d Kyrin said, his voice as warm and rich as I remembered. Glennie hustled back to her duties.</p><p>Slowly, I turned. His hair fell in tangled disarray about his shoulders, and his clothing was dirty and wrinkled. I\u2019d never seen him so disheveled. I...liked it. Made him sexy and raw. Made me want to make him dirtier.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d I said, punctuating each word.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat did you do while I was gone? Were you a good girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Grandpa,\u201d I said, pointing a finger in his direction. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to irritate me today. After leaving me here without telling me where you were going or what you were doing, you\u2019re at the top of my shit list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things, I visited Dallas,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My lips clamped together, and I shook my head. Surely I had misheard. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI visited Dallas.\u201d</p><p>I shot to my feet and raced toward him. \u201cWhat happened? How is he?\u201d The words snagged in my throat, emerging broken and unsure.</p><p>He clasped my hand in his, his palm warm and soothing. \u201cClose your eyes and let me show you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t question him. This was too important. I simply obeyed.</p><p>The moment darkness folded over my eyes, images flashed through my mind.</p><p>Kyrin strode down a long, narrow hallway. There were nurses about, but no one paid him any heed. They couldn\u2019t see him. He moved too quickly, like a human bullet. He slipped inside Dallas\u2019s room and removed the oxygen mask from Dallas\u2019s face. He made a deep incision in his own wrist and placed the torn, bleeding flesh over the dying man\u2019s mouth. At first, Dallas did nothing. Then, like a hungry infant, he sucked greedily, drinking Kyrin\u2019s blood. With each second that passed, Dallas\u2019s color deepened.</p><p>Kyrin released my hand, and my mind went blank.</p><p>My eyelids slowly lifted, and my focus snagged Kyrin\u2019s. Sweat beaded his brow, then tiny rivulets trickled down his temples. Almost too afraid to hope, I rolled away the cuff of his shirt before he could withdraw from me. My eyes widened. A long, jagged scar bubbled the skin of his wrist, matching my own. An hour, maybe two, and his injury would fade completely.</p><p>Amazed by what he\u2019d done, I blinked up at him. He\u2019d done it. He\u2019d saved Dallas.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to think. Didn\u2019t know what to say. My relief and joy were too great. Dallas would live. Dallas would live! My knees weakened, and I almost crashed to the floor in a boneless heap. I grasped Kyrin\u2019s arm and held myself steady, drawing from his strength.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I gulped. He\u2019d done what he\u2019d sworn he would never do. He\u2019d given me something without receiving Lilla in return. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Thank you doesn\u2019t seem good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not thank me yet. Your friend now bears my blood. Arcadian blood. When he awakens, he will not be the same man he was before.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t care. He would be alive, and that was all that mattered. \u201cI do thank you, Kyrin. I thank you with all of my heart.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a steady breath. \u201cThen I accept your thanks.\u201d</p><p>Biting my lip, I stroked my fingertips up the smoothness of his forearm, over the ridged swelling of the scar. \u201cWhy do you still bear the mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deeper the incision, the longer the healing requires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cWhy did you save him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWe need each other, and it was time I did my part.\u201d</p><p>Those words...I didn\u2019t know how to respond. A lump formed in my throat. He had decided to trust me completely. I saw the knowledge in his eyes, and it scared me. Was I worthy of that kind of trust? If I had to betray him to close my case, I would. Only the job mattered. Didn\u2019t it?</p><p>His long lashes dipped in a seductive blink, casting shadows over his cheekbones. \u201cCome. There is something I wish to show you.\u201d</p><p>He extended his hand. I faltered briefly\u2014I don\u2019t know why\u2014then placed my palm in his. As with every time we touched, an electric tingle raced up my arm. I expected it this time, yet was still surprised by its intensity. He led me into the dining room. There he laid his free hand flat against one of the panels and said, \u201cBegin scan.\u201d A yellow glow pulsed between each of his fingers before a single panel split down the middle, revealing a downward staircase.</p><p>\u201cThis is voice and alien flesh activated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not be able to enter without me. Even my servants cannot enter.\u201d</p><p>I was too astonished to comment. We descended the dark flight of stairs, the air clean and welcoming.</p><p>\u201cA hidden room,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand gently in response.</p><p>When we reached the end of the steps, he halted. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis my lair.\u201d</p><p>Bookshelves towered from floor to ceiling, and a huge flat-screen television occupied the center, emitting a spring of colors and shapes. His desk separated the room into two halves. One half boasted shiny oak floorboards, and the other half was softened by a thick faux fur rug.</p><p>Kyrin released my hand, and I flexed my empty fingers, suddenly feeling cold and alone\u2014like I\u2019d felt most of my life.</p><p>If I weren\u2019t careful, I would come to depend on this man.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d I asked, changing the focus of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou will see,\u201d was all he said. Without a glance in my direction, he rooted atop his massive, half-circle desk, separating and stacking papers. \u201cI need but a moment. I did not plan to bring you here so soon.\u201d</p><p>While I waited, I strolled through the chamber and studied the wall hangings. Lilla smiled from all of them, her features perfectly stitched. He\u2019d taken great pains to hang these in order of age. His love for his sister was commendable, his need to protect her admirable. A ripple of longing drifted beneath that knowledge. Lord, I missed Dare, his laughter. His love.</p><p>Sighing, I eased onto a plush emerald chaise in front of the TV.</p><p>\u201cThis Atlanna,\u201d I said, reclining. \u201cI did a computer search on her name, and the only information I discovered was about the mythical island of Atlantis. Are you familiar with that story?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give me his direct attention, but offered casually, \u201cYes. I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny link between the two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could probably say so, yes. Your Atlantis was a world of perfect people. They were strong, intelligent, and beautiful. Atlanna wants that, too.\u201d</p><p>I blinked over at him. \u201cShe thinks to make babies that can conquer the world?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. Her desires run toward creating a perfect race of children she can sell. She does not have money like I do. Perfection always gains top dollar, does it not?\u201d With a satisfied nod, he lifted the fresh stack of paper and eased beside me on the couch. Our knees brushed, causing that ever-present hunger to renew, white-hot and intense.</p><p>His eyes lifted, beseeching mine. \u201cAre you ready for the entire truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you learn what I know, you will be faced with a decision. A decision I am not sure you are prepared to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stronger than I look,\u201d I said. I doubted whatever it was I needed to decide would be difficult. \u201cYou know that firsthand.\u201d</p> <p>A smile played at the corner of his mouth. The very mouth that had kissed and tormented me\u2014in reality and in my dreams.</p><p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI will always fight for what is good and right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you swear this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not question my honor, Kyrin. I said I will and I will.\u201d</p><p>He uttered a resolved sigh. \u201cVery well. I only pray you recall those words,\u201d he said, handing me a newspaper clipping.</p> <p>The headline read:</p><p>LOCAL WOMAN FOUND DEAD</p><p>I read the story and frowned. A human New Britain woman had been discovered dead in an abandoned house. She\u2019d recently had a baby, though the infant had never been found. Suspected cause of death: poison.</p><p>I glanced at the picture of her in the top right corner. A picture of how she\u2019d looked before her death. She\u2019d been very pretty, with short dark hair and wide brown eyes. A young woman, probably no more than twenty-five, who looked like she had many years of happiness ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cNotice the date,\u201d Kyrin instructed.</p><p>I did, and my lips pursed. March 17. But this was dated twenty-nine years ago.</p><p>Kyrin handed me another clipping. Same story. Different woman. Different day. Same year.</p><p>He handed me yet another.</p> <p>And another.</p><p>And another.</p><p>All of the women had disappeared within the same year, all possessed dark, glossy hair and brown eyes, and all were killed by some sort of poison and found nine to thirteen months later, their bodies still distended from recent pregnancy. Not a single baby had been found.</p><p>The similarities between these cases and the current cases were staggering. Yes, my victims were men\u2014well, other than Rianne Harte\u2014but each male had dealt with some aspect of fertility. \u201cDid Atlanna kill these women, too?\u201d As the three-hundred-year-old Kyrin proved, Arcadians aged at a much slower rate than humans.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe might have never learned about her activities if she\u2019d just hidden the bodies. Instead, she places them outside like gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she wanted these women to be found. I only know she used William Steele to draw A.I.R.\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>My brow crinkled, and I fought through a haze of confusion. \u201cWhy would she want our attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that in a moment. Rianne was helping Atlanna, giving her names of the men who fit their needs. When I realized this, I went to Rianne and paid her to stop. That\u2019s why she was doing it, for the money, so she was more than willing to take mine instead.\u201d</p><p>I jerked a hand through my hair. \u201cI\u2019m sure Atlanna could have made more money by selling Arcadian children to humans. I don\u2019t understand why she used humans.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cThe babies were half of each race, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, shook my head. I hadn\u2019t expected such an answer. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to merge alien and human DNA. Our scientists have tried. Many times. They never succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cAtlanna discovered a way. For these women, though,\u201d he said, lifting the newspaper articles, \u201cthe process was not yet perfected, and they died as a result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the babies?\u201d I asked, my throat filling with a hard knot.</p><p>Sadness and shame flickered across his features. He turned away from me. \u201cThey died, as well. When they emerged from the birth canal, their bodies craved both Onadyn and oxygen. The two worked against each other.\u201d</p><p>I clasped his jaw in my hands and forced him to face me completely. My hands were trembling. \u201cTell me how you know this.\u201d</p><p>His shame cresting, he reached up and curled his fingers around my hands, holding me there. He tugged my wrists to his mouth, kissed the soft inner flesh, lingering over my tattoo.</p><p>\u201cI was there,\u201d he said, a torrent of remorse in his voice. \u201cI helped her.\u201d</p><p>I gave no outward reaction. A part of me had been prepared for such a response from him. I\u2019d known he was involved somehow, that he needed to atone for something, but I hadn\u2019t truly expected to hear he\u2019d helped Atlanna.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Had he said anything else, I would have told him to get over himself. To stop acting like a martyr. He\u2019d killed. So what? \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was doing such a wonderful thing. Something miraculous for both our worlds, something that would bring complete harmony between our people. Halflings would be accepted by earthlings. I never meant to hurt those women. Never meant for the babies to suffer. When I realized the babies couldn\u2019t survive, I fought Atlanna every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you hoped to sell the kids too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I would die before I sold a child. Any child. What I did, I did for my people.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI have to make this right. Atlanna has to be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>I agreed 100 percent. \u201cThe experiments failed. So why would she now abduct dark-haired, dark-eyed male humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch coloring is the opposite of the Arcadians and revered by our kind. That is what Atlanna deems perfect. That is what Arcadians would pay the most to possess since she\u2019s trying again to make the halflings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want hard evidence of her culpability,\u201d I said. \u201cEvidence I can take to my superiors. That way we can devote all our manpower to finding and killing her.\u201d</p><p>Grim, he shoved to his feet and stalked to the hearth. There, he lit a fire, and the flames soon crackled and grew, filling the room with the crisp essence of pine. I waited, silent, not pushing for a response. He was struggling inside himself, so for once I showed patience.</p><p>\u201cI have what you need,\u201d he said, as if he hadn\u2019t kept me at the edge of the chaise in suspense. \u201cI have proof of her actions.\u201d</p><p>At his words, a sense of foreboding claimed me\u2014sank razor-sharp talons into me. I swallowed hard, knowing what he was going to say, and it didn\u2019t require psychic abilities.</p><p>Perhaps I had always known.</p><p>I prayed that my instincts were wrong. But they never were.</p><p>Slowly, he turned and faced me. \u201cYou, Mia. You are the proof. You are a halfling, not quite human, not fully alien either.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>I calmly rose from my seat, my face devoid of emotion as I walked to Kyrin. One moment I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do, the next I was raising my hand and slapping him with all the strength I possessed.</p><p>His head whipped to the side, and he rubbed at his lip with his fingers. \u201cDid you do that because you know I\u2019m right, or because you hope to make me withdraw the truth?\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cYou\u2019re contradicting yourself, Kyrin. A few minutes ago, you said all the babies died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said none of the babies born to the human women survived.\u201d</p><p>I hit him again, using my fist this time and cutting his skin. The wound quickly healed. Violence churned inside me every time he opened his mouth. My ears rang as blood rushed to my head.</p><p>\u201cThe man you know as your father truly is your father. But the woman you knew as your mother is no blood relation at all. You are one of Atlanna\u2019s experiments, born to an Arcadian female. This experiment worked only once. We did not understand at the time how we achieved success with you; we only knew that your birth destroyed the woman\u2019s womb, and she was unable to conceive again.\u201d He gripped my shoulders, forcing me to hold his gaze, to face the truth. \u201cUntil now, that is. She has found a way to duplicate the procedure, and she is using human men to impregnate her Arcadian women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalflings do not exist, therefore I am not a halfling. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have psychic abilities,\u201d he said, cutting off my words. A steely determination reflected within the darkening purple luminance of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cMany humans do,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cYou are able to track and kill aliens other hunters never find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work hard.\u201d My awkward attempt to convince myself of the impossibility of this seemed like nothing more than wasted breath.</p><p>\u201cI saw the way you moved that day, when Atlanna attacked us.\u201d He growled low in his throat, a sound of deep frustration, and shook me once, twice. \u201cWhat will it take to prove your origins?\u201d</p><p>I had no answer for him. I didn\u2019t know what would convince me when I didn\u2019t really want to be convinced. I\u2019d spent so many years of my life hating other-worlders. Hunting them. Killing them. To be one of them...to be all that my father hated...</p><p>But what else explained how I\u2019d slowed down the world as I myself had sped up? What else explained how I\u2019d drawn that beer bottle to me without touching it? What else explained how I had shattered those door hinges with merely a gaze?</p><p>I pressed my lips together as another thought swept through me. In my vision about Dallas, I\u2019d seen one alien and one human. I\u2019d thought Isabel was the alien and I the human. I\u2019d thought\u2014Bile rose in my throat. Oh my God.</p><p>Kyrin covered his face with his hands. \u201cI tried to defeat Atlanna myself, all those years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried. And I failed. Her power for mind control surpasses even Lilla\u2019s. I\u2019ve known since the first man disappeared that I cannot face her alone, so I\u2019ve done little things to hinder her. I spoke to the men, befriended them. Warned them. That didn\u2019t slow her down. I knew I needed you. You can defeat her. Power churns inside you, churns as deeply and aggressively as an ocean storm, and you have only to reach inside yourself to find it.\u201d</p><p>My teeth ground together. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense it. Just as you sense my power whenever I walk into a room. But more than that, you...you are Atlanna\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lying fucking bastard,\u201d I spat. Maybe I could accept being a halfling. Maybe. What I could not accept was being related to a monster like Atlanna. How dare he even utter those words.</p><p>He grabbed hold of my wrists, preventing me from striking him. \u201cYou are Atlanna\u2019s daughter,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYour powers are as numerous and great as hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. Just shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know how you came to live with your father when Atlanna meant to raise you. I only know that Atlanna followed you here. And so, too, did I.\u201d</p><p>Violently I shook my head in denial. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Your father knows this to be true. You have only to ask him.\u201d</p><p>Hate the aliens, Mia, my dad always said. Despise them. They are responsible for all our troubles.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cDeep inside, you know the truth.\u201d His voice was so gentle yet held the dangerous power of a whirlwind.</p><p>He strode to a locked safe where he murmured a single command, the word unfamiliar to me. The safe door creaked open, and he withdrew a silver chain and locket. \u201cEvery Arcadian possesses one of these. A kalandra, we call them. Inside the center, they showcase a beloved moment in our lives. Sometimes the moment has happened, sometimes it has yet to happen. Here is yours.\u201d</p><p>Mine? The color drained from my face as he approached me. Dangling the chain from his finger, he reached toward me. I pinched it between my fingers and held it from view. I wasn\u2019t ready to look. I kept my gaze on him. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have seen how quickly I move.\u201d He gave me a wry smile. \u201cNeed I say more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I continued to hold the necklace away from me. I sat there, gathering my courage, battling a twisted mountain of turmoil. I blinked, gulped. Just do it.</p><p>With a deep breath in, I dragged my gaze from Kyrin, from the far bookshelf, to my fingers. I focused on the locket\u2014and almost sighed in relief. The locket was round and appeared to be nothing more than a small, clear ball. My lips were edging in a mocking smile when I realized something was moving inside. I intensified my study.</p><p>I gasped. In holographic detail, I watched a woman with braided white hair gently rock a bundled infant in her arms. Humming softly\u2014I could actually hear her\u2014she faced the baby. Her profile was the image of mine. Slightly sloped nose, high cheekbones. Full lips.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d she said to the infant, her voice lyrical and soothing. \u201cYou are my perfect angel.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d seen her before. In my dreams...at the parking lot shootout.</p><p>\u201cThat woman is Atlanna,\u201d Kyrin told me, \u201cand she is holding you.\u201d</p><p>My fingers tightened around the locket, blocking the image. That didn\u2019t keep the woman\u2019s voice from fading from my ears. You are my perfect angel. With my free hand, I covered my mouth.</p><p>Atlanna.</p><p>My mother.</p><p>Color drained from my face, and a rush of dizziness swept inside my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyrin sat down and wrapped his arms around me. He drew me close, and I willingly burrowed my face into the hollow of his neck. \u201cAccept what you are, Mia. For your sake. For mine. And for the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Kyrin said. His warm breath fanned the top of my head. \u201cAn Arcadian can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>When he said that, my origins seemed so...affirmed, and my desperation grew. Of their own accord, my fingers curled around his shirt collar. \u201cEverything I know is crumbling,\u201d I said. \u201cHelp me understand.\u201d</p><p>He caressed his hands down my spine, massaged my lower back, then traced his fingers up to my shoulders. He continued the comforting motions as he spoke. \u201cYour father was married to Kane and Dare\u2019s mother when he and Atlanna had an affair. It lasted over a year. Then something happened between them, and your father disappeared, taking you with him. For a while, she abandoned her research in her quest to find you.\u201d</p><p>I allowed his words to flow through me. \u201cIf I accept what you say,\u201d I said, \u201cI will have to accept that my entire life is a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can now live a life of truth,\u201d he said, tightening his hold.</p><p>Could I, though? If A.I.R. heard any of this, I\u2019d be out a job. Aliens were not accepted in that line of work. I might lose the only friends I had. And just what would I do if I lost my job and my friends? They were all I had.</p> <p>\u201cI need to call my dad, Kyrin. I need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>He released me immediately and strode to his desk. Expression resigned, he unearthed a phone and placed the small unit in my hand.</p><p>I spoke my dad\u2019s name, hating the way my voice shook.</p><p>He answered on the fourth ring. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s me, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said again. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Atlanna en Arr my mother?\u201d The words emerged as nothing more than a ragged whisper. I squared my shoulders, forced my throat to obey, and repeated my question. \u201cIs Atlanna en Arr my mother?\u201d</p><p>His breath crackled over the line. I pictured him casually smoking a cigar. \u201cWhy are you asking me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a subject up for discussion, little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Another crackling breath. \u201cYes. She is,\u201d he stated. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together as the truth hit me. Fully hit me. I was a halfling. Atlanna was my mother. \u201cIs that why you stopped loving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered without hesitation, not even trying to deny it. \u201cYou began to look just like her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m half yours, Dad. Doesn\u2019t that mean anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe once.\u201d His tone remained indifferent. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done everything you ever wanted. I\u2019ve killed aliens. I\u2019ve hated aliens. I could have destroyed them all, and that wouldn\u2019t have made a difference to you, would it?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. He didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take me from Atlanna? Why didn\u2019t you just leave me with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seduced Kane,\u201d he growled, showing his first emotion. \u201cI found them together, and she laughed. Laughed!\u201d Now he laughed, a cruel sound. \u201cI killed Kane and managed to injure her. And you know what? That wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted you so badly, I took you from her.\u201d He chuckled again. \u201cI made you hate your own kind. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t let him finish. I said, \u201cEnd,\u201d and let the earpiece drop into Kyrin\u2019s waiting hand.</p><p>My shoulders squared, I pushed to my feet and consciously placed one foot in front of the other until I stood beside the bookshelf. I am a halfling, and Atlanna en Arr is my mother. The knowledge tore me apart inside, slicing deep, leaving raw, open wounds.</p><p>Obviously top brass hadn\u2019t wanted us to know halflings could, indeed, be created. That explained why they\u2019d removed all mention of fertility from the A.I.R. files.</p><p>My eyelids squeezed firmly shut, and a painful knot grew in my throat. The future I\u2019d imagined for myself was now shrouded in uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cAtlanna is more powerful than I have ever been,\u201d Kyrin said, and I knew he hoped to distract me from my inner turmoil. \u201cBut you...you have the greatest of her strengths coursing through your veins. Once you tap into that power, you can kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill my own mother?\u201d I screamed. He actually wanted me to execute my own mother\u2014the woman who sang so sweetly and had called me her greatest treasure?</p><p>Kyrin cursed under his breath. \u201cI feared this would happen. I feared you would do this. Bad people are bad people, Mia, and it is your job to kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d My voice cracked. I was quickly reaching my breaking point, and I suddenly wanted to be alone. I hooked the necklace around my neck. What I was going to do with it, I didn\u2019t know. \u201cGive me some time,\u201d I said, shoving past him.</p><p>I know he saw my shattered spirit in my eyes, but he pushed to his feet with every intention of stopping me. \u201cTwo other men were found dead last night. Raymond Palmer and Anton Stokenberg. If we do not act, the others will soon follow.\u201d</p><p>I halted mid-step, then spun, glaring up at him. Through clenched teeth, I said, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a hunter, just as you are, though I seek a different kind of prey. You stalk aliens. I stalk Atlanna. I followed her, and watched her dispose of them.\u201d</p><p>Fury conquered all of my other emotions. While I had been here sleeping and eating like a queen, two more men had been found dead. Perhaps I could have saved them, perhaps not. Either way, I hadn\u2019t been on the streets, searching for them. No, I\u2019d practically embraced this mini-vacation.</p><p>I had to get out of here. Scowling, I jerked at the armband on my forearm. I jerked until my skin was bruised black and blue from the strain. The thick alloy stubbornly remained in place. My bones were stiff, my muscles achy, when I finally allowed my hands to fall to my sides.</p><p>\u201cTake this damn thing off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, determined. \u201cNot until you calm down. Not until you realize Atlanna might be your mother, but she is still a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d I seethed. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now, this moment, and your actions dictate whether I leave in peace or in pain.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d I strode from the office and to the front door. Without a single interruption in my step, I emerged into the afternoon sun.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Pain clawed from my arm to my head and slashed down all the way to my toes. I kept walking. Dizziness mingled with the ache in my head, both nearly felling me. My steps slowed, became agonizing, and I stumbled. But I didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Keep moving. I had to keep moving.</p><p>The snow froze my bare feet, the needle-sharp pricks of cold almost unbearable, and the farther away I moved from Kyrin\u2019s home, the sharper my suffering became. Hurt. Hurt so desperately. Anguished screams were lodged in my throat by the time I reached the shade tree in his garden.</p><p>Footsteps echoed in my ears, and then suddenly I was propelled toward the ground by a force greater than myself. Strong arms wrapped around me. Kyrin, I realized. He hoped to stop me. I fought against him as he turned me midair, taking the brunt of the impact upon himself when we hit. We rolled several feet.</p><p>When we stopped, I sat astride him. I shoved against his chest, but he clasped my arm, and with a wave of his fingers, the armband dropped away.</p><p>\u201cYou are free,\u201d he ground out. \u201cFree.\u201d</p><p>His words penetrated my mind, and I realized then that my pain was already gone, that he\u2019d actually removed my shackle. Shock beat through me, as cold and real as the snow around me. I met Kyrin\u2019s stare, his words echoing through my mind. You are free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I stopped. I would not say thank you when he never should have imprisoned me to begin with.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing you can do right now that A.I.R. isn\u2019t already doing. You\u2019re upset, and you need me. Just like I need you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I did need him. Just like I needed to forget, if only for a moment. The air sparked between us, tiny pinpoints of white-hot lightning and heat. Heat that was always present between us.</p><p>I studied him. His eyes were heavy-lidded, and his teeth were parted on a groan, as if he was in deep pain. His arousal strained between my legs, hard and potent. He didn\u2019t ask my permission, he simply tangled his hands in my hair and jerked my mouth to his. I didn\u2019t protest. No, I thrust my tongue into his mouth and met him stroke for stroke. I savored the sweetness of his taste, like summer rain and carnal desires.</p><p>Right then nothing mattered except the feel, the touch, the pleasure of this man. Not my parents. Not the past. Not my job. My fingers tore at the middle of his shirt, ripping the black material down the middle, sending those stubborn buttons flying through the air with a pop.</p><p>He rolled me on my back, and the snow made me gasp. So cold. Yet my skin felt so hot. I arched up against him, my legs twining around his. I wanted more. Needed more. I pushed him over, straddled him again, and scraped my nails over the solid wall of his chest. Several ice crystals had melted against the heat of his skin. I licked away every drop.</p><p>He moaned. Kissed me. Then tore his mouth away. I growled at the loss. He rolled me over a second time and jumped to his feet, violet fire blazing in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he said. He scooped me up into his arms.</p><p>\u201cNot this way. I want you here. Now. In the daylight. In the snow.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to wait until we reached the inside of his house. I didn\u2019t want him in a soft bed, nice and cozy. I wanted him in a place that matched my desire. Some place untamed. Wild. Wicked.</p><p>Some place raw.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he agreed. He carried me into a hidden cove shadowed by towering naked branches. The walls were man-made and warmed to the touch. Hot, just like my blood.</p><p>Kyrin eased me to my feet. We stood there, and our eyes met and held. Only a whisper separated us. I reached between our bodies, unfastened his pants, and shoved them down his legs. He kicked out of them and was suddenly naked. Unabashedly aroused. God, he was beautiful. Like a sculpture. Pale and hard, tall and majestic, with dark tattoos scattered across his abdomen. My tongue descended and followed the designs, and his heady flavor, a mix of desire and man, fueled my need.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d I asked, licking each symbol.</p><p>His arms circled my shoulders, and his fingers brushed my neck. \u201cThe light shall overpower the darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fits,\u201d I muttered. And it did. My palms slid across his chest. My fingertips circled around his small, puckered nipples. He was so solid. So rippled with sinew. I had pure, unadulterated power at my fingertips, and I liked it. I liked him.</p><p>This man challenged me in a way I\u2019d never been challenged. At times he irritated the hell out of me, and he never bowed to my dictates. Perhaps I was insane, but I admired those qualities in him.</p><p>\u201cI have wanted you,\u201d he said, his words intermixed with nipping kisses on my jaw and neck, his breath labored, \u201csince the first moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He uttered a warm, husky chuckle, then crushed his lips to mine. Arousal pounded through me, frantic for release as his tongue dove into my mouth. His hands tunneled beneath the silky material of my crisscrossed top. And his fingertips traced the edge of my nipples. I shivered.</p><p>Desire pooled between my legs. I was wet. I was ready. Ready for him and only him. I needed the hard, thick length of him inside me. Pounding in and out. Maybe slow at first, but growing in speed.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d I beseeched. \u201cSee what you do to me.\u201d Eyes closed in surrender, I guided one of his hands under the froth of my skirt, up my inner thigh and onto the edge of my panties.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d he muttered huskily, then slipped past the fragile silk barrier.</p><p>\u201cThere. Right\u2014Yes! There.\u201d Unable to stop myself, I arched into his touch, creating more pressure, more friction. \u201cDo you feel how much I need you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are liquid fire,\u201d he praised. He dropped to his knees in front of me, keeping one hand on my panties. The other caressed a path under my skirt and up my feet, calves, and thighs. \u201cI want more. So much more.\u201d Reverence dripped from his words.</p><p>\u201cThen take it,\u201d I said, my hips writhing as he touched me.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said. \u201cI will take everything you have to give, and then I will take even more.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the pink panties from my legs and tossed them to the ground. With a flick of his wrist, he parted the folds of my skirt. He didn\u2019t have to spread my legs; I did so eagerly, willingly, and in the next heartbeat, he was kissing the wetness between my thighs. At the first flick of his tongue, I exploded. Fire, joy, pleasure, all seared me, and my head reeled. My knees shook. I gripped his head, losing touch of where I was, who I was, only feeling an incredible shiver race through me again and again.</p><p>And just when I thought I might die from it, Kyrin kissed my heat again until I could only gasp his name. He tasted me, sucked me, made me want him all over again.</p><p>My head arched back as delight ripped across my nerve endings. I moaned and cried out, the sounds escaping on ragged catches of breath. My eyelids closed, and I chewed at my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I told him, panting. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He uttered another chuckle, and the vibrations tickled my thighs. \u201cAlways the commander,\u201d he said.</p><p>Only when I screamed his name again did he stand. He propped his arms on the wall behind me, trapping me in his embrace. \u201cYou are beautiful when you come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to see you that way,\u201d I said. I curled my fingers around his penis. He sucked in a hiss of breath and muttered something in a language I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI want to see you when you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said brokenly. \u201cI will savor the rest of you first.\u201d A heartbeat passed, a mere whisper of time, before his lips touched mine. His tongue moved over my mouth with heady slowness, exotic and consuming. I tasted myself, and it excited me, reminding me of where he\u2019d been and what he\u2019d done. I moved my hand up and down his length, stroking.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he said, his voice growing more hoarse with every word, watching me through the thick shield of his lashes, \u201cthat you are the most passionate woman I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad.\u201d His hands slid languidly up my sides and cupped my jaw. He planted breathy little kisses and nips over my nose, my eyes, my chin.</p><p>Warmth skidded along my spine. \u201cI wasn\u2019t glad at first. I was pissed.\u201d I palmed the heavy weight of his testicles.</p><p>A bead of sweat ran down his temple, and his words seemed even more labored. \u201cIf this is the way you channel your anger, I\u2019ll strive to infuriate you more often.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled huskily. He tugged me to my tiptoes for another kiss. While his tongue worked magic, he shifted his hands under my butt and urged my legs around his waist. I spread my thighs and hooked my ankles at his back until I straddled him and cradled his erection without actual penetration.</p> <p>One of his hands flattened against the base of my throat, so warm, so inviting, a heartbeat away from dipping inside my shirt and cupping my breast. But that strong, masculine hand remained in place, teasing, taunting. Tormenting.</p><p>As one expectant minute ticked by and then another, my nipples hardened painfully. The rosy peaks anticipated his touch and strained against the silkiness of my top. I shouldn\u2019t have been this excited. I\u2019d already come twice.</p><p>\u201cKyrin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia.\u201d With his eyes squeezed tightly shut, he traced a path down my sternum. He traced the seam back up again, never once deviating from that path. \u201cI told you I want to savor you. Memorize you and brand you. Later is the time for wild and rushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want wild now.\u201d</p><p>He only uttered a soft but strained chuckle. \u201cIn this I will have my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see how long you can hold out.\u201d I\u2019d long since lost control over my body where he was concerned, and strangely, I didn\u2019t mourn the loss.</p><p>He pressed his erection against me, and I gasped. I rubbed my chest against his, urging him on. He moaned, bit my collarbone. His hands were everywhere, all over me. Every so often he paused to simply look at me, or to whisper erotic promises in my ear, but always he left me aching for more.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good against me, angel. I have to touch more of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d I groaned, then, \u201cNo, no,\u201d when he did. I was on fire for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever imagine that a human and an alien would feel so perfect together?\u201d he asked. His tongue licked and sucked my exposed neck and chest. He kneaded my butt. I writhed; I melted into him; I tried to force his hands where I needed them most, but he always thwarted my efforts by drawing his palms a safe distance away.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Kyrin. Let\u2019s finish this.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was a taut, desperate purr. His hands dipped inside my gown. But instead of cupping and squeezing as I so ravenously craved, he teased a fingertip around my nipple. The action only increased my frustration, my need. How was he doing this to me? Making me want, need more?</p><p>Then he grazed the tip of my waiting nipple with his teeth.</p> <p>My hips jerked, and I almost came again. \u201cYes, there. Right there! Do that again.\u201d</p><p>He gave my other nipple the same treatment\u2014a light grazing, followed quickly by the heat of his tongue. My lower body arched into him. Just one more touch. One more.</p><p>\u201cWhere else do you need me?\u201d he demanded, all touches ceased.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere, damn it.\u201d I reached between our bodies and wrapped my hand around the hardness of his cock. Watching his face intently, I led his hand to the juncture between my legs and guided his fingers through my dark curls. Then I rocked forward.</p><p>Contact. I moaned. His hand darted away. I growled and followed. In the next instant, I heard fabric rip, felt cool air. I was suddenly completely naked and flat on my back. Kyrin stood over me, his chest heaving, his cock ready. His hair seemed lighter than a ray of sunshine, and his eyes...his eyes were blazing with passion, bright and crystalline. He gazed down at my body, at my spread legs and wet arousal.</p><p>\u201cYou amaze me,\u201d he said. Muscles bunching, he knelt and crawled over me. We both gasped as skin met skin. \u201cI\u2019d hoped to prolong this, to prolong our pleasure, but you are driving me crazy with your little moans and your bold caresses.\u201d He rocked himself against me, careful not to enter me.</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d I gasped. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>He did, gliding back and forth in the slick V of my thighs while I rubbed myself against him. He kissed my breasts, dragged his teeth over my nipples, and positioned himself for penetration. He poised himself at the precipice, not actually pushing inside.</p><p>His teeth clenched. \u201cOnce I take you, you are mine. My woman. No other man can have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d I agreed on a moan, not caring about the consequences of such a vow.</p><p>He plunged inside me.</p><p>We both cried out at the perfection of it, the exquisite rightness. My nails scored his back as his lips crushed into mine, taking, giving. For the first time in my life, everything felt completely right.</p><p>He was so big and thick inside me, sliding in and out. He filled me completely. Passion uncurled with his every movement, seeking total satisfaction. I used the strength of my legs and rolled him to his back so I could ride him, so I could command the depth of his penetration, the swiftness of our pace. I moved up him, then down, increasing the delicious friction.</p><p>He maneuvered me to my back.</p><p>And I immediately switched our positions again. \u201cKyrin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he said. My name was like a reverent prayer on his lips, and he allowed me dominance this time. His hands slid from my hips to grasp my ass and jerk me tighter against him. We began moving faster. Faster still.</p><p>I\u2019d never felt so alive. So free. I wanted this feeling to last forever. I didn\u2019t want reality to intrude.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Kyrin.Deeper.\u201d</p><p>He ground against me, hard. Perfectly. Deeply.</p><p>He reached between our bodies and circled my clitoris with his thumb. I gasped, cried out. My inner walls tightened and spasmed against him, and he moved faster. Harder. Deeper. Just like I needed. Almost instantly, another orgasm catapulted me to the stars, this one stronger than the last. Only when he heard his name rip from my throat did he spill inside me.</p><p>When the last pulse subsided, he thrust me to my back and collapsed on top of me. A long while passed before the hazy sexual fog lifted from my mind.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, Kyrin was gazing down at me, his lips soft with tenderness. \u201cI have waited for you my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me the rest of this day. Tomorrow we can deal with the outside world.\u201d</p><p>Immediately I opened my mouth to tell him no. There was so much I needed to do. Call Jack. Search for Atlanna. Visit Dallas. I had a case to wrap, but after everything I\u2019d learned today, I needed a bit of normalcy in my life. More pressing than any of those, however, was my need to be with this man.</p><p>\u201cI...would like that,\u201d I said.</p><p>He grinned and gave me a swift kiss. We didn\u2019t bother with clothing. We didn\u2019t need it. I allowed him to carry me inside his house\u2014into his bedroom.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Later that night, I awoke in a dirty alley behind an abandoned grocery store. Crickets chirped a lazy tune while I oriented myself. Cold, pungent air. Hard ground. Moonlight. I blinked. This didn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019d been in a bed. A soft, warm bed with Kyrin.</p><p>He\u2019d climaxed.</p><p>I\u2019d climaxed.</p><p>Then...What?</p><p>I\u2019d fallen asleep, obviously. But how the hell had I\u2019d gotten here? I shifted my gaze in every direction. The night sky winked above me, discarded papers and food cartons whirling on the concrete.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t I shivering? I wondered, looking down at my body. A thick coat draped across my shoulders. I wore thick socks and heavy boots, and leather pants hugged my legs. I didn\u2019t recall getting dressed, which meant Kyrin had done it for me.</p><p>Where the hell was that lover of mine?</p><p>As if sensing my thoughts, he appeared beside me and crouched down. I sat up, noticing that we were hidden behind a stack of reeking garbage. My nose wrinkled in distaste. No one was nearby, and neither was there any noise. Kyrin didn\u2019t spare me a glance, but kept his attention directly in front of him. \u201cI hope you do not mind, but I transported us here.\u201d</p><p>I would have loved to watch the whole transportation thing, but let it slide. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWaiting,\u201d he answered just as softly.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d The man needed to learn I\u2019d never settle for half-answers.</p><p>Now he leveled me with an intense gaze. \u201cAtlanna. I want you to see firsthand that she is not the motherly woman you want her to be.\u201d</p><p>I instantly went on alert and moved beside him on my knees, staring at the dark alley he had watched moments before. Eagerness thrummed in my blood. Eagerness...and dread.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>\u201cWhen she appears,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are to study her, nothing more. No matter what happens. Before we attack her, you must see how she utilizes some of her powers.\u201d</p><p>I almost screamed a denial. Almost. I knew studying the enemy and learning his weaknesses and strengths before jumping into action was the right way to hunt\u2014and win. I knew that. Yet my impatience was strong. I yearned for some sort of confrontation with Atlanna.</p><p>\u201cGive me a gun anyway.\u201d I said. \u201cI will\u2014\u201d</p><p>A twig snapped.</p><p>I sliced off my words and went completely still.</p><p>At the far end of the alley, a woman suddenly appeared from the shadows. Moonlight bathed her in youth and beauty, paying nothing but tribute to her fair skin and curly mane of white hair. Black pants and a long black leather jacket draped her, showcasing her curves. She looked like a hunter. She looked like me.</p><p>Atlanna.</p><p>Kyrin stiffened.</p><p>I watched as a body floated behind the woman. She blinked, and the bulky, naked form fell unceremoniously onto the ground. Shit. Her telekinesis must be unbelievably strong to lift such weight.</p><p>As a wave of her energy hit me, she paused and frowned. Her gaze darted in every direction, searching for something\u2014or some one.</p><p>My heart raced. I controlled the urge to stride to her. To strangle her. To hug her. Before I took my next breath, she disappeared in the shadows.</p><p>The winter wind kicked up a notch, swirling and whistling around the alley. Keen disappointment nearly felled me, and I massaged the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cShe sensed us,\u201d Kyrin said.</p><p>\u201cYes. She probably felt a hum of energy in her blood.\u201d Like I felt every time I\u2019m near an Arcadian. I strode to the body, preparing myself for what I\u2019d see. A male. He was naked, his body devoid of any sign of torture. The poor bastard was even smiling. I checked his pulse, just to be sure. \u201cDead,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI wish to God I knew why she was leaving them out. You said William was to get A.I.R.\u2019s attention. What about this one?\u201d</p><p>I dropped my head into my hands. I\u2019d always wanted a mother to love me. Hell, I\u2019d always wanted a mother to love. But my mother had killed this man. My mother was a predatory alien, had done such evil things, and just thinking about them made me sick. I was duty bound to hunt and kill her. And yet...</p><p>\u201cAmusement, probably,\u201d Kyrin said. \u201cThere was no way to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to call Jack. He needs to know about\u2014\u201d</p><p>A familiar, pungent scent filled my nose. \u201cSorry, angel. You are not ready, and too much do I fear for your life.\u201d</p><p>The last thought to drift through my mind before darkness claimed me was that I was going to murder Kyrin and his damn sleeping potion.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d I shouted as I awoke.</p><p>Sunlight streamed through the burgundy curtains, illuminating the spacious decadence of Kyrin\u2019s bedroom. Honey oak floors gleamed, the elaborate vanity glistened, and the sconces and jasmine-scented candles glittered.</p><p>I was sick and tired of being drugged when he wanted to move me.</p><p>I searched the room for Kyrin, but he was gone.</p><p>As soon as I found him, he was going to give me his phone unit so I could call the station house and tell Jack everything I\u2019d learned\u2014except for the part about Atlanna being a blood relation. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever broach that particular subject. And I\u2019d probably leave out the part about sleeping with Kyrin, too.</p><p>I abandoned the warmth of the comforter and trekked to the bathroom. There, I brushed my teeth and hair and programmed the wall console for a shower. The water burst on, deliciously waiting for me. I was just about to step into the tub when a flash of gold caught the corner of my eye. Filled with a sense of dread, I scrubbed mist from the mirror.</p><p>That rat bastard!</p><p>My fists clenched as potent fury consumed me. If I\u2019d had a pyre-gun, I would have found Kyrin and blasted his ass to ashes. He\u2019d done it. He\u2019d really done it. After every erotic thing we\u2019d done together, after promising to trust each other, he\u2019d returned the armband to my bicep, keeping me a goddamn prisoner here.</p><p>I jerked on the fresh blue sheath folded neatly on the sink rim. \u201cBastard,\u201d I growled under my breath. \u201cI\u2019d thought he meant to free me permanently. But no, he meant to keep me here all along.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stormed through the mansion, pushed my way past his servants. They scrambled out of my way. Kyrin was nowhere to be found. A low growl worked its way past my throat. On top of everything else, he still thought to play detective on his own. His death would be my greatest pleasure.</p><p>I kicked and clawed the hidden door to his office, but the stupid thing wouldn\u2019t budge. Did he think I\u2019d be okay with this? That I would forgive him? What, give the little woman a few mind-shattering orgasms, and she\u2019d be content to wait at home?</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d I spat again.</p> <p>Whipping around, I saw I was alone. Smart of the servants to hide. In my frustration, I might have accidentally hurt them. I stalked to the kitchen and withdrew a cooking blade from a wooden sheath. Before the day ended, I was going to hack this armband from my body. Then I would await Kyrin\u2019s return. And I knew that with each second that ticked by and he remained absent, my fury would grow hotter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to skewer him alive,\u201d I said, slamming down on a barstool. \u201cI\u2019m going to rip out his heart and feast on it for days. I\u2019ll tie his intestines around his neck and choke him to death.\u201d I jabbed the tip of the knife under the band.</p><p>\u201cOh, and just who do you intend to torture this way?\u201d a husky female voice asked behind me.</p><p>I quickly jumped up and spun, knife braced and ready. When I saw who stood there, my jaw dropped open. Atlanna. I hadn\u2019t sensed her presence, yet there she stood, a vision in creamy lavender cloth. My first thought was that of a hunter. I wished I had my pyre-gun. I wished I had a tape recorder.</p><p>My second thought was simply that of a daughter. I wondered what she thought of me as she examined me so intently.</p> <p>Up close, her uptilted violet eyes, high cheekbones, and pixie nose were the epitome of perfection. Even the arch of her eyebrows dared not deviate from the flawlessness of her features. She resembled me, yet was so much more delicate.</p><p>Gold armlets snaked around her biceps, and bracelets adorned her wrists and ankles. Her glitter-soft white hair nearly reached the floor, and was plaited in several braids. Innocence enveloped her, glowed lovingly around her. Deceptively.</p><p>Two separate needs battled for dominance. I could run to her, accept her as my mother, and talk to her. Or I could use the blade I held in my hands and end the mess this Arcadian had created.</p><p>I did neither.</p><p>I simply stood conflicted, my heart rate increasing, my palms sweating. I was so filled with curiosity. What would my life have been like if I had remained with her as a child? Would I have known the love I\u2019d always craved? Would I have killed innocent humans to please her?</p><p>I was supposed to hate her, and I did hate her on so many levels.</p> <p>Take her into custody, the huntress in me cried. Question her. Find the missing men, if any of them are still alive. Find the babies. Still, I couldn\u2019t force myself to move. To act as I\u2019d been trained.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cTo see you.\u201d Her fingers skipped down her braid. \u201cWould you like me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014No.\u201d I shook my head. No matter my needs, that wasn\u2019t an action I could allow.</p><p>She gave me a half smile, and amusement sparkled in her expression. \u201cHolding that knife, you remind me of myself. So strong. So ready to conquer the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept we use our weapons for different reasons.\u201d There. I\u2019d said it. It was the first step in forcing myself to think of her only as a murderer, not a mother.</p><p>\u201cKilling is killing.\u201d Slowly her smile faded, and she leaned her hip against the kitchen doorframe. A hint of anger stiffened her chin. \u201cWhich of us do you think has more fun with our victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t always about fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it about, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the right thing admitting to my crimes? Fine. I did it. I killed the men you found. They had served their purpose, and I learned well not to leave fathers with their babies.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her cold confession, uttered so nonchalantly. I\u2019d never\u2014never\u2014had an alien admit so blatantly to a crime. And yet her confession fit so perfectly with her other actions. Shocking. Uncaring. Bold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brought you to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot mean to convince me that you killed them only to get to me. What about the babies?\u201d I asked, keeping my tone as neutral as hers\u2014a feat that required every ounce of strength I possessed.</p><p>She shrugged, waved a delicate arm through the air, and gave a light chuckle. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d Like a queen before her court, Atlanna strolled around the kitchen, touching and lifting certain items for her inspection, then haplessly dropping them back into place. Wrinkling her nose in distaste, she traced a fingertip over the counter. \u201cI expected Kyrin\u2019s home to appear more...I do not know. Rugged?\u201d</p><p>My teeth ground together so forcefully my jaw almost snapped. \u201cYou do realize you will be executed for your crimes, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans cannot hurt me.\u201d She faced me again, her gaze boring into mine, her eyes thoughtful. \u201cYou, though, could do great damage, I think. You are, after all, my finest creation.\u201d</p><p>Her words sent a rush of anger through me, and I scowled. \u201cYou had nothing to do with shaping me into the woman that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are more mine than your father\u2019s. More alien than human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not like you. I will never be like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mia en Arr. We are the same.\u201d Her beauty glowing in the light, she approached me. \u201cYour father hid you well. I spent years, so many wasted years, searching for you in New Britain. Then I read an article written about New Chicago\u2019s A.I.R. team. There you were, staring out at me from a computer screen. I packed my belongings and traveled here that very day. I\u2019ve watched you, you know. You are everything I wanted you to be.\u201d There was a \u201cbut\u201d in her tone.</p><p>\u201cBut I fight for the wrong team,\u201d I finished for her.</p><p>\u201cYes. There is that small little detail. Small\u201d\u2014a grin flitted across her face\u2014\u201cbut fixable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here, in Kyrin\u2019s home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed your trail of energy last night. That,\u201d she said, her grin becoming sheepish, too innocent for the monster hidden inside, \u201cand I have my people watching Kyrin. The silly man thinks he is so smart, that he sneaks undetected through my home. But I know. I always know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo here we are,\u201d I said, trying for a casual tone.</p><p>\u201cYes, here we are. What better place for our first meeting? A.I.R. does not know where you are; therefore they cannot give me trouble.\u201d She moved directly in front of me, and I smelled the subtle floral fragrance that encompassed her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you that day in the parking lot. Kyrin was my target.\u201d</p><p>Do your job, I told myself. She\u2019s evil. Vile.</p><p>I had to take her down. Duty first and always. Innocent lives rested in this Arcadian\u2019s hands, and if I didn\u2019t snatch them away, she would crush them.</p><p>\u201cHow horrid Kyrin is to keep you here, locked away. Do you plan to kill him? Of course you do.\u201d</p><p>Not giving myself time to think further, I dropped my knife and pounced. Perhaps I should have kept the weapon, but I wasn\u2019t ready to kill her. Not when she might be the only way to find the babies. Not when\u2014I didn\u2019t allow myself to consider the other reason.</p><p>I wrapped my leg around hers and pushed. Because my action was so swift and unexpected, and delivered with expert precision, she fell backward, her expression stunned. I was on top of her in the next instant. By then she had already gained her momentum and unleashed a torrent of power so great, I dropped to my knees with a thud.</p><p>My hands covered my ears, trying to block out the loud, piercing blast of reverberating energy through my head. This was a thousand times worse than the pain I had experienced when stepping outside Kyrin\u2019s home. Wave after wave of agony rushed through me. A scream tore past my throat.</p><p>An eternity passed, or maybe minutes, but I felt a brush of fingertips across my cheek and forced my gaze open. Atlanna crouched in front of me, her features filled with anger, as well as a hint of pride. \u201cNot many could have taken me unaware.\u201d With a simple glide of her fingers, she removed the armband from my bicep. \u201cYou are free now, Mia. Free to kill Kyrin for locking you away.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the ringing inside my head subsided.</p><p>\u201cTake me to the babies and return the human men you abducted,\u201d I croaked. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not finished with them yet,\u201d she said, rising.</p><p>I grasped her hand, meaning to keep her from leaving. When our palms touched, her image filled my mind. I saw her lying on plush carpeting, covered in blood. Whose? Hers? She didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t utter a sound. Was she dead or alive? Who had hurt her?</p><p>I tried to manipulate the vision, hoping to reveal the answers, but the harder I tried, the more the vision faded. No, I almost shouted, unsure whether I spoke to the vision or to Atlanna\u2019s bleeding form. Stay with me. I probed the edge of my consciousness, twisted each image with a mental hand. Soon the vividness of colors and the complexity of shapes evaporated into mist, finally vanishing completely.</p><p>My eyes wide, I stared up at her. She watched me, her lips parted, her features now pale.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d she demanded, clutching my shoulders. \u201cTell me what you saw.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I wouldn\u2019t tell her, didn\u2019t know how to tell her she might perish in the coming days. I didn\u2019t even know how I felt about what I\u2019d seen.</p><p>She released me, stepped two feet away. \u201cI, too, have visions. They are never wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said sadly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know, too, that we sometimes see distortions of the truth?\u201d</p><p>My brows drew together. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d That what I\u2019d seen might not come to pass? That what I\u2019d seen was merely one possibility of what the future held?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She paused, whatever she\u2019d planned to say dying a quick death. \u201cCome to me after you have killed Kyrin. Your...brother would like to see you again.\u201d</p><p>With that, she strode from the house.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>I bolted after her, my footsteps pounding into the wood panels. Just before I reached her, Atlanna glanced over her shoulder, and for a moment of suspended time, our gazes held. \u201cDo not make me wait too long,\u201d she said.</p><p>My head filled with the same intense ringing she\u2019d caused before, and I squeezed my eyes shut as I dropped to the waiting ground. How many minutes passed, I didn\u2019t know. I only knew that when the sound cleared and the pain subsided, I opened my eyes and found myself alone. Atlanna had disappeared as if she\u2019d never stepped into the house.</p><p>Her final words inside the house penetrated my now pain-free mind. Your brother would like to see you again. I blinked once, twice. Kane. The brother I didn\u2019t remember. The brother my father worshipped and thought he\u2019d killed.</p><p>So Kane was with Atlanna. Was probably helping her. I should have been shocked. I wasn\u2019t. Why should anything go right for this shitty case?</p><p>I whipped to my feet, retrieved the knife I\u2019d dropped, and sheathed the sharp blade inside the waist of my skirt. Upstairs, I confiscated a pair of Kyrin\u2019s boots and multiple pairs of socks. The socks I used as stuffing inside the boots, but even then the black leather boots proved several sizes too big and flopped on my feet. I didn\u2019t waste time with pants or a shirt. I simply tugged one of his jackets over my shoulders. The thick material sagged, and the sleeves covered my hands. It\u2019d have to do.</p><p>Urgency hammering through me, I raced outside.</p><p>No street</p><p>signs. No traffic. The afternoon air breathed a frosty cover in every direction as a large expanse of trees and untamed land greeted me. How many miles stood between the city and me? I didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t even see New Chicago\u2019s skyline. I could begin walking, hoping someone would drive past and give me a lift, but...I didn\u2019t like the odds, the waiting. The time involved. Kyrin could return at any moment.</p><p>There had to be another way.</p><p>The answer entered my peripheral vision as I stepped farther away from the house.</p><p>To my right rested a four-car garage, square in shape, white trim and red brick, detached from the house. The very garage I\u2019d watched Kyrin speed from only one night ago. I quickened my step, pumping my arms and flinging snowflakes up my calves.</p><p>The side door proved locked, and the automatic entrance too heavy for me to lift. I busted the back window with a rock and climbed inside, knowing I\u2019d set off whatever alarm system he used. I didn\u2019t care. Warmth enveloped me as I studied three SUVs, each clean and all-terrain. And waiting for a driver.</p><p>Waiting for me.</p><p>I grinned. One space proved empty, which meant Kyrin was still using the Jag. As I considered what to do next, my smile dissolved. I didn\u2019t know how to hot-wire a car. Earthlings used fingerprint IDs to start cars. Most aliens did not have fingerprints, so they used voice recognition.</p><p>Without Kyrin...No. Wait. Most likely, Kyrin would have programmed a few of his servants\u2019 voices into the system, in case he needed someone to run his errands. Or he would have left a recorder with his voice commands for their uses.</p><p>Cursing, I ran back through the snow, my teeth chattering, my body shivering. Inside the house, the servants were still in hiding. As I searched for them, I also searched for a recorder. I rummaged through drawers and cabinets on the ground floor, finding nothing but a few batteries and bullets. Scowling, I pounded up the stairs to Kyrin\u2019s room, where I left no corner or hollow untouched.</p><p>I discovered a feather boa and a straw cowboy hat in his closet\u2014but I didn\u2019t want to consider why he had those items. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Back downstairs I went. A few minutes later, I found a young woman hiding in a cubbyhole under the kitchen floor. She screamed when she saw me. I grabbed her by the upper arm and hefted her up.</p><p>\u201cCome with me. Be good, and I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled, but she didn\u2019t try to fight me. I raced back outside, dragging her with me as I retraced my steps to the garage. Thankfully, there was no sign of Kyrin\u2019s return. I approached the far SUV, the one with chains on the tires, low mileage, and turbocharge.</p> <p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d I commanded the woman.</p><p>\u201cOp\u2014open,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nothing happened. I banged my hand on the hood in frustration. \u201cSay it again. In the right language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuo,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>The door popped open.</p> <p>Relief pounded through me. \u201cNow make it start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPren,\u201d she shouted, and the engine hummed instantly to life.</p><p>I released her and slid inside the car. As she sprinted away, I programmed in the coordinates to my apartment. The garage door opened automatically and the car jolted into motion. The squeal of thick tire tread filled my ears as I sped away.</p><p>I snatched the car phone and said, \u201cJack Pagosa, A.I.R.,\u201d into the speaker. I heard the ring, but he never answered. Shit. I\u2019d try again when I reached my home. I drove north for half an hour, and had almost given up finding a familiar road when New Chicago\u2019s skyscrapers rose ahead, above the horizon. An hour later, I eased into my building\u2019s parking lot. I left the car running.</p><p>My steps clipped and frantic, I strode inside the building. The hallway was a broad opening into an expansive sunlit lobby that left nothing to obstruct my vision. Just as I rounded the corner, I heard a high-pitched you\u2019re-looking-good whistle. I turned sharply on the balls of my feet. My neighbor, Eddie Briggs, paled when he realized who he\u2019d just objectified.</p><p>He was damn lucky I didn\u2019t knife him.</p> <p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d he said, pressing his glasses up his nose and trying not to stare at my cleavage. He wasn\u2019t doing too good a job. He stood in front of the elevator, tall, lanky, and young, probably twenty, with dark blond hair and freckled skin.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to live, don\u2019t comment on my clothes.\u201d I never slowed my step and quickly passed him. I felt his gaze on my legs.</p><p>\u201cUh, the police have been here looking for you,\u201d he called.</p><p>I stopped mid-step and spun to face him. \u201cDid they question you?\u201d</p><p>I waited. Nothing further was offered. He just continued to stare at the gown beneath the jacket, and I waved my hand in front of his face until he actually made eye contact. \u201cWhat\u2019d you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I didn\u2019t know nuthin\u2019. That I hadn\u2019t seen you in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good,\u201d I told him, jumping back into stride.</p><p>Only when I reached my apartment did I stop again. I cursed. My ID unit was busted. I cautiously stepped into the foyer and scanned my living room. Nothing appeared out of place or destroyed, but...something didn\u2019t feel right. The air pulsed with someone else\u2019s energy. Someone, maybe A.I.R., maybe not, had searched my place. That someone might still be here.</p> <p>I unsheathed my knife. A thorough search revealed an empty trash bin and a missing answering unit, but thankfully, no intruder.</p><p>I tried Jack again. After eight rings, I slammed the receiver onto the kitchen receptor, once, twice. Where the hell was he? My fingers stiff, I phoned the hospital next, only to be informed that Dr. Hannah was absent. Was everyone conspiring against me?</p><p>After locking up as best I could, I hurried through the spray-shower, changed into fitted slacks and a button-down, then ceremoniously dumped Kyrin\u2019s clothing into the corner. God, it felt good to wear my own things. Even better, I had strapped on a pyre-gun, clips, and several knives. I secured the necklace Kyrin had given me in my closet safe, where I usually kept old weapons. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with it yet.</p><p>Thankfully no one had stolen the SUV, so I used it to drive to the hospital. Anticipation filled me as I strode into Dallas\u2019s room; sunlight streamed through the open blinds and gleamed on the white tile and silver bed rails. I stood there, drinking in every detail.</p><p>Dallas was propped up on the bed, eating lunch and speaking with another agent. Garret Harsbro, I realized, a young recruit fresh from school.</p><p>I felt a surge of joy and relief, consuming, pure. Dallas was alive, healthy, and whole. His skin possessed a strong pink tint. His motions were slow but sure. The only evidence of his recent brush with death was his thinner cheeks and the lines of tension around his mouth.</p><p>He chuckled at something Garret said, the sound a little strained, yet I found myself laughing with him. True laughter. Uninhibited. He heard me and glanced over. I had to bite back a gasp. His eyes...even from this distance I could tell they were no longer the deep brown of before. They were lighter. Almost blue. Like Kyrin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he said, dropping his fork and returning my smile. \u201cDamn, but it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>I rushed to his bedside and clasped his hand in mine. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d I said. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>He gave my palm a squeeze, his grasp weak. \u201cGlad to be back. Dr. Hannah said I should be dead, but the gods must like me.\u201d</p><p>I blinked up at Garret. \u201cWill you excuse us?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t give a shit if I was being rude. I needed some time alone with my friend. My best friend.</p><p>Garret gave me an appreciative grin, nodded, then strode from the room.</p><p>When we were alone, I turned back to Dallas and said, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter every hour.\u201d Suddenly the smile fell from his lips, and he eyed me with concern. \u201cYou missed Jaxon by ten minutes. Something\u2019s going on, Mia, and it has to do with you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him to worry. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of touch for a few days, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that, and\u2014\u201d He paused, like my words had only just reached him. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019ve been out of touch? You\u2019re never out of touch. Your job is your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story, and I don\u2019t have time to explain. What did Jaxon tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know if I\u2019d spoken to you since I\u2019d come out of the coma last night. And of course I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s what he didn\u2019t say that threw me. Jack called on Jaxon\u2019s cell. Another body was found this morning. I don\u2019t know who. Jaxon wouldn\u2019t tell me. Anyway, while Jack was talking, Jaxon turned pale. He whispered your name, and at first I thought you were the one dead. But when I asked Jaxon about it, he said I\u2019d misheard and to call him if I spoke to you.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>\u201cJaxon bolted after that. I called your house and your cell, but couldn\u2019t reach you. Your unit didn\u2019t even pick up.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to reveal my trepidation, I kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything once I\u2019ve spoken with Jack, okay?\u201d</p><p>He reluctantly nodded and tugged on my hand to keep me by his side a moment longer. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>I managed a grin. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>By the time the station house came into view, my unease had grown to unimaginable proportions. I refused to be a coward, however, so I maneuvered into the parking lot. I watched the building as agents came and went. Nothing seemed unusual. Resigned but still unsure, I slipped inside the lobby.</p><p>Several agents greeted me normally with a quick \u201cHi\u201d and a smile. Some rushed to my side, patted me on the shoulder, and asked how I was doing. I answered politely but sternly, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d and kept moving. Others eyed me with leery distrust and maintained their distance.</p><p>When I reached Jack\u2019s office, I paused, hand raised midair. I\u2019d never knocked before. Why start now? I pushed open the door. Jack was in the middle of a sentence and cut himself off abruptly when he saw me. Jaxon, Jaffee, and Mandalay were seated in front of his desk, and all turned their focus to me.</p><p>Jaxon jumped to his feet. He strode one step toward me, then stopped. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, concern dripping from his words.</p><p>I gave him a weak smile. \u201cAs good as can be expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t...hurt you, did he?\u201d Jaxon asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence encompassed the room. Silence tight and heavy, unnatural.</p><p>Finally Jack said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, Mia? We\u2019ve had PD and agents scouring the countryside for three days. Three damn days, and you stroll oh so pretty into my office, as if nothing ever happened.\u201d</p><p>There was no time to explain. \u201cI know who killed Steele, Jack. And the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said, easing back in his chair and popping antacids like candy. \u201cSo do we. Kyrin en Arr.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to utter a determined, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d but Ghost and Kittie rushed inside, halting my words. They flanked my sides and ground to a halt when they saw me.</p><p>\u201cDallas called my cell,\u201d Ghost said, dragging in breaths after every word. \u201cHe said you were on your way here.\u201d He enfolded me in his arms. \u201cKyrin didn\u2019t hurt you, did he?\u201d he demanded, repeating Jaxon\u2019s question. \u201cBecause I will personally find him and kill him\u2014if you haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still alive,\u201d I answered, \u201cand I\u2019d like him to stay that way. He isn\u2019t violent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s not, huh?\u201d Jack threw back a few more antacids. \u201cThen why is his voice DNA recorded at the scene? And why,\u201d he added darkly, \u201care your fingerprints there?\u201d</p><p>There was something in his eyes, a gleam I\u2019d never seen directed at me before. They knew I\u2019d been at the scene, but did they know about my origins? Did they suspect? My attention moved to Mandalay. She hastily glanced away. Next, I focused on Jaffee. He, too, couldn\u2019t face me for long. Jaxon, Ghost, and Kittie all watched me, each with equal expressions of concern and dread.</p><p>I faced Jack. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink back to the day you were taken, Mia. One minute I\u2019m watching you have a pleasant discussion with an invading Arcadian, and the next you simply disappear. We don\u2019t hear from you for three days, and then we discover your fingerprints all over a crime scene. How does that look to you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer his question, but spoke one of my own. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m guilty of murder? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>Defeated, he slumped back in his chair. \u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t. You\u2019re the best hunter I\u2019ve got. You\u2019ve saved God knows how many lives, and taken God knows how many alien lives. But the top guns are out for your blood. They think you\u2019re guilty, that you\u2019ve helped Kyrin every step of the way.\u201d He pushed out a sigh. \u201cThey want your badge.\u201d</p><p>Dread uncurled inside my stomach and launched a path through my blood. \u201cNeither Kyrin nor I killed those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you weren\u2019t involved, but this Kyrin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d he interjected. \u201cAlways have. But I don\u2019t trust him. And besides that, I have to do my job. Right now I have orders to take your gun and your badge, pending investigation. You\u2019re on leave until further notice, and don\u2019t give me any shit about it. This is standard procedure. You know that. You\u2019re lucky it\u2019s not worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping my gun, Jack, and I\u2019m staying active,\u201d I said, hand tightening around the gun in question. \u201cLegally or not.\u201d</p><p>He blinked over at me, searching my eyes for...what? The strength of my determination? The lengths I\u2019d endure to triumph? Whatever he saw deflated his intent.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be difficult,\u201d he said, but there wasn\u2019t any heat to his tone. \u201cFine. Keep your gun. I suggest you spend your time proving your innocence and bringing me the one responsible. But by God, you were never here. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her,\u201d Jaxon said.</p><p>\u201cSee who?\u201d Ghost asked. \u201cMia\u2019s still missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I\u2019ll search for her in the Northern District,\u201d Kittie said. \u201cYou know how that woman likes to shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here before I change my mind,\u201d Jack commanded gruffly.</p><p>God, I loved these men. I gave each man a quick hug. When my arms wrapped around Ghost\u2019s neck, he whispered, \u201cYou need anything, you call. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>I also knew what I had to do next. Even though it would make me look that much more guilty.</p><p>When I stepped into the hall, I stayed in the shadows. I\u2019d worked here so long, I knew every secret room, every place to hide. Sweat beaded on my face and hands, and my heart raced. What I was about to do was going to piss off Jack, and maybe destroy his trust in me. But this had to be done.</p><p>Kyrin had said I had powers, that I had only to reach inside myself to find them. Atlanna, too, had said I possessed powers as strong as her own. I had felt glimmers of them over the years, and especially these last couple of days. I\u2019d had no control of them, however.</p><p>I had to try, though. I closed my eyes and mentally reached within my mind, plucking away the walls I\u2019d erected there. One by one the stones fell, until slowly, so slowly, the entire structure crumbled. Nothing happened at first. I stood on the precipice, hovering, waiting, the force of everything I\u2019d buried churning like a tempest.</p><p>I realized at that moment I\u2019d been asleep my entire life and was only just now about to awaken. With a shaky arm, I stretched out a mental hand. The moment my fingers penetrated the swirling fog, energy flooded me. My knees almost buckled from the intensity. So much power. It consumed me, ate me alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I trembled, and my eyelids flew open.</p><p>Focus, I commanded myself. Focus. Everything around me\u2014the people, insects, dust\u2014moved in slow motion. Barely moved, in fact. Almost as if they were standing still. Just like before, in the parking lot with Kyrin. I heard the tick of a clock, yet the ticks seemed to come every other minute instead of every second. The voices around me sounded deep and dragging.</p><p>I took one step, then another, and found that I moved quickly, faster than I\u2019d ever moved before. I flew through motion detectors and across weight-sensitive floors, then checked myself into the cell hall. I had Lilla by the hand before my presence was even announced over the computer. Lilla\u2019s expression was shocked, yet she didn\u2019t resist me as I dragged her from the building and into Kyrin\u2019s car.</p> <p>Only when we were on the highway did I allow myself to relax. The moment I relaxed, all energy deserted me, and time kicked back into regular speed. Things no longer moved slowly, voices no longer dragged. I was the one dragging now.</p><p>A wave of dizziness assaulted me. My stomach rolled. I programmed the car to a stop, tumbled out, and emptied the contents of my stomach there on the side of the road.</p><p>Lilla opened the passenger door. I thought she meant to run, that I\u2019d have to find the energy to chase her, but she crouched beside me. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d she asked.</p><p>My head felt heavy, too heavy, but I managed to turn toward her. \u201cKnown what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are like me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d</p><p>Something vulnerable flickered in her eyes. \u201cWhy did you free me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFor your brother. Now answer a question for me. Did you help Atlanna abduct those humans?\u201d</p><p>Silence swelled around us.</p><p>Finally, \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut when I realized she planned to kill them after we had finished with them, I asked Kyrin to help me stop her. I just\u2014I wanted a baby of my own, and I thought that was a wonderful way to have one.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a breath. I didn\u2019t trust this woman fully, but I had to put my life in her hands. I had no other choice. \u201cGet us to Kyrin\u2019s, okay. I need to close my eyes.\u201d</p> <p>She helped me back into the car, and the last of my strength deserted me. I didn\u2019t want to sleep. I wanted to be awake when we reached Kyrin\u2019s. But the moment the car jerked into gear, my mind went blank, and a deep haze cocooned me.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Ribbons of awareness slipped into my conscious mind, incrementally prodding me to wakefulness. I blinked open my eyes. At first, I saw nothing more than black spiderwebs, making my surroundings appear hazy and unclear. When I focused, a sight more delicious than a smoldering ocean of coffee greeted me, and a smile played at the corners of my lips. I stretched like a contented kitten. Kyrin lounged beside me, propped on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, a yawn at the edge of each syllable. Then I remembered what he\u2019d done to me, how he\u2019d shackled me. I lost my smile and punched him.</p><p>His head whipped to the side.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for trying to hold me prisoner again.\u201d</p><p>As he rubbed his jaw, he gave me a repentant sigh. \u201cI am sorry. I only thought to protect you. I knew you would chase after Atlanna, and I didn\u2019t want you to do that alone. I never expected her to come to you.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou have my solemn oath that I will never, never, clamp you with an armband again.\u201d</p><p>Muted beams of light etched his frame, darkening the aura of disquiet around him. My brow furrowed together, and I frowned. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNine P.M.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d I asked, then paused. \u201cWait. My memories are a bit fuzzy, but I remember bits and pieces. Lilla drove me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did.\u201d He brushed his fingertips over my cheek, around my ear, then tunneled into my hair. \u201cThank you for freeing my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d I relaxed into his touch.</p><p>With slow, sensual grace, he swirled a dark tendril around his finger, then glided the raven tress over his cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cI had a vision about Atlanna. I think\u2014I think she will soon die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie? How?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI saw her prone, lifeless body on the ground, her blood seeping away from her.\u201d A tremor raked my spine. \u201cMy visions are never wrong.\u201d</p><p>His voice became as gentle as a summer rain. \u201cPerhaps we will win this war, after all.\u201d</p><p>I should have felt tremendous joy at such a remark, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sinking into him would have been so easy. Wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling him to me for a kiss would have been easier still. Yet I did neither of those things. I allowed him to offer the comfort.</p><p>His fingers cupped the back of my neck, and he did what I had not. He urged me back onto the mattress, allowing his lips to brush against mine. In the wake of such a sweet promise, I lost all sense of animosity and abandoned myself to his kiss. Gently, so gently, our tongues danced together. His tasted as pure and masculine as I remembered. His scent wrapped around me, evoking images of star-filled nights, expensive champagne, and chocolate truffles. On an achy moan, I slipped my hands under his shirt, willing to give him everything I had to give. His skin was soft velvet over hard steel.</p><p>His moan matched mine in intensity, but he tore his mouth away. His breathing labored, he said, \u201cLilla told me what happened. How you used your powers.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a shaky breath, and my arms dropped back to my sides. \u201cA.I.R. thinks you killed those men. William Steele, SullivanBay, and even the woman, Rianne Harte. They\u2019re determined to hunt you down and execute you.\u201d My voice hardened with authority. \u201cI want you to leave the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they so sure I am guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour voice DNA is all over Bay\u2019s murder scene. And the fact that you had contact with every victim doesn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>He cursed under his breath. \u201cI did not have enough time to clean away the evidence of my presence the last time. I should never have gone, but I wanted you to see Atlanna\u2019s cruelty for yourself.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell sounded.</p><p>I jolted up. I knew instantly who stood outside, wanting entrance into Kyrin\u2019s home. A.I.R. Adrenaline pumped through my blood, giving me strength. \u201cGet up. We have to go.\u201d</p><p>He remained casually lounged atop the mattress. \u201cWorry not, little angel,\u201d he said as his lips curled. \u201cI will send them on their way.\u201d</p><p>My hands anchored to my hips, and I leaned my face into his. Only a breath away. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they found you, but they can enter your home with or without your permission. The fact that they\u2019re ringing your doorbell is only out of respect for me.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cI will simply make them choose not to enter.\u201d</p><p>Riding a wave of urgency, I latched onto his arm and jerked him to his feet. \u201cMind control isn\u2019t something you can do. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right.\u201d Still, he acted unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cKyrin! Work with me here.\u201d</p><p>He clasped my forearms and leveled me a glance. \u201cLilla is here, Mia. She can dissuade A.I.R. from entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Just like that, amusement replaced my apprehension. A deep, true chuckle escaped. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be glad for her ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful when you laugh. Like a goddess of love come to enchant all who gaze upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d a female voice said from the doorway. \u201cYou are making me sick.\u201d</p><p>Both Kyrin and I reluctantly turned away from each other and toward Lilla, the sounds of revving engines in our ears.</p><p>\u201cI will hear your thanks now,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI just saved both of you. I like roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo play,\u201d Kyrin said. He waved one hand through the air. \u201cWe are busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cStay. We have work to do. We\u2019re going to visit Atlanna. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kyrin frowned. \u201cYou have not enough experience using your powers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not ready to face her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith enough pyre-guns, we\u2019ll be ready for three intergalactic wars.\u201d I shifted my gaze to Lilla, who still leaned casually against the doorframe. \u201cCan we count on your help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou set me free,\u201d she answered, her expression resigned. \u201cI owe you. And an Arcadian always pays her debts.\u201d</p><p>I almost shook my head in surprise. These two aliens I had judged so harshly and fought so incessantly to destroy were becoming my strongest allies. That fact boggled my mind. I wanted to thank them, tell them I was sorry, and demand to know why all at once.</p><p>Kyrin sighed. \u201cWhat should I do first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a car ready,\u201d I said. \u201cI know where we can get weapons.\u201d I grinned. \u201cA.I.R. is about to make an anonymous contribution.\u201d</p><p>Sneaking through the back door, up an elevator shaft, and into A.I.R. storage took a little over an hour. I had to dodge cameras, guards, and ID scans. Not easy, and not fun. But I did it. I pocketed several pyre-guns and daggers from agents\u2019 lockers, and loaded myself down with top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art experimental gear from the lab. Exiting A.I.R. only required ten minutes. I just jacked the alarm in sector twelve and ran like hell.</p><p>As I turned toward the corner, five agents approached, guns drawn. I recognized three of them. They were hard, by-the-book A.I.R. If one of them tried to stop me...I knew I couldn\u2019t kill a fellow agent, so I increased my speed. Maybe they would be too busy to notice me, a suspended officer, striding as pretty as I pleased through this secured area. Right. I didn\u2019t know what would happen next, but I was prepared for anything. They passed by, heading toward the alarm without giving me more than a conspiratorial wave and a knowing grin.</p><p>God, I loved these people!</p><p>Once situated in Kyrin\u2019s SUV, where both Kyrin and Lilla awaited me, I passed out weapons and said, \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I need.\u201d I slipped my cell unit from my back pocket.</p><p>I rang Ghost, Kittie, and Jaxon on conference. I knew calling them was the right thing to do. They could get into places I couldn\u2019t, and having them at my back would give me a sense of peace.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d I said after each man had answered.</p><p>They replied without hesitation, granting my request. Ghost even said, \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to help prove your innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and I meant it. I briefed them on the situation. I told them everything. About Atlanna. About Kyrin. About Lilla. \u201cYou still in?\u201d I asked.</p><p>One by one, they all agreed.</p><p>These men might never know how much their support meant to me. \u201cMeet me at the northeast corner of</p><p>Michigan Avenue</p><p>. One hour.\u201d</p><p>I slipped my phone into my back pocket and began strapping a recorder under my chest. This time, I was going to record Atlanna\u2019s voice. When I finished, I turned to Kyrin. Determination stiffened my spine. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later, I found myself crawling over hills, around trees, and along icy embankments. Kyrin had explained the layout of the house, so we knew to enter through the basement.</p><p>Ghost and Lilla snagged the rear of our little train. Kittie and Jaxon had the middle, just behind me, and we all stealthily followed Kyrin. Some of us moved a little more stealthily than others. Apparently, Lilla did not know the meaning of the word silence. Her knees found and snapped every twig within a mile radius. And she\u2019d slipped on the ice too many times to count. I couldn\u2019t believe this klutzy alien was the same one who\u2019d once given me the slip.</p><p>When we topped the last hill, I gazed down at a beautifully landscaped garden that led to a circling wall and an equally beautiful home. Not a mansion like Kyrin\u2019s, but close. As white as Ecstasy, with a peaked roof that dipped and rose like the waves of an ocean.</p><p>\u201cShe keeps the men in the basement,\u201d Kyrin whispered to me.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I replied just as quietly. \u201cGhost and I will check for survivors. If we find any, we\u2019ll bring them here. Jaxon, you look for children, or any hint of children. All of you, grab any files\u2014hell, any papers you see. Kyrin, stay here.\u201d</p><p>Kyrin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are not going inside that house without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trained for this type of mission, and I need someone out here, acting as guard. You can project your voice into my head and tell me if anyone else arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trained either. I do not mind waiting,\u201d Lilla offered.</p><p>I shot her a glance. \u201cWe may need your mind control.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThis seemed fun in theory, but now that we are here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll cover you,\u201d Ghost said, a lusty edge to his words.</p><p>She smiled over at him, even ran her nails over his arm. \u201cI like the thought of your body covering mine. You are so dark.\u201d</p><p>I leveled Ghost a warning glare. \u201cConcentrate, people. Screw later.\u201d</p><p>Sheepish, he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI go in,\u201d Kyrin repeated.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Everyone goes,\u201d I said. \u201cJust stay quiet.\u201d I directed the last to Lilla.</p><p>This time, Ghost and I led the way. Several armed men, all human, patrolled the outside wall. Lilla distracted their minds, and we were able to stride directly in front of them. They never saw us.</p><p>Remaining alert, we led our ragtag group inside the home\u2019s basement door, which Ghost expertly opened for us. Three female Arcadians were sauntering down a nearby hallway. Mind control wasn\u2019t what we needed here. I wanted these aliens incapacitated.</p><p>\u201cStun,\u201d I mouthed to my men. They might be pregnant, so I didn\u2019t want them killed. Each man nodded in turn. We set our pyre-guns to stun and fired on my count of three. The room lit for a split second, then one by one the women froze in place, their minds and bodies on hold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before any of us could blink, a fourth woman burst from the shadows, surprising us. Her expression wild, she stabbed Ghost in the thigh with a retractable knife. He groaned, the sound blending with the woman\u2019s screech as she raced away. I bolted after her and tackled her, knocking her to the plush carpet. The moment our bodies hit, she fought like a caged tigress. She scratched, bit, kicked, and clawed. I landed a solid punch to her chin, knocking her witless for a few seconds. Those seconds were all that I needed. I steadied my gun and fired. As the stunned woman lay motionless, I pushed to my feet.</p><p>Jaxon, Ghost, and Kittie all watched me expectantly. Lilla appeared distraught, as if I might attack her next, and Kyrin was shaking his head in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cCan you not go one day without using your fists?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I ignored him. \u201cPlaytime is over, kiddies. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>We worked our way through without further incident. Ghost dragged at the rear. There were several rooms, but only one was occupied. A lone man reclined upon a soft, decadent bed. Fat silk pillows of every color enveloped him. Wispy lace hung from the ceiling, cascading around X-rated portraits of couples having sex. The man was completely naked and reading a magazine. Erotic Encounters. His long, muscular legs consumed every inch of space, and his dark hair and dark eyes glowed with boredom. I didn\u2019t recognize him from the missing persons portfolio.</p><p>When he spotted me, he set his magazine aside with a sigh. \u201cHow do you want it?\u201d he asked. Resignation dripped from his voice.</p><p>\u201cSsshhh,\u201d I hissed, scanning the room to make sure we were alone. Once I was satisfied that no other ears were listening, I crossed the room and positioned myself at the foot of the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrence Ford.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you here willingly?\u201d Jaxon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ford said. He kept his gaze directed at me. \u201cDo you want to be on top?\u201d</p><p>Behind me, Kittie chuckled. \u201cYeah, Mia. Do you want on top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to save you,\u201d I told the victim. \u201cNot screw you. Idiot,\u201d I muttered under my breath. \u201cSee this man here?\u201d I motioned to Ghost. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take you to safety.\u201d</p><p>Ford stood so quickly, the sheet atop the bed whipped to the floor. His knees were wobbly, and he would have tumbled to the ground if Jaxon hadn\u2019t grabbed him by the forearm.</p><p>\u201cSteady,\u201d Jaxon said.</p> <p>I draped the comforter around the man\u2019s nakedness.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he gushed. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Ghost helped the poor, practically-screwed-to-death man from the chamber. I noticed Ghost was limping, and with every step the limp worsened. In fact, a trail of blood now followed him.</p><p>\u201cGuard Ford, and wait in the car,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Ghost didn\u2019t argue. He nodded, for the first time looking like his name.</p><p>I turned to Kyrin. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m ready to face Atlanna.\u201d Ready to face my mother.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>We entered several upstairs bedrooms. Like the rooms below, these were empty. We kept moving until we spotted a gathering of Arcadians huddled together in the middle of a hallway, laughing and talking. The carpeted flooring was congested with females, probably breeders, I realized.</p> <p>Our guns were already set to stun, so we discharged a round of lasers. Blue lit the air like a midnight bonfire, and suddenly their bodies looked frozen by time, some standing, some sitting. Some were even poised with hands upraised, mouths open.</p><p>This almost seemed too easy.</p><p>Shaking my head, I studied the forked hallway ahead of me. Two choices. Left or right.</p><p>\u201cLilla,\u201d I said, \u201cstay here. Detour anyone who comes this way.\u201d</p><p>She gulped and clasped a pyre-gun as if it were a precious diamond. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaxon, Kittie. You take the right. Kyrin and I will take the left.\u201d</p><p>Everyone nodded, and we split.</p><p>Kyrin and I entered a large sitting room, making sure to stay in the shadows. A fireplace decorated the far wall, the only spot not covered by mirrors. A black velvet couch and two matching chairs flanked the center.</p><p>I sucked in a breath. There, in the second chair, lounged Atlanna. She wore a sheer lavender gown, mere wisps of fabric, and her snow-white hair hung down her body in erotic curls. A man was seated directly across from her, talking about their progress with the halflings.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t make out his features, but I knew from his short, inky hair that he was human. I inched a step toward them, my pyre-gun aimed at Atlanna\u2019s heart. Stun. I\u2019d only stun her, I thought, squeezing the trigger. Blue lights erupted. Then fizzled. I watched, my heartbeat suspended. My mouth formed a small O. Shit, shit. Something was wrong. Atlanna remained completely unaffected. In fact, neither she nor the human had ceased their conversation.</p><p>Kyrin fired off a round of his own.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Atlanna shifted her body and faced me directly, as if she\u2019d known I was there the entire time. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you decided to join me, Mia. Sorry I had to destroy your weapon.\u201d She waved her fingers in the man\u2019s direction. \u201cLeave us,\u201d she said.</p><p>He instantly obeyed and disappeared behind a mirrored door. Before I could receive a clear look at his features, a sharp pain lanced through my hand. With a gasp, I dropped my gun, and the metal fell limply from my fingers and thudded on the carpet. Kyrin\u2019s features were contorted with pain, I noticed, and he too dropped his gun.</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Atlanna said, and the pain stopped.</p><p>\u201cOur battle will end here and now, Atlanna,\u201d I told her, straightening to my full height.</p><p>\u201cYou disappoint me,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d kill Kyrin and help me. Instead, you do the opposite. Foolish girl.\u201d</p><p>A swarm of Arcadians burst into the room from the mirrored door, surrounding us. The air circling Kyrin thickened, and I knew he was about to use his lightning-fast reflexes. I closed my eyes, willing myself to do the same, damn the consequences. Instantly, my powers sprang free. When my eyelids snapped open, I saw Kyrin fighting three Arcadians at once. They moved slowly, barely an inch per second, while he waltzed around them, punching and kicking.</p><p>I turned my attention to Atlanna. Her eyes were narrowed, and she was watching me. She strode a step in my direction, yet even her actions were slowed. It was as if she could see me, but couldn\u2019t force herself to move as quickly. Something deadly gleamed in her gaze.</p><p>Fighting my way toward her, I landed a quick kick to one man\u2019s neck and a hard jab to another\u2019s midsection. But my head began to ache, my muscles going lax, and I slowed the closer I came to her. I knew, knew, Atlanna was the source of my pain, just as before. The more the ache intensified, the more energy I lost, until finally I was jolted back into normal speed. Lethargy seeped into my every pore.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>Before I could gather the strength to protest, four male aliens latched onto my arms and legs. They gripped me, and I used what little strength I had to try and jerk myself free. I failed. Where was Kyrin? Was he safe? I could no longer see him, but I knew he was there, knew he fought for my freedom. Two of my guards flew back against the wall, making me fly forward. Before the other two were felled, a mass of them converged around me and managed to apprehend Kyrin. Slowly, his image appeared.</p><p>My strength completely gone now, I sagged against my captors.</p><p>\u201cMy people have already gathered the rest of your team,\u201d Atlanna said. \u201cHow silly to think you could best me.\u201d She positioned herself directly in front of me.</p><p>\u201cIf you harm them, I will make your death as painful as possible.\u201d</p><p>Her hands came up, the nails long and clean, polished, and she caressed my jawbone. \u201cI want a thousand more just like you. Think of the profit they would bring.\u201d Eager to brag, she said, \u201cFor years I thought the answer lay in science, but all along I was the answer. Me. My blood, like Kyrin\u2019s, has healing qualities that aid in the creation of halfling offspring. After I infused my women with my blood, they were able to produce healthy babies with Earth men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they? Where are the children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disgust me.\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed in her brilliant lavender eyes. \u201cWhip him,\u201d she said, motioning to Kyrin. \u201cAnd if you fight it,\u201d she told him, \u201cI will punish Mia. I might anyway. She\u2019s proving to be quite a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>His expression dark and dangerous, he nodded. A guard stripped away his shirt and bared his back.</p><p>\u201cI will be fine,\u201d he assured me with a strained smile.</p><p>That smile was almost my undoing. He thought to keep me calm, to assure me everything would be okay. We both knew it wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cHe is able to heal quickly,\u201d Atlanna growled, \u201cunless he is whipped until there is none of his precious blood left. Or...unless the whip is laced with poison. Which this one is. You see, the poison binds with the healing properties of his blood, and the more his body tries to recover, the more the poison destroys him.\u201d</p><p>A mixture of panic, dread, and helplessness uncurled in my stomach, giving me a jolt of energy. I twisted and lunged; free for a moment, I raced toward him, but was quickly grabbed again and subdued. \u201cLeave him the hell alone,\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d Atlanna said to the whip wielder.</p><p>The first blow landed on his back, and Kyrin flinched. Then the next and the next were delivered in rapid succession. Sweat dripped from his temples, and blood flowed like a crimson river down his back. Again, the long, thick length of the whip cracked through the air. He moaned.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d I shouted, kicking and jerking. I just didn\u2019t have the physical strength to fight my way free. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you. Do you hear me? I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Atlanna\u2019s eyes narrowed menacingly. \u201cNo, you will not. You will help me breed more.\u201d</p><p>I stilled. \u201cI\u2019m your daughter, and you would do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I hoped to gain your willingness, but if you will not give it, I will take it by force. Lock her up,\u201d she snarled to the guards who held me. \u201cPerhaps some time alone will help her adjust to her new fate.\u201d</p><p>I fought for my life, Lilla\u2019s, my agents\u2019, and most importantly Kyrin\u2019s, as six Arcadian warriors dragged me into a cold, dank cell. A cot lined the far wall, the only piece of furniture. No blankets, no toilet. This prison was nothing like Terrence Ford\u2019s. His had been meant for seduction. Mine was meant for punishment. Perhaps death.</p><p>The door slammed closed. A lock clicked in place, and red lasers formed bars, illuminating the small area with an eerie cerise glow. Alone now, I felt terror slice through my mind. Escape. I had to escape. The walls were closing in, faster, faster. Darkness all around. I heard a woman\u2019s screams, and realized moments later that they were mine. My throat was raw, my hands aching from clawing at the walls.</p><p>To my surprise, I felt a comforting presence enter my mind. I knew instantly that Kyrin was reaching out to me. He was alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said inside my head.</p><p>Peace settled over me, as warm and welcoming as a winter coat. I am a fighter, I reminded myself. Atlanna would not defeat me. She would not break me. I patted down my body. The weapons I\u2019d strapped to my thighs and waist were gone, taken during the trek here. I traced my palm over the edge of my boot, and a relieved sigh slipped from my lips. I still had one blade, small but just as deadly as any other.</p><p>With only one knife, how was I going to win this war?</p><p>The answer came to me like a gift from the God I\u2019d thought I had forgotten. I straightened my shoulders, determination working through me. I knew what I had to do.</p><p>Hours passed, and still I remained calm. When I felt my energy had returned sufficiently, I stood directly in front of the door, the glow of the lasers nearly blinding me. They produced no heat, but I knew they\u2019d burn the skin from my bones if I touched them.</p><p>I closed my eyes and allowed my powers to flood me. Stronger. Stronger still. I became saturated with it, and my lids flew open. I saw the blink of the lasers, realizing they vanished every other second. One, two, I counted, then shot out my hands and worked the blade into the lock. One, two. I jerked back, barely missing the flash of lights. One, two. I repeated the action many times before disabling the metal barrier.</p><p>I felt a flash of victory. Waiting until the lasers had disappeared again, I shoved past the thick doors and leaped into the waiting hallway. Just as I steadied myself, the lasers returned.</p><p>I zoomed through the house in search of Atlanna. I found her moments later. Too self-assured to require a guard, she stretched atop the black velvet couch in the same mirrored room she\u2019d occupied before, her eyes closed. For one prolonged moment, I remained at the threshold. My God. She needed time to recuperate. After using her powers, she became weakened, just as I did.</p><p>My movements still quickened, I quietly shut and bolted the main door, as well as the mirrored door, then rushed at her. I struck her with my fists, toppling her to the floor before she had even opened her eyes. Then I sprang on top of her and hit her again and again. She kicked, hit, bit, and scratched, unable to concentrate long enough to gather her powers.</p><p>I drew back to punch her, and by luck or precision, she landed a kick to my stomach. Air burst from my lungs in a mighty heave as I was propelled backward. My arm hit a marble vanity table, and I would have cried out if I\u2019d had the breath. A vase crashed onto the floor, shattering into a thousand tiny pieces.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Kyrin? Where are the others?\u201d I gasped, laboring for every molecule of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d she shouted, jumping up. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>From a mirror panel, a man rushed into the chamber.</p><p>The moment I saw his features, I forgot about everything else in the room. My mouth floundered open and closed, and I was unable to stop the motions. Dare. My beloved brother was alive. Not Kane, as I\u2019d assumed, but Dare. It was like looking into the past. He was tall and strong and possessed the same dark curly locks and wide-spaced blue eyes as he had at eighteen. The same high cheekbones and straight nose. The same innocence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My momentum slowed, as did my speed. I shook my head, certain if I cleared my vision, I\u2019d realize this couldn\u2019t possibly be my brother. After all, I\u2019d seen his dead body all those years ago. That was perhaps my first mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have allowed my speed to slow, for already I was growing tired again. I fought against it.</p><p>\u201cDare?\u201d I said. My first instinct was to rush to him and wrap my arms around him as I\u2019d done as a child. Atlanna\u2019s words stopped me. My second mistake.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cMy blood saved him, and in return I have his devotion.\u201d</p> <p>Devotion? My eyes narrowed. No, she controlled him with her mind. His features were blank. Unemotional. The same look Isabel had worn when she\u2019d shot Dallas. Atlanna had controlled her as well, I realized. The woman\u2019s sins increased with every minute that passed.</p><p>Dare didn\u2019t spare me a glance, but watched Atlanna. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Even his voice was the same. Familiar, only slightly different from the loving laughter I remembered from fourteen years ago.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Atlanna wiped a small trickle of blood from her lip. Already the wound was closing.</p><p>Dare finally glanced in my direction. Not a single spark of happiness touched his eyes. I stood frozen, wondering what to do, what to say.</p> <p>\u201cShall I whip her?\u201d he asked Atlanna.</p><p>I spied the three-pronged, bloodied whip draped across the edge of the couch and, without thinking, dove for it. I knew what I had to do.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dare shouted, realizing my intent.</p><p>Before he could react, I was on my feet and advancing. I knocked him aside, kicked out my foot, connecting with Atlanna\u2019s ankles. All in one motion. Atlanna tripped and launched to the floor, her back to me. As she screamed and tried to crawl away from me, I gathered every force within me and whipped her until the fabric of her gown was torn, until her blood flowed around her. Until Dare grabbed my arm and forced the whip from my grip.</p><p>Panting, I blinked down at the floor. Her body was slumped in unconsciousness. Disgust\u2014for myself, for Atlanna\u2014filled me. I\u2019d only just found my mother, only just found my brother, and I\u2019d lost them both. I swallowed back a lump in my throat. My hands shook, and I pressed my lips together.</p><p>Dropping the whip, Dare sank to his knees in front of her. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he said, brokenly. \u201cThe whip was laced with Erolan. Even Atlanna cannot withstand such a poison.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t answer him. The war was over. Except for the missing children, the case was closed. I\u2019d done my duty, just as I always had. Why didn\u2019t I feel victorious?</p><p>Dare jumped to his feet. He glared down at me, but he didn\u2019t say another word. He simply scooped Atlanna up in his arms and quietly strode from the chamber. I let him go. She was dead, no longer a threat, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do more. Hopefully, in the coming days, Dare\u2019s mind would clear from her monstrous influence, and he would come back to me.</p><p>Right now, I had to find my friends. My strength slowly draining, I moved from the room. Only two guards were stupid enough to try and stop me. Because of my loss of energy, one managed to knife a wound from my sternum to my navel. When they were unconscious from my chokehold, I battled past the pain and stanched the flow of blood with a scrap from one of the women\u2019s gowns. I stumbled through the rest of the house, finding Jaxon and Kittie inside a cell. I disabled the lasers, and Jaxon was able to pick the lock.</p><p>They rushed through the doorway, then ground to a halt when they saw my blood-soaked shirt.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jaxon asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I managed. \u201cSomeone else\u2019s blood,\u201d I lied. \u201cHelp me find Lilla and Kyrin.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Kittie called, \u201cIn here. They\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>My footsteps were slow, but I made my way inside a bedroom. Lilla stood over a large, bare bed, staring down at an unmoving body. She slowly turned and faced me. Tears ran down her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cHe is dying,\u201d she whispered brokenly. \u201cKyrin is dying.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Jaxon and Kittie dragged Kyrin outside to the vehicle where Ghost and Terrence Ford awaited us. Ghost had his thigh wrapped with cloth, and I knew he was going to be okay. But Kyrin...I was fighting to stay calm. I desired this man, this alien, maybe even loved him. Yet he\u2019d been wounded so badly, he might not survive.</p><p>\u201cI called for backup and medical,\u201d Ghost admitted weakly. \u201cBe here any time now. Told Jack the whole story.\u201d His gaze zeroed in on my stomach. \u201cMia? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. Trees and sky swam before my eyes. Concerned faces faded in and out, and their voices seemed so far away. For one brief moment, flashing lights and sirens penetrated my senses.</p><p>I collapsed.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember the drive to the hospital. I just know that when I opened my eyes, I\u2019d lost my clothes, and several doctors were standing over me, examining my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>\u201cI hurt like hell,\u201d I said, my voice raspy.</p><p>He grinned, causing his mustache to twitch at the corners. \u201cUnderstandable. But you\u2019re healing faster than anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Within the hour, they had me stitched up. I refused pain medication. I needed my head clear. \u201cTake me to see Kyrin,\u201d I said. I had to see him, had to know how he was.</p><p>The doctors and nurses ignored me.I refused to be ignored. I screamed profanities at the top of my lungs until one of the nurses ran to get me a relaxant. Before she returned, Jaxon rushed into the room. Dallas followed, his progress slowed by a cane. His light blue eyes still gave me pause. If anyone else had noticed, they hadn\u2019t said anything to me.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Jaxon demanded, weapon drawn.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Kyrin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what all the commotion is about? He\u2019s here,\u201d he answered, putting his gun away.</p><p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d I probed, my hands clenching, my stomach twisting.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he evaded.</p><p>Everything inside me relaxed, rejoiced. I couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cTake me to him,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He gulped, looked away. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jaxon, Dallas. I\u2019m begging you here.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon glanced at Dallas. Dallas glanced at me, those lines of tension still firmly etched around his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know Ghost is healing nicely,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>Fine. They didn\u2019t want to take me, I\u2019d take myself. With my wound shrieking in protest, I ripped the IV off my arm, shoved myself from the bed, and plopped into a nearby wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cStubborn as always,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cHelp her out, Jaxon, before she kills herself.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Jaxon grabbed the handles of the wheelchair and ushered me to Kyrin\u2019s room. Dallas hobbled beside us.</p><p>Jaxon said, \u201cDamn, I\u2019m glad this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>As dread and hope mingled inside me, we entered Kyrin\u2019s room. I glanced around, noticing that Kyrin was the only patient. He lay stomach down on the bed, his chin tilted toward the door, toward me, his eyes closed. Lilla stood vigil beside him, just as she\u2019d done at Atlanna\u2019s.</p><p>A tear\u2014my own freaking tear\u2014slipped down my cheek. I hadn\u2019t cried in so long, the single drop stung my tear duct. God, it felt so good to see him alive. I\u2019d thought all my tears dry, but now, seeing him, I was unable to stop the torrent of emotion that flooded me. Relief. So much relief. Happiness. So much happiness.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know, Mia,\u201d Jaxon said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Dallas said, cutting him off. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Lilla said softly, \u201cShe has a right to know. He\u2019s dying, Mia. Kyrin is dying.\u201d</p><p>My joy instantly shriveled, but I gave no outward reaction to her words. I didn\u2019t believe her. I wouldn\u2019t believe her. This man, my man, was not going to die. I wouldn\u2019t let him. Slowly I rose from the wheelchair and hobbled to the bed.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d I said to the men, not even glancing behind me.</p><p>Dallas patted my shoulder, then limped from the room with Jaxon at his side. They shut the door behind them. My tears trickled free at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Lilla asked. \u201cI cannot live in this world without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to die,\u201d I said through clenched teeth, gazing down at him. His skin was pallid. His cheeks were hollow, and there were blue shadows under his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at him, Mia. How can he survive?\u201d Lilla caressed his brow with loving fingers. \u201cWhen we were children, it was he who cared for me. He who taught me how to use my powers. His love has always given me strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once had the same type of relationship with my brother,\u201d I said. \u201cHis name is Dare, and he loved me when no one else would. He played hide-and-seek, rescued me when my dad became abusive. When Dare died, I wanted to die with him. And now I discover he\u2019s alive, but it\u2019s as if I\u2019m dead to him.\u201d</p><p>My tears splashed onto Kyrin\u2019s chin, then trickled onto his neck. I buried my face in my hands and wept for all I had lost. And all I might lose.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t die, Kyrin. Don\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>Two days dragged by, feeling more like two years. Every moment I grew stronger, Kyrin grew weaker. I\u2019d been back to Atlanna\u2019s house, looking for any lead as to where the halfling children were, but the home had been ransacked, everything taken. Whether it had been done by Atlanna\u2019s underlings, by A.I.R., or by some other government agents, I didn\u2019t yet know. But I planned to find out as soon as the chaos in my life settled.</p><p>Lilla and I continued to talk to each other. Ironically, I found comfort in sharing my feelings with her, feelings that I was only now beginning to understand. She shared her own feelings with me. We\u2019d formed a tentative sort of friendship.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t come to terms with Kyrin\u2019s approaching death. I needed to fight for him, but I didn\u2019t know how. Helplessness consumed me as I stared down at his thinning body and pallid skin.</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d I said to Lilla. Each of us occupied a seat beside his hospital bed. \u201cHe has brightened my life. I\u2019m different when he\u2019s around. With him I\u2019m a...woman. Not a huntress.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI wish there were something we could do. But the poison is slowly destroying him.\u201d</p><p>I asked her the same question I\u2019d asked her a thousand times before. \u201cIs there no antidote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered raggedly, the same answer she\u2019d given each time.</p><p>The next day, I hadn\u2019t slept properly, and my brain felt like it had gone on sabbatical. I plopped myself next to Kyrin\u2019s bed, meaning to steal a quick nap. If only he had normal human blood, I thought wearily. Then I straightened. Shit. Shit! Hope sparked inside me and erupted like wildfire. That was it. That was the answer.</p><p>As Atlanna had said, the poison was binding and destroying the healing properties of his blood. What if his blood was replaced with average human blood?</p><p>Risky, I thought. Extremely dangerous\u2014but he would die if we didn\u2019t try something.</p><p>I pitched my idea to the specialist in charge of Kyrin\u2019s care, and at first he refused. With a little persuasion\u2014in the form of bodily threats\u2014he decided to test my theory. He used a blood sample from Kyrin and a human, and studied both under a microscope.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said incredulously, \u201cthis just might work.\u201d</p><p>That was all the encouragement I needed. I couldn\u2019t ask Dallas; he now had the same type of blood as Kyrin. So I called Jaxon from my cell phone, because he was the first that leaped into my head, and explained what I needed.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Jaxon said, \u201cfor you, I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Since Jaxon and Kyrin were of different species, blood compatibility tests were unnecessary. We knew they wouldn\u2019t match. The doctors drained all of Kyrin\u2019s blood that they dared, then hooked him and Jaxon to a connecting tube. I watched the crimson blood flow from Jaxon to Kyrin. Would it work? My eyes widened as Kyrin\u2019s color slowly returned. Then...his heart monitor stopped.</p><p>A voice I didn\u2019t recognize sounded, \u201cCode blue. Room four-one-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rejecting the blood,\u201d someone said. More doctors and nurses rushed inside. One man pounded on Kyrin\u2019s chest, while another wrapped his legs in a thermal blanket. No, I screamed silently. No!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I need to ask you to leave,\u201d a nurse said to me, trying to usher me to the waiting area.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask,\u201d I growled. \u201cBut I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>She left me alone after that, and I remained exactly where I was, watching Kyrin through horror-filled eyes. This was his last chance. His only chance. If he didn\u2019t make it\u2014</p><p>The monitor beeped. Then beeped again. And again. And again. Finally steadying out.</p><p>Someone laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>I collapsed to my knees in a relieved heap. I covered my mouth with shaky hands, halting my cry of happiness. He was going to be okay. I knew it. Felt it. He was going to live.</p><p>When he regained consciousness the next day, relief and happiness consumed me.</p><p>Kyrin\u2019s eyes were feverish, but he managed to clasp my hand. \u201cYou did well,\u201d he said, as if we were still at Atlanna\u2019s and not a single day had passed since. \u201cYou defeated her. Something no one else has ever done. I know she is your mother, but\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My fingers pressed against his lips, stopping his words. \u201cMy only concern is for you.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my hand, and he offered me a soft smile. \u201cI will live, Mia. I will live and spend the rest of my life loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d I said, wiping away my tears. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. Our palms met, and we held each other, knowing we might never let go.</p><p>The day Kyrin was released from the hospital, healthy and whole, was the same day he and Lilla were exonerated of all charges. Smiling\u2014I just couldn\u2019t seem to stop doing that lately\u2014I drove him to his house. I thought to give him a little time alone, to heal, but he took my hand and led me inside.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to show you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a feather boa and a cowboy hat.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNothing like that, I promise you.\u201d He ushered me into his office and placed a kalandra in my hand. His kalandra. \u201cLook,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brow furrowed, I glanced down. I gasped. Inside the locket was a lifelike picture of me, and I was embracing Kyrin. I blinked up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you each necklace holds a legacy for the owner. You have always been my destiny, Mia. Always.\u201d With that, he enfolded me in his embrace. \u201cI knew it the moment I saw you. You are a dominating, powerful halfling with attitude, and our time together will certainly be interesting.\u201d</p><p>I pushed him onto the couch. \u201cYou better believe it will.\u201d I had a feeling our adventure had only begun. </p> </body></html>"]
