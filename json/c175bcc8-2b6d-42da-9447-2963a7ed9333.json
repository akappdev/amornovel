He lets out a low whistle while staring out one of the garage doors. Irritation and jealousy shoot through my body, and I have no fucking clue why. Maybe it\u2019s the way he said it or the tone of his voice, but I look past him to see what he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>The blonde we both have our eyes on now looks like she stepped off a runway. Or what I\u2019m guessing a runway model would look like. Although from the pictures I\u2019ve seen in magazines of models, her curves are better. Her platinum-blonde hair hangs all the way to her waist where the ends start to curl. It makes me want to wrap my finger around one of them, grab a fistful of it as I pump my cock inside her. I wonder how she\u2019d moan as I drove in and out of her.</p><p>Her short dress hugs her curves in all the right places and shows off her long legs. My eyes track down her stems to the ridiculously tall heels she\u2019s wearing. I have no idea how she\u2019s even walking in them on the uneven concrete that covers the front of my shop. The way she\u2019s dressed makes me think she must be rich royalty. What she\u2019s doing here I have no fucking clue because she clearly doesn\u2019t fit.</p><p>She looks over at us, like she feels us watching her. Her gray eyes meet mine, and it\u2019s like a sucker punch to my system. All the air leaves my lungs, and all my blood rushes to my cock. It makes me feel light-headed, and I grip the car I\u2019m working on for support.</p><p>I\u2019m too fucking old to get a hard-on just by looking at a chick. Twenty-eight isn\u2019t old, but it\u2019s too old to be getting turned on by something so simple. Too old to be having dirty thoughts about a random chick, something I haven\u2019t done since I was a randy teenager. I don\u2019t go dipping my dick into any random hole. A half-smile pulls at her lips, and it\u2019s as if she\u2019s trying to play innocent or some shit. Must be part of her game.</p><p>When she finally pulls her eyes from mine, I feel an unexplainable loss. Shit. That can\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cI got this one boss,\u201d Butch says with a shit-eating grin on his face. It\u2019s a look I know all too well, and I can see he\u2019s making like he\u2019s going to go greet the blonde piece of ass at the front of the office. Before he can make it two feet, I\u2019m grabbing him by the arm.</p><p>That isn\u2019t fucking happening. Butch always has women wrapped around his finger. Scratch that, wrapped around his dick is more like it. He\u2019s got women falling at his feet whenever we go out, and it\u2019s probably because he\u2019s always running his mouth. From what he says, I seem to have a \u2018don\u2019t talk to me\u2019 look pasted across my face, scaring them all away.</p><p>I have the urge to lay him out for just thinking about talking to her, but I push the feeling back because it\u2019s fucking ridiculous. Like either one of us have a chance with a woman like that. Who knows what she\u2019s doing in a small-ass town like this. Probably passing through and something went wrong with her ride. Here today, gone tomorrow. The thought makes my gut clench. I\u2019ll need a taste before she\u2019s gone. Something I\u2019m sure won\u2019t be easy.</p><p>\u201cFinish dropping the engine in. I got her.\u201d The irritation in my voice is clear as I order him back to work. I want to be the first to talk to her, but I see Joey beat me to the punch when I enter the front of the office.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been making that sound?\u201d Joey asks, pulling a pen from her dark black ponytail. When her hair catches the light a certain way, it almost looks blue.</p><p>\u201cWell I was\u2014\u201d The blonde duchess stops talking when she finally notices I\u2019ve joined them in the office. A slight blush hits her cheeks, and it makes my cock jerk. Double shit. A goddamn blush is making my cock ache with need.</p><p>I hear Joey drop the notepad down onto the counter, and I look over to see her rolling her eyes and returning the pen to her ponytail.</p><p>\u201cI was sure it would be Butch.\u201d Joey says with a smirk on her face. I\u2019m sure she did think it would be Butch. Because chasing ass isn\u2019t something I do. But it seems this little duchess has me bending some rules.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy and he needs your help.\u201d It\u2019s a lie. Butch can finish the job on his own, but I don\u2019t need Joey in here giving me lip or stocking up on things she can give me shit about later.</p><p>She snorts, but exits out the door I just entered and leaves me and the duchess all alone.</p><p>We both just stare at each. I\u2019ve never seen a woman so perfect in my life. There is something about her, how flawlessly she is put together, that makes me want to throw her on the floor and fuck her right there. She\u2019d be so dirty when I was done with her. The grease on my hands would smudge all over her clothes, her hair would be wild after I drove in and out of her, and her make-up would be smeared. I could look at her and know I did that. That I made this perfect little slip of a woman get dirty for me and she\u2019d love it, beg me to do it over and over again until she was dripping with my cum.</p><p>She finally breaks eye contact, pulling those gray eyes from mine. It\u2019s then I realize that I\u2019m staring at her like a love-struck puppy. I clear my throat and get to the subject before I cum in my pants thinking about all the things I want to do to her.</p><p>\u201cYour ride?\u201d My voice comes out deeper than I mean for it to be as I make my way around the counter. I need to get a little space between us and cover up my hard cock before I scare her off.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says, biting her lip. I want to tell her to stop that, but I just brace my arms on the counter, waiting for her to continue. \u201cI just got to town, and it started making some weird thumping noise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks like a scared rabbit, ready to bolt at any moment. I need to pull it back before I make her run. If she knew the things I was thinking about moments ago, she\u2019d be long gone. I\u2019m guessing the men she\u2019s been with were smooth and soft with her, something I\u2019m not sure I could be, but hell, if she asked I would sure as hell try just to have her beneath me for a few minutes. But I don\u2019t think a few minutes would ever be enough with someone like her. I bet a taste would drive a man to his knees. She\u2019s not used to talking to a dirty grease monkey like me. No, she\u2019s more into suits and polos down at the country club. The thought of someone else touching her has a red haze hitting my eyes. They wouldn\u2019t know what to do with her. I may not even know what to do with her, but I would die trying to give it to her. A woman like her should be worshiped and fucked regularly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just your fan belt,\u201d I finally say, trying to pull my thoughts from wanting to fuck her.</p><p>\u201cIs that an easy fix? I have a ton of stuff I need to get done.\u201d</p><p>I bite my tongue to keep from saying something rude. I\u2019m sure duchess here has a big day of shopping ahead of her and doesn\u2019t want to spend it in a dirty garage with the likes of me. I reach out wanting her keys, and she jumps back. She looks down at my hands, and I realize they aren\u2019t the prettiest. They\u2019re still smeared with grease from the last car I had my hands inside of. They show signs of manual labor, something she\u2019s probably never done before. I bet her skin is soft and silky all over. Her hands wrapped around my cock would feel a whole lot better than my own, which is all my dick has been getting for a very long time. Maybe that\u2019s why my dick is begging for something it shouldn\u2019t be wanting right now.</p> <p>\u201cKeys,\u201d I snap, making her jump again. I\u2019m irritated that my hand repulsed her, and I can\u2019t help the tone of my voice. I look up, and I can see the pulse in her neck start to pick up as she looks back at the door. I see what she\u2019s thinking, but I put a stop to it.</p><p>\u201cOnly shop in town, duchess. Give me the keys.\u201d</p><p>Her gray eyes go hard at the nickname, and she gives me an icy glare. Fuck. Even that turns me on. I\u2019m starting to think there isn\u2019t anything she could do to turn me off. How can someone piss you off and turn you on at the same time? I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019s doing it, but she is.</p><p>She digs in her purse, pulling her keys out and tossing them to me. I catch them in the air, wishing she would have just handed them to me. I could have stolen a touch and found out if she\u2019s as soft as she looks.</p><p>\u201cCome back in hour and she\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d I point to the clipboard on the counter. \u201cFill out your name and number so I can call you if I\u2019m done before you\u2019re back.\u201d</p> <p>She quickly scribbles down her number before turning and leaving the shop, giving me a nice view of her ass as she stomps out. I pull out my phone and look down to see her number and name and laugh when I see she identified herself as \u2018Duchess.\u2019 I program it into my phone before ripping her number off the sheet and putting it in my pocket. I hate the idea that it\u2019s just sitting there for anyone to access it.</p><p>I quickly pull her Carrera GT into the shop and change her fan belt in record time. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s because I\u2019m just trying to get shit done, but I\u2019d be lying to myself. I just want her back in here. The whole time I\u2019m working on her car, I\u2019m irritated at the idea that she\u2019ll never give me the time of day. I\u2019m a fucking joke to someone like her. Why even try?</p><p>Pulling out my phone to give her a call, I look up and see she\u2019s already standing in the front office again. This time I see her laughing at something Butch just said, more at ease with him then she was with me.</p><p>I\u2019m going to fucking kill him. He may be a little rough around the edges, but his blond hair and blue eyes always seem to pull the women in. He cleans up nicer than I seem to be able to. I look over to see Joey trying to hold back a laugh as she looks between me and what\u2019s happening in the front office.</p><p>\u201cPull the fucking car out and drop the keys on the front counter when you\u2019re done,\u201d I snap at her, only making her laugh more. After a second she lifts her hand, extending her middle finger at me.</p><p>I stomp across the garage and throw the door open a little harder than I mean to. I\u2019m shocked the glass window in the door doesn\u2019t shatter when the door hits the wall. The sound makes Duchess jump again. Shit. All I seem to do is make her jump.</p> <p>Butch just leans against the counter like he doesn\u2019t have a care in the world, and irritation boils inside me. I look over at him and put an end to the conversation he\u2019s having. \u201cBack to work. I don\u2019t pay you to flirt with customers.\u201d</p><p>Duchess blushes at my words, looking embarrassed. If I had my way with her, that blush would cover every part of her skin. Yeah, like you\u2019ll get that chance, a voice in the back of my mind says. Girls like her who ooze class won\u2019t give me the time of day. No matter how hard I work, or what I have in my bank, they just think they\u2019re better than me. Types like her want men in stiff suits and five-star dinners. I met a couple girls like her growing up, and I\u2019ve learned to stay clear, and I always have, but something about her is pulling me in.</p><p>Butch winks at her on his way out, and it makes me grind my teeth as he strolls out the open door. If I blackened both of his eyes, he wouldn\u2019t be able to wink again for a while, I think to myself. Once he\u2019s through the door, I reach over and slam it shut. I try to get myself together and push back all these foreign emotions. I take a breath and try to smooth things over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll fixed up. It was the belt,\u201d I confirm. \u201cFollow me to my office, and I\u2019ll write up your bill.\u201d I start walking back towards my office and feel myself release the breath I was holding when I hear the click of her heels following me. I look at the windows that line the garage and see both Joey and Butch watching. Probably wondering why I\u2019m taking her to my office and not just checking her out in the front. I want her in my space. Maybe when we\u2019re in my small office, I can finally get a smell of her.</p><p>I motion for her to sit down when we reach my office, and I close the door behind her. Then I hit the blinds on the window that looks out into the shop so no one can see us. Just her and me now.</p><p>Taking my seat at my desk, I watch as she fidgets with the trim of her dress in her lap. Her pink nail polish is perfectly done, and as I watch her fingers play with the edge, all I can think about is flipping her dress up to see if her panties match.</p><p>She looks so out of place in here. Just like most of the shop, my office is a freaking mess. I never got a nice desk or chairs because they\u2019d be stained in two weeks. Everything is worn and old so I don\u2019t worry about it getting fucked up. The contrast between her and the room is another reminder that she\u2019d never be with someone like me. Even if I pulled just as good of a living as a suit, it\u2019s still all about appearances to people like her. I match their bank accounts, but I sure as shit don\u2019t belong.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an easy fix.\u201d I tell her as I start to fill out the receipt. I should have broken something else and made sure she stayed in town a little longer. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t go too far for a while.\u201d The lie trips off my tongue easily, but I don\u2019t have a moment of guilt about it \u201cStay close to town, I mean.\u201d I raise my eyebrows at her to gauge her reaction.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m in town indefinitely.\u201d The way she says it makes it clear she\u2019s not happy about it. She doesn\u2019t look like she belongs around here, seeing as there isn\u2019t much to this small town. If you want something fancy, you have to make the two-hour drive into Denver.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one twenty-five for the belt with labor.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitating she reaches into her purse and pulls out a silver American Express card.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take those.\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t tell her that we take cards, just not Amex. I\u2019m letting her draw her own conclusions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I have on me unless I can run to an ATM or something real quick.\u201d She starts to rise from the chair like she\u2019s leaving.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no ATM, and the bank is closed. I\u2019m closing up shop for the night, so I need to get paid.\u201d I lie again just as easily as before. They keep slipping from me, but I want to see her again. Maybe if I can get her back here tomorrow, I can come up with a game plan of making a move on her, or at least find out who she is and why she\u2019s here. Everyone knows everything in a small town like this.</p><p>She plops back down into the chair. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cJust come back in the morning with the money.\u201d I stand up and walk to the door like I\u2019m going to leave, but she stops me.</p><p>\u201cI need my car tonight. I still have a few errands I need to run. I have plans.\u201d</p><p>I pause at the door, turning to look at her. She\u2019s still sitting in the chair, staring up at me. Her eyes are pleading, like she\u2019s trying to get me to crack with a pout on her full lips.</p> <p>My eyes move to her chest and linger there, and it makes her breathing pick up. It gives me an opening, and I\u2019m going to take it. I stroll back over to the front of my desk and sit my ass on the edge in front of her, my legs almost touching hers.</p><p>\u201cYou could pay me with something else.\u201d My eyes roam her body, and I let my meaning become clear. I don\u2019t know what made me say it, but the words are out of my mouth before I can pull them back. I expect her to stand up and slap me, or her to storm out of the office, but she just wiggles in her chair a little.</p><p>\u201cWha-what do...\u201d She can\u2019t even get the words out, and I don\u2019t make her finish, because I\u2019m impatient. If she isn\u2019t running then I\u2019m going to push a little more.</p><p>\u201cPull up your dress up. I want to see your panties.\u201d</p><p>Her face turns red, but she grabs the hem of her skirt like she\u2019s going to do it. But instead she just bunches it in her hands, her knuckles going white. Is she really this fucking shy? Nobody who looks like her, who\u2019s dressed like that, is shy. She\u2019s a rich duchess coming into a place like this and asking for it. Fuck it, if she wants to play shy, I\u2019ll help her out.</p><p>Leaning forward, I grab her by the arms, her soft skin like silk against my fingers. I pull her to me so her legs go on either side of my large thighs as I stay seated on the edge of the desk. She lets out a squeak in response but makes no move to stop me. Interesting. I had no clue this would be so easy.</p><p>Reaching down with my stained hand, I flip her dress up, revealing white satin panties. Her legs are spread just enough that I can see a little wet spot.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>She\u2019s turned on, and I haven\u2019t even done anything to her. The sight has my cock pushing against the zipper of my jeans, and I welcome the pain. Because it stops me from cumming in my pants.</p><p>\u201cHold it,\u201d I say, indicating that I want her to hold up her dress for me. I need my hand for this.</p><p>\u201cBut I showed you. Now give me my keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was for the belt, materials. This next part is for the labor.\u201d I lick my lips just thinking about the next part. God, what I\u2019d give to bury my face between her thick thighs and make her scream my name. I\u2019d make her tell her who\u2019s giving it to her. That she\u2019s fucking the local mechanic. Not some preppy dick in a suit, which I\u2019m sure is what she\u2019s used to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you,\u201d she blurts out, and it makes me clench my teeth. In spite of her words, her dress remains bunched up in her hands and she keeps herself revealed to me. That\u2019s fine, Duchess. Pretend all you want. I\u2019ll play if it gets me a little bit of you.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, when I fuck you, you\u2019ll beg for it.\u201d Reaching down, I run my fingers across the soft panties, just teasing her a bit. I feel the damp spot against my digits, and I need more. I use two fingers to pull them to the side and feel her bare pussy. No fucking hair. I bet she has it waxed off. But for who, I wonder. The thought makes me jealous and angry, and I can\u2019t hold back the growl that leaves my chest.</p><p>Her eyes go big at the sound, and I yank at the panties, pulling them from her body. I want to see her bare pussy for myself, and I want to mark it as mine. The thought is primal and barbaric, but I don\u2019t care. I want this pussy for myself. Only mine. She might have waxed it for someone else, but I\u2019m sure as fuck going to put my mark on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her words come out breathless, but she makes no move to stop me or drop her dress. In fact, she leans into me a little more. She says one thing, but her body is betraying her.</p><p>I bring the underwear to my nose, smelling her sweet scent, and I let it fill my lungs, I almost lose it when I feel the wet spot against my face. Knowing I don\u2019t have much time before I lose my load of cum, I drop her panties onto my desk and free my cock from my jeans.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuge,\u201d I finish for her. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing one of her hips, I pull her closer to me. Using my other hand, I guide my cock to her pussy lips. They part easily for the head of my dick, and I find her hard little clit begging for attention.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot God, baby. Paine,\u201d I correct her as I start to move the head of my cock back and forth on her clit. I want to rip the top of her dress and suck her big tits, but it would ruin the dress, and I don\u2019t want her walking out of here with them on display. So I grip her hip a little tighter, making my hand stay in place.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d Her eyes look glassy, her pupils dilated. She\u2019s so fucking turned on, the smell of her pussy fills the room. Her juices coat the head of my cock, showing me how much she wants this too. Her body is begging for some cock.</p><p>It takes everything in me not to say, \u201cPlaying with your pussy, which is now mine.\u201d Instead I go with, \u201cCollecting the bill with your cunt.\u201d</p><p>She moans, dropping her head back, her hair brushing my fingers that are gripping her hip.</p><p>She looks so young and pure, like she\u2019s never known this kind of pleasure before. Shit.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re legal,\u201d I growl. I\u2019m not sure if I could pull away if she told me she\u2019s underage. It might just be worth the prison time.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-one,\u201d she mumbles, lost in the pleasure. Thank fuck. I don\u2019t know what I would have done. I\u2019m sure there isn\u2019t a thing that could pull her from me in this moment.</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d I ask, picking up speed, rubbing her clit back and forth with the head of my dick, slipping easily through her juicy pussy lips. \u201cYou use this pussy to get whatever you want, don\u2019t you? I bet you have men wrapped around your finger.\u201d The words make me sound like an asshole, and I know it. I started this, but I hate that she so easily let me have her. Does she do this with everyone? Is this some game to her? Here I am, falling all over her and this could mean nothing to her, but maybe she thinks the same of me. She has no idea that I don\u2019t fall all over women. Hell, I haven\u2019t even thought about a woman in years. Too busy working on my shop. Until her.</p><p>I push the thoughts away because I won\u2019t ruin this for myself. I\u2019m going to enjoy this perfection I have in my hands while I\u2019ve got it.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d She says the words angrily as she tries to move her hips. She\u2019s mad as hell but wants to make me go faster. I tighten my grip on her even more so she can\u2019t take what she wants. She\u2019s bound to have marks there tomorrow from the way I\u2019m holding her.</p><p>I can tell she is about to cum, her body strung tight. I\u2019m so fucking close too, but I\u2019m controlling this. She already has too much control of me; I at least get this.</p><p>\u201cSoon I\u2019ll be fucking you, Duchess. You\u2019ll take me inside your little cunt until I fill you with every drop of cum I have. Then I\u2019ll do it over and over again until you beg me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaine!\u201d She yells my name, cumming at my filthy words. She\u2019s probably never been talked to like that, and I fucking love it.</p><p>I let myself cum with her, releasing the cum that\u2019s been building up in my balls since she strolled her ass into my shop. My cum coats her clit, her pussy lips, and thighs. I cum harder than I\u2019ve ever cum in my entire life. I cum so hard, I see stars. The intensity rocks me to my core. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never felt before, and warmth fills my chest.</p> <p>When I finally come back to earth, she\u2019s dropping her skirt and backing away from me.</p><p>\u201cDuchess,\u201d I say, reaching for her and wanting to touch her lips to mine. I want to finally get a taste of her. She had to have felt what just happened here. It was life changing. There\u2019s something between us, but she dodges my hand and bolts for the door.</p><p>It takes me a minute to get my still-hard cock back into my jeans before I run after her. By the time I make it to the front of the shop, I see her car pulling out, the screech of tires filling my ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d she get the keys?\u201d I look over and see Joey standing behind the counter. I give her a hard glare, and she holds her hands up in defense.</p><p>\u201cThey were sitting right here. I thought she was good to go.\u201d She raises an eyebrow in question, but I don\u2019t answer her.</p><p>Fuck me, I don\u2019t even know her name.</p><p>Two</p> <p>Penelope</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do a shot!\u201d my cousin Lizzy shouts as she jumps up from our table and starts dancing backwards to the bar. Her brown curly hair bounces with her steps as she nearly runs into two people along the way. Her moonwalk makes it clear she doesn\u2019t need another drink, but I sure do.</p><p>My body is still buzzing from the orgasm Paine gave me hours ago, and I need something to take the edge off. If this is what orgasms are really like, I\u2019ve been missing out. I\u2019m starting to think the ones I\u2019ve been giving myself aren\u2019t orgasms at all. When Paine touched me, it was as if my body came to life for the first time.</p><p>I still can\u2019t believe I did that. I\u2019m chalking it up as one final dirty thing I did before I get married next week. I\u2019m guessing Scott would never talk to me the way Paine did today. I know for a fact he doesn\u2019t get the response from my body that Paine does.</p><p>I follow Lizzy to the bar, needing another shot so I can forget about my impending nuptials to a man I\u2019ve met a handful of times. The only time I ever talk to him is when I\u2019m trying to reach my father. I\u2019ve not so much as hugged the guy. I was just as shocked as everyone else when I got the wedding invitation in the mail. An invitation to a wedding I didn\u2019t even know was happening until two weeks ago. Apparently, right after I graduated from college I was to be wed. Glad I got the invitation, otherwise I may have not known.</p> <p>I\u2019d planned to come to town and tell my father that I would marry his lawyer over my dead body, but I got shut down fast when he informed me that if I didn\u2019t do as he commanded, he\u2019d cut me off from seeing my grandmother. I\u2019ve just graduated with my business degree, and I don\u2019t need him or his money anymore. I can get a job and make my own life, but telling me he\u2019ll never let me see my bedridden grandmother again was enough to have me doing whatever it is he wants. It was the nail in my wedding coffin.</p><p>My grandmother is all I have. I have no idea how she puts up with him, but she doesn\u2019t have anyone else to rely on. Having never known my mother, I clung to her as I was growing up. She was the only softness in my life. My father just treats me like an object he can use to further his political career. I was shipped off to boarding school at the age of eight, where I stayed until I graduated high school and went right into college. Both were all-girls schools. My mother died in childbirth, so my grandmother stepped in as best as she could. My father had the final say, though, using my need for a good education as a reason to send me away. Thankfully, I had my grandmother\u2019s letters to keep me company, and any holiday I had, she would come visit me, saying I didn\u2019t need to come home. I think she knew even then that he held all the power over me, and as she got older and her health began to fail, he now has power over her. The two of us try to cling to one another while someone else calls the shots.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why I had my reaction to Paine. I\u2019d never met a man like him. He has power within him, but it didn\u2019t feel like he wanted to control me. No, it felt like so much more than that. It felt like Paine wanted to devour me. He wanted to consume my body, yet in his presence I felt like I had the dominance. He oozed sex and masculinity, and it woke something inside me I didn\u2019t even know was there.</p><p>\u201cTwo lemon drop shots, please,\u201d Lizzy says to the bartender, and he gives her a look like really? What did she expect? The bar is worn, with old pool tables, dartboards, and a wooden floor that has seen better days. I like it, though. It goes with the town. The place feels homey, like everyone knows everyone else. Sadly, I don\u2019t know anyone here, and I grew up in the town. Well, technically it was my home address, but I was never here. I was always away at school or some kind of summer program. When I did get to come home, I spent all my time with my grandmother at the family estate. My father now lives in the mayor\u2019s mansion, and oddly enough, I\u2019ve never even been inside it. Although I\u2019m going to see it soon because I\u2019m getting married there next week. I have to hold back the eye roll at my own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cTwo vodka shots will be fine,\u201d I finally say, seeing that neither one of them is going to move. \u201cWhatever kind of vodka you\u2019ve got is fine.\u201d The bartender fills two shot glasses and slides them across the bar to us.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even chill them.\u201d Lizzy eyes the vodka like it might bite her. I don\u2019t blame her, but at this point I just don\u2019t care. I\u2019d take a shot of anything. \u201cTold you we should have gone to DeDe\u2019s.\u201d She pouts at not going to the nice bar in town, but I wanted to come here because it\u2019s different to places I normally go to. I find myself wanting different a lot lately.</p> <p>\u201cJust do it fast.\u201d I grab one of the shots and shoot it back. The burn of cheap vodka makes me cringe, but for some reason I smile.</p><p>Lizzy coughs, then grabs the man\u2019s beer next to us to use as a chaser. She\u2019s comical about it, and it gives the stranger an in to talk to us. \u201cCan I buy you ladies another? It\u2019s the least I could do for the bride-to-be.\u201d</p><p>I adjust the stupid sash I\u2019m wearing. Lizzy and Deb demanded I put on the pink band emblazoned with \u2018Bride-To-Be\u2019 in pink lettering. The guy is hot, but not Paine-hot. The thought pulls my mind back to Paine again. His thick, muscular body leaning close into mine. His huge hand on my waist as he holds me in place. His dark-blond, shaggy hair and scruffy beard made him look wild. His waist was trim, exaggerating his broad shoulders, and those arms looked like he could pick up ten of me. He looked like he\u2019d run a motorcycle club on one of those TV shows. I bet he even drives one. God, what would it feel like to be on the back of his bike? I squeeze my thighs together as I remember his long thick cock. I think about the vibrations from a motorcycle and having him between me like that, and it\u2019s enough to have me soaking my panties all over again. Just the thought of Paine has me hotter than I\u2019ve ever been in my life, and all I can think about are his dirty hands on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShot! Shot! Shot! Shot!\u201d I hear the other girls from our table start to chant, and it pulls my thoughts away from Paine. I really wish Lizzy hadn\u2019t set up this little bachelorette party, but she has no idea I have no desire to get married. We are distant cousins, not super close, having really only spent some holidays together over the years. Between that and a few random emails, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s really happening.</p><p>I had no idea she had anything planned, but when she told me we were going out, after the day I\u2019d had, I just went with it. Now I\u2019m wearing this stupid sash and crown, and I don\u2019t know how my night could get worse. At least I convinced them to come to Smokey\u2019s tonight instead of somewhere else. I just need a dive bar with lots of alcohol, and this is the perfect place.</p><p>We take the next round of shots that the guy next to Lizzy bought us, and I have to promise to save him a dance when the music starts up. We all chat and drink for a while until the bar finally fills with music, and all of us girls jump up. We head for the small makeshift dance floor as the house band starts to play. I\u2019m feeling good from the alcohol, and I sway my hips, closing my eyes and enjoying the music.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. Paine\u2019s here.\u201d At Lizzy\u2019s words, my eyes pop open. \u201cGod, he\u2019s so fucking hot.\u201d She knows Paine? Of course she does. She grew up here and everyone knows everybody, it seems. It takes everything in me not to turn and look at him, so I hold my drink and focus on the stage. I look down at myself, and it makes it me curse. Shit. The sash. Lizzy stares unabashedly, not an ounce of shame. \u201cOh my God, he\u2019s coming this way. Damn, Penelope, he looks pissed.\u201d</p> <p>Three</p><p>Paine</p><p>I walk into Smokey\u2019s and head to the bar. It\u2019s surprisingly busy considering this hole in the wall is usually half-empty. After the day I\u2019ve had, I need a drink. I move over to my usual stool, and Jake, one of the bartenders, comes over with my usual beer. To say I\u2019m a creature of habit is an understatement. I like my order, and I like things to be simple. But little Duchess came into the shop today and shook my whole world upside down. I need to have a drink and try to forget about her, something I haven\u2019t been able to do since she strolled into my life.</p><p>Butch and Joey stand behind me, and Jake slides their usual to them. I grab mine and nod my thanks, but he stands in front of me, not going anywhere. When I raise an eyebrow in question, he leans over the bar like he\u2019s got a secret for me. What the hell? Are we in sixth grade?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bachelorette party happening here tonight if you guys are looking for some action.\u201d</p> <p>I can feel Joey\u2019s eye roll beside me, while Butch leans in a little closer. I, on the other hand, have no interest in getting laid tonight. I\u2019ve had enough trouble with pussy today to last me a while.</p><p>An image of my little Duchess\u2019 cunt flashes in my mind, and my dick twitches. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have slipped my thick cock inside that tight hole. I bet she would have sucked it off just from the twitches of her orgasm. I shake my head and take a drink of my beer, hoping to wash the thoughts away.</p><p>\u201cPoint me in the right direction, Jake. You know I\u2019m always looking for some fresh trim in this town.\u201d Butch sits up and peers over the crowd as Jake points towards the dance floor. Curiosity gets the better of me, and my eyes follow Jake\u2019s pointing finger. Suddenly, Butch laughs and looks back at me. \u201cLooks like that rich chick with the Porsche is the bride-to-be.\u201d</p><p>I grip the bottle of my beer so tightly, I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t shatter. Everything in my vision goes red, and suddenly, my beer is being taken out of my hand. I look over and see Joey has taken it from me, and she\u2019s giving me a look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold it for you, boss,\u201d she says, and nods over to the dance floor.</p><p>I don\u2019t say a word as I get up and start to make my way over to a crowd of girls. There\u2019s probably about a dozen of them, all in various stages of drunkenness. I see Lizzy Eastman standing just in front of what looks like the back of my Duchess\u2019 head. She\u2019s turned away from me, and Lizzy is standing in front of her, almost like she\u2019s blocking her.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Paine! It\u2019s so good to see your body, I mean, you.\u201d Lizzy snorts as she slurs her words, and I\u2019m a little concerned about how she\u2019s going to get home. We aren\u2019t best friends, but I know her name and have seen her grow up around here. This is a small town, so even if we\u2019ve never been introduced, we know who the other one is.</p><p>\u201cI got this one, boss,\u201d Butch says, tapping my shoulder and stepping up beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Lizzy. Show me some of those dance moves.\u201d Butch takes her hand and Lizzy follows him around to the other side. Butch may talk a lot of shit, but deep down he\u2019s a good guy, and I know he\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s safe.</p><p>I\u2019m still standing in the same spot, and little Duchess hasn\u2019t moved an inch. She\u2019s tight with tension and facing away from me. It\u2019s as if she thinks if she doesn\u2019t turn around, then I\u2019m not really here.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the big day?\u201d</p><p>I see her shoulders deflate a little, and she turns to face me. She looks me up and down and licks her lips, and it takes everything in me not to kiss her right here, right now. Those thick lips look like they\u2019re just begging for a dick, and I want to help her out with that need.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna answer me, Duchess?\u201d I try to keep the anger out of my voice, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working.</p><p>She looks around and then bites her lip, once again making me want to stuff my cock in her mouth. She finally brings her eyes back up to mine. \u201cNext week.\u201d The words are barely whispered, but I hear it over the music. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why do her words feel like a shot to the heart? Like I\u2019ve lost something that I never had to begin with? I need to get my shit together. Obviously, this little rich girl just wanted to play with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks before she got married. Have one last little fling. Well, I\u2019ll give her something to remember before she says \u201cI do.\u201d I tell myself this, but it\u2019s a lie. I want her myself.</p><p>Grabbing her by the arm, I start dragging her towards the back of the bar. I only feel a slight protest, but she quickly matches my pace and comes along willingly. I pull her down the long hallway that leads out to a back alley, but instead of going out there, I open the door to the back storage room and pull her inside. There\u2019s just a single lightbulb overhead, and once I turn it on, I close the door behind us and lock it. The room is full of cleaning supplies, a bucket and a mop. It\u2019s a small dirty room and just about perfect for what I want from her.</p><p>I turn to look at my Duchess and see her eyes are a little wide with fear. \u201cWhat do you want, Paine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave that crown on while you suck me off.\u201d My words are filthy and cocky, but I don\u2019t care. She wants to be used up and have a fling, I\u2019m going to get what I can. Never mind what my heart is telling me. I\u2019ll ignore it for now.</p><p>Her little tongue comes out and licks her lips, like she\u2019s preparing, but she shakes her head. I let out a short laugh and crowd her personal space.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me no? You couldn\u2019t seem to find that word earlier today either, Duchess.\u201d I undo my belt and then my jeans. I keep eye contact with her as I reach into my boxer briefs and pull out my hard cock. I wrap my big hand around it and stroke it a few times. \u201cYou wanna get dirty with a man from the wrong side of town before you tie the knot, then you better get on your knees and get to it, Duchess.\u201d I need those juicy lips surrounding my dick.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d she says, licking her lips again and looking down between us. Her eyes grow wide when she sees how big I am, and I feel my cock grin as she starts to reach out towards it. Before she makes contact, she looks up at me hesitantly. She\u2019s had to have done this plenty of times, so I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s nervous. She needs to get on her knees and open up. I\u2019m horny as fuck because of her, and she needs to fix it.</p><p>The thought of her with other men makes me so fucking jealous. I\u2019ve never felt this kind of raw anger before, and it\u2019s driving me crazy. Normally, I\u2019m a laid-back guy who doesn\u2019t get caught up in women, but one sight of this little thing and I\u2019m being led around by my dick. The sight of her sash and the words \u2018Bride-To-Be\u2019 written across it make me even madder.</p><p>I reach out, quickly snatching her wrist. \u201cYou ran out so fast on me earlier, I didn\u2019t get your name. Why don\u2019t you use that sweet little tongue of yours to spell it out on my cock?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opens in shock, but I see her pupils dilate, the gray darkening as a shiver goes down her back. She can fight it all she wants, but she loves the dirty talk. If this is all I can have of her, I\u2019ll take it and deal with the consequences later. I\u2019ve got to cum before my balls explode, and this is all her fault. Time for her to pay up.</p><p>Slowly, she nods her head and runs her hands down my chest and stomach, making me hate my shirt as she moves lower down my body and gets on her knees in front of me. I hold my cock out for her, and I watch as she reaches out and takes it from my shaking hands. I feel a tremble go through my body at the same time, and I don\u2019t know why I react to her the way I do. I don\u2019t have any control over my need, and it\u2019s maddening.</p><p>\u201cOpen up, Duchess. I want you to earn that crown you\u2019re wearing.\u201d She opens her mouth, and I reach down, grabbing her soft blonde hair in both hands. She looks up at me through her long black lashes just as the tip of my cock touches her lips. \u201cAnd when you get me off, I want you to drink down my cum so that when you go back to that asshole you\u2019re going to marry, you\u2019ve got me in your belly.\u201d</p><p>A white pearl of cum beads at the end of my dick and drops onto her bottom lip. She licks it up, and I feel her warm tongue against my cock, and it makes another white pearl appear. She wiggles the point of her tongue into the hole of my cock as if she\u2019s trying to get all of the flavor she can. When I see a bit of cum coat her tongue, she closes her eyes and moans at my taste. At the sight, I almost lose it. \u201cFuck,\u201d I moan, closing my eyes tightly and trying to think about baseball. I don\u2019t want it to be over yet. Jesus, I don\u2019t ever want it to be over.</p><p>Suddenly, I feel her warm mouth open wide over my dick, and she sucks me to the back of her throat. I look down, and the sight makes me grip her hair tighter. I feel her tongue licking the underside of my cock, and it massages more cum out of me. The thick vein underneath is pulsing, and I know she\u2019s getting thick drop after thick drop in her mouth. It turns me on to think of me inside her and having her on her knees in front of me gives me power.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Duchess. You give such good head. I think you might suck my soul out of my dick.\u201d I feel her giggle around my cock, and the feeling goes straight to my balls. She\u2019s got a mouth made for fucking, and I start to pump my hips a little while holding her hair. I fuck in and out of her mouth, and she just kneels there, taking it.</p><p>Her hands come up to stroke the length of my cock she can\u2019t get in her mouth, and she grips me there, rubbing up and down as I keep up my shallow thrusts, her mouth open and taking what I give her. I want this to last forever, but her mouth is too sweet. It\u2019s too hot and too good, and I won\u2019t last much longer. I can feel her excitement while she\u2019s licking me, and I can see her body moving to her own rhythm. She\u2019s turned on by this, and knowing that takes me to the edge. Fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s moaning around me and nearly giddy as she sucks my dick. She\u2019s loving it, and I can\u2019t hold on. \u201cI\u2019m gonna nut, baby. You want it in your mouth or on your face?\u201d</p><p>She pulls back just a second and says, \u201cMouth,\u201d while catching her breath and going back to my cock. She sucks harder and deeper, and it\u2019s so good. I want to close my eyes, but I can\u2019t stand the thought of missing a single second of this.</p><p>Just before I let go, I see one of her hands move from the base of my cock and go between her legs and up her dress. The fact that she\u2019s touching her pussy while sucking my cum is all it takes to send me over. I grip her hair around her bridal crown and pull her down on my cock as I cum deep in her throat. I feel her swallow around the head of my dick, and I\u2019m barely able to stand upright as she takes every drop of me.</p><p>I watch as the hand between her legs speeds up, and her body tenses at the same time as mine. Jesus Christ, she just came while sucking my dick. Goddamn, I wish I could taste that orgasm. I wanna get her on the ground and sixty-nine with her. If she cums just from sucking my cock, imagine what she\u2019d do if I was eating her pussy at the same time.</p><p>After I come back down from outer space, I gently touch her hair and stroke her cheek with my thumb. I feel so protective of her, and right now, I just want to scoop her up in my arms and take her home with me. We lock eyes, and something passes between us. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s reading my mind and asking me to take her away.</p><p>I open my mouth to ask her to come with me. I could take her home and never let her leave, she\u2019d be mine forever, but suddenly there\u2019s a loud crash on the other side of the door. The spell is broken, and she\u2019s on her feet in a flash. I hurriedly tuck my cock back into my jeans and turn around, pulling the door open.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d Lizzy belts out, and I see Butch running up behind her, throwing his hands up in apology. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for forever. We gotta go. One of your sorority sisters\u2014Mindy, Wendy, Cindy, I can\u2019t remember her name. Anyway, she threw up on the drummer and we gotta go. The limo is about to leave. Bye, Paine. Always nice to see your body, I mean, you.\u201d Lizzy reaches out and snags my Duchess\u2019 wrist, pulling her from me.</p><p>Just before I can reach out and pull her back to me, she\u2019s through the door. I take one step, and she turns back to me, shouting over the music.</p><p>\u201cPenelope. I was spelling out Penelope.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Paine</p><p>\u201cPenelope,\u201d I mumble to myself, taking another swig from my beer.</p><p>\u201cIf you say that word one more time, I\u2019m going to knock you off that fucking stool,\u201d Joey says, dropping her shot glass back on the bar. Seems I\u2019m not the only one trying to drown my sorrows, but I\u2019m half-failing at it because this is only my second beer. Maybe I should switch to the hard stuff like Joey. She seems well on her way to not remembering the night.</p><p>I can\u2019t fucking believe I let her slip out of here. She\u2019s probably going home to her fianc\u00e9. I should have made it clear there was no more fucking fianc\u00e9 in her life. She may have been his yesterday, but she was mine tonight. I coated her pussy and mouth with my cum and marked her as my territory. She doesn\u2019t know it, but now she\u2019s mine. The sooner she comes to terms with it, the better.</p><p>Fuck, I don\u2019t even know her last name. Everyone I asked in the bar has no clue who she is. Shit. I pull my hand through my shaggy hair, trying to release some of the tension. I haven\u2019t even known this girl ten hours and I\u2019m all kinds of fucked up. She\u2019s got me twisted up like never before, and it was so hard and fast I couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up,\u201d I tell Joey, looking over at her fiddling with the paper on her beer bottle, pulling it off and sticking it back on.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did. You went after something you can\u2019t have and you shouldn\u2019t want,\u201d she says, her dark green eyes coming to mine. Something like understanding flashes in them. I wonder if she\u2019s talking more about herself than she\u2019s talking about me. I didn\u2019t mean I fucked up by being with my little Duchess, I meant I fucked up by letting her slip through my fingers tonight. I don\u2019t like the feeling of not knowing where she is. It doesn\u2019t sit right with me.</p><p>\u201cEvening, Sheriff. What can I do for you tonight?\u201d the bartender says. It draws my eyes to the mirror behind the bar, and I see the sheriff standing five feet back from Joey and me. Joey flinches, and I see her grip the empty shot glass tightly in her hand.</p><p>Well, isn\u2019t that interesting. I sure hope it\u2019s not what I think it is. I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about Sheriff Law Anderson, the Mayor\u2019s son. The mayor named his kid Law, as if he knew that one day he\u2019d use him, which is what worries me about him. Anyone under Mayor Anderson\u2019s thumb is someone to keep an eye on.</p><p>I\u2019d heard he used to be a big detective up in Chicago until Daddy Mayor made him come home. And he had himself a sheriff in his back pocket two point five seconds later. Law\u2019s not the type I thought Joey would go for, or vice versa. Joey has jet-black hair, so dark it\u2019s almost blue. Sometimes she\u2019ll put wild colors in it that match the tats she\u2019s got on her shoulders and back. She\u2019s always in simple jeans, boots, and tees, and never has a trace of make-up or anything girly on her. I guess I always thought she\u2019d go for some tatted-up motorcycle guy, or maybe a tatted-up motorcycle chick. I don\u2019t ask her a lot of questions. But I never thought she\u2019d go for the good ol\u2019 boy next door like Law Anderson. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust checking on things,\u201d he responds, but his eyes stay on Joey\u2019s back. She\u2019s pretending he\u2019s not there. Until he speaks to her. \u201cHow you doing, Josephine?\u201d</p><p>Josephine? Fuck me. This isn\u2019t good. I expect her to stand up and get in Law\u2019s face, but she just raises her hand, giving him the finger. She still hasn\u2019t turned around and refuses to meet his eyes in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cJosephine, sweets, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweets\u2014\u201d I try to say something, but she cuts both of us off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, Anderson? Pretty sure stalking is against the law.\u201d</p><p>I watch the Sheriff\u2019s jaw tick. The bar has become eerily quiet now because everyone is watching what\u2019s happening. It seems to make the Sheriff uncomfortable, until he breaks the silence.</p><p>\u201cJake, my sister around? I thought they came in here tonight,\u201d Law says, looking to the bartender.</p><p>\u201cShe with that bachelorette party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have been them.\u201d If Law\u2019s sister was with the bachelorette party, I realize I might have a way to find out who my Penelope is. I start to speak up, but his next words hit me hard. \u201cShe\u2019s the bachelorette.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly everything clicks into place.</p><p>A distant memory of the Mayor\u2019s daughter coming home from college to marry his lawyer, Scott Winstead, has me clenching my teeth so hard I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t crack. Scott and I go away back, and the history isn\u2019t fucking good. The guy\u2019s a cocky bastard who thinks his shit doesn\u2019t stink, and he\u2019s just as crooked as the mayor. Two peas in a fucking pod, those two are.</p><p>At least I know where to find her now. She\u2019s either at the Mayor\u2019s house or their old family estate. If she\u2019s at fucking Scott\u2019s house, I\u2019ll burn the place to the ground with Scott still in it.</p><p>\u201cThey left here about two hours ago,\u201d Jake says, pouring old Jim at the end of the bar another glass of cheap whiskey.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I was just checking in before I head home for the night.\u201d</p><p>Joey snorts at his words like she doesn\u2019t believe him. She mumbles something I don\u2019t catch, but before I can ask, Law is speaking to her.</p> <p>\u201cJosephine, can I have a word with you outside?\u201d He shifts back and forth on his feet, looking nervous. Hell, I\u2019d be nervous too if I kept calling Joey \u2018Josephine,\u2019 but he says it as if he\u2019s always done it. The two can\u2019t have a ton a history because Joey\u2019s only been here a little over a year now.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d She motions for Sam to pour another shot. \u201cThe Sheriff or Law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking, sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the answer is no. Besides, you don\u2019t like being seen with me in public.\u201d She shrugs her shoulders like she doesn\u2019t give a shit, but I can tell by how tense she is that it\u2019s an act.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fucking true and you know it.\u201d Law takes a step towards her, but Joey slams her shot back and jumps up from the stool with a little wobble in her step. Both Law and I move at the same time to make sure she doesn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch her,\u201d Law growls at me, pulling her towards himself in a possessive hold.</p><p>Normally, I\u2019d tell him to go fuck himself, but Joey can hold her own, and I don\u2019t want to start shit with Penelope\u2019s brother. I already have a fight ahead of me, and I don\u2019t want to throw fuel on the fire just yet. I want to keep my cards as close to my chest as I can.</p><p>Just as I thought, Joey pushes at Law\u2019s chest and makes him take a step back from her. Joey is small, barely coming up to Law\u2019s chest, but she knows how to defend herself.</p> <p>\u201cYou made your choice. Now live with it.\u201d She tries to go past him, but he grabs her by the arm, and she gives him a look that would kill a lesser man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too drunk to drive.\u201d His words are soft and filled with concern.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t even respond to him. Joey just calls out Butch\u2019s name. He\u2019s over at one of the pool tables, but when he hears her calling him, he walks over.</p><p>\u201cButch has me,\u201d she says, and her voice is a little smug.</p><p>Law clenches his jaw again, but what can he really say? If he knows anything about Joey, he knows she shares a townhouse with Butch. He was friends with her brothers, and he was the reason Joey moved here. She\u2019s been staying at his place since she got here, but as far as I know nothing\u2019s happened between them. But again, I don\u2019t ask a lot of questions.</p><p>\u201cPick up your phone,\u201d Law says, but Joey isn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d With that, she\u2019s gone, strolling from the bar. Butch gives me a \u2018what the fuck?\u2019 look before he follows her out, leaving the Sheriff just standing there looking like a kicked puppy. I\u2019m not so sure he can handle Joey. She might be small, but she makes up for it with attitude and an iron will.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in over your head,\u2019 I tell him, finally turning to look at him head on.</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m somewhere with her, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d With that, he follows Joey and Butch.</p><p>Shaking my head, I get our tabs and close them out, thankful I didn\u2019t let myself get drunk like I wanted to. No, I need to make sure my sweet Penelope is tucked into her own bed for the night. Alone. Once I get that squared away, maybe I can start to think of a way to dig out of this shitstorm I seem to have landed myself in.</p><p>This morning I woke up without a care in the world, and now I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up or down. It\u2019s making me understand now what the Sheriff was saying. I\u2019d rather be in this mess with Penelope than have no Penelope at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Making my way out to my motorcycle, I hop on and drive past the Mayor\u2019s place first. When I don\u2019t see any cars or signs of anyone home, I head towards the old Anderson estate. I can\u2019t believe that Penelope\u2019s family has lived in the same town as me all these years and I\u2019d never seen her before. There no way I wouldn\u2018t have remembered a girl walking around this town with hair and eyes like hers, no matter the age. Hell, I\u2019d never met Law either until he came back to run for sheriff. Their father must have had them sent off to private schools their whole lives. Probably didn\u2019t want them to see the fucked-up shit he does.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he wanted to hide the fact that he fucks anything that moves. Mayor\u2019s got a nasty reputation for not being able to keep it in his pants, even though he\u2019s married to a woman who can in no way be Penelope\u2019s mom. Unless she had her at five. I\u2019ve also heard he likes his pills, too, but for all I know, that one could just be small-town gossip. Shit spreads like wildfire around here.</p><p>When I make it to the Anderson estate, I park my motorcycle outside of the north wall so no one can spot it or hear me pull up. Jumping the wall, I make my way up to the house. I\u2019ve only ever seen it from a distance. My family was never invited to any of the charity events or parties that were held here. We didn\u2019t meet a certain standard, so we weren\u2019t allowed inside the gates. Seeing it up close, it looks like a fucking palace, making my Duchess\u2019 nickname all the more fitting.</p><p>What\u2019s the Mayor going to do when he finds out I\u2019ve got my hooks so deep in his daughter they\u2019ll never come out? I have a gut feeling things aren\u2019t going to be easy after tonight.</p><p>When I make it to the front of the house, I say a silent thanks for her car being parked outside in the driveway. Bonus, the thing\u2019s unlocked. Bad girl, Duchess. Popping the hood, I take out the ignition coil and disable it, ensuring someone\u2019s going to need a tow right into my shop tomorrow morning.</p><p>You can run all you like, Duchess, but you\u2019ll be tracking me down come morning. Quietly shutting the hood, I look around to see if I see Scott\u2019s BMW. For all I know, it\u2019s parked in the garage or outside Tammy Lean\u2019s house. How the fuck did that slip my mind? Scott\u2019s been nailing her since Butch peeled her off his dick.</p><p>Going back to my motorcycle, I head to the other side of town and release a breath when I see Scott\u2019s car parked outside of Tammy\u2019s. Thank fuck. I didn\u2019t want to go kicking in the Andersons\u2019 front door. Now I don\u2019t feel so bad about stealing his girl. He doesn\u2019t deserve her if he keeps dipping his dick into a viper like Tammy. Had to be something wrong with him, anyway, if he\u2019d throw Penelope to the side so easily.</p><p>Glancing at my watch, I see that it\u2019s already two in the morning. I head back to the shop, just deciding to crash in the apartment upstairs for the night. I want to make sure I\u2019m there when she shows up in the morning.</p><p>When I get up into the apartment, I go over to the bed and flop back on it. Reaching down, I pull Penelope\u2019s satin panties out of my pocket, then free my hard cock from my jeans. I bring the panties to my nose and breathe in her scent. Then I wrap them around my cock and slowly start stroking myself.</p><p>I picture her riding my dick and begging me to fill her with my cum. Her warm cunt would contract around me, sucking every drop into her willing body. The thought of her begging me to spill inside her has me cumming all over myself. Even after I\u2019ve tried to get out every drop, it does nothing to lessen the ache in my cock.</p><p>Fuck. I\u2019m never falling asleep.</p><p>Five</p><p>Paine</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at the front desk with my boots kicked up on the counter and sipping some coffee. I gave up on sleep and decided to just wait down here, hoping she comes in before the shop opens. I\u2019ve caught up on paperwork, done the bookkeeping, and checked over all the work being done in the garage.</p><p>I have nothing else to do besides sit and wait, and it\u2019s killing me. The need for her is like a living and breathing thing.</p><p>About an hour later, the phone rings. It\u2019s Eddie, the local guy who does the towing in our town. He\u2019s calling to make sure someone\u2019s here to sign for a Porsche, and I grin from ear to ear when I give him the okay.</p><p>After his phone call, I start pacing the shop, the anticipation killing me. I\u2019ve still got at least another hour before anyone shows up for work at the shop, and I\u2019m hoping I have that hour alone with my Duchess.</p><p>After what feels like an eternity, I see a flash of light, and then I hear the sound of a tow truck pulling in. I can\u2019t help my excitement as I stand at the entrance, waiting on them to pull up. I feel a little of the pressure in my chest release when I see a blonde in Eddie\u2019s passenger seat. I wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d come or not, but I\u2019m happy she did. I\u2019m also happy Eddie is a happily married man with three kids, or I wouldn\u2019t have liked her riding alone in a truck with him.</p><p>I make my way outside, and I see her open the truck door and jump out. I feel an ache deep in my cock at the sight of her. She\u2019s wearing a flannel shirt with jeans and cowboy boots. Her blonde hair is in a messy knot on top of her head, and she doesn\u2019t have a speck of make-up on. She looks like she just woke up, and I suddenly have the urge to throw her on the back of my bike and take her to my bed. My God, she couldn\u2019t be more beautiful than she is right now. All sweet and soft.</p><p>Slamming the door of the truck behind her, she stomps over to where I\u2019m standing. When she gets in front of me, she puts her hands on her hips, and it\u2019s then I notice that she\u2019s pissed. It makes me smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMorning, Duchess. You miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou messed with my car, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I take a step forward, putting my body close to hers. We\u2019re almost touching, but not quite. She looks away but then takes a breath and looks up at me through her lashes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Couldn\u2019t get to Starbucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was going for breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>I reach out and gently stroke her cheek, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cDidn\u2019t get enough to eat last night?\u201d My insinuation is clear, and her cheeks redden at my words.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d She looks over her shoulder at Eddie, who\u2019s unloading her car.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you to breakfast. We can go to the diner around the corner.\u201d I should have offered to make her breakfast, but there\u2019s no food upstairs in the apartment, and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll go home with me yet.</p><p>Penelope turns back around and looks in my eyes. After a second she finally nods, and I feel like I gained a little more control. She\u2019s got me so tied up over her.</p><p>Walking over to Eddie, I sign the paperwork and have him leave the car so I can fix it. Once he\u2019s gone, I walk over to my Duchess and take her hand. I lead us to the direction of the diner, and she starts to pull her hand away. Feeling her resistance, I turn and look at her, wanting to make this clear.</p> <p>\u201cYou married yet?\u201d I don\u2019t mean the words to come out angry, but they do.</p><p>She looks away from me, shifting her gaze to the ground. I can barely make out the word as she whispers, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can hold my fucking hand and have breakfast with me.\u201d Snatching her hand back, I walk us towards the diner again, and this time I don\u2019t feel an ounce of fight from her. She may be promised to someone else, but she\u2019s mine. And I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make sure it stays that way.</p><p>I try not to think about how warm and soft her hand is or about how I\u2019m rubbing my thumb across her fingers as we walk. I\u2019m trying to focus on my steps so I don\u2019t fall flat on my face because I\u2019m too busy thinking about how beautiful she is.</p><p>We walk into the diner and there are a few old-timers at the bar. They turn and give me a nod because I\u2019m a regular. I\u2019m normally in here at 5 a.m., having my coffee, so I expect a few looks when I pull Penelope in behind me. Nobody says anything. They just give her a long, lingering once-over and then go back to what they were doing. I can\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d have a hard time keeping my eyes off her, even if I was seventy years old.</p><p>We sit down, and old Rick comes over with the menus. I look at Penelope and wait on her to go first. She looks back at me, and I see some hesitation on her face, but I don\u2019t know why.</p> <p>\u201cOrder what you want, Duchess.\u201d She bites her bottom lip, and it has my dick rock hard. She looks so fucking cute that I want to come across the counter and bite her lips myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the Hungry Man\u2019s Breakfast. Pancakes with chocolate chips, bacon, hash browns, eggs over easy, and a side of biscuits and gravy.\u201d She looks at me and blushes, then slowly slides the menu back to Rick.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m about to order, she interrupts. \u2018Oh, and can I have coffee? But chocolate milk with my meal, please.\u201d</p><p>Rick writes it all down and then looks at me. I feel the smile on my face as I pass him the menu. \u201cI\u2019ll have the same.\u201d</p><p>When Rick walks away, she won\u2019t meet my eyes, so I reach my hand across the table and wait for her to take it. She takes a second, but slowly she brings her hand from under the table and puts it in mine.</p><p>\u201cPeople are going to talk,\u201d she whispers, and looks out the window.</p><p>\u201cAbout how much you ordered for breakfast? Guaranteed. Where the hell does a little thing like you put all that?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and looks over at me, and we stare at each other in silence. She\u2019s right. This is a small town, and people are gonna talk about seeing us together. I may not have been able to figure out who she is, but these guys in the diner know the Mayor. Whether they like him or not, I\u2019m not sure, but I know for a fact they\u2019ll talk. I smile as I run my finger over her wrist. I hope they tell the whole goddamn town.</p> <p>\u201cYou going to tell me why you messed with my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know why.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and lets go of my hand as Rick sets down our coffee. I pick up the mug and take a sip as I raise an eyebrow, daring her to reply.</p><p>\u201cYou could have just asked for my number.\u201d She pours cream and sugar in her coffee, taking a sip and raising an eyebrow just like I did.</p><p>\u201cWould you have given it to me?\u201d I ask, not reminding her I already have it from the first time she came into the shop.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her answer is quick, and we both know it\u2019s the truth. She\u2019s the type of woman who needs a firm hand. And it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s not getting that elsewhere. My cock hardens further as I think about dominating her little body. Filling her with me.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re going to fuck me on the table.\u201d</p><p>I reach out, taking her hand again, and this time I bring it to my mouth, kissing her palm. \u201cThe thought crossed my mind. But I was afraid a few of the old guys might fall over dead from seeing a beauty like you laid out naked. And besides, I don\u2019t show off what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d The tone of her voice is irritated, but she doesn\u2019t pull her hand away from my lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMine.\u201d I growl the word and slide my teeth over her wrist.

This is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt before, and I can\u2019t explain it. Being in her presence is like being punched in the gut and jerked off at the same time. It\u2019s overwhelming and amazing.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Rick says, breaking the spell. We sit back as he lays down plate after plate of food. The small table is comical, loaded with a ridiculous amount of food. I can\u2019t help but laugh as Penelope smiles, reaching for the syrup and digging in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPussy,\u201d Penelope says as we walk out of the diner.</p><p>I clutch my belly and laugh as I follow behind her, grabbing her hand. I can\u2019t believe she out-ate me. I smile over to her and squeeze her hand a little. She doesn\u2019t pull away from me as we walk back to the garage in silence.</p><p>When we get there, I see her car is already in the shop, and Butch is under the hood. I wrote up a work order and left it on the counter before we left so they would know what to fix. I just needed to get her here this morning, and now I need to make her stay.</p><p>\u201cWhen will my car be ready? I\u2019m supposed to be somewhere.\u201d She pulls her hand from mine and crosses her arms, not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cThat someplace you gotta be have anything to do with you getting married?\u201d</p><p>She snaps her head up and gives me a hard look. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you. I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d She starts to look away, but I move in front of her and hold her jaw so she can\u2019t look anywhere else but into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t feel it, too, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeelings don\u2019t have anything to do with this. We don\u2019t always get what we want, Paine.\u201d</p><p>The way she says my name sounds a lot like regret. \u201cFine. You wanna pretend? So can I.\u201d With that, I grab her arm and pull her inside the shop to my office in the back. Once we get in there, I close the blinds and lock the door.</p><p>Turning around, I see Penelope has her arms crossed again, and she looks mad as hell. \u201cYou can go ahead and unlock that door. I\u2019m not doing anything with you.\u201d</p><p>I approach her slowly, making my moves clear.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but the work on your car isn\u2019t free.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who broke it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash or ass, Duchess. It\u2019s time to pay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Paine. I\u2019m not a whore.\u201d She uncrosses her arms and makes fists at her hips. She\u2019s pissed, and I love it. I get even harder seeing the fight in her. It\u2019s going to make taming her so much sweeter. It\u2019s clear that with her I have to push, and I\u2019m willing to do that for her.</p><p>Standing in front of her, I push my big body against hers. I grab her upper arms and lift her onto the desk, pinning her there. \u201cYou\u2019re not a whore, Duchess. You\u2019re mine. And when I say it\u2019s time to pay up, that means you\u2019re gonna slide off those jeans and show me your cunt.\u201d</p><p>I hear her intake of breath, and there\u2019s a slight tremor to it. She likes my dirty talk. I lean over her more and push her all the way back so she\u2019s lying on my desk, with her legs hanging over the edge. Once she\u2019s down, I sit up and move my hands to the waistband of her jeans. When I grab for the zipper, she reaches out and tries to stop my hand. I push her fingers away and go back to what I was doing, unzipping her jeans and grabbing the top of them. Before I pull them down, I look up into her eyes and watch her reaction as I slowly pull her jeans and panties off her hips, down her thighs, and push them to her knees. I keep my eyes locked on hers, and I run my hands up her warm soft thighs, watching as she bites her lip. She looks nervous, as if she\u2019s close to telling me to stop.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna try to tell me no?\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes when I rub the palm of my hand over her bare pussy and just rest it there. Letting the heat of my hand melt against the heat of her cunt. I don\u2019t move, I just wait for her response, feeling her dampen my palm.</p> <p>\u201cDuchess?\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes, and they are glazed over. She\u2019s turned on by all of this, even if she doesn\u2019t want to admit it. After a second she swallows, licks her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this either, baby.\u201d I lean down and kiss her bare stomach where her flannel shirt has come open. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I had anything to do with a woman, I\u2019m not sure I know how anymore. Besides, any thought of someone else left my mind the day your ass walked into my shop.\u201d</p><p>I feel her laugh nervously as I kiss her tummy and rub my beard across her delicate flesh. Seeing my stained hands against her creamy skin reminds me of how different we are. But that doesn\u2019t matter right now. All that matters now is that I get to taste a little bit of heaven.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, Paine.\u201d I feel her tense against me, and I look up into her eyes. She looks almost scared.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I sit up but leave my hands on her body, hoping to calm her with my touch.</p><p>She bites her lip again and then takes another deep breath. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything before yesterday. Nothing. I\u2019m a virgin.\u201d</p><p>I think my jaw comes unhinged at the same time my cock swells to the point of pain in my jeans. She\u2019s so fucking beautiful. I expected her to have left a trail of men behind her. But to know I\u2019m the first to touch her makes me want to shoot off a cannon and plant a stake beside her that reads \u2018This land is claimed.\u2019 She\u2019s an undiscovered country, and I wanna be the goddamn king of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPaine?\u201d Her voice brings me back to earth, and I shake my head, trying to find reality again. I close my eyes and lay my forehead against her belly. Breathing in the scent of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cJust a taste. For now,\u201d I say against her skin, and I lick around her belly button. I look up at her and move my hand so my fingers gently spread her lips and rub her damp clit. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be the first to get it, Duchess. But not here and not like this.\u201d</p><p>She moans and closes her eyes, and I dip my fingers lower, playing at her entrance. I move down a little and kiss the insides of her thighs. Her sweet smell is making my mouth water, and I can\u2019t wait any longer. Her legs are bound together at her knees by her jeans and panties, so I\u2019m only able to spread them a little as I lick down between her legs. I grip her thighs, taking a handful of each as her nectar hits my tongue. She\u2019s sweeter than anything I\u2019ve ever tasted, and one drop has me addicted.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d is all I can say as my tongue moves all over her virgin pussy.</p><p>\u201cPaine.\u201d She moans out my name like she\u2019s as desperate as my dick is. He\u2019s begging to come out and play, but I know the second my cock hits air, I\u2019m gonna need to fuck her. So for now, I keep it in my pants.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Duchess. Show me what a dirty girl you can be.\u201d I rub my chin on her clit, letting my beard soak up her juice. \u201cThat\u2019s your payment, baby. You can\u2019t get your car back until you cum on my face. Now wipe that pussy on my tongue and earn it.\u201d</p><p>I feel her cunt pulse against my face as I devour her. I can\u2019t get enough of her, and the more I drink her down, the closer she is to getting off. Hearing she\u2019s never had this before has me wanting to give her the best. I want to be the only one she thinks of ever again.</p><p>Sucking her clit hard, I feel her body bow off the desk, and I squeeze her thighs tighter, holding her down. Her orgasm is hard and deep, and she shouts my name as she hits her peak.</p><p>Hearing her voice echo through my office makes me feel like a god. I\u2019ve been places and done things in my life, but nothing compares to the feeling of being the first to eat her pussy.</p><p>And I\u2019ll be her last, if I have anything to say about it.</p><p>Six</p><p>Penelope</p><p>\u201cTry this one, Grandma.\u201d I hand her another sample of cake, taking the two others from her lap. I stopped at the cake shop and brought all the samples back to the family estate. This isn\u2019t the wedding I dreamed of, but I know my grandmother wants to be a part of it, and it\u2019s something I want to give her. I could put on a fake smile and pretend this was what I wanted, because if I don\u2019t I know she\u2019d worry. She\u2019d start asking questions and would probably be on the phone to my father, and he wouldn\u2019t let me back on the property to see her. Probably make up some lie about me leaving the country or something. I don\u2019t like lying to her, but I want us to be able to see each other, and I\u2019ll do whatever I can to make that happen. I know our days are numbered as it is with her health declining.</p><p>\u201cThey all kind of taste the same,\u201d she says, taking another bite of what seems like the twentieth sample of cake this afternoon. Maybe that giant breakfast was a bad idea. I tingle between my thighs just thinking about what Paine and I did afterwards. Nope, it was totally worth it. One of the small pleasures I was going to take for myself.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I say we just pick one.\u201d Moving the plates over to a side table, I lie across the end of my grandma\u2019s bed and unbutton my jeans. If I keep this up, I won\u2019t fit into the wedding dress. Then maybe I won\u2019t have to get married.</p><p>\u201cGo with the vanilla bean then. It has a nice filling.\u201d She sets the plate down on her nightstand, then pulls out a ring box from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to show you this. Do you remember it?\u201d She hands me a small velvet box, and I open it, gasping at the ring inside. It\u2019s a beautiful circular diamond, surrounded by a halo of sapphires. The band is studded with diamonds that wrap all the way around, making it look antique. It\u2019s the most perfect ring I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYour grandpa gave me that.\u201d</p><p>I pull it out of the box and read the inscription.</p><p>Only you. Only us. Forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you wear it.\u201d My eyes drop to her ring finger, which bears the wedding ring she\u2019s worn ever since I can remember. It\u2019s a simple gold band that looks beat up after all the years of wear.</p><p>\u201cI did from time to time to make your grandpa happy when he was alive, but I could never bear to take this one off.\u201d She runs her wrinkled hand over the gold band on her ring finger. \u201cThis was the one he gave me when he didn\u2019t have a penny to his name. The one he asked me to marry him with. This is the one I\u2019ll be buried with. He only gave me that one because he thought I\u2019d want something better.\u201d</p><p>She moves the gold band back and forth on her finger, and can I can tell she\u2019s having memories about him. \u201cI never cared about all this.\u201d She waves her hands around, indicting the house and their wealth. Grandpa played the stock market, and it paid off big. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I don\u2019t have to worry about you, and I know your grandpa felt the same. He wanted to make sure we never went without, but I\u2019d give it all away to have even just one more day with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could remember him better,\u201d I tell her, putting the ring back in the box. Life seemed like it was so different before I was born. So much love filled the house. I don\u2019t know how my father snaked his way in, but it just didn\u2019t fit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grandpa died when I was young, and I can\u2019t remember him at all. My mother died when I was born, and he followed soon after her. I\u2019m not sure how my grandma survived losing her husband and her daughter so close together. Another reason I wouldn\u2019t let her lose me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d light up whenever he looked at you. He loved you so much.\u201d I love when she talks about my grandfather. Her whole face warms, and the love she has for him shows even after all these years of him being gone. I want a love like that one day. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but one day I\u2019ll find that. I\u2019ll just have to suffer through this marriage for a while and enjoy the time I have left with my grandmother. Life seems to be about living day to day at this point.</p><p>I reach over, handing her back the ring box, and she puts it in her bedside table. \u201cYour grandpa got me that ring because he wanted to make me happy. It\u2019s what he always wanted for his family. It\u2019s a beautiful ring that he worked so hard for. And to me, it\u2019s a sign of the purest love and devotion.\u201d She smiles at me, and I can\u2019t help but wish for that kind of love and happiness.</p><p>I know she wants me to be happy. Happiness is all she and my grandfather ever wanted for me. It\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow because this wedding is a lie. I\u2019ll be miserable.</p> <p>\u201cLife is about being true to yourself and finding the love you deserve. It\u2019s too short to do it any other way.\u201d She rests her head back on her pillow, and I can tell she\u2019s tired and probably needs one of her pills. She\u2019s right, though. Maybe I can soak as much up as I can before I walk down the aisle to my fate.</p><p>Getting up from the bed, I go to the bathroom, get her pills, and fill her glass of water. Placing them next to her bed, I lean down and give her a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re marrying someone from here. I missed you so much when you were away at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Grandma. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p> <p>Paine</p><p>I\u2019m losing my fucking mind, I think to myself as I see a clearly freshly fucked Tammy leave Scott\u2019s law office, which sits in the center of town. Not ten minutes later, I see Scott exit his office, throw a bag in the trunk of his car, and turn, spotting me sitting on my motorcycle. I stare at him, and I can tell by the look on his face the whispers have already reached his ears.</p><p>He straightens his suit and starts to head my way. He thinks because we\u2019re in the middle of town and he\u2019s a lawyer, I won\u2019t lay his ass out. He\u2019s wrong. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t. Not over something stupid or petty. But Penelope\u2019s more than that, and she\u2019s definitely worth a night in jail. Though I couldn\u2019t track her that night if I was. I don\u2019t like the idea of not being able to have my eyes on her if I wanted to. I sound like a stalker, but I don\u2019t give a shit. If tracking my girl and showing up at random places keeps her out of another man\u2019s hands, you can label me however you want, and I\u2019ll wear that title proudly.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you run over to Kirksville if you need to get your dick wet, Paine? I\u2019ve never known you to dip into the local girls.\u201d</p><p>My whole body goes rock solid at his words. Did he really just talk about the woman he was going to marry like that? Not only that, but he was just fucking local pussy himself. But that\u2019s nothing new. I never understood the guys who chased women around here. Everyone would just be fucking each other at the end of the day. Not something that sounded appealing to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never let Tammy suck my cock in the back of Smokey\u2019s, no matter how much she begged me to do it. So it seems I\u2019m not the one getting my dick wet.\u201d</p> <p>I know we aren\u2019t talking about Tammy, but I want him to know I\u2019m on to his games. He hasn\u2019t had my girl because she\u2019s still cherry sweet and waiting for me to take it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with these two, but things aren\u2019t adding up. I don\u2019t see a girl like Penelope letting her man run around on her, so maybe she doesn\u2019t know, or maybe she doesn\u2019t care. She doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of woman who just wants to be kept and made into a little trophy. I might have thought that when she first strolled into my office, but the woman I had in my arms while I ate her cunt this afternoon was nothing like that. She was different, no matter how this situation appears to be.</p><p>His eyes harden at my words. Seems Scott thought he was the only one Tammy liked to suck off. No, Tammy just goes for anyone with money. I may not be as flashy with mine as Scott is, but I make a good living, and that\u2019s something someone like Tammy can easily sniff out.</p><p>\u201cStay away from her,\u201d Scott says, the smugness he first had now long gone from his words.</p><p>\u201cWho are we talking about here, Scott?\u201d I bait him, because I\u2019m not totally sure. He didn\u2019t seem too pissed when he was warning me off Penelope, but one comment about Tammy and his tone completely changes.</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m off my bike before he can finish the word. No way can I bear to hear him call her that. Not fucking happening. I have him by his suit jacket, lifting him so he\u2019s eye level with me.</p><p>\u201cPaine. Let him go.\u201d</p><p>I feel Law\u2019s hand come down on my shoulder, and I let go of Scott with enough force to send him falling to the ground. He\u2019s lucky the Sheriff showed up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pressing charges!\u201d Scott shouts, picking himself up off the ground and dusting the dirt off his suit.</p><p>Law lets my shoulder go, shaking his head at me. Shit, I should have had better control. No way Law isn\u2019t going to throw my ass in jail after I just tossed his soon-to-be (or so he thinks) brother-in-law to the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cScott, all I saw was you about to fall and Paine here tried to prevent that. Seems you tripped anyway.\u201d Law\u2019s words shock me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be fucking serious right now,\u201d Scott barks out, but keeps his distance no matter how hostile his tone is. He\u2019s smart enough now to keep a few feet between us. That\u2019s good. At least he understands I\u2019m not fucking around here.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for your shit today.\u201d I have a feeling the Sheriff Isn\u2019t talking about mine and Scott\u2019s shit, but probably the Mayor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to hear about this,\u201d Scott fires back, but Law just shrugs his shoulders like he doesn\u2019t give a shit. I find that hard to believe, with the Mayor being his father and all.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever. I have a date to catch with Penelope.\u201d He turns to walk off, and Law has me by the arm. I didn\u2019t even realize I was lunging for the dipshit. \u201cI\u2019ll haul you in if you make me.\u201d</p><p>I jerk from his hold but stay rooted as I watch Scott jump into his car and speed off. Looking around, I see a good portion of the town staring at us, probably having seen most of what just went down.</p><p>I don\u2019t know much about Law other than Joey might be head over heels for the guy, judging by the song she was singing this morning at work. But how could he let a shit like Scott marry Penelope?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to let that pompous fuck marry your little sister?\u201d The distaste is clear in my voice.</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Paine. This is family business you don\u2019t know anything about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know a man like Scott would ruin a woman like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he says, and starts to walk away. I grab him by the shoulder like he did to me moments ago.</p><p>\u201cYou agree?\u201d I\u2019m being loud, and I don\u2019t give a shit who hears us, but apparently Law does because he leans in closer to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can but trying to keep my hands clean. It\u2019s not your concern. Like you said, she\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe town gossip,\u201d he says, referring to the whispers running around town. \u201cI\u2019ve also never heard my sister even utter your name, so to me she\u2019s not your anything.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue to tell him she moaned my name over and over just today, but I won\u2019t make what I have with her dirty. What we have and what we\u2019ve done is special, and I won\u2019t throw it around like that. It might be dirty between us, but between us is where it fucking stays.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sherriff. Tell me where Dipshit and Penelope are going tonight and I\u2019ll make sure she doesn\u2019t end up with him. I\u2019ll make it my life\u2019s mission to keep her from making a mistake and walking down the aisle with that piece of shit.\u201d I can see the hesitation in his eyes as he looks away and looks back at me. \u201cDon\u2019t let her do this.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath, making a decision, and nods his head.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Paine</p><p>That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done fucking around. I tried being nice and talking sweet, but I\u2019m through with that. I don\u2019t care why she\u2019s marrying that douche. It\u2019s over.</p><p>I\u2019ve got my bike parked in front of Lucinda\u2019s, the fancy Italian place two towns over. It\u2019s funny that Scott is willing to fuck Tammy in the middle of our small town, but he makes the woman he\u2019s supposed to be getting married to have someone drive her almost an hour away. It\u2019s as if Penelope is the dirty secret, and that thought makes me even madder. She\u2019s mine, and she\u2019s something to be proud of.</p> <p>I wait for a long time until I finally see a dark town car pull up and Penelope step out. Scott still isn\u2019t here, but as the driver pulls away, I\u2019m guessing the plan was for him to drive her back home. That thought has me off my bike in a flash and crossing the street to get to her.</p><p>Penelope is in a black dress and black heels. Her blonde hair is pulled into a tight knot at the nape of her neck, and it looks like she\u2019s got on a ton of make-up. She looks like she\u2019s a different person than the sweet sexy girl I had breakfast with this morning. I hate it.</p><p>When I get to the front of the restaurant, she turns and faces me, the shock clear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPaine? What are you doing here? You have to leave. Scott is going to be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d I grab her by the wrist and pull her behind me, walking towards my motorcycle. I turn around and take off my leather jacket, holding it out for her to take. \u201cPut this on and climb on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaine.\u201d There\u2019s a plea in her eyes, and as she looks over her shoulder to the restaurant and then turns back to look at me, indecision runs through her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to go because believe me, I do. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDuchess, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with you and that dipshit, but the wedding isn\u2019t happening. You\u2019re mine, so get your ass on the back of my bike. You\u2019re coming home with me tonight and every night after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d She stomps her foot when she says the last word, and it makes me smile. \u201cI can\u2019t go with you. Things could go really bad for me if I don\u2019t do this.\u201d She takes a small step towards me, and her eyes plead with me again. \u201cI want more than anything to run away, but this isn\u2019t just about me.\u201d</p><p>I reach out, grabbing her chin, and keep my eyes locked with hers. I don\u2019t want her to miss anything I\u2019m about to say because this is crucial. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you trust me, Penelope?\u201d</p><p>I see little tears start to form in her eyes, but they don\u2019t fall.

Now you tell me, do you feel what\u2019s between us?\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes to try and shut out my words, but I squeeze her chin a little and she opens them back up. After just a second, she nods.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Duchess. This isn\u2019t a bit of fun. This isn\u2019t a fling. This is real. Now, you getting on my bike or do I have to tie you to it? Because I brought rope.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and I release her chin, holding out my leather jacket to her once again. She looks at it and then reaches out, taking it and putting it on.</p><p>I turn around, get on my bike, and sit there, waiting for her to come with me. She turns and looks at the restaurant one last time before climbing on behind me, and I crank it up. It\u2019s in that moment Scott pulls up and gets out of his car.</p><p>\u201cTake your hair down, Duchess. I want it blowing in the wind on the back of my bike, and I want that fucker to see it so he knows.\u201d</p><p>After a second I feel her warm hands come around my waist and her front press to my back. I pull out of my parking spot just as Scott turns and spots us. When we pass by, I reach one hand back, running it up Penelope\u2019s thigh, and make sure he\u2019s sees she\u2019s mine.</p><p>Game over, Dipshit.</p><p>I keep my hand there the whole way back to my house, holding on to my girl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me everything after I have you in our bed. We clear?\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I pick her up off my bike and hold her as I walk inside. Her legs go around my waist and her arms around my neck. The feeling of her pressed against me as we rode was wonderful, but I\u2019m looking to press against her in a lot of other ways.</p><p>I take her through the main entrance and walk her down the long hallway to my bedroom. Once there, I stand her up in the middle of the room and take a step back.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go into that bathroom and take off that dress you wore for him, and then I want you to wash your face. You\u2019re too beautiful to hide under all that stuff, and I want to see the real you. After that, you come out here and lie on my bed with your legs open.\u201d I reach out and touch her blonde locks, which are down and windblown. \u201cYou ready to do that for me? Give me that virgin pussy?\u201d</p><p>She looks away as a blush creeps across her cheeks, and goddamn if it doesn\u2019t make me harder. After just a second she nods and then walks past me to the master bath. I watch her go in there and shut the door, and I walk to my closet to undress. I pull off my white V-neck shirt and kick off my boots and jeans. I keep on my boxer briefs for now, wanting her to take them off me. I run my fingers through my dirty-blond hair and then over my dark-blond beard, thinking about what I\u2019m going to do to her.</p><p>I walk out of the closet, my dick hard and ready to fuck. I have to wait for only a second before the bathroom door opens and she walks out, completely naked. Her face is rosy from washing it, but she looks like the girl I met this morning. She looks sweet and innocent, and I can\u2019t wait to get my dirty hands on her pure body.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed, Duchess. Legs open for me. I want to see it all spread out for me. What you\u2019re offering me. Only me. \u201d</p><p>I stalk closer as she climbs on and lies in the middle. After just a moment of hesitation, she spreads her legs wide. I move to the end of the bed and stand there with my arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cKnees up, baby. I wanna see all your pretty pussy. Don\u2019t hide from me.\u201d</p><p>She takes a nervous breath and does what I ask, pulling her knees up and exposing everything. My mouth waters at the sight, and I can\u2019t wait to stick my face all in it.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you look so beautiful like this. Laid back on my bed, legs spread, and ready to be taken.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s too good for a dirty mechanic like me, but here she is, pussy out and open, begging me to fuck it. I can see her horny cunt dripping down to her asshole, and I lick my lips at the invitation it\u2019s giving me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve ever had in my house, Duchess. The only woman who\u2019s ever been in my bed. And after tonight, you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s ever going to be in it again.\u201d</p><p>I see her hands tremble a little at my words, and seeing her a little nervous makes me impossibly harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna eat that sweet pussy before I take your cherry. I want you nice and relaxed when I get inside you.\u201d I reach down and rub my cock through my boxer briefs, trying to relieve the ache. \u201cBut after you cum and I get my cock in you, I wanna fuck you hard. I want you to remember this first time forever.\u201d</p><p>I climb on the bed and dive between her legs, not wasting any more time. I push her thighs far apart and put my whole mouth on her pussy. I open wide, sucking her into my mouth and licking her at the same time. Her hands shoot out, grabbing my hair, and she grips me hard as I eat.</p><p>Her rich virgin cunt is so sweet and juicy. She\u2019s like a warm peach, and I can\u2019t get enough. I move down, sticking my tongue as far inside her unfucked pussy as I can go. I feel her hymen with my tongue, and I lick it, letting it know I\u2019m about to fuck through it.</p><p>Moving down, I pull her ass cheeks apart and lick her there, feeling her tight ring. She moans again at the sensation, and I move over, biting her ass cheek hard, leaving teeth marks. I want to mark her body up with signs of me so that everyone knows who she belongs to. No more bullshit fianc\u00e9, no more wedding talk. That all ends tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I move back up to her pussy, sucking on her lips and clit. I don\u2019t have a lot of patience, so I focus on getting her off instead of dragging it out. When I suck her pussy in my mouth and give her clit a gentle bite, she nearly pulls my hair out as she climaxes, tensing up and shouting my name.</p><p>After I milk her orgasm, and she stutters, trying to push me away, I sit up and move over her body.</p><p>\u201cReach down and take my cock out, Duchess. I want you to be the one to put it in you. I want you to remember that you asked me to claim you.\u201d</p><p>I lean down, taking her mouth in a kiss and letting her taste her pussy. Her juices are covering my beard, and the smell of her is driving me insane. Her warm tongue sweeps into my mouth as her hand goes between us and she pulls out my cock. I feel her grab the base of it and move it to her opening as she bites my bottom lip. When the tip of my cock is at her virgin entrance, I feel the head of it get coated in her sticky juice.</p><p>Pulling back from the kiss, I look down into her eyes and hold her face. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Paine. I want you.\u201d Her eyes are pleading and needy, and I can see that she wants this just as much as I do.</p><p>I run my stained hands over her creamy white skin, down to her tits. I grab one and lean down, taking her nipple in my mouth. I bite down on it hard as I thrust my bare cock into her virgin cunt. It\u2019s tighter than my own hand. Tighter than anything else I\u2019ve ever felt. She\u2019s so hot and wet, and it\u2019s pure heaven. I feel her tense under me, but I keep going. I told her I would fuck her rough, and I intend to. I want her sore and thinking of me every time she sits down. I\u2019ll kiss it better later, but right now, I\u2019m claiming it.</p><p>\u201cYou on the pill?\u201d I grunt out as her nipple pops out of my mouth. I thrust hard again.</p><p>She lets out what sounds like a cross between a moan and a yell, and I grab her hands, holding them over her head. I pin them both down with one hand and with my other, I grab her leg and throw it over my shoulder. I want in there deep.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Duchess. You taking anything to keep me from breeding you?\u201d Her eyes snap up to mine, and I feel the wicked smile spread across my face. \u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. I plan on cumming in you until you\u2019re bred. You\u2019re not keeping me from that, are you?\u201d</p><p>I feel her pussy clench at my words, and I thrust harder. After two more thrusts, she moans and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Duchess. Tell me you aren\u2019t on anything and you want me to cum inside you.\u201d</p><p>Looking up at me, she raises her hips at my thrusts, and moans, \u201cI\u2019m not on anything. Cum inside me, Paine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you want my cum, Duchess. Tell me you want it deep inside you, coating your unprotected womb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it,\u201d she whispers, and raises her hips again.</p><p>I reach between us and rub her clit. With her leg over my shoulder, she\u2019s wide open and taking only what only I can give her. It takes just a few strokes and she\u2019s clenching around me, squeezing my cock and cumming on me.</p><p>I look down to where we are joined and see her cream spreading up and down my shaft as I fuck her. Seeing her go off has me losing it, and I thrust hard one last time, emptying my cum inside her.</p><p>My orgasm goes on for a solid minute as my balls draw up and unload into her waiting womb. After I release every drop, I keep her in place with my dick still inside her, holding her hips up, and making sure my cum stays there.</p><p>I lazily move my cock in and out just a little as we sit there.</p><p>\u201cCome lie down beside me, Paine.\u201d Penelope reaches for me but I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cJust a little longer like this, baby. I wanna make sure my cum stays in you.\u201d I want to make sure she\u2019s bred. Nothing will take her.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Penelope</p> <p>I wake to kisses traveling down my spine, before they move to my butt cheeks. The whiskers of his beard make me giggle and try to wriggle away. I still feel the wetness of his cum inside me and on my thighs, and I get a soft bite on my ass to halt my movements.</p><p>\u201cYou passed out on me,\u201d he mumbles against my skin, then takes another soft bite of the opposite ass cheek, like he is trying to give them equal attention.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault. I passed out from exhaustion, and you didn\u2019t even feed me.\u201d I look over my shoulder at him to give my best pout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duchess. It slipped my mind. I filled up on your sweet cunt.\u201d He kisses the same spots where he bit me, pulling himself from the bed and taking me with him up and over his shoulder, strolling through the house like I weigh nothing. I don\u2019t even struggle with being carried around like I\u2019m a doll. I have a nice view of his ass from this angle, but too bad he slipped on his boxer briefs. I watch his powerful leg muscles move us with ease down the hall, reminding me of how big he really is.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had this closeness with someone before, and I\u2019m going to suck up every second of it. I\u2019m sick of fighting this. The last few hours of my life have been the best I can remember.</p><p>I\u2019m through with everything, and it\u2019s all going to change today. This is something I\u2019ve never done. I\u2019ve always done what my father\u2019s wanted and that\u2019s gotten me nowhere. Everything from the classes I took, to the activities I participated in, he had laid out for me.</p><p>It feels freeing to let go. I thought I would\u2019ve had this freedom when I left college, but instead I came back to have control ripped away from me once again. It seems playing by my father\u2019s rules got me nowhere, and no matter what I did, he would just make up new ones. It was an endless cycle of holding me down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m still a little worried about my grandma. Maybe I can just tell her what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m so worried that it might stress her out, and that\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t need right now. She seems to be so weak lately that she doesn\u2019t need all this laid at her feet. I hate that I didn\u2019t realize how sick she\u2019s really been. I should\u2019ve been coming home more, but every time I called she always said she was fine. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I found out things haven\u2019t really been all that fine after all. And now my father really has some leverage over me\u2014the one thing he can use to control me.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to wonder what he has over Law. Law and I have never been super close, both going off to different boarding schools and him being eight years older than me. His life was busy when he worked up in Chicago, and even when I could make it out to see him, he always had his head buried deep into whatever case he was working on.</p><p>I haven\u2019t gotten much time to talk to him since I\u2019ve gotten back. I was being pulled in so many directions, we didn\u2019t have time to catch up. We\u2019re going to have to sit down and work some stuff out because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let Dad keep me from Grandma, and more than likely I\u2019ll need Law\u2019s help.</p><p>Paine sits me on the counter, making me squirm on the cold granite top. \u201cSorry, Duchess.\u201d He reaches for a shirt hanging off the bar stool at the breakfast bar, sliding it over my head. \u201cI love seeing you naked, but I don\u2019t want you to be cold either.\u201d Leaning in, he takes my mouth in a soft kiss. \u201cYou sore?\u201d His eyes go soft, and I can see the concern in his face. \u201cI took you hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more perfect.\u201d I smile when I say the words because they\u2019re true. I feel so happy with him. Like I\u2019m home. \u201cAnd thanks,\u201d I say, looking down at the worn shirt with an old car on it. I love it more than any piece of clothing I have. It\u2019s completely Paine, complete with what looks like an old grease stain. Even better, it smells like him.</p><p>\u201cYou never have to thank me. Taking care of you is what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d He runs his thumb across my lip before pulling away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you fancy, Duchess?\u201d he asks, pulling open the refrigerator door.</p><p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d I can\u2019t picture him working his way around a kitchen. A car, sure, but making spaghetti? Not so much.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019ve got food I can, but I\u2019ve been too busy to get to the store. Someone has had me chasing them all over town.\u201d He turns to smile at me as he pulls eggs and cheese from the fridge.</p> <p>It\u2019s crazy how easy this feels. Like we\u2019ve been doing it forever. Maybe when it\u2019s right, that\u2019s just how it is. I don\u2019t have experience with men, but my grandma told me when you find the right man, you just know.</p><p>I kept getting worried that she\u2019s going to ask me if Scott was the one, but she hasn\u2019t. Maybe she just thinks he is. Why else would I agree to marry him?</p><p>\u201cHope you like egg-and-cheese sandwiches. We can run to the store and stock up tomorrow on some stuff. I plan on keeping you in our bed for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Butterflies take flight in my stomach at the word \u2018our.\u2019 He\u2019s acting like I\u2019m never leaving. Maybe I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to go home when my dad finds out I\u2019m not marrying Scott.</p><p>It\u2019s all so simple here. I glance around, taking in Paine\u2019s home. It\u2019s warm and cozy. Hardwood floors run throughout, with deep gray-blue walls. The floor plan is open with the kitchen off to the side of the living room, and a big dining room to the other side of the kitchen. A giant fireplace takes up one wall, with silver tiles surrounding it.</p><p>One thing I\u2019ve always disliked about my family home is that it is too big. I love the idea of being able to cook in the kitchen and still be able to talk to someone lying on the couch. I can easily picture a family here.</p> <p>Me in the kitchen cooking dinner, Paine lying on the couch watching a baseball game and talking to me while I cook. The kids at the dining-room table, doing their homework before dinner. It makes me miss something I never knew I wanted. Being here with Paine, it\u2019s all so clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you have that look on your face?\u201d I turn back from my domestic fantasies and study him. If he meant half of what he said when he took me to bed hours ago, then maybe we\u2019re on the same page.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cKids.\u201d</p><p>I run my hands down his tatted-up arms, pulling him closer. He sets a plate down on the counter next to me and wraps his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly three?\u201d he teases, and I\u2019m relieved that the fairy tale I just dreamed up moments ago is so close. I can almost reach out and touch it, or maybe it\u2019s already in my grasp.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s start there. We still have an uphill battle,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to start talking.\u201d He jumps up on the counter with me, handing me one of the sandwiches he just made, and I lay it all out for him while we eat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. He can\u2019t keep you from seeing your grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. Scott\u2019s the family lawyer, and I have no idea who controls what. I\u2019ve never had to worry about it before, and I know my father has some powerful friends, Paine. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, calm down.\u201d He jumps back off the counter, grabbing my face between his hands. \u201cI promise you. I won\u2019t let him keep her from you. I told you, I\u2019ll give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted, and if you want to see your grandma, you\u2019ll see your grandma.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I believe him, and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve only known him for such a short time, but I can tell by the look in his eyes he means it. And it\u2019s quite clear Paine gets what he wants.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He pulls me to his chest and holds me tight, that feeling of being home warming me again.</p><p>A knock at the door pulls us from our embrace.</p> <p>\u201cWho the fuck...\u201d Paine glances over his shoulder to look at the clock on the stove. \u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooty call?\u201d I half-tease. Who else would show up at his house so late?</p><p>Paine gives me a stern look. \u201cI told you I never invited a woman back here. Don\u2019t push your luck or I\u2019ll spank your ass.\u201d</p><p>I wiggle at his words, thinking about him spanking me as he takes me from behind. The image makes everything in my core clench.</p><p>\u201cMy dirty Duchess. You like getting your ass spanked? I\u2019ll have to remember that.\u201d</p> <p>I go to lie and tell him I don\u2019t, but another knock sounds on the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking coming,\u201d he shouts. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d He shoots me a look, and I stay rooted.</p><p>I watch as he makes his way to the door, wearing just his underwear. It better not be a woman out there, because I don\u2019t want someone else seeing his boxer briefs hugging his thighs tightly. It\u2019s then I notice all of his tattoos across his arms and chest are on display. I didn\u2019t realize he had so many. He was wearing long sleeves when I first met him, and only a few of the tattoos peeked out at his wrist. I don\u2019t know what it is about his hard side that draws me to him. I\u2019ve never met someone like him before, and men like him don\u2019t run in the same circles as I have all my life. Maybe that\u2019s why I never knew what attraction was until I met him.</p><p>When the door opens, I hear Paine sounding pissed at whoever it is. \u201cThis is private fucking property.\u201d I can\u2019t see around him, his big body filling the door and blocking the view, but I know who it is when a familiar voice speaks.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere she\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Paine fire backs. I get down off the counter and try to get past him to face my father, not wanting them to go to blows.</p> <p>\u201cI know for a fact she isn\u2019t with her fianc\u00e9,\u201d my father says, but it\u2019s clear Scott told him who I was with. There\u2019s no other way my father could possibly know I was here with Paine.</p><p>\u201cThen you thought wrong because you\u2019re looking at her fucking fianc\u00e9.\u201d There\u2019s no missing the possessive tone in Paine\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cStop it. Both of you.\u201d I finally make it past Paine, ducking under his arm in a quick move, but I don\u2019t get far. He wraps an arm around my waist, pulling me back to his front.</p><p>The cold night air hits my legs, reminding me I\u2019m only wear Paine\u2019s shirt. Lucky for me, he\u2019s a freaking giant and the thing comes almost to my knees.</p><p>My dad looks at me in disgust. Like he has room to talk. Not only is he married to a woman five years older than me, but everyone knows he sleeps around on her. I have a feeling she does, too, with the looks she shoots my brother at Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>\u201cPut some clothes on. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Paine answers for me. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so intimidated by my father, but I am, and I\u2019m glad to have Paine standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother got hurt. We had to call the doctor to come out. She\u2019s asking for you, Penny,\u201d my father says, using the nickname for me I haven\u2019t heard in years.</p> <p>\u201cLet me get my things.\u201d I try to break from Paine\u2019s arms, wanting to get to her as soon as possible, but he\u2019s holding tight.</p><p>\u201cGive us five and we\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Paine says, finally letting me go.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him on the property.\u201d My dad\u2019s tone is final, and I know he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll call the police and have Paine thrown in jail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go, she doesn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell your grandmother you couldn\u2019t be bothered then.\u201d My father turns to leave, and I feel so angry at how he always says \u2018your\u2019 grandmother, like she\u2019s nothing to him. Like she\u2019s not the mother of his late wife. Like she\u2019s not his mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d I yell at him, making him turn to look at me. He has a smirk on his face, which makes the wrinkles around his mouth more prominent. Time hasn\u2019t been good to Dad these past five years. Most of his hair would be gray now if he didn\u2019t dye it. He\u2019s even put on some weight.</p><p>\u201cDuchess,\u201d Paine says, holding on to my arm. His grip makes it clear he isn\u2019t letting me go.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to trust you, Paine. Can you trust me? I have to go. I\u2019ll come back.\u201d I look up into his eyes, wanting him to see what I saw moments ago when we were in the kitchen together, talking about the life we wanted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it,\u201d I hear my father say from behind me, and I can see the tension rolling off Paine.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d Paine pulls me into the house, slamming the door behind us. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I think he\u2019s playing at something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d Breaking away, I head back to his bedroom where I find my purse, and I pull my phone out to call Law. Paine watches my every move like a hawk while I call my brother. He picks up on the second ring and I get straight to the point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey. Is Grandma okay? Dad just told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to see her yet. The doctor is still in there, checking her over,\u201d Law says, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>I hang up the phone, putting it back into my purse. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I just don\u2019t fucking like it.\u201d Paine\u2019s whole body looks like it\u2019s filled with rage.</p><p>I walk over to him and reach up to grab his face. I pull it to mine so we\u2019re only a breath apart. \u201cI want what we talked about,\u201d I tell him, letting him know I\u2019ll come back to him.</p><p>He kisses me hard before reluctantly pulling away. \u201cDon\u2019t clean up. If you\u2019re leaving this house without me, the cum on your thighs and pussy stays put.\u201d I should be appalled, but I\u2019m not. I like that I still smell of him. That when I leave, a part of him is coming with me. I nod, making my retreat into the bathroom.</p><p>I make quick work of putting my dress and shoes back on. I toss Paine\u2019s shirt onto the bed. When I enter the bedroom, I see Paine is also dressed and is just pacing back and forth like a caged animal.</p><p>\u201cPaine.\u201d My voice makes him stop and turn to look at me.</p> <p>I can\u2019t read the look on his face, but I reach out, wanting him to come to me. He walks over, his big hand engulfing mine. I lead him down the hallway and to the front door. I open it and see my father still standing there.</p><p>Turning back to Paine, I squeeze his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I have news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me every hour,\u201d Paine corrects, but he\u2019s not looking at me. He\u2019s in a staring match with my father.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call you every hour.\u201d Which I will if it will cool him down a little and put him at ease.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck your game is, Mayor, but I\u2019ll figure it out. And when I do, I\u2019ll burn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick to things you know, Paine. Like fixing cars. You don\u2019t want to get tangled with me.\u201d My dad looks down his nose at Paine. Something he does to a lot to people, and it makes me want to lash out. Now is not the time to get on his bad side when he\u2019s standing between me and my grandma.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already tangled. You show up on my property, take my girl, and don\u2019t think that\u2019s all there is to it? Maybe you\u2019re the one who\u2019s not too bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d I break into the middle of their pissing match, which I know will just escalate. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I want to get there before the doctor leaves. I want to hear what he has to say.\u201d I start to walk off the porch, but Paine pulls me back to him, kissing me hard and possessively.</p><p>\u201cTake this.\u201d He hands me his phone.</p><p>\u201cI have mine.\u201d I indicate to my purse under my arm.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take this one.\u201d I can tell by his tone that there is no arguing. He grabs my purse, taking my phone out of it, and hands the purse back. \u201cI\u2019m keeping yours. You can reach me on it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but I just go along with it. I take one last look at Paine as I get into my father\u2019s car.</p><p>As the car pulls away, I expect him to lay into me about Paine and Scott, making threats and demanding I get back with Scott, but he doesn\u2019t. He takes a different tactic.</p><p>\u201cPaine will get you nowhere in life, Penny. I just want what\u2019s best for you. I thought if I pushed you into marrying Scott, you\u2019d see he was right for you. He\u2019d be good for you. He\u2019s going places.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d My response is flat and without emotion. It\u2019s right there in his words. Scott is going places, and I\u2019m guessing my dad wants his hand in those places. I have no idea what he\u2019s playing at with this soft, caring approach. This is nothing like how he was days ago when he was telling me what I would and wouldn\u2019t be doing.</p><p>He sighs deeply, making me look over at him. I see him glancing at the cell phone Paine gave me, making me grip it tighter before I put it into my purse.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later. Let\u2019s just get back home and see how your grandmother is doing.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s silent the rest of the twenty minute drive home. I\u2019m out of the car before it even comes to a full stop, rushing into the front door as fast as my heels will let me. I dash up the stairs and head for the east wing, and I\u2019m out of breath when I reach her hallway.</p><p>When I get to the door, I see my brother sitting outside, still in uniform, his eyes coming to mine.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor just left. Grandma\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m relieved and sad. I wanted to see her, but if the doctor left and isn\u2019t having her transferred to the hospital then she must be okay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I turn to see if my father followed me, but he didn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t seemed too concerned about Grandma, but he doesn\u2019t care about any of us unless he has a use for us. It\u2019s clear from his not coming to check on her that she doesn\u2019t have something he needs at the moment. Except maybe for her money.</p><p>\u201cShe had a dizzy spell, had a little fall, and hit her head. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t break anything, and she\u2019s just got a little bruise on her forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God.\u2019</p><p>Law pulls me into his arms, giving me a hug. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Why don\u2019t you go lie down, and you can see her first thing in the morning.\u201d I nod into his chest, but for some reason I feel like he\u2019s trying to get rid of me. It\u2019s not something I want to contemplate right now, so I let it go. This day has been long and filled with more emotions than I can handle. I need to crash, and my bed is calling me. I wish I could be in Paine\u2019s bed, but this one is close to Grandma. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Letting go of Law, I say goodnight and head to the other side of the house. When I get to my room, I fall into my bed, flipping my shoes off and dumping my purse beside me, not caring that I\u2019m still in my dress. I let my eyes fall closed until I hear a phone ringing. Absently, I reach for my purse, pulling Paine\u2019s phone from it and put it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so worried! You missed our sonogram appointment. Why haven\u2019t you texted me back all day? Was the shop that busy?\u201d The woman on the other end of the line explodes with questions as soon as I pick up.</p><p>\u201cYou must have the wrong number,\u201d I tell her, thinking she\u2019s way too wound up for nearly one in the morning.</p><p>She pauses for a second\u2014checking the number she dialed, I\u2019m guessing. \u201cNo, this is my boyfriend Paine\u2019s number. The man whose baby I\u2019m carrying. The baby appointment he missed today,\u201d she screams each word louder than the last, and the urge to vomit makes me drop the phone. I run towards to bathroom, losing everything Paine made me eat earlier.</p> <p>I lie on the cold tile floor and let the tears flow. I can hear the phone ringing over and over in my bedroom.</p><p>How could I have been so freaking stupid? All the things Paine said tonight rush through my head. Suddenly, I\u2019m thinking of all the times I remember girls at my dorm crying about men they had dated who had filled them with lies to get into their pants.</p><p>Peeling myself off the floor, I turn on the shower, wanting the smell of him off me. It\u2019s too much to bear. I scrub my body clean, washing away his scent, but the little love bites he left still show. Seeing them makes a sob escape from deep inside me. Turning off the shower, I grab my robe, making my way back into the bedroom. I see six missed calls all from my number, meaning it\u2019s Paine. I pull up his contacts, but the only number programed is mine.</p><p>Paine calls again, but I just clear it and click into his text messages. I see a bunch from the number that called, claiming to be Paine\u2019s girlfriend. I scroll a few and read them. One is a picture of a sonogram pic. The others talk about missing him, and another is about all the dirty things she\u2019s going to do to him. I drop the phone, not able to look at it any more.</p><p>What if I\u2019m pregnant? Paine didn\u2019t use anything with me. Maybe it\u2019s, like, his weird kink or something. He liked going bareback, and maybe that\u2019s why he has a baby on the way.</p> <p>The phone rings again. It\u2019s Paine calling. I should just shut it off, but my anger gets the better of me. He couldn\u2019t have faked everything with me tonight, and maybe he does feel something for me, but it\u2019s clear he has someone else, too. What can he say? \u201cNo, Duchess, I want to be with you, not her.\u201d Oh, sweet, just ditch your ex for the newest fling. What happens when someone else comes along that catches your attention? Thanks, but no thanks.</p><p>I pick up the phone, wanting to hurt him back. I don\u2019t give him a chance to speak before I start in. \u201cPaine, it\u2019s over. Go back to your pregnant girlfriend and leave me alone. I\u2019m marrying Scott.\u201d I hang up before he can respond. I turn the phone on silent and put it back into my purse. I can\u2019t bear to look at it because it\u2019s something that will just remind me of him.</p><p>Tossing my purse on my nightstand, I knock over the ring box Scott gave me when he asked me to marry him. Well, I guess saying he asked isn\u2019t correct. It was him and my father telling me how this was a great idea and how Scott and I were a great fit. I flip open the box and stare at the giant diamond. It\u2019s nothing like the ring I thought I\u2019d wear one day. The one my grandma gave me flashes through my mind, but I push the image away. If I\u2019m not going to be with Paine, I might as well make things easier around here. I slide Scott\u2019s ring onto my finger with no intention of marrying him, but maybe it will give me some time to figure things out. Get them off my back. I\u2019m guessing Paine isn\u2019t going to want to solve my problems now.</p><p>The tears start to flow again until exhaustion claims me.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Paine</p> <p>\u201cLet me in, Law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you five times already. The answer is no. It\u2019s three in the morning. Anything you need to say to Penelope can wait until morning.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s standing in front of the house, in just jeans and a shirt. I\u2019m sure he could get official and take me to jail, but he must sense the desperation in me enough to give me a pass.</p><p>I know it\u2019s late and her grandmother is sick. I just need to wait until daylight and make this right, but I\u2019m going crazy that for even a second she thinks that I\u2019ve been with someone else. I haven\u2019t touched a woman in years. Not so much as even had a kiss. It\u2019s scientifically impossible for me to be having a baby with someone. I want to be able to talk to Penelope and explain this to her, but she won\u2019t answer the damn phone.</p><p>Sighing, I turn and walk towards my car. I clench my hands into fists, frustrated beyond belief. All I can hear is her broken voice in my head. I\u2019m shocked she would think I could ever do something like that to her, deceive her in that way. A pregnant girlfriend? She\u2019s marrying Scott? I won\u2019t stand for it.</p><p>I walk away from the house and get into my truck. I didn\u2019t want to bring the motorcycle because it\u2019s loud, and I know her grandmother isn\u2019t doing well. I get in and drive away from the house, watching in the rearview as Law goes inside and shuts off the porch light.</p><p>I circle around the block and park along the fence at the back of the property. Silently, I jump the estate walls and creep along the trees through the woods. When I reach the back of the house, I climb up the railing along the porch. I\u2019m able to lift myself onto the second-story balcony, and I hide in the shadows, not knowing whose room I\u2019m outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s not too cool tonight, and lucky for me, the doors are open. I wait for a sound, and when I don\u2019t hear one, I tiptoe inside. I don\u2019t make it five steps before a bedside lamp clicks on. I stop mid-step, caught in the act.</p><p>\u201cYou must be the man my granddaughter is all twisted up about.\u201d</p><p>I turn and face the bed, seeing what looks like a much-older Penelope. She and her grandmother are nearly identical, her grandmother just having a few soft lines. She\u2019s in the bed, but wearing a robe, her long hair braided and falling down one elegant shoulder. She folds her hands across her lap, patiently waiting for me to speak.</p><p>\u201cShe told you about me?\u201d I don\u2019t know why these are the first words out of my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but she and I share a close bond. I know when something is troubling her, and you, my dear, are trouble.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hands up and start to plead my case, but she cocks her head to the side and smiles at me. She reaches out and pats the chair next to her bed, and I walk over, taking a seat.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d My mouth falls open at her candid questions. \u201cListen, when you get to be my age, things become simpler. If you want to know something, you ask. So I\u2019m asking you. What is it that\u2019s got you sneaking in here in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>I feel a half-smile dance across my face. This is my kind of lady.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s something special to me, and some things got twisted up tonight. I\u2019m here because she won\u2019t answer the phone and let me explain myself. She\u2019s upset, and it\u2019s because of a lie. I\u2019m here to tell her the truth. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to reserve the confession of my feelings so that I can give them directly to Penelope. I think it\u2019s only fair that she hears it first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to let her marry that idiot Scott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d My answer is fast and fierce. \u201cShe\u2019s mine, and I swear to you that I\u2019ll protect her and cherish her for the rest of our lives. I don\u2019t know what happened tonight, but I will fix it, and then I\u2019ll never let her leave my side. I may not be able to give her all this,\u201d I wave my hand around to indicate the estate, \u201cbut I\u2019ll treat her better than anyone ever could. There\u2019s not a man alive who will take care of her better than I will.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a soft smile and leans her head back against her pillow. After a second, she closes her eyes and then opens them again. She looks a little teary eyed as she reaches over to her bedside table and opens a drawer. She pulls out a small ring box and passes it to me.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of my late husband, James. We started out with nothing but love, but damn if he didn\u2019t love me enough that I never needed anything else.\u201d She lets go of the box and wraps my hand around it. \u201cShe\u2019s down the hall, fourth door on the right.\u201d</p><p>I clutch the box and then slide it into my pocket. I know what it is, and I know what it means. As close as Penelope is to her grandmother, I\u2019m relieved to have her blessing.</p><p>Standing up beside the bed, I look down at her, seeing how tired she looks. Leaning down, I lay a small kiss on her cheek, and her hand comes up to touch my beard. When I pull back, she\u2019s smiling and then holds her cheek where I kissed her.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot how much I missed my James\u2019s beard. Go get your girl.\u201d</p><p>With that, I turn and leave the room, making my way quietly down the hall. I count off and when I get to the fourth one, I put my ear to it and listen. I hear slight snoring, and smile. That\u2019s my Duchess.</p><p>Opening the door, I see her silhouette on the bed. I can make her out from the moonlight streaming in. I walk over to the bed, stripping down as I go. When I\u2019m completely naked, I strip back the covers and climb in behind Penelope.</p><p>She\u2019s wrapped up in a robe that\u2019s wriggled its way up her hips, and I can see she\u2019s naked underneath. I move on top of her, and she comes awake, her gray eyes growing big. I put my hand over her mouth as she starts to shout, and I hold my finger over my lips.</p><p>\u201cShh, Duchess. You\u2019re going to listen to me. Don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s shouting at me from under my hand, but I lean in, kissing her neck to help calm myself. I can still feel her struggling against me and calling me a few names.</p><p>Leaning up, I look into her eyes, and I can see she\u2019s mad as hell at me. \u201cYou can call me every name you want to, Duchess. I\u2019m not going anywhere until you hear me out.\u201d</p><p>She tries to move her legs and kick at me, but all it does is open them further. The action also pushes my cock against her naked core.</p> <p>I hold her tightly and wait her out, kissing her neck and collarbone. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself all worked up, and you haven\u2019t even asked me if anything is true. You heard something from someone, and you assumed the worst. Why, baby? What have I done to you to make you think all my words aren\u2019t true?\u201d</p><p>Looking into her eyes, I can see she\u2019s starting to hesitate, some of her anger falling away.</p><p>\u201cPenelope, you said I had a pregnant girlfriend, which is impossible. I haven\u2019t been with anyone but my hand in years. An embarrassing number of years, as a matter of fact. So I don\u2019t know who told you what, but it\u2019s all lies.\u201d</p><p>I feel her deflate completely under me, and I slowly take my hand away. I don\u2019t move my body off hers. Instead, I press against hers harder, letting her feel the ridge of my cock against her warm, open pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d lie to you about something like that?\u201d She looks me in the eyes, and after a second, shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Duchess. I wouldn\u2019t ever do anything to hurt you. I\u2019ll always tell you the truth, and I would never keep something like that from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I move my hips, dragging the thick vein on the underside of my cock across her sensitive clit. She moans at the movement, and I grab her wrists, holding her hands above her head. When I go to entwine my fingers with hers, I feel a ring on her finger. One that I sure as fuck didn\u2019t put there.</p><p>Sitting up a little, I grab her hand and hold it up, seeing the diamond on her finger. \u201cI wanna say a few choice words about this, but I\u2019m thinking about how you jumped to conclusions with me, so I\u2019m going to give you three seconds to explain this.\u201d</p><p>She reaches up, taking the ring off her finger and putting it on the table beside the bed. \u201cI was mad. And though I don\u2019t have any intentions of marrying him, I thought it would make life easier if it appeared that way.\u201d</p><p>I reach down between us, grabbing my cock and putting it at her entrance. I thrust hard inside her warm, willing cunt and fuck in and out of her. I grit my teeth and hold her legs open, letting her feel my need.</p><p>We lock eyes, and I reach up to grab her chin. \u201cNobody but me puts a ring on that finger. You got me, Duchess?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head, and I keep thrusting hard, little moans escaping her. Her pussy is dripping wet and takes my fat cock easily. Her hips rise up a little, welcoming my dick deep.</p><p>\u201cYou feel me bare inside you, Duchess?\u201d When she nods again, I hold her wrists down and lean in so her hard nipples rub against my chest. \u201cI\u2019ve never been raw with anyone until you. There\u2019s never going to be anything between us. So don\u2019t let people try to come between us, either. You got me? \u201c</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d she whispers, and I take her mouth. I kiss her roughly, then break away to suck on her tit. She moans when I bite down on one, then lick it better. I can\u2019t wait to breed her and have them dripping with milk.</p><p>Reaching down between us, I hold her hips with both hands, tilting them up a little so I can get a deep angle. I make sure I\u2019m hitting her sweet spot when I bottom out, and I feel her pussy clench around my dick with every thrust.</p><p>When I feel her cervix kiss the tip of my cock, I hold it there and pulse in and out of her slightly. \u201cI want you to cum like this so your body opens up to take my seed, Duchess. I\u2019m gonna keep my dick right here, so when you cum, I can empty into you. Make sure I bred you good.\u201d</p><p>She clenches at my words, and after just a few rocks against her, she cums. She has to pull a pillow over her face to muffle the shouts of ecstasy. Her hot cunt pulsing around my dick has me going off with her. I concentrate on shooting in her sweet spot, knowing I want my baby growing inside her.</p><p>After my balls are completely drained, and she\u2019s come down from her peak, I roll us over so my cock is still inside her, and I hold her to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever leave my side again.\u201d</p><p>Penelope sits up and looks into my eyes, nodding her head. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>I thrust lazily into her as she falls asleep on top of me. I rub her back with the tips of my fingers, finally calm now that we are back together.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Penelope</p><p>Paine holds me to him, his arms wrapped tightly around me as I sob uncontrollably. I have no Idea what I would\u2019ve done without him today. He\u2019s been my rock through everything. Helping me move through the motions.</p><p>When I went to check on my grandma this morning, I found her unresponsive. The rest was a blur of red lights and the doctors telling me there was nothing they could do. She was gone. She had passed easily in her sleep sometime in the night.</p><p>It\u2019s so eerie to be standing in a hospital, being told someone you love is gone. Then being told to go home. You just leave without your loved one. I don\u2019t know why I thought this was so strange, but it hit me hard. I didn\u2019t want to leave the hospital, it felt too soon and all too final. There was still so much more I needed to say as the nurses and doctors moved around me tending to other patients. But they were right. There was no reason to be there. But I didn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>\u201cLet it all out, Duchess.\u201d Paine strokes my hair as he slowly rocks me in his lap. We\u2019re now back at his house, in his bed. I have no idea how long I\u2019ve been in his lap now, but there\u2019s nowhere else I want to be in this moment.</p><p>When the sobbing finally stops and I don\u2019t think I can shed another tear, Paine lays me down in his bed, slipping me under the covers. \u201cBaby, you need to eat.\u201d The mention of food makes my stomach turn over, and I shake my head.</p><p>He drops down beside me. He gently pushes some of my hair out of my face, and I think how I could have ever believed that he\u2019d hurt me. This man who\u2019s been holding me together all day would never hurt a hair on my head. I want to kick myself for doubting him, which makes me cry even harder.</p> <p>\u201cThe last conversation I had with her was filled with lies,\u201d I tell him, confessing my mistakes. \u201cI talked about that stupid wedding. I wish I\u2019d told her about you. Should would have loved that so much. You should\u2019ve heard the way she talked about my grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, Duchess,\u201d he whispers as he places a red velvet box between us. I realize it looks familiar because I\u2019d been holding it the day before. \u201cHow did you...\u201d I reach out to grab it, but he snatches it back, giving me a sweet smirk. I didn\u2019t know a man like Paine could have a sweet smirk, but it\u2019s there on his face now, all soft and warm.</p><p>\u201cShe let me in last night.\u201d He opens the box, pulling out the beautiful ring, a contrast to his rough, hard hands. \u201cShe knew she wanted you to be happy, and I told her I\u2019d spend my life making sure you were. She knew a lot more than you think she did, and I think she saw in me what you do. Then she gave me the ring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sit up, not knowing what to say. He talked to my grandma last night, and she\u2019d given him the ring? He stays on his knees next to the bed, me looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do this differently, give you flowers and say words filled with poetry. Something a woman like you deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman like me?\u201d I question, not knowing what he means.</p><p>\u201cA duchess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour duchess,\u201d I correct, making his eyes grow possessive.</p><p>\u201cI may not have a castle to put you in, but I\u2019ll build you one if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy being your duchess anywhere you put me, Paine. If you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, baby,\u201d he teases, making me smile for the first time all day. This is what my grandma was talking about. She didn\u2019t care about all the things my grandpa gave her. It was just being with him. I realize what she was getting at, and I don\u2019t care about it either. The idea of going back to the giant family estate isn\u2019t appealing. I want to stay right here in Paine\u2019s house for the rest of my life.</p><p>Paine grabs my hand, his rough fingers running along my knuckles before he slides the ring on me. He leans up to kiss me, his mouth taking mine possessively like never before. This one is claiming, like he is trying to leave a mark on me for the world to see. Desire shoots through my body, and I try to pull him closer to me, wanting his body against mine. Just as I have this thought, he breaks the kiss and rubs his cheek against mine, both of us breathing heavily. His beard is rough against my soft skin, and I lean into it, loving the feeling.</p> <p>\u201cNone of that tonight, baby. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d give me whatever I want.\u201d I try to pout, but he turns me over, facing away from him as he comes crawling in behind me, wrapping his arms around me. He pulls my back to his front as he spoons me, and I close my eyes at the feeling of safety. This is something we\u2019ll get to do for the rest of our lives, and I feel another smile pull at my lips.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he whispers in my ear before placing a kiss on my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says, and wraps his arms around me even tighter. I have a feeling a lot of things with Paine are going to go like this. He wants something and he takes it. It should make me mad, but all I do is smile and drift off to sleep.</p><p>Twelve</p> <p>Paine</p><p>Once I know she\u2019s asleep, I slip from the bed, pressing a kiss to her bare shoulder. Fuck, I\u2019m going to love having her in our bed every morning before I go to work. I\u2019ll leave her warm in our bed, knowing she\u2019ll be here when I get home. I may not be able to give her a castle like I told her, but she\u2019ll never go without. The life we\u2019re going to have together, I\u2019ll do anything to have, and no one is going to fuck with my girl. These little games are so beyond over. Done. They keep trying to take her from me, and now I\u2019m going to be the one doing the taking.</p><p>Her grandma left her to me, and I\u2019m going to make sure she\u2019s cared for like she should be. I know the next few days are going to be rough, and I don\u2019t want anything making them any harder than they have to be. I\u2019m going to make sure a few people stay out of our way. They\u2019ve done enough damage. She\u2019s spent the last two nights crying\u2014last night because of some lies someone told her, and tonight because of her grandmother. The first night was all their fault, and that shit wasn\u2019t okay.</p><p>I change my clothes and grab the keys to my bike, rolling it down the driveway so it doesn\u2019t wake Penelope when I start it. She finally passed out, and she needs her rest to make it through all the details of the funeral. When I get far enough away, I flip my phone open, calling Butch.</p><p>\u201cYo,\u201d he says over the heavy beat of dance music. He\u2019s probably at some bar, chasing tail.</p><p>\u201cI need you to watch my house for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way.\u201d The line goes dead, and I know he\u2019ll be here quick with no questions asked.</p><p>I hop on and start the engine, the chopper roaring to life. I head across town, one location in mind, knowing Butch will make sure no one bugs my girl while I\u2019m gone.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take much for me to figure something wasn\u2019t right. It started at the hospital when the doctors were directing all their questions at Penelope and Law while their father stood off silently to the side. I was a little surprised he\u2019d shown up to the hospital at all, but how would it look if the Mayor hadn\u2019t? Everything to him was about looking good in the public eye. He was good at hiding the shit he was covered in.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the Mayor before now because I hadn\u2019t had a reason to. As long as he stayed out of my way I didn\u2019t give two fucks. I\u2019d often wondered how he got elected, but the simple answer was money, and now I\u2019m starting to question if he has any. I know he married into Penelope\u2019s family, but I didn\u2019t know how much control he had over it. I\u2019m really starting to suspect it\u2019s none.</p><p>Things like making Penelope marry Scott, his right-hand man were really starting to make sense now. I didn\u2019t understand why he was so hell-bent on it, going so far as to threaten his own daughter if she didn\u2019t. Yeah, I can see a guy like him not wanting her slumming it with the local mechanic, but pushing her into marrying a certain man was outdated, unless he needed to control her. Seems he\u2019s been doing that with Penelope\u2019s grandma to a certain extent. I had a feeling some things were going to be coming to light every soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I make it to Tammy\u2019s, I pound on the door, not giving a shit how loud I\u2019m being. I know Scott\u2019s inside; his car\u2019s parked in her driveway. I also know it was Tammy who made that call to my girl last night. I don\u2019t give a fuck if she\u2019s a woman. I\u2019ll bury her right along with the Mayor and Scott. I called the number back on the phone, and when she picked up, I recognized her voice. I just hung up, and another thing clicked into place. I wasn\u2019t going to have it out with her on the phone. No, I wanted to do it in person so she and Scott could see how much I wasn\u2019t fucking around. That I\u2019m not playing games.</p><p>When she answers the door, her face is surprised, but it quickly turns to what I think is supposed to be seductive. She pouts her lips and lets her robe fall open, revealing she only has on underwear. I glance past her to see Scott sitting on the sofa, not even looking this way, his eyes on the TV.</p><p>Who the fuck would let their woman answer the door after midnight dressed like that? \u201cClose your fucking robe. You\u2019ve got nothing I want to see.\u201d</p><p>Scott jumps off the sofa after hearing my voice. I can tell he\u2019s about to say something, but I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re fucking playing at, but either of you do another thing to hurt my woman and I\u2019ll fucking kill you. I got a lot of land, and bodies aren\u2019t that hard to hide.\u201d</p><p>Tammy takes a step back, wrapping her robe around her tighter after hearing my warning. Scott still stands there and isn\u2019t getting the fucking message.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I shoot him a look, taking a step into the house, and he retreats, shutting his mouth. It\u2019s the smartest thing he\u2019s done yet.</p><p>\u201cMy lawyer will be in contact with you tomorrow, Scott. Penelope and I want to see all the paperwork on her family\u2019s estate and the will. I don\u2019t trust you, and if he finds even one thing out of place, anything that indicates that you and that fuckhead Mayor were doing something you shouldn\u2019t have been doing, then you\u2019d better hope Law gets his hands on you before I do.\u201d</p><p>With that, I leave. No point arguing with him. I don\u2019t want to hear what he has to say because it doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is getting back to my girl, making her something to eat, and climbing back into bed with her before she wakes.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Paine</p><p>She grinds her pussy down on my face as I grip her ass with both hands. I hold her tight so I don\u2019t grab my cock and stroke myself as she takes her pleasure from my face\u2014something I\u2019m more than willing to give her.</p><p>\u201cYou like your throne, Duchess?\u201d I rub my beard against her pussy, which makes her moan and push back into my face. Fuck, I love how much more open she\u2019s become over the last two weeks. My cock isn\u2019t so sure, because she always has him in a constant state of need. I\u2019ll dump one load inside her only to have her start trying to get another one out of him. And right now he\u2019s begging to release one, but I won\u2019t let him. I want him deep inside her cunt before he gets his. I\u2019ve been filling her with every drop I can, trying to get my baby inside her as soon as possible.</p><p>I look up as she rides my face, her hair falling all around her as she leans forward to grip the headboard. Her big tits bounce with each slide back and forth across my face. It makes cum leak down the head of my cock and drip down to my balls.</p><p>Waste of good seed if you ask me, but I\u2019ll hold back the rest. Gripping her hips, I halt her movements, sucking her clit into my mouth. I\u2019m going to fucking cum all over myself if I don\u2019t get into her soon. She jerks against my face as I suck her orgasm from her body and drink it down my throat.</p><p>When the pulsing in her cunt stops, I flip her over and have her facedown on the bed. Using my knees to spread her legs, I thrust my thick cock home.</p><p>\u201cPaine.\u201d She moans my name, making a spurt of cum spill inside her. Fuck. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cYou like this? When I take over? Do whatever I want to this body now that it belongs to me?\u201d I slide in, harder this time, my cock touching her womb. She grabs the headboard tighter to help her little body brace for my thrusts. She begs me for more and for me to fuck her harder. My dirty girl.</p><p>I drop down further onto her, giving her some of my weight as I use my knees to spread her even wider. I want in her as deep as I can get. My chest fully covers her back, and I grab a handful of her hair, turning her head so I can put my teeth on her neck. I bite and kiss her there, then work my way to her shoulder. I\u2019ve learned her favorite spots and what to say. My little Duchess loves when I talk filthy to her. One night I was playing with her nipples, telling her all the things I was going to do to her, and she came without me so much as touching her pussy.</p><p>I spanked her ass for wasting an orgasm that my mouth or cock didn\u2019t get to taste. Then I tied her to the bed while I cleaned it up with my mouth, and then made her give me two more to lick off her pretty pussy. I didn\u2019t know a pussy could be so fucking pretty, but she proved me wrong.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d I grunt, as I thrust over and over into her tight cunt, making the headboard knock the wall, the smell of our sex filling the room. I\u2019ll have to fix that shit when we have kids. Maybe just nail the thing to the wall because there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll ever stop fucking her pussy like this. It\u2019s begging me for it, gripping onto my dick with each thrust like it\u2019s worried I\u2019ll leave it. It should know by now I won\u2019t leave it until it\u2019s overflowing with me, my cum dripping out of her, spilling onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Paine, cum inside me. I need it.\u201d My fingers tighten in her hair. I can feel her try to lift her ass to meet my thrusts, but I have her pinned beneath me as I press harder and deeper into her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to take every drop of me.\u201d It\u2019s a command, not a question, and it\u2019s enough to set her off. She cries out with a wild moan as she climaxes around my cock, gripping me in a vice-like hold. I keep thrusting, rocking her body against the mattress as her pussy pulls my own orgasm from me. It makes my cock swell even more, and a loud groan sounds from deep in my chest as I ejaculate inside her. Long jets of semen fill her as she continues to milk my cock.</p><p>Dropping to the side so I don\u2019t crush her, I pull her into my arms so we\u2019re both on our sides, my chest to her back. I wrap one leg around hers and spread her open, my cock still inside her. Reaching down, I spread her pussy lips and strum her clit, unable to stop touching her.</p><p>\u201cI need you to cum again, baby. I want this pussy to clench up and pull all my cum deep inside you. You want that baby, don\u2019t you? Your pussy has to suck all my cum deep so it can plant there.\u201d</p><p>Just like always, her body jerks, cumming again, doing as I tell her. A little more cum spills from my cock, and her pussy takes it greedily.</p><p>She lies quietly against me, and I pepper kisses down her neck. Pulling out of her, I move and take her mouth in a soft kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She runs her finger down my cheek and into my beard. She gives me a sexy, satisfied smile that makes my chest warm, knowing I did that shit to my woman. It makes me proud to know I put that look on her face</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never said that before today.\u201d She whispers the words, as if speaking loudly will make them go away.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to know that, before we go to the lawyer today. But I do love you. I have from the first day I laid eyes on you. Knew you were different. Knew I\u2019d make you mine.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes water, and she blinks a few times to keep the tears from escaping. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if my car hadn\u2019t needed fixing. What if I hadn\u2019t found you? I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve made it without you these past weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve found you.\u201d I say the words with all the confidence in the world, not wanting her to think that way. I may not have known it, but being alone all those years, I thought it was because I was busy and had no interest in women. Now I know I was just waiting for her and no one else would do. A part of me knew she was out there, and I just had to wait and I\u2019d find her. \u201cNo way would I have missed you walking around this town. Hell, if you hadn\u2019t come into the shop, I would\u2019ve found you at the bar that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s what was I thinking. I\u2019m kind of surprised you didn\u2019t find me at birth with your ability to track me,\u201d she giggles, and the sound makes my cock grow hard again. Not that it ever went down. Her being naked against me makes that impossible.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d She jumps from the bed, running towards the bathroom. I hear the shower turn on, and I pull myself from the bed, too. We need to get a move on. We have an appointment with the lawyers in an hour, but maybe I can milk one more orgasm from her.</p><p>Looks like I got two from her. She gave me one in my mouth and another on my cock before I pulled her from the shower and we both quickly got ready.</p><p>Now I\u2019m sitting in a room with three lawyers, Scott, Law, and the Mayor, and my head is all but pounding.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you forged my name. I never signed any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Law says, taking Penelope\u2019s hand in his. They\u2019d never been close, but over the past two weeks they\u2019ve been working on being a family again. \u201cBut I had a feeling something weird was going on so I started digging around. Seems like when something didn\u2019t say something you liked, you just changed it, whether it\u2019s legal or not.\u201d Law\u2019s stare bores straight into his father.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. How dare you make those accusations! I\u2019m your father.\u201d</p><p>Law just runs a hand through his hair, not seeming to care. Both Penelope and Law have pretty much wiped their hands clean of him since the funeral. Their father tried to get them both banned and wouldn\u2019t let them come to the will reading, saying their names weren\u2019t listed in it. All bullshit, and they know it.</p><p>Scott stands, like he\u2019s appalled at the accusations. \u201cMy client doesn\u2019t have to entertain this line of questioning.\u201d Maybe he should\u2019ve been an actor instead of a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sit down if I were you, Scott, because the Mayor\u2019s hands aren\u2019t the only ones that are dirty in this. Looks like you\u2019re all over this, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d Both of them storm out of the office, and I move to grab them, but Law stops me.</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t getting away with this. They signed my woman\u2019s name on all kinds of documents. Saying she gave up rights to things she never did, and you\u2019re talking like they got their hands into something else as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo FBI agents are going to grab them before they even make it off the curb.\u201d Law leans back in his chair, and I understand his easy tone. Still, I\u2019d like to have gotten my hands on them before the feds did.</p><p>\u201cNot only did they try to change stuff in Grandma\u2019s will and give us a fake one, seems good old Dad has dabbled in some campaign fraud, too. I\u2019ve been tracking it for a few months now.\u201d</p><p>I hear Penelope sniff beside me, and I pull her into my lap. She comes easily, leaning into me.</p><p>One of the lawyers clears his throat, reminding us he\u2019s still here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike I was saying, here\u2019s the real will. It\u2019s quite simple really. Everything is split evenly between brother and sister. Everything. And she left a note. The rest is just legal work I\u2019ll take care of, and we\u2019ll have everything switched over to your names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA note?\u201d Penelope says, cutting the lawyer off. He walks across the room, handing her the note.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it. I\u2019ll be in contact.\u201d With that, the two of them leave the three of us alone.</p><p>Law sits down beside us as Penelope opens the letter, and we all read it.</p><p>I was broken when I lost your grandfather and mother so close together. I let grief overtake me, and before I knew it, I\u2019d lost almost all my family. Your father shipped you both off to school, and you seemed so happy. I thought it would be selfish to make you come home, but maybe, just maybe, with my passing we can finally pull this family back together again. Love and being together. Nothing is more important than that.</p><p>Love you always, Grandma.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d Penelope looks over at her brother, and we all know she means leaving town and going back to Chicago. If he is, I think she\u2019ll want to follow, and I\u2019m more than willing to do that for her. I just want to be wherever she is.</p><p>\u201cNo, Penelope, I\u2019m never leaving again. We\u2019re both staying.\u201d He glances over at me, a knowing look on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s right. We need to pull this family back together. It starts with you and me, and I think we\u2019re both about to start our own little families.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and nods. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Paine</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, Duchess, that\u2019s it. All the way to the back of your throat, baby.\u201d I feel her suck my cock down, and I bury my face back in her cunt. Her sticky sweetness coats my mouth and beard, driving my need higher and higher. Somehow we ended up on our bedroom floor. Why? I have no idea. We have a perfectly good king-size bed right beside us, but sometimes need gets in the way.</p><p>I\u2019m taking her sixty-nine, and it\u2019s killing me. She\u2019s on top, and I\u2019m having a hard time controlling anything like this. I\u2019m at the mercy of her mouth, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it. Normally, if I can watch her go down on me, I can grab her hair and help control it. In this position, I\u2019m utterly taken and completely off balance.</p><p>I try to focus on eating her pussy and sucking on her clit. I lick back, sticking my tongue deep inside her, and press a finger against her asshole. She cums so hard when I have just a little pressure there, so I rub her tight ring, making her moan louder around my dick. She tenses and grinds on my tongue, taking what she wants.</p><p>Feeling her mouth pop off my cock, she licks down to my balls, giving them attention. She sucks them into her mouth one at a time, licking them and nuzzling there with her face. I feel her gently rub her nose and cheek against me, and the intimate feeling nearly has me cumming on her face. It\u2019s too intense and too perfect all at the same time.</p><p>Having her pussy on my mouth and her tongue on my dick is heavenly, but I can\u2019t go off like this. I love cumming inside her too much to waste it.</p><p>I break my mouth away from her pussy, pushing her hips down my chest. \u2018You gotta stop or I\u2019m gonna bust too soon. Ride me, Duchess.\u201d She lets out a little whine, like I took away her favorite toy, and in a way, I guess I did.</p><p>\u201cGet on it, baby. I\u2019ll give you what you want. I swear.\u201d She sits up, and I help her squat down over my cock, getting in reverse cowgirl position. I\u2019m so turned on, my cock is already standing straight up, so it\u2019s easy to hold it in place as she slowly lowers herself down. When my thick cock is fully inside her, I thrust up, and she lets out a loud moan.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d give it back to you, Duchess.\u201d Grabbing her hips, I help her bounce up and down on top of me. Her ass shakes with each thrust, and it makes my cock leak inside her tight pussy with every stroke.</p><p>\u201cLean forward a little, baby. Let me watch.\u201d She does as I ask, leaning forward and bracing her hands on my knees.</p><p>I look at where we\u2019re connected, watching my thick cock fuck in and out of her tight channel. Her pussy is so fresh and tight, I can see it holding on to my dick when I pull out. Her cunt gripping me and begging me to stay.</p><p>Every stroke in and out leaves a coating of her cream my dick. She\u2019s so fucking horny for it, her pussy is dripping to the base of my cock and making a little puddle. Each time she drops down on my cock, a smacking sound echoes through the room.</p><p>After a few more bounces, I feel her hand rub my balls. I groan at the sensation, loving her gentle touch there. They tighten at her contact, so ready for release.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rub them until you go off inside me, Paine. I just want to feel you pulse in me as you do it. I want your cum to warm me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I close my eyes tightly, trying to hang on until she\u2019s cumming too. \u201cRub your pussy, Duchess. I\u2019m close, and I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>She rubs my balls, trying to milk them for me as her other hand goes to her pussy. I can feel it there because I can feel her fingers slip around my wet shaft. She rubs around the base of my cock where we are connected, scooping up our combined cream. She rubs it around and then slides it up to her clit, rubbing it there to get herself off. She glides up and down my cock while rubbing our cream on her cunt, and I can\u2019t take it anymore. Seeing my dick disappear and reappear as I fuck her and feeling her tight pulses have me nearly cross-eyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPaine.\u201d She moans my name as my cum pumps up into her. Her pussy clenches as her orgasm hits. I can feel each time my dick contracts, sending a squirt of cum into her.</p><p>She rides it out, slowly moving up and down, taking all of me as she shouts out her orgasm. Squeezing me harder and harder, she tenses up at her peak.</p><p>I hold her hips and try to breathe, letting her ride it out. After a few seconds, she falls back on top of me, a sweaty heap lying across my body. I wrap my arms around her, holding her to me, kissing her neck as we both try to catch our breath. It was intense and hot as fuck, and I don\u2019t know how long I lie there, holding her, trying to recover.</p><p>After a few moments, I kiss her shoulder and tell her it\u2019s time. \u201cIt\u2019s probably ready by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there with you the whole time.\u201d I smile against her skin and squeeze her tighter, letting her know I\u2019m never going anywhere.</p><p>She takes a deep breath and nods, and I get us both up off the floor. I take her by the hand and lead her to the master bathroom.</p><p>Penelope is a few steps behind me as I pull her to the sink with me. \u201cYou realize the test said we only had to wait sixty seconds, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I feel the cocky grin come appear on my face, and I turn to look at her. \u201cYes, and I told you sixty-nine sounded like a better idea, and that\u2019s how we ended up on the floor. You didn\u2019t put up much of a protest, if I recall.\u201d She blushes a little, and I move in to kiss her.</p><p>These past weeks have been absolute heaven. I didn\u2019t know love like this could be real, and each day I\u2019m happier and happier. It\u2019s only been about six weeks total since I first laid eyes on her, but I felt then what I feel now. I feel like I\u2019m home.</p><p>When we left the lawyers that day, we went straight to the estate and got her things. There was plenty of time to go through the house and figure out what she wanted to do with it, but in that moment, we both wanted one thing, and that was to have her living with me.</p><p>I wanted her in our bed forever, and whatever it took to do that, that\u2019s what we did. I asked her a couple of times what kind of wedding she wanted, and she finally decided she wanted to do something small in our home.</p><p>We got married in the backyard under the old oak tree. She wore her grandmother\u2019s wedding dress, which was classic and simple. And she had her brother walk her down our makeshift aisle. Butch was my best man, and surprisingly, Penelope asked Joey to be her maid of honor. Over the past weeks, they\u2019ve grown really close, and I think it has something to do with Joey being important to Law.</p><p>Neither of us cared about a big wedding or anything fancy. So we kept it simple. We just wanted something for us, and to make it legal. And I wanted to make sure the rings were exchanged.</p><p>She wears the ring her grandma gave me, and I wear a simple gold band. People tell me it\u2019s dangerous to wear one while working on cars, but I think it\u2019d be more dangerous not to wear one. I don\u2019t want anyone thinking I\u2019m not taken by the most beautiful woman in the world. I wear it with pride, and if you ask me about my wife, you better get comfortable. I\u2019ve got a long list of what I love about her. I couldn\u2019t be happier.</p><p>Standing in the bathroom, I break our kiss to reach over and grab the pregnancy test. I don\u2019t look at it, just hold it out for her to take. Her nervous fingers take it from me, and she holds it, hesitating.</p><p>I pull her naked body close to mine, wrapping her up and kissing her forehead. \u201cTurn it over, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>She turns over the pregnancy test, and we look down, seeing the blue plus sign. I feel my heart nearly burst with love, knowing that we made a baby together. I knew at some point it would happen, but seeing the test makes it so much more real. I feel myself smile from ear to ear, and I look down to see Penelope shed a few tears. I kiss them away, scooping her up and carrying her to our bed.</p><p>Laying her down, I crawl in beside her, resting my hand on her belly. I feel a tear slip free from my eye, and she leans in to kiss it away, just as I did to her. I\u2019m overflowing with happiness, and it\u2019s coming out in the form of tears.</p><p>\u201cThank you for making me so happy, Penelope.\u201d I hold her to me and think about how perfect everything is. I would fight to the death to keep this love, and I\u2019ll never let anything come between me and my family. \u201cI love you and our baby so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you, too, Paine.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hand over mine, and we lie there talking about baby names and what kind of nursery we want. I don\u2019t care what she chooses, as long as she\u2019s happy. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m the lucky son of a bitch she chose to take along for the ride.</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>PENELOPE</p><p>5 years later</p><p>\u201cYou better quit that or we\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time, and it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d Paine mumbles against my neck, sending chills down my spine.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I spent three hours cooking sides for this BBQ, and if we\u2019re late and we miss Law pulling the pork off the smoker, you\u2019re gonna have one pissed-off pregnant lady on your hands.\u201d</p><p>Feeling Paine kneel down behind me, I start to wiggle. I know what he\u2019s up to. It\u2019s been five years and three\u2014almost four\u2014kids later. I know his moves.</p><p>He lifts up my summer dress and nibbles across my ass. I grip the counter top, some of my anger melting away. \u201cPaine,\u201d I warn, but he ignores me.</p><p>His tongue come out and moves from my ass cheeks to the area between my legs, and all my resistance disappears. Bending over as far as I can with an eight-month pregnant belly, I spread my legs, giving him all of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stopped wearing underwear years ago, getting tired of having them in the way. He always wants me, any time of the day, and I just gave up trying to block him. Instead, I\u2019m almost always in dresses, with no panties, and it\u2019s made for a very happy marriage.</p><p>It\u2019s not always easy with three kids running around, but when love is important, you make the time. Thankfully, the kids had a slumber party at their cousin\u2019s house last night, so we\u2019re all alone. Law and Joey took them for the night, knowing how much their kids love having them over.</p><p>Paine licks the inside of my thigh, teasing me before going back to my core. I moan loudly and push back, wanting more. \u201cStop playing, Paine. Don\u2019t tease me. I\u2019ve got too many hormones right now.\u201d</p><p>I feel him laugh against me, then his mouth goes to my clit. He eats me out from behind, and I give myself over to him. After just a few knowing strokes of his clever tongue, I\u2019m cumming against his face, the release fast and hot. He knew what I needed, even if I didn\u2019t know to ask for it. That\u2019s what years of being together has done to us.</p><p>I rest my forehead against my arm on the counter as I feel Paine kiss my legs, loving every inch of me. He runs his hands up my hips, petting me as he flips my dress back down.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I needed that,\u201d I say as Paine stands up and rubs my back. He always knows exactly how to handle me in the sweetest way. I stay in that position, leaned over with him rubbing me, and I feel all the anxiety of today melt away.</p><p>I\u2019m lucky I found such an amazing man who loves me unconditionally. He loves me when I\u2019m moody and when I\u2019m being a brat. And best of all, he knows just what to say to pull me out of it. I smile, thinking that he\u2019s pretty damn lucky he\u2019s got me, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got everything taken care of, Duchess. You go sit your pretty ass in the truck and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder and smile at him. I stand up, turning around to give him a kiss. I taste myself on him, and it has me excited, wanting more. Reaching down, I rub his hard cock, but he takes my hand and entwines our fingers together.</p><p>\u201cThat was just for you. We\u2019ll have fun tonight after the kids are in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I say, and turn to walk out of the kitchen. He smacks my ass on my way out, and I turn around, laughing and rubbing the spot he smacked. I grab my bag, going out to the truck and doing what he says.</p><p>Our lives are loud, and messy, and a little crazy at times. But they\u2019re overflowing with love, and that\u2019s all that matters. When he climbs into the truck and smiles at me, I know I\u2019ve won the husband lottery.</p><p>BONUS STORY!</p><p>Joey &amp; Law</p><p>Joey</p><p>Click, click, click, click.</p><p>\u201cStop that or you\u2019re going to flood the engine.\u201d I stare over at the Sheriff through his windshield as he tries to start his cruiser. I swear, everywhere I go in this town, there he is. Today it was the diner. I ate lunch there before I needed to get back to the shop, and there he popped up. Like always, he just stared at me, and it confused the ever-loving shit out of me. He\u2019s never spoken to me before, even with all the staring, but then again, I give him a wide berth when I see him. He makes me feel things, things I\u2019ve never felt before, and it would just be better for everyone if those feelings stayed buried.</p><p>\u201cJust can\u2019t seem to get the damn thing to start.\u201d His deep voice rolls over my skin, making goose bumps break out, even though it\u2019s a good ninety degrees right now.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Pop the hood.\u201d I stumble over my words, and he shoots me a smirk. Prick. Probably used to women falling all over him. Not that I can blame them. I\u2019d probably fall all over him, too, if I thought I was his type. Which I\u2019m definitely not.</p><p>He\u2019s clean-cut in a hard, pretty-boy kind of way. Blond hair, blue eyes, and a thousand-watt smile that comes out easy. He couldn\u2019t be more of a good ol\u2019 boy if he tried. Unfolding himself from his cruiser, he reaches down and pops the hood. I don\u2019t wait for an invitation as I step off the sidewalk and lift the hood.</p><p>It\u2019s an easy fix if it\u2019s what I think it is. Retrieving my wrench out of my back pocket, I grab the battery cable, giving it a wiggle. It\u2019s loose, just like I thought, so I screw it back on to the battery terminal tightly.</p><p>\u201cGive that a try.\u201d I straighten and turn around, knocking straight into a wall of chest. The badge clipped to his chest shines bright in my face. \u201cWhoa there, Sheriff. I don\u2019t need you up my ass.\u201d</p><p>I snap the words, trying to take a step back as his masculine smell invades my senses. God, he smells good. I didn\u2019t know a man could smell that good. Probably because he doesn\u2019t work in an auto shop full of sweaty men all day. Jesus, his smell has me feeling those goose bumps again.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t bite, Josephine.\u201d</p><p>The use of my name has me glaring at him. No one calls me \u2018Josephine.\u2019 Only my mother ever did, and that name died when she did. It\u2019s too intimate for him to be using that name, and I hate how I felt when he said it. It made me feel all feminine and shit. Nope. Not touching that.</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Joey,\u201d I correct him, trying to put a firmness behind my tone. I want him to know I\u2019m not fucking around. But he just shoots me that stupid perfect smile, making my heart flutter. I should take a step back, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m intimidated by him. That, and I\u2019m still rather enjoying the smell of him. I grew up with three older brothers who are all in the Air Force now. Surely I can handle one sexy, muscle-bound sheriff. I think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like \u2018Josephine\u2019 better. Fits you.\u201d His hand goes to my shoulder, picking up the end of my ponytail as he twirls the black strands around his finger.</p><p>What.</p><p>The.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever twirled my hair, and the fact that I like him touching me bothers me. I bat his hand away, pretending to be annoyed. \u201cHow do you even know that name? Everyone calls me \u2018Joey.\u2019\u201d I give my best stink-eye, which seems to have no effect on him, either. Normally, men scurry off when I give it, but I don\u2019t think Sheriff Law has scurried from anything in his entire life.</p><p>\u201cI know a lot of things about you.\u201d His tone makes it sound like we\u2019ve been intimate, like he knows every part of my body. It\u2019s completely untrue, unless he can see through my clothes with all that staring he\u2019s been doing.</p><p>\u201cYou stalking me?\u201d I push my shoulders back, trying to make myself bigger, but my stature is dwarfed by his broad frame. I take a step into him, thinking he\u2019ll retreat at my aggression, but he doesn\u2019t. In fact he leans in a little more, making me feel the heat of his body.</p><p>\u201cIf stalking you is thinking about you every night while I stroke my cock and cumming with the sweet name \u2018Josephine\u2019 on my lips, then yeah, I\u2019ve been stalking. I\u2019ve been stalking the fuck out of you since I moved back here.\u201d</p><p>All the blood rushes to my face, and I can feel it turning bright red. I\u2019ve been around men my whole life who say the nastiest shit, and never once have I blushed. I\u2019m used to it, and sometimes I even add a few jokes of my own. Being around my older brothers and working in an auto shop, there probably isn\u2019t a thing I haven\u2019t heard. What I\u2019ve never heard is that filthy talk directed at me.</p><p>No, not me. Joey the tomboy who fits in better with the boys. Joey the chick who doesn\u2019t know shit about being a chick.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that.\u201d The words leave my mouth breathily. I should shove my knee right in his balls, but I find myself wanting to touch him there, just not with my knee.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing compared to the things I\u2019ve thought about doing to you, my sweet Josephine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sweet,\u201d I bite out. \u201cOr yours, for the matter.\u201d</p><p>He leans down, like he\u2019s inhaling my scent. \u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re sweet all right. You smell like sticky cotton candy on a warm summer day. Probably taste like it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s grease you smell, jackass.\u201d I want the words to come out mean, but they sound more like a tease. What is he doing to me?</p><p>\u201cGo out with me,\u201d he says, ignoring my statement. I\u2019m just not buying it. Why now? We\u2019ve both been in this town together for over a year, and this is the first time we\u2019ve ever so much as talked. \u201cWhy are you asking me out now? Run out of local pussy and now you\u2019re digging the bottom of the barrel? Thanks, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>I turn to leave, making the retreat that I didn\u2019t want to make. I wanted him to back down, to get out of my space, but that clearly wasn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m in way over my head, and a little pissed, too. It burns that I\u2019ve wanted him since he showed up in this town, but never once has he made a move. Now out of nowhere he\u2019s all up my ass wanting to go out. Something stinks, and I don\u2019t want any part of it, no matter what my body is begging to do. It\u2019s not like I want him to actually do all those things he said he wanted to do to me. Nope, I lie to myself.</p><p>He grabs me by the waist, pulling me back to him, and my body embarrassingly melts into his. I can\u2019t help loving the feeling of having him pressed up against me. My body is enjoying the physical contact so much, it almost makes me want to cry. The loneliness I\u2019ve felt comes rushing forward, crashing against my chest, and reminding me how long it\u2019s been since someone held me.</p><p>\u201cThe only pussy I\u2019ve thought about is yours.\u201d He flips the word \u2018pussy\u2019 off his tongue like he\u2019s pissed he has to use the word. Which is crazy because not minutes ago he said cruder stuff to me. \u201cIn fact, I thought about it so fucking much I can\u2019t seem to get my goddamn job done. I\u2019m finished waiting, so I might as well take it now. Maybe after I get you under me, I can have some sanity and actually finish doing what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word has absolutely no power behind it. Something\u2019s wrong with me. I\u2019m broken. I\u2019m letting him manhandle me, and I\u2019m not even fighting it. Fuck. I don\u2019t want to fight it. Why should I? I\u2019m a twenty-two-year-old virgin whose body is screaming for some physical attention. Maybe it\u2019s time to pull off the virgin Band-Aid. Maybe he\u2019s looking for a good time, a roll in the sack, and needs to get me out of his system. Why I\u2019m in his system to begin with, I have no idea, but maybe this could work. I see how other women in the town look at him. They flirt with him all the time, but I\u2019ve always just seen him be professional. Until now. I like the idea that maybe I\u2019ve made him crack, even if it isn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cuff you and take you to the station until you agree.\u201d He leans in to whisper into my ear. \u201cOr just wait for everyone to leave the station and eat your pussy until you agree.\u201d He takes my earlobe into his mouth, sucking it, then giving it a little bite. A moan escapes my lips, loving the sensation.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Don\u2019t make that sound when we\u2019re in public.\u201d He lets go of me, and then I remember we\u2019re standing in the middle of town, beside the diner. I look around, but no one seems to be looking our way or paying attention. Not much is going on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d He echoes the word, raising his eyebrows like he doesn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll go out with you.\u201d His body loses some of the tension I didn\u2019t notice was there before.</p><p>\u201cGive me your number.\u201d He pulls out his phone, and on the screen I see a picture of me standing in the auto shop. It looks like I\u2019m laughing in it. I grab the phone from his hand, wondering how he got the photo.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d I look at the picture, but he snatches the phone away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a better one tonight.\u201d He ignores me, like it\u2019s not weird that I\u2019m his screensaver. I pretend like I\u2019m appalled, but really, I want to jump up and down like a dork in high school who just found out the quarterback has the hots for me.</p><p>\u201cNumber?\u201d</p><p>I just stare at him. \u201cYou think I really believe you don\u2019t already have my number?\u201d No way he doesn\u2019t. Not after the picture thing and him knowing my real name.</p><p>He smiles, slipping his phone back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d He takes a step toward me, putting his finger under my chin, making me look up into his eyes. \u201cAnd Josephine,\u201d he says, looking into my eyes. \u201cNo more flirting with Butch. I don\u2019t want to have to kill him.\u201d</p> <p>With that, he turns, pushing the hood of his car down before getting in. It starts right up, the engine turning over as he pulls out and leaves me gaping. I don\u2019t flirt with Butch.</p><p>Butch is one of my brother\u2019s best friends. He\u2019s the reason I even came to this town. He got me my job working at the auto shop. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here. Growing up with all boys, I could pretty much do anything they could, except pee standing up.</p><p>Fuck, do I love the thought of him getting jealous over Butch. He\u2019s just like another brother to me, and besides, I\u2019m not even Butch\u2019s type. He likes them blonde, tall, with giant boobs, and as easy as they come.</p><p>My phone beeps, and I see I have a text from an unknown number. Sliding my finger across the screen, I read the message.</p><p>Stop missing me. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of hours.</p><p>I roll my eyes, but then I find myself smiling as I walk back to the garage. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p> <p>Law</p><p>I pump faster, speeding up my rhythm. My cock is aching for release, so this won\u2019t take long.</p><p>Picturing Josephine standing in front of me, bent over, spreading her ass cheeks apart, I jerk off faster. I imagine her looking over her shoulder, giving me that sassy smirk, begging me to fill her up. I think about her smart mouth telling me how bad she wants me, and I start to cum.</p><p>Standing over the toilet, I watch as my cum drips down into the water. I hate to waste it, but no way can I sit through dinner and being so close to her without some kind of release. I won\u2019t be able to control myself, so hopefully, this will take the edge off.</p><p>Jesus, it\u2019s like I\u2019m fifteen. I can\u2019t last for more than sixty seconds when I\u2019m thinking about my Josephine. I can\u2019t wait until she\u2019s under me, and I can get actual relief. Anytime I get hard, I can slide it into her body and empty my seed. After tonight\u2019s hurdle, I\u2019ll have her bred before the end of the week.</p><p>I smile to myself as I clean up and head out, not wanting to be late. I\u2019ve driven to her townhouse a thousand times. I know she lives with Butch, but from what I can tell they are just friends. I still don\u2019t like it, but for the moment there\u2019s not much I can do. I\u2019ll take care of that soon, but first I\u2019ve got to get her in my bed. Then I\u2019ll fix everything.</p><p>I pull up and take a breath, thinking that this probably isn\u2019t the best timing with the case still going on. But I\u2019ve waited almost a year to claim Josephine, and I can\u2019t wait anymore. I\u2019ve watched her like a hawk from the second I first saw her, unable to let her get too far from me. I\u2019m not proud of some of the things I\u2019ve done, but when it comes to \u2018the one,\u2019 the rules don\u2019t apply. At least that\u2019s what I keep telling myself.</p><p>Getting out of my cruiser, I walk by her car and think about the night I put the tracer on it. It\u2019s hidden under the wheel rim and completely undetectable. Even if she took her car apart, she wouldn\u2019t find it unless she was looking for it. Walking to the porch, I ring the doorbell, looking up to see the pinhead camera I installed around the same time. No one would know it was there unless you pointed it out. And even then it\u2019s hard to tell. I wanted to know who was coming and going from her house at all times. Making sure she got home safe every night, too.</p> <p>Oh yes, I\u2019ve done a lot of things to keep eyes on my Josephine. Almost a year later and I\u2019ve had enough playing around. I don\u2019t care if this fucks up my case, I\u2019m a man, and I\u2019m only so strong.</p><p>The door opens, and Butch is standing there with his shirt off. I clench my hands into fists, ready to rip his head off.</p><p>\u201cEvening, Sheriff. What can we do for you?\u201d He looks genuinely surprised to see me, and I shouldn\u2019t be shocked Josephine didn\u2019t tell him I was coming over.</p><p>Butch stands there waiting on a response, but my jaw is clenched too tight to speak. I\u2019m seconds away from tackling him to the ground when Josephine walks around the corner.</p><p>I nearly stop breathing as she walks towards us, my heart beating out of my chest.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Joey. Who died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat a bag of dicks, Butch.\u201d She walks past him, pulling the door closed behind her, and stands on the porch. She looks at me expectantly, but I still can\u2019t speak. I blink a few times and try to focus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, my earlier plan was a waste,\u201d I mumble, thinking that jerking off twenty minutes ago was completely worthless. My dick is at full attention and trying to bust out of my slacks.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, you look utterly gorgeous, Josephine.\u201d Her cheeks blush at my compliment as my eyes roam over her body. She\u2019s wearing a fifties-style pinup outfit with a high-waisted pencil skirt that\u2019s tight to her body. A white, button-up, short-sleeve blouse and shiny red peep-toe heels finish off her look. Her ink-black hair is pinned to one side, and her lips are lacquered in the same shade as her shoes. She looks like she should be laid across the front of a plane, motivating soldiers in World War II. Her dark eyes look up at me through her thick lashes, and I\u2019m literally breathless at how beautiful she is.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d she whispers, and I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about.</p> <p>Leaning in, I find my words, pulling her against my hard body, \u201cI think I should be asking you that question, love. Because with the way you\u2019re dressed and the way you\u2019re looking at me, you\u2019re going to have to try to keep me off you.\u201d</p><p>I expect her to pull away, upset by my crude words, but instead, she leans in closer. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to keep you off me?\u201d</p><p>She licks those shiny red lips, and I\u2019ve had all I can stand. Reaching down, I snatch her wrist and pull her behind me to my cruiser. I\u2019m nearly dragging her, but my need is too strong, and I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>Taking her to the passenger side, I open the door and silently help her into the car. When I go around to the driver\u2019s side, I get in and crank up the car, driving away from her townhouse.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she whispers, and I can hear the slight need in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cMy place. I\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>I hear her laugh, and I look over to see her lean back in the passenger seat. Her legs are together, but the slit on the skirt goes all the way up her thigh, making me grip the wheel harder.</p><p>\u201cThis is our first date, and you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve waited long enough?\u201d</p><p>I look back to the road and hit the gas. I can\u2019t get home soon enough. \u201cYou know damn well this has been coming.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I feel her warm hand on my thigh, and I reach down and put my hand on top of hers. I look over and see her lick her full red lips. She\u2019s got the prettiest mouth I\u2019ve ever seen, with lips like something out of a magazine. I can\u2019t wait to ruin her lipstick. I can see the shyness in her eyes, and I know reaching out to me was a bold move for her. She\u2019s usually so tough, but tonight she\u2019s giving in and letting her guard down. I want to show her how good it can be between us, so I push her a little further.</p><p>Gripping her hand slightly, I pull it over so her palm is resting on my hard cock. The heat from her palm nearly burns me through my slacks as she rubs her fingers along the ridge of my dick. I press her hand harder against me, and she grips me firmly. It\u2019s all I can do to keep the car on the road as I turn down the long driveway to my house.</p> <p>I bought this cabin when I moved back, opting not to stay on the family estate. My dad had a few choice words about it, but fuck him. This place is beautiful. It\u2019s a big cabin that sits just outside of town on a small lake. I bought this house the week after I first laid eyes on Josephine.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, this is your place?\u201d She loosens her grip on my cock but doesn\u2019t take her hand away. \u201cThat garage is sick.\u201d There\u2019s a little wonder in her voice as she sees the four-bay garage off to the right of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cYeah, apparently this used to be a hunting lodge, and they had the garage for guests. I had the inside of the place renovated, but kept the garage as is.\u201d</p><p>She looks over at me and raises an eyebrow. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know anything about cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But lucky for me, my woman does.\u201d I had the garage redone for her. Once I got her here, I didn\u2019t want her to have any reason to have to leave. Show her right up front I wasn\u2019t fucking around. She was meant to be mine from the moment I laid eyes on her. I knew it down to my soul. I just had to get things ready so I could have her, but things weren\u2019t moving as fast as I would have liked so I was jumping in to speed up the process.</p><p>Her mouth falls open a little as I reluctantly move her hand off my cock and get out of the car, going around to her side. I open the door and hold out my hand, helping her step out of the car.</p><p>I reach down, scooping her up, and carry her like a bride to the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cLaw, what the fuck are you doing? Put me down.\u201d She tries to wriggle a little, but I grip her tighter.</p> <p>\u201cNot a chance, love. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d There\u2019s a slight squeak to her voice that I can only assume is fear. It\u2019s okay. That will pass the more we\u2019re together.</p><p>\u201cJosephine, I\u2019m almost thirty years old. I\u2019ve never once been in love or anything close to it. It\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve so much as shaken a woman\u2019s hand. So no, I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>I look into her eyes as I open the front door and carry her over the threshold. I can see wonder there, and I can also see hope. I don\u2019t know what kind of life she comes from, but from what I\u2019ve seen over the past year of watching her, she\u2019s built up a fortress to keep people out.</p><p>Kicking the door closed behind us, I carry her through the great room and walk down the hall. I take her straight to the master bedroom and stand her up at the end of it, holding her hips to steady her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLaw, this is crazy. Tonight is just...it\u2019s insane.\u201d Her dark eyes search mine for guidance. She\u2019s desperate for someone to take the reins, and lucky for us, I\u2019m okay with that.</p><p>Cupping her neck with both hands, I rub my thumb across the bottom of her jaw. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired, Josephine?\u201d She looks at me questioningly. I lean in, just a hair\u2019s breadth away from her lips. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of holding up all those walls? Let go, love. I\u2019ll be here when they fall.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips to hers, and she opens for me, letting me in. Her arms go around my waist, pulling me to her as my tongue sweeps in.</p><p>Her taste is so sweet, I have bite her bottom lip. I want to devour her body, starting with her lips.</p><p>\u201cLaw,\u201d she whispers, her words like a balm to my aching body. I feel her let out a breath, and I pull back to look into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not...experienced.\u201d She looks away and then looks back at me, clenching her jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before. I don\u2019t know if that matters to you or not.\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me with one arm, letting every curve of her body melt against mine. With the other hand, I reach up and start to undo the buttons of her blouse.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me who you\u2019ve been with and what you have or haven\u2019t done before me. All I care about is that I\u2019m your last.\u201d Once her blouse is open, I trace my fingers along the edge of her black lace bra and up the middle of her cleavage. \u201cAll I care about is that nothing comes between us tonight. Just you and me. Skin...\u201d I lean down, kissing between her breasts. \u201c...On skin.\u201d I say the words against her lush tits, needing to suck on her more.</p><p>I let go of her waist, unzipping her skirt and taking off her clothes. She\u2019s standing before me in her black lace bra, panties, and her blood-red high heels. She\u2019s covered in ink, and she looks like a fucking rock star goddess. I burn the image into my brain, wanting to remember this when we are a hundred, and I remind her about the first time she gave me her body.</p><p>Reaching around her back, I unclasp her bra and let it drop to the floor. Her tits bounce free, making me lick my lips. Dipping my fingers into the waistband of her panties, I pull them down her thighs, down to her ankles. She goes to take off her shoes, but I touch her leg, stopping her movements.</p><p>\u201cLeave those on, love. They\u2019re beautiful and delicate, just like you.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling down in front of her, I look up to see a deep blush spread across her cheeks. I help her step out of her panties and then stand back up to relish the sight of her completely naked. I grab my chest and try to breathe.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ. My will is on my desk in my office if I don\u2019t make it through tonight.\u201d</p><p>Josephine laughs, and I snap out of my daze, removing my dress shirt and slacks as well. When I\u2019m in front of her in my boxer briefs, she walks to me, putting her fingers in the waistband, pulling them down my hips. She kneels down in front of me as I did her as I step out of them. She stays on her knees in front of me, eyeing my cock. A drop of cum beads at the end of my dick, and she licks her luscious red lips.</p><p>I reach down and grab her arms, pulling her up from the floor and taking her over to the bed. \u201cNot yet, love. Tonight is all about you.\u201d</p><p>Laying her down in the middle of the bed, I crawl between her legs, spreading them wide. She\u2019s a little tense, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because she\u2019s shy. \u201cRelax, Josephine. I\u2019m going to make friends with your pussy for a little while. After that, we should all be better acquainted.\u201d</p><p>I see the smile spread across her lips as I kiss the inside of her knee and work my way up her thigh. I lick and nibble between her legs, feeling her soft flesh against my tongue. When I get to her cunt, I nuzzle the short, soft curls and smell her sweetness. Goddamn, she smells so sweet. Sucking her fat lips into my mouth one at a time, I close my eyes and moan at her flavor.</p><p>I can\u2019t decide if her cunt tastes better than her kisses, so I lick her clit to see. I feel her legs fall open farther, and her hands come to grip my hair as I eat her sugary sweet pussy.</p><p>Her warm juices run down my chin as I take up residence between her legs. I start humping the bed with every lick, envisioning my cock instead of my tongue in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cLaw, more. Please, I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her voice as she grips my hair tighter is enough to send me over the edge. I growl against her pussy as I cum on myself and the sheets, making a mess. I can\u2019t control myself when it comes to her, and I want to make sure this first time is good for her.</p><p>Gripping her thighs harder, I suck on her clit, making it my job to pleasure her. I flick the hard bud with my tongue over and over, feeling her tense up. I don\u2019t stop. I keep the same rhythm as she arches her back off the bed and screams my name.</p><p>I feel a splash on my chin and realize she just came so hard she squirted on me. I moan against her cunt, wanting to bathe in her orgasm. I feel like a goddamn superhero. I feel like her cum on my face is my trophy, and I want to scream to the world what she gave me.</p><p>Kissing up her body, I wipe my cum off my stomach and bring it up to her pussy, rubbing it against it. I want all of me on her. After it\u2019s all smeared across her clit, I move between her legs, my dick at her opening. My cock is an angry purple color, like I didn\u2019t just cum two minutes ago.</p> <p>Leaning down over her body, I hold her face and kiss her lips. She has a sleepy smile on her face, and she looks like a woman that just had a hell of an orgasm.</p><p>\u201cThat feel good, love?\u201d She mumbles a yes against my lips, pulling me to her. \u201cThis part may sting a little, but I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josephine nods against me, and I kiss her jaw and move down her neck. I pinch her hard nipple with my two fingers as I move to her other one, sucking on it and giving it little bites.</p><p>When she\u2019s raising her hips for me to enter her, I thrust in in one long plunge. She tenses under me and lets out a small grunt as I rip through her virginity. Her sheath is tight and grips me so hard that it\u2019s all I can do to keep licking her tits and not cum.</p><p>I focus all my attention on her breasts, trying to pull her back from the edge of pain and bring her fully into pleasure. I lick and pinch, nibble and suck, until she\u2019s gripping my hair and moaning.</p><p>I keep going for a little longer until she wriggles her hips and begs me for more. \u201cPlease, Law. I\u2019m okay. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d She\u2019s breathless with need, and I can\u2019t deny her.</p><p>Moving my lips up her throat, I thrust hard into her willing cunt. \u201cNothing between us, love. Skin to skin with no barrier.\u201d She moans at my words, growing wetter as I fuck deep, her cunt squeezing me so sweet when I bite her neck.</p><p>\u201cLaw, I\u2019m not on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were, love.\u201d</p><p>Her head is thrown back, her eyes closed, and she\u2019s lost in pleasure. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m so close. Maybe you should pull out.\u201d</p><p>I laugh against her throat. \u201cNo, baby, I don\u2019t pull out of you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She clenches down on my dick hard, and I feel her juices all over me. I tilt my hips up a little, hitting her clit with every stroke. It has her scratching my back and moaning my name after only a few pumps.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Josephine. Cum all over my raw cock. Open that soft cunt up for me so I can go off inside you. I\u2019m not pulling out, so if you cum on me, I\u2019ll nut in you.\u201d</p><p>My words are enough to send her over the edge, and she shouts her orgasm into the room. Our room. I feel her cunt wet my dick, and it\u2019s all the invitation I need. I thrust against her one last time and hold it deep as I cum in her virgin pussy.</p><p>When I feel the last drop of my cum splash inside her, I roll us over, not breaking our connection. She lies on top of me, breathing hard, and I smile.</p><p>She\u2019s mine now.</p><p>Joey</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ, Joey. You\u2019ve got that stupid grin on your face again.\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek to try to stop the smile as I look out from under the hood of the old Lincoln I\u2019m working on. I meet Butch\u2019s eyes and fail miserably, busting out laughing at the look he\u2019s giving me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe a fucking copper put that look on your face.\u201d He leans under the hood, using both hands to brace himself like we\u2019re about to have some big conversation about this. And we\u2019re not. This is my business, and for the first time in my life, I don\u2019t have three giant older brothers in it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give you shit about whose legs you\u2019re between, so why you giving me shit about who\u2019s between mine?\u201d I pull the rag from my back pocket and wipe the grease off my hands. Glancing up at the clock, I see I have about enough time to get home and shower before Law is at my door.</p><p>Like clockwork every day for the past two weeks, he\u2019s at my door, picking me up at six thirty sharp. Each time he makes me pack a giant bag and asks me why I just don\u2019t go straight to his house when I leave work. I\u2019m slowly noticing that each day, more and more stuff is disappearing from my house and turning up at his.</p><p>It should piss me off, but it doesn\u2019t. In fact, it just puts the stupid smile back on my face.</p><p>\u201cJust making sure you\u2019re good. You haven\u2019t slept at home one time since the copper took you on that date. Don\u2019t want you getting too deep into something and getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all men are like you, Butch. Some of them actually don\u2019t fuck \u2019em and leave \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be an ass, I just want you to be careful is all.\u201d He runs his hand through his shaggy brown hair like he\u2019s mulling something over. \u201cTo be honest with you, you guys just don\u2019t look like you fit together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d I throw the towel down on the workbench, then motion for him to move so I can drop the hood down on the Lincoln.</p><p>\u201cHe just looks like the type to be with some snotty trophy wife. His father\u2019s the Mayor, for fuck\u2019s sake. You see that guy\u2019s wife?\u201d His words burn like acid in my stomach. Fuck this shit. I\u2019m not even hearing it. I know what\u2019s been happening between Law and me for the past two weeks, and it\u2019s been perfect. The way he touches me and treats me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m the rarest thing on earth. Like he can\u2019t live without me.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Butch. Just because I\u2019m not some rich socialite doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t attract a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up. That\u2019s not what I meant at all. That went both ways. He doesn\u2019t seem like your type either. I thought you\u2019d end up on the back of someone\u2019s bike or something. Not with the quarterback of the football team.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s got me there. I can see why he\u2019d think that, but like most things in my life I don\u2019t fit the mold of what people think. Why would who I end up with be any different.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your concern, but it\u2019s not needed.\u201d I unzip my coveralls, letting them hit the floor as I step out of them. Picking them up, I throw them into the bin with all the dirty, grease-covered clothes.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d Butch does the same, peeling off his work coveralls before throwing them into the bin. I feel my phone vibrate against my ass, warming my stomach because I know who it is. Sliding my finger over the phone, I read the message. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Law: Can\u2019t make it tonight, sweets.

Maybe a night alone isn\u2019t so bad. I could go to that cute lingerie place in town and get a few things. I own, like, two cute pairs of underwear, and I\u2019ve already worn them both twice. I want something different and fun.</p><p>\u201cLaw just canceled on me.\u201d I try to make my voice flat, like it\u2019s no big deal, but Butch puts his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cCome have a few beers with Paine and me.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s better than sitting at home. \u201cSure. I just need to run home and change before I make a quick stop. Meet you guys there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. You can help me poke bossman about the blonde piece of ass he was drooling all over today.\u201d</p><p>I snort, remembering how Paine looked when the woman walked into the shop. I thought he might trip over his own feet to get to her. It was worse when she seemed to give him the slip. Now he\u2019s been back in his office pouting about it for the last twenty minutes. I didn\u2019t even know Paine could pout.</p><p>\u201cSee you guys there.\u201d I head to my locker, grab my shit, and head home. I rush through a shower, and it only takes me thirty minutes to be back in town. I threw on some jeans and a simple black tee with my boots. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to impress tonight. I have a man. The simple thought makes me blush and giddy with excitement. I have a man. I say it over and over again in my head, loving it more every time.</p><p>Deciding to drop my car in the bar parking lot, I walk towards Main Street in the direction of the lingerie shop. It\u2019s a small town, and if you park anywhere by the main road, you can pretty much walk anywhere. Walking by the different shops and stores, I stop suddenly when a familiar face catches my attention. The sudden glance makes my stomach drop.</p> <p>There, in the little Italian restaurant, I see the Mayor and his wife, with Law, and a leggy blonde who I\u2019ve never seen before. They\u2019re all sitting at a table together, and Law is holding the blonde\u2019s hand. Like he feels my eyes on him, he turns to look at me, but I sidestep the glass window and lean against the brick building, trying to get my pounding heart under control.</p><p>Fucking work shit, my ass. Jesus, could Butch have been more right? Suddenly, I feel like his dirty little secret. Law never takes me out to dinner, nor does he even talk about his family. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that it\u2019s common knowledge that he\u2019s the Mayor\u2019s son, I would\u2019ve never known.</p><p>It burns. Holy shit, does it fucking burn. I push the tears back and shake off the hurt, going with anger instead. I was about to go get lingerie for his ass and set up something sexy. I was going to call him out on taking shit from my house and putting it in his. Tell him he didn\u2019t have to play games, that I wanted to be there.</p><p>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</p><p>I should\u2019ve known better. I see how my brothers burn through beautiful women. Hell, I live with Butch, and I see how he burns through them. I\u2019m a tomboy and a plain Jane at best. How did I expect to keep someone like Law?</p><p>My phone buzzes in my back pocket, and I see I have two texts. One from Butch and one from Law. Is he texting me while he\u2019s on a date? A date he took to meet his father? I grit my teeth and click on Butch\u2019s text.</p> <p>Butch: See your car in the bar parking lot. Where you at?</p><p>Me: Be there in five.</p><p>I cross the street, not wanting to walk right in front of the restaurant again, then head towards the bar. I can\u2019t stop myself from clicking to see what Law said.</p><p>Law: Miss you, sweets.</p><p>I clutch the phone to keep myself from throwing it. Sweets. I loved that name. How he always said I smell so sweet, taste so sweet, am so sweet. No one had ever called me sweet before him, and I was eating it up. It was like he saw the real me. Yeah, I like to fix cars and watch football and dress down a lot, but I\u2019m a woman, and when he called me sweet, it made me feel like one. Stupid, I snap at myself again. He played you. Got what we wanted. Sex. Some piece of ass on the side to fuck when he wanted, and no one had to know about it.</p><p>\u201cYou look fit to be tied.\u201d I look up to see Butch and Paine waiting for me outside the bar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to fucking talk about it.\u201d My voice is firm but holds a little more emotion in it than I like, but they both just nod, getting it. That\u2019s the great thing about having male friends. They don\u2019t make you talk things to death. You say, \u201cConversation over,\u201d and it wraps up pretty quickly.</p><p>Butch and I follow Paine in, and I can tell Paine is in just as much of a pissy mood as I am. The only one who looks like someone hasn\u2019t kicked their puppy is Butch, but he\u2019s always got a stupid easy smile on his face.</p> <p>Without asking, Jake the bartender slides us our drinks, and I quickly grab my beer, thinking I\u2019m going to need something stronger tonight.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bachelorette party happening here tonight if you guys are looking for some action,\u201d Jake says, making me roll my eyes as I take my seat next to Paine.</p><p>\u201cPoint me in the right direction, Jake. You know I\u2019m always looking for some fresh trim in this town.\u201d Butch straightens and gives the crowd a once-over as Jake points towards the dance floor.</p><p>Not being able to help myself, I follow Jake\u2019s finger to see who Butch\u2019s prey for the night will be.</p><p>Suddenly, Butch is laughing and looking back, and I see why when I catch the blonde hair of the woman who ran out of the shop today with Paine hot on her ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks like that rich chick with the Porsche is the bride-to-be,\u201d Butch says in a teasing tone, and I see Paine grip his beer bottle so tightly I\u2019m shocked it doesn\u2019t shatter in his hand.</p><p>I reach out and grab his bottle as his eyes meet mine. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it for you, boss,\u201d I tell Paine because I know where he\u2019s heading. Straight for the dance floor to get the girl Butch is following. I down my beer and order another, enjoying sitting at the bar by myself. I don\u2019t feel like being social.</p><p>My phone buzzes across the bar top, and I check the message. I should turn it off because I know it can only be one person, but like a masochist, I click the message.</p><p>Law: Sweets, text me back. You got me worried.</p> <p>He\u2019s fucking worried? Is he worried while he\u2019s got his dick in some other chick\u2019s cunt? The thought knocks the air out of my lungs. I motion for another drink, and Jake drops it down in front of me moments later.</p><p>Paine sits down next to me, and I don\u2019t comment on where the little blonde went. Hell, I even see Butch behind me in the mirror over the bar, hitting on some chick. Are all men alike? I can\u2019t believe I let myself think I found something different.</p><p>My phone buzzes again.</p><p>Law: Damn it, Joey, answer me or I\u2019m going to spank your pussy when I get my hands on you.</p><p>How can he fucking talk to me like that when he\u2019s out with another woman!</p> <p>Me: Why don\u2019t you spank the pussy of the blonde you were having dinner with. You know, the one you introduced to your family.</p><p>With that, I power off my phone. I don\u2019t want to read his excuses, or worse, see that he doesn\u2019t respond at all. He probably knows he got busted, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done with me.</p><p>\u201cPenelope,\u201d Paine mumbles next to me for the tenth time since he sat down, taking another pull from his beer.</p><p>\u201cIf you say that word one more time, I\u2019m going to knock you off that fucking stool,\u201d I tell him. Can\u2019t we both wallow in our misery in silence? I\u2019m just thankful the bar finally turned the music down since the bachelorette party left.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up,\u201d Paine says, looking over at me while I fiddle with the paper on my beer bottle. I pull it off and stick it back on, annoyed at everything.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did. You went after something you can\u2019t have and you shouldn\u2019t want,\u201d I tell him as I meet his eyes. We both went after people who were out of our league and in a class we\u2019d never understand. Law may just be a sheriff, but he comes from old money. Hell, his dad is the goddamn Mayor.</p> <p>\u201cEvening, Sheriff. What can I do for you tonight?\u201d the bartender says. My eyes snap to the mirror behind the bar, and I seeing Law standing five feet back from Paine and me. My whole body locks up, and I grab my beer, wanting something to hold on to. Play it cool, I repeat over and over again in my head. I\u2019ve given him enough of myself. I won\u2019t give him anymore. He\u2019s already seen parts of me no one else ever has. The girl who lies beneath my layers. One who is going back into hiding to lick her wounds.</p><p>\u201cJust checking on things,\u201d Law responds, and I can feel his eyes on me. I try to pretend he\u2019s not there until he speaks right to me. \u201cHow you doing, Josephine?\u201d</p><p>My heart clenches at the use of my name. It bugged me at first when he called me that, like he knew me, but over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve grown to love it. Crave him saying it. When we\u2019d make love and he\u2019d call it out, it was like the sweetest thing I\u2019ve never known. I still refuse to meet his eyes in the mirror and just go on ignoring him. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this in the middle of the bar for everyone to see. Before today I wouldn\u2019t have thought it a big deal, but after seeing him out with the other woman, the pieces click into place. He didn\u2019t want people to know we were together. How didn\u2019t I see it before? I was too content to spend our time together just holed up in his home, in his bed.</p><p>Instead of answering him, I just give him the middle finger. Because that\u2019s what he can do. Fuck off</p><p>\u201cJosephine, sweets, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweets\u2014\u201d Paine tries to say interject, but I cut them both off.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, Anderson? Pretty sure stalking is against the law.\u201d</p><p>The bar has become eerily quiet now, and I know everyone is watching what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>\u201cJake, my sister around? I thought they came in here tonight,\u201d Law says, pissing me off even more. He has a fucking sister? Law knows everything about me, and I didn\u2019t even know he had a goddamn sister. Oh, I know why, there\u2019s no point in introducing Joey because you\u2019ll never meet her. You\u2019re just the Sheriff\u2019s dirty secret he fucks out in his cabin.</p><p>\u201cShe with that bachelorette party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have been them. She\u2019s the bachelorette.\u201d</p><p>I almost want to laugh at the irony of Law\u2019s words. Paine and I have been sitting at the bar, moping about a brother and sister who are way out of our range. But I have a feeling that won\u2019t stop Paine. As for me, my ego can\u2019t handle another round. I might shatter.</p><p>\u201cThey left here about two hours ago,\u201d Jake says, pouring a glass of cheap whiskey.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I was just checking in before I head home for the night.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but snort at his words, not believing him. \u201cProbably going to be fucking his date tonight since he won\u2019t be fucking me,\u201d I mumble to myself.</p><p>\u201cJosephine, can I have a word with you outside?\u201d I want to scream at him. Of course, so no one sees the sheriff is slumming it, but I can\u2019t ignore him. He\u2019s still the sheriff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d I motion for Jake to pour me another shot. \u201cThe Sheriff or Law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking, sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the answer is no. Besides, you don\u2019t like being seen with me in public.\u201d I shrug my shoulders, trying to pretend I don\u2019t give a shit and failing. I can feel the tension in my whole body; I\u2019m practically vibrating.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fucking true and you know it,\u201d Law snarls, and I can feel him getting closer to me, something I don\u2019t want. He can\u2019t touch me. I won\u2019t be able to hold back the tears if he does, and I won\u2019t give him my tears. I slam back my shot, jumping off the barstool, and I wobble a little. Both Law and Paine jump to steady me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch her,\u201d Law growls at Paine, pulling me towards his body in a possessive hold. I feel the dam inside me start to shake, and it takes everything in me to get my words out without it cracking.</p><p>\u201cYou made your choice. Now live with it.\u201d I try to push past him, but he grabs me by the arm and I turn, shooting all my anger at him. I\u2019ve got to hold on to that anger until I get out of this bar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too drunk to drive.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even respond to his words. I just call out Butch\u2019s name. \u201cButch has me,\u201d I say, hoping that fucking digs into his gut. Law may not want everyone to know we\u2019re together, but I know he doesn\u2019t want to share me. Double standard much?</p><p>Law clenches his jaw again, but what can he really say? Everyone in the bar is staring at us.</p> <p>\u201cPick up your phone,\u201d he grits out at me, but I\u2019m having no part of it.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>With that, I grab onto Butch\u2019s arm, and he pulls me closer, probably because he sees the distress on my face.</p><p>\u201cGet me home, please,\u201d I whisper to him as the tears start to fall.</p><p>Law</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in over your head.\u201d Paine says the words, but I don\u2019t look at him. I keep staring out the door Josephine just walked through, taking a part of me with her. When she hadn\u2019t returned my text messages I got a little worried, but when she sent that last text, it felt like the bottom of my world dropped out from under me.</p> <p>I grit my teeth and clench my fists, trying to get my anger under control. I only have myself to be pissed at. I played this all wrong. The last year of my life has been miserable and fucking lonely, and the last two weeks were the best I\u2019ve never known. I\u2019m not letting it slip through my fingers so easily. One way or another, she\u2019s going to listen to me. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m somewhere with her, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d It\u2019s the truth. I\u2019ll take my girl any way I can get her. I may be in over my head with her, but that\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019ll drown in her, and it will be the sweetest death a man could ever ask for.</p><p>I walk out of the bar and make it in time to see her get into Butch\u2019s car. I know they\u2019re just friends, but fuck does it burn to see him taking care of her. She was hurting when I walked into the bar, and it isn\u2019t Butch she should have been calling out for. No, it should\u2019ve been me. But I fucked up. I want to be the man she runs to when she needs someone to lean on. I\u2019d almost gotten all her trust, only to see it go up in smoke.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I scream out to the empty parking lot before heading to my cruiser. I don\u2019t give it a thought. I flip on the blue lights and the siren, chasing after them.</p><p>Butch pulls to the side of the road and I follow suit, turning off the siren but leaving the lights on. Butch goes to open his door, probably to argue with me, but I give him the same voice I used on thugs on the streets of Chicago when I worked patrol.</p><p>\u201cHands on the wheel and don\u2019t so much as fucking move a finger.\u201d It\u2019s a dick move, using my power for my own ends, but I can\u2019t bring myself to care. There isn\u2019t anything I won\u2019t do to have my sweet Josephine, even pissing a year-old case down the drain. I\u2019ll find another way.</p><p>I go over to the passenger side, pulling the door open. Reaching in, I pop her seatbelt and pull her out of the car and sling her over my shoulder. She gives me a little bit of a fight, but she\u2019s just so tiny it\u2019s easy to get her under control.</p><p>Butch hops out of the car and I stop looking at him. I can tell from the indecisive look on his face that he\u2019s debating what he wants to do. He may want to come at me, but I\u2019m still the Sheriff.</p><p>\u201cYou made her cry. I\u2019ve never seen her cry before, Law.\u201d</p> <p>His words are like stones dropping into water. The first impact is brutal, the aftermath rips through my body, reaching to my soul. I did the very thing I was trying to prevent, and now I\u2019m going to lay my cards on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix it,\u201d I tell him, letting all my emotion out in my words. I won\u2019t get any points with Josephine if I knock her best friend out on the side of the highway because she\u2019s not going with him. Over my fucking dead body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking with you, Law. Fix it or Paine and I will be so far up your ass...\u201d</p><p>\u201cButch! What the fuck? You\u2019re just going to let this lying cheating bastard take me?\u201d She starts kicking her feet again, and I slap her ass. I\u2019m trying to get her under control before she tries to buck off my shoulder and I land her ass on the hard blacktop.</p><p>\u201cCall me in the morning, Joey.\u201d Butch gets back in his car and takes off, but Josephine still yells until she realizes he\u2019s gone.</p><p>I go to the passenger side of the cruiser and place her on her feet, caging her in. She bucks against me, trying to free herself. She\u2019s hitting at my chest while tears stream down her face. Each verbal blow she lands is a direct hit to my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI fucking loved you! But I was just some dirty secret to you. Not good enough to take out in public. Not good enough to meet your parents.\u201d</p><p>When the fight finally leaves her body, getting all of what she was holding in out, she sags against the car.</p><p>I drop to my knees in front of her, my hands engulfing her narrow hips, looking up as she looks down at me. The moon makes her big green eyes seem brighter than normal, and my heart aches twice as hard.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about my dirty secrets.\u201d She starts to push my hands off her hips, but I just hold her tighter. \u201cThey are my secrets that I\u2019ve been trying to hide from you. I didn\u2019t want them touching you. I don\u2019t want them anywhere near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Her words say one thing, but her eyes fill with hope. Her hands come to rest on my shoulders, and I\u2019m thankful she isn\u2019t trying to push me back with them.</p><p>\u201cI hate my father and can\u2018t stand to be in the same room as my stepmother.\u201d I don\u2019t let her know it\u2019s because the woman has been trying to get in my fucking pants for years, something that makes me want to throw up, but I don\u2019t want to make my girl jealous. Jealousy eats me up when it comes to her. Fuck, last week I got jealous of the goddamn straw in her drink, and I don\u2019t want her to have those feelings. I want her to have no questions about what she is to me, or that I\u2019d ever give another woman the time of day because I wouldn\u2019t. Hell, women haven\u2019t even been on my radar for years. I poured everything into my job. Until her. She turned my world upside down.</p><p>\u201cThat may be true, Law, but I saw you with another woman. You were holding her hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with the FBI.\u201d Her fingers tighten on my shoulders waiting for me to continue. \u201cI\u2019ve been building a case against my father, and she\u2019s part of it. About a year ago he asked me to come back here to Springfield and run for Sheriff. At first I told him no, but he kept pressing. Then the FBI reached out to me, told me that things around my dad didn\u2019t smell too good. I didn\u2019t like that one bit. I just wanted to wash my hands of him, but I\u2019d heard him talk about my sister. About roping her into coming back here, and I knew then he had plans to get her under his thumb. We may have never been close, but I couldn\u2019t let him do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went on the date tonight as a decoy. Go out to dinner, then back to my dad\u2019s for drinks. I\u2019d distract good old Dad and my stepmom while Debra, my fake date,\u201d I emphasize \u2018fake\u2019 so she gets the point, \u201cwent to snoop around a little. But that all went out the window when you wouldn\u2019t respond to my text messages.\u201d I tell her even though I don\u2019t care that the plan went to hell. I\u2019ll find another way. Josephine is my number one priority. Not the cons my dad has been doing to move himself up in life.</p><p>\u201cI blew your case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the case,\u201d I growl, because that isn\u2019t the issue here. \u201cJosephine, my sweet Josephine. Think of all the ways I\u2019ve worshiped your body. Made love to you every night. You\u2019re it for me. Nothing else in this whole world matters if I don\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaw.\u201d Her eyes fill with tears again, but I can tell I\u2019m getting through to her. Her beautiful face has gone soft. It\u2019s the same face she gives me when I tell her how utterly sweet she is, and she tells me there\u2019s nothing sweet about her, which is utter bullshit. She\u2019s pure sweetness. A sweetness that only I get.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d I ask her. Her words still rolling around and around in my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you said you loved me. Did you mean that? Do you still love me?\u201d Her words ripped through me when she threw them at me in anger. I want them back. Need them. We\u2019ve never said them to each other before, because I didn\u2019t want to push. I\u2019d pushed her so much already that I hadn\u2019t wanted to add to it. And to be honest, I wanted them from her first. I had done so much to get her. Gone after her hard and just taking over. I wanted this to be something she gave me.</p><p>She drops down to her knees in front of me, but I scoop her up in my arms and stand. She wraps her legs around my waist, her hands around my neck, her fingers digging into my hair at the back of my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever go to your knees.\u201d</p><p>She ignores my words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I overreacted. I just...you\u2019re just...\u201d She stumbles over her words, and I hold my breath, wondering if she\u2019ll say it again. \u201cToo perfect to be true. This is all so new to me. I\u2019ve never done this before, but I should have known I feel it when you touch me, you love me and I love you.\u201d</p><p>I take her in a deep kiss, pushing my tongue into her mouth, needing a taste of her more than I need to breathe right now. I was so fucking scared she\u2019d never give me this again. Her body melts into mine, her sweetness seeping out. I press her up against the car, but I quickly pull back, remembering we\u2019re still on the side of the road, and I don\u2019t want anyone seeing her with all this passion on her face. It\u2019s all mine, and I\u2019m not sharing even a drop of it.</p><p>She tries to pull me back to her, and I can\u2019t help but chuckle. Over the past few weeks she\u2019s become more of the aggressor when it comes to the bedroom. It\u2019s adorable as shit when she tries to boss me around in the bed and when she tries to attack my cock.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d I tell her, trying to remind myself as much as her before my control starts to slip.</p><p>\u201cTake me home.\u201d</p><p>I pause at her words, and she must feel my body tense up. \u201cOur home,\u201d she finishes, making me smile. I\u2019ve been slowly trying to move her in, and it seems she was on to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, sweetheart, and there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather take you than to our home.\u201d</p><p>Joey</p><p>Law carries me into the house, and I can\u2019t keep my hands off him. The passion between us has ignited and there\u2019s no putting it out.</p><p>When I open my eyes to see we are in our bedroom, I hop out of his arms and start taking off my boots. \u201cGet on the bed, Sheriff. I\u2019m in charge tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Law gives me a cocky smile, letting me know that he\u2019ll play along. I know he doesn\u2019t really let go of his control. He just lets me play for a while. I felt like a jerk for messing up his case, but on the way home he got a call from his partner saying that she was able to sneak a wiretap in his father\u2019s office tonight and that she should have all the evidence to sink his ship very soon. Law didn\u2019t seem to really care, but I was grateful that he hadn\u2019t given up on all that work just because I got mad and didn\u2019t hear him out. I\u2019m quick to heat, and I judge fast. I should have heard him out. That\u2019s what you do when you love someone. You give them a chance. This is all crazy new to me, but with Law on my side, we can make it through anything.</p><p>Once he\u2019s naked and climbs onto the bed, he lays his big body in the middle, spreading his arms and legs.</p><p>His hard cock is pointing straight up, and I can\u2019t help but clench between my legs in excitement. Goddamn, do I love fucking him. We have times where it\u2019s sweet and slow, and sometimes it\u2019s rough and fast. I think tonight I want a little of both.</p><p>I slowly strip off my clothes, letting him get his fill. He reaches down between his legs, stroking his cock as I bend over to take off my panties, spreading my legs wide and letting him see all he\u2019s about to get.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby, I don\u2019t know how long I can wait.\u201d</p><p>Once I\u2019m completely naked, I slowly crawl from the foot of the bed, up his body. I straddle his leg and rub my wet pussy up his thigh, letting him feel my heat and teasing us both. I rub back and forth, grinding on his hard muscle and feeling the friction of the hair he has there against my clit. It\u2019s so good that I reach down and spread my pussy lips further apart, wanting all of me against him.</p><p>I grind down as I watch him stroke his cock, pearls of cum beading at the tip. He smears his pre-cum down his shaft and uses it as lube as I rotate my hips back and forth. My pussy is soaked, and I can hear the sticky sound of me against his skin, and it turns me on more.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Josephine.\u201d I look up to see the desperate need in Law\u2019s eyes, and I move up, straddling his cock, placing his thick tip at my opening.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Law.\u201d Slowly lowering myself down onto his wide cock, I feel him spread me open in the most delicious way.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, my sweetness.\u201d</p><p>When I reach the root of his cock and I\u2019m unable to take any more of him, I slowly pulse up and down. Gently wetting his length and trying to stretch my pussy to accommodate his big cock.</p><p>Even after all the times we\u2019ve made love, I still have to get used to his size. I feel myself leaking down his cock, and I clench tighter with need. I think my body was so worked up from the stress earlier, and now I\u2019m so relieved that everything is okay that I just need a release.</p><p>I rub circles around my clit as I start to move up and down Law\u2019s cock. He grabs my hips, thrusting up into me, and I close my eyes and moan. After just a few thrusts, I feel him sit up and latch onto one of my nipples. He\u2019s even deeper at this angle, and I can\u2019t hold back my shout of surprised ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close.\u201d I barely get the words out as his teeth find my neck, and I use my free hand to grip his hair. My other hand is still on my clit, inching me closer and closer.</p><p>\u201cLet go, Josephine. I\u2019m right here to catch you.\u201d</p><p>His words of trust and love send me over the edge, and I cum on his cock, releasing all the tension I\u2019ve been holding on to. I melt into him and move up and down, riding out my orgasm and making it go on longer. He grips my hips and makes me grind down on him as he thrusts deep and fills me up. I feel his cock twitch inside me as his warm cum spreads through my pussy.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d I smile against his skin because I can\u2019t stop saying it. I feel so silly and shy because I keep repeating it, but it just keeps coming out. I\u2019m officially head over heels in love with this man of mine.</p><p>I hear him whisper the words against my neck, sending chills up and down my back. I move against him a little and feel that he\u2019s still rock hard inside me. There\u2019s not usually a time we are together that he isn\u2019t hard, and if he isn\u2019t, it only takes a wiggle of my ass to get him there.</p> <p>\u201cMarry me, Law.\u201d</p><p>He pulls back fast, grabbing my face and looking into my eyes. \u201cSay it again.\u201d It\u2019s a demand, not a question. His look is intense, and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019ve upset him or made him happy.</p><p>I take a deep breath and remind myself that this is what love is. Everything out on the table and heart wide open.</p><p>\u201cI said, marry me, Law. Will you marry me?\u201d I bite my lip and think that he may have wanted to do the asking. But he should know by now that I\u2019m not a conventional girl, and this isn\u2019t a conventional relationship. I\u2019m different, he\u2019s different, and that makes us different.</p><p>He closes his eyes tightly for a second and then opens them to look back at me. His big eyes are a little watery as he nods his head.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d My voice goes up on a squeak on the last word, but I\u2019m too excited to care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Josephine, I\u2019ll marry you. Been waiting on you to ask that for a long time. And to be honest, I thought I\u2019d have to wait a long time for it. I love you so much, baby. I can\u2019t wait to make you my wife.\u201d</p><p>He grabs me by the waist and picks me up from the bed, not breaking our connection. He walks me down the hall to his office, around his desk, and sits in his big chair, all while keeping his cock in me, with me wrapped around his hips.</p><p>Reaching over, he pulls out a black velvet box and hands it to me. There\u2019s a receipt on top, and the date is circled. It\u2019s from almost exactly a year ago today, and I look up at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cSince I first laid eyes on you, Josephine.\u201d He pulls out the ring\u2014an emerald-cut black diamond. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the only one.\u201d</p> <p>He slides the ring onto my finger, and my lips fall on his, telling him what I can\u2019t find the words to say. As he lays me back on the desk and makes love to me, I realize that he wanted me before he knew me. He took one look at me and knew I would be his best friend, his partner, his wife, and the mother of his children. He saw more in me in one glance than I\u2019d seen in myself my whole life.</p><p>Goddamn, I\u2019m a lucky woman.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>LAW</p><p>Ten years later...</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you three times, I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosephine, I swear it\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>I hear the phone click, and I know she hung up on me. I feel the smug smile on my face as I lean my ass against my cruiser and wait for her to show up.</p><p>The kids are with Paine and Penelope this weekend, and what better way to start off our time alone than with a little fun.</p><p>We\u2019ve been together so long that I\u2019m sure she knows my game, but that sassy hard-ass of hers likes to play hard to get.</p><p>Things between us have only gotten better over time, and I still can\u2019t get enough of her. She\u2019s the love of my life, and even though things get hectic, we still find time to remember why we fell in love.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have to wait long before she pulls up in her Corvette. I bought her the classic for her thirtieth birthday, and she looks sexy as fuck in it. She steps out, and my eyes roam up and down her tight body. She\u2019s got on a black tank top, tight jeans, and her work boots. Her black hair is in messy waves down her back, and she looks like a fucking sex goddess. She stomps over to me and crosses her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d She looks over my shoulder to see the hood of my cruiser up and raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Damn thing won\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip to keep from smiling and elbows past me to check it out. It won\u2019t take her long to see the battery cable disconnected, but the real fun will begin after I get the cuffs on her.</p><p>I smile as I turn and follow her, thinking this is going to be a hell of a weekend. </p> </body></html>"]
