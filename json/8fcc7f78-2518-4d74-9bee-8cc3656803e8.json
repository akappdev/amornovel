From the top floor of the Black Oak Oil building, he could practically see all the way to Fort Worth. He knew the view well. The same buildings and trees, the same smog hanging over the same traffic jam this time of morning. Even the coffee was the same, just like every other morning. He rose long before the sun, nightmares chasing away any semblance of peaceful sleep. He always gave up and, after a punishing run, came in to the office. His employees thought he was dedicated, but the truth was he had nothing better to do.</p><p>His only reason for smiling anymore was the one person he must stay far, far away from.</p><p>Hannah Craig.</p> <p>Yeah, you did such a great job staying way far away from her, you idiot. You hired her as your admin. Way to keep the girl safe. She\u2019s a whole twenty feet away from you eight plus hours a day. Good going, James.</p><p>The phone ringing on his desk interrupted his nasty inner monologue.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, I\u2019m going to be a little bit late.\u201d Gavin\u2019s brother Slade yawned as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat a surprise. Another late night at the club?\u201d</p><p>Maybe Hannah wasn\u2019t the only one who made Gavin smile. He couldn\u2019t help the way his lips quirked up, thinking about how his brother spent his nights. Spanking women was rapidly becoming a second job for Slade\u2014and he was good at it. Often, Gavin wondered why he didn\u2019t go out with his brothers. Maybe not to the BDSM club they frequented, but dinner would be nice. He\u2019d become so solitary in the last ten years since\u2014</p> <p>Nope. He refused to think about that.</p><p>Gavin forced a cheery tone to his voice. \u201cDid Dex keep you out all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not keep him out,\u201d Dex said as he strolled into the office, proving once again that he was always on time. Of course, he also was the illegitimate child who felt the need to prove he belonged. \u201cSlade managed that all on his own. He found a pretty blonde. Surprise, surprise.</p><p>When I left the club they were getting mighty cozy.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s brief foray into a decent mood took a nosedive. Slade would have picked a pretty blonde for one reason and one reason only\u2014to pretend she was Hannah. Of all of Gavin\u2019s many reasons for staying the hell away from his admin, the fact that both of his brothers were crazy about her sat at the top of his list.</p><p>Who are you fooling? That\u2019s not why you stay away. If you don\u2019t, you know what will happen. You know what you\u2019d do to that girl. You already lost one. Do you really think you deserve a second chance?</p> <p>Gavin took a deep breath and forced a smile. Dex already believed that he was indifferent.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to push his half brother even further away.</p><p>Punching the button on the phone, Gavin put Slade on speaker. \u201cTell me you\u2019re going to make the board meeting.\u201d</p><p>Dex snorted and tossed his big body into one of the chairs in front of Gavin\u2019s desk. He crossed one leg over the other, his beat-up cowboy boots poking from his tailored suit. That was Dex. Gavin could force him into a designer suit, but he was never going to lose the cowboy.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to make the meeting,\u201d Slade said with a long-suffering sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not late because I partied too hard. I just talked to the blonde. Mostly. Candy? Sandy? I don\u2019t remember. She was nice, but she wasn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Hannah. Gavin watched Dex\u2019s mouth turn down. He was obviously thinking the same thing.</p><p>Slade continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Listen, I got a call about the Alaska site. We\u2019ve had a little trouble there. Something\u2019s gone wrong with the infrastructure. I\u2019m going to have to head up there for a few days. I spent the morning calling around to make sure the house is ready for me after the board disperses.\u201d</p><p>Gavin arched a brow at Dex, who waved him off. \u201cIt\u2019s an engineering problem, not security.</p> <p>I already talked to Mike in River Run. He said it\u2019s been really quiet there. The worst they\u2019ve had is some kids deciding the base office needs new graffiti on the side. They have computer problems, too, but the IT guy is on it. The situation Slade is talking about just needs a little follow-up and supervision.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least security was one thing he didn\u2019t worry about. Since Dex had taken it over for Black Oak Oil, that function had been running smoothly.</p><p>Gavin grabbed the stack of mail he\u2019d taken from Hannah\u2019s desk, waiting for her arrival in thirty-four minutes. God, he was an idiot. He knew the exact time she would walk in the door, and he waited on her like a dog waiting for a promised treat. Anxiously, he sorted through the mail. It was too early to expect anyone else to be in for meetings, and he had nothing else to do.</p><p>She was far too efficient. He\u2019d hired her straight off the bus from some no-name West Texas town, never imagining how quickly she would become essential. Sometimes, Gavin even found himself twiddling his damn thumbs because Hannah ran his workload so efficiently.</p><p>There was a slight pause on Slade\u2019s end of the line, and then his brother sounded almost reluctant. \u201cGavin, Dex and I want to talk to you about something. Do you think we could schedule lunch after the meeting?\u201d</p><p>The mail was all crap. He could throw most of it away. He came to a large envelope that looked more interesting. Maybe it contained something other than an offer to halve his budget for bulk paper. Gavin sliced his letter opener neatly through the material as suspicion about this luncheon crept into his mind. \u201cAbout what? Business?\u201d</p><p>Dex shifted in his chair. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He didn\u2019t want to do this with them. \u201cIs this about Hannah?\u201d Why had he even asked? He knew. His brothers had been sniffing around her since the day Gavin had reluctantly hired her almost a year ago. Somehow, they\u2019d zeroed in on the fact that he wanted her, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat we want isn\u2019t going to change, Gavin,\u201d Dex said, his mouth a stubborn, flat line. \u201cNo matter how much you want it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an adult.\u201d Slade\u2019s voice was cajoling where Dex went straight to the fight. \u201cShe\u2019s smart and capable of making her own decisions. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what? Twenty-two or something.\u201d Practically a child. At least he kept telling himself that.</p><p>Dex leaned forward as if ready to fight if need be. \u201cGavin, you were running this company at twenty-two, don\u2019t forget. Besides, Hannah is twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>A chill raced across Gavin\u2019s skin, and suddenly the room seemed way too small. Hannah was twenty-five. They had just celebrated her birthday not a month before. He\u2019d brought in a cake, and Dex and Slade had thrown her a party. Gavin remembered the jealousy he\u2019d felt as his brothers had led her out of the office. He\u2019d wanted to be there beside her, too, celebrating with Hannah. Holding her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re being at all honest with yourself, Gavin, you want what we want. Hannah is not Nikki, and you\u2019re not the same person you were then. You have to let it go and live again,\u201d Slade said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes. We\u2019ll talk more then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of her actual age, she\u2019s na\u00efve. She\u2019s not ready to take on multiple men or play your games.\u201d Gavin was pleased with how stable his voice sounded when all he could see in his mind\u2019s eye was Nikki\u2019s body laid out on the impersonal slab at the morgue.</p><p>Lately in his dreams, Nikki\u2019s body turned into Hannah\u2019s. The image seared itself in his head.</p><p>He managed to breathe, barely. He had to focus or he would lose it. And he needed to find another job for Hannah. If he kept her this close... No, he just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gavin,\u201d Slade growled. \u201cWhen it comes to Hannah, these aren\u2019t games, and we\u2019re not playing.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s heart stuttered. \u201cGive the girl time to grow up.\u201d</p><p>He upended the large envelope in his hand and let the contents drift to his desk, hoping Dex didn\u2019t notice his shaking hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like it\u2019s all just Slade and me. You\u2019re not fooling anyone,\u201d Dex said. For once, the big cowboy almost looked reluctant to speak. \u201cI see how you look at her. You want her. You care. That\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, if there\u2019s one thing both Slade and I understand, it\u2019s how a man can be crazy about Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s voice came over the speaker. \u201cDex and I have given this a lot of thought. We think it\u2019s time, and all of us need to be on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Dex leaned forward. \u201cWe have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Anything else they were about to say got lost as Gavin saw what spilled out of the envelope. Photographs of Hannah. He frowned. Ten pictures, all of them of her gorgeous body wearing lovely, lacy creations in soft colors that showcased her plump breasts and gorgeous ass. In one, a shot of her backside, she wore nothing at all. Gavin\u2019s breath fled, and his cock stiffened at the sight.</p><p>Dex stood, peering down at the pictures on the desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Gavin had a sudden desire to hide the provocative images. Instead, he glared. At times, Dex had been known to think way outside the box when he solved a problem. Dex had said he a plan.</p><p>Was taking these pictures a part of it? Or Dex\u2019s immature way of reeling him into their twisted little arrangement?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to explain this?\u201d He shoved the least seductive image in Dex\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Hannah. What the hell?\u201d Dex grabbed the picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Slade asked, his voice rising in alarm over the phone. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018that\u2019s Hannah?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Dex stared at Gavin, his face taking on that same blank expression he\u2019d had for the first two years after Gavin and Slade had found him in a foster home. Dex had been the child their father hadn\u2019t planned on or wanted. It had been pure chance that Gavin and Slade even discovered that Dex existed. \u201cYou think I would do this?\u201d</p><p>His half brother\u2019s indignant tone registered in Gavin\u2019s head, but rage rode him hard. \u201cDo you know what Hannah could do to you if she found out about this? She could call in the cops, and I would let her. And your sick ploy won\u2019t work. You might be able to pull Slade into your perversions, but don\u2019t think you can do the same with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Gavin. Why would you say that?\u201d Slade slammed a door, and Gavin knew that his brother was on his way.</p><p>Dex practically radiated fury. He was a huge bull of a man, and Gavin thought they were about to have the throw down he\u2019d always suspected was coming. Dex loomed over Gavin, his fists clenched and ready, but then he shut down. Dex\u2019s shoulders relaxed, and his face became a mask of bland politeness. \u201cListen up, Gavin. The only reason I am not walking out the door right this second is that I want Hannah safe. After I figure out who\u2019s stalking her and make sure he can\u2019t do it again, I\u2019m leaving. You won\u2019t have to deal with this perverse bastard ever again. But next time your rich-boy conscience takes over, don\u2019t you dare come looking for me.\u201d Gavin looked at the pictures again and realized he\u2019d made several terrible errors. He\u2019d been so concerned about the photos that he hadn\u2019t taken time to really look at the envelope. It hadn\u2019t been addressed to him, but to Hannah herself. There was no stamp on the front. Some bastard had walked right into her office, stood at her desk, and made sure she would receive his \u201cgift\u201d.</p><p>Dex flipped over one of the photographs and slapped it on Gavin\u2019s desk with a resounding thud.</p><p>You\u2019re mine.</p><p>The menacing words had been written in blood-red marker, the color a stark contrast to the white of the photo paper.</p><p>\u201cThis is not some prank I cooked up to trick you into joining us. You\u2019re really accusing me of becoming a stalker and trying to terrify the woman I love? And yes, I love Hannah. I won\u2019t not say it because you\u2019re too much of a pussy to handle it. I\u2019m going to figure out what\u2019s going on, and when I leave, I intend to take her with me. And you, big brother, can go to hell for all I care.\u201d Dex turned on his boots and strode out the door.</p><p>Gavin tried to stop the queasy feeling in his stomach as everything Dex had said sank in.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do, Gavin?\u201d Slade asked, his voice barely audible over the sounds of traffic.</p><p>Gavin bit back the urge to put his head in his hands. He\u2019d utterly mishandled everything. But that was the story of his whole fucking life. \u201cGet your ass up here now, Slade.\u201d He hung up the phone and couldn\u2019t help but stare at the pictures in front of him. Hannah was in her bedroom, and the pictures were obviously taken from a distance. They had a grainy quality. In most, Hannah was reading or watching television in her tiny bedroom. She wore a nightgown in two of the pictures, but the majority featured her in a lacy bra and barely-there panties. So fucking gorgeous. She hid that body under nearly shapeless clothes and always kept her hair in a ponytail. In the pictures, her rich honey hair flowed down her shoulders in loose curls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He loved the one where she leaned back on the bed, the phone in her hand and a smile on her face, like she was laughing. Her green eyes were bright, and that smile could light up the whole fucking world. The clock by her bed read ten o\u2019clock. Gavin remembered calling Hannah at just around that time a few nights before. He\u2019d lost an important phone number. She\u2019d teased him about his organizational skills.</p><p>This was how she looked when she talked to him? Half-dressed, plump lips welcoming?</p><p>Fuck, he\u2019d explode next time he had to call her at home.</p><p>Gavin flipped the photo over.</p> <p>Don\u2019t let those perverted brothers touch you. You\u2019re mine.</p><p>Gavin shoved the photo aside and surged to his feet. Hannah was in danger, and he\u2019d been getting a hard-on looking at evidence. What kind of man was he?</p><p>You know, that voice said. You know exactly what kind of man you are, asshole.</p><p>He was a man who had just shoved his half brother aside in one of the cruelest ways possible.</p><p>He shoved everyone away. Now, he was going to lose everything if he didn\u2019t get his shit straight.</p> <p>Not this time. By damned, he was going to make things right.</p><p>Gavin paced as he waited for Slade, a plan already forming.</p><p>Hannah Craig stopped and stared as Dex Townsend walked out of Gavin\u2019s office and into the grand reception area she liked to consider her turf. Walked? Dex never walked. He strode. He swaggered. And now he charged out of the office like an angry bull.</p><p>She inched back into the hallway to observe him. She\u2019d discovered that all of her men tended to put on a front when they realized she was in the room.</p><p>Her men. It was all she could do not to laugh at herself, but that was the way she thought of the James Gang\u2014Gavin, Slade, and Dex. In her fantasies, they were her men, though she would never, ever tell them. But she\u2019d fallen madly in love with them, and all three were way out of her league.</p><p>Now one of her men walked straight up to the wall across from her desk and scrubbed an angry hand across his head. He looked back at the door to Gavin\u2019s office as though he wanted to march back in and give his oldest brother a piece of his mind. Something definitely had Dex in a state. His handsome face was a mottled red and yet...she swore she saw a slight sheen of tears in his eyes. With a little huff, he pulled back his fist and put it straight through the wall. The drywall gave without a fuss, merely cracking and sending up a little cloud of dust. Dex yanked on his hand to pull it free.</p> <p>It was time to bring that man down from whatever had him so mad or he\u2019d start in on the furniture.</p><p>\u201cI never did like that wall,\u201d Hannah said softly.</p><p>Dex turned, shock obvious on his face. His angry, red flush muted to an embarrassed pink.</p><p>\u201cHannah. I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and walked in as though nothing at all was wrong. Life was what a person made it, her Gran had always said. It was time to make Dex\u2019s life a bit calmer. \u201cI mean it. I\u2019m glad someone finally put that arrogant wall in its place. I\u2019ve slapped at it a couple of times, but it always just stands there.\u201d</p><p>He huffed a little laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, girl. You know that, right?\u201d The tension in Dex dialed down several notches.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you mean. And you\u2019re one to talk. I\u2019m not the one taking out my frustrations on a wall.\u201d</p><p>She set her purse down and looked around for the mail. Nothing. Gavin probably had it. She was going to have to have a discussion with the man about his priorities. A CEO looking at the mail. Hannah sighed. If she let him, he would make the coffee, too. Gavin James was a micromanager. She opened her calendar to get ready for the day ahead.</p> <p>\u201cHannah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>When she looked up, Dex was in front of her desk, six foot five inches of the hottest cowboy she\u2019d ever seen forced into a business suit. Dex had the broadest shoulders and the deepest chest, but what got her every time was how often he showed off his big heart. He tried to hide it, but she knew he\u2019d helped out more than one employee with money troubles or medical bills.</p><p>If she told him what was happening to her, he would move heaven and earth to fix the problem. More than once, the information had been right there on the tip of her tongue, but she held back. Dex had his own troubles, and she could handle hers. She was an independent, strong woman who wasn\u2019t going to panic because some idiot sent her a few letters. And called a couple of times. And had potentially killed her cat.</p><p>She forced a smile on her face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hit me, big guy, so no apologies. Do you want to tell me what\u2019s going on with Gavin that has you feeling violent?\u201d She didn\u2019t want to bring him into her trouble, but she couldn\u2019t stay out of his. Dex and Gavin had a difficult relationship, to say the least. Slade was the bridge between the two, but he wasn\u2019t here, so it was up to her.</p><p>Dex took a long breath and then that \u201caw shucks\u201d smile was back on his handsome face. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, darlin\u2019. Just a small difference of opinion. Put it out of your mind.\u201d She looked over at the hole in the wall.</p><p>He flushed again. \u201cI\u2019ll have that fixed.\u201d</p><p>The outer doors crashed open, and Slade rushed in. He was one disheveled hunk of male hotness. His dress shirt hung together by one small button at the hips. The rest fell open, exposing his hard pectorals and giving her a breathtaking glimpse of his ridged abdomen. She damn near swallowed her tongue. His inky hair sat slightly askew. And he looked rattled.</p><p>Hannah managed to smile without panting. \u201cYou are going to be a big hit in the board meeting.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his clothes as though it was the first time he\u2019d given it a thought. \u201cI was in a hurry. Hannah, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the phone, knowing exactly what he needed. This wasn\u2019t her first rodeo, as the folks back in Two Trees liked to say. \u201cWendy, you have a code blue.\u201d Wendy, Slade\u2019s admin, sighed. \u201cWhich part do I need to replace? Tie? Socks? That man is constantly wearing athletic socks with his dress shoes.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked Slade up and down. He knew the drill, turning in a circle for her inspection.</p><p>\u201cNope, Wendy. This is a head-to-toe fixer-upper.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone just as Slade got a look at her wall. He stared at it a moment before glaring at Dex.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Please tell me that wasn\u2019t Gavin\u2019s head. Where\u2019s his body? Do I need to call 911?\u201d Slade asked the questions with a sarcastic edge, but Hannah heard his concern.</p><p>Dex simply shook his head. \u201cNo trouble at all. I\u2019m going to call maintenance and get them up here to fix this. Then I have a few things to do. I think I\u2019ll skip the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t skip the board meeting.\u201d</p><p>Dex shrugged as he moved toward the door. \u201cWatch me. I have more important things to do.</p><p>And Hannah, you\u2019re having lunch today with me and Slade.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her calendar. \u201cI can\u2019t. I agreed to have lunch with Scott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Scott?\u201d Slade demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe works with the IT teams. He said it was important,\u201d Hannah explained. \u201cI\u2019m sure it has something to do with those installs I\u2019ve been helping to coordinate.\u201d Both men went very still.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not meeting Scott anymore. You\u2019re having lunch with us, and we\u2019re going to have a long talk, the three of us.\u201d Dex\u2019s dark eyes held hers for a moment. He was so serious that her heart started racing. When his voice got deep and dark, it made her blood pound.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Slade crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. She hadn\u2019t sounded that breathy, had she?</p><p>Dex walked out, the doors slamming behind him. Slade shook his head. Even disheveled, he was a gorgeous sight. With thick, dark hair and a face that looked like Michelangelo sculpted it, Slade always made her sigh.</p><p>Gavin opened his door and stepped out. He radiated power. Unlike Slade and Dex, there was nothing less than perfect about his appearance. No suit would ever dare to wrinkle while Gavin James wore it.</p><p>He nodded grimly at her. \u201cGood morning, Hannah. I need to talk to Slade, but I would like you to stay close to your desk this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It was an odd request, but one she could handle.</p><p>Slade disappeared into his brother\u2019s office. Gavin closed the door, watching her intently until it shut between them with an ominous thud.</p><p>And then Hannah was alone.</p><p>She reached into her purse and pulled out the number for the private investigator she\u2019d hired two days before. He\u2019d cashed her check but hadn\u2019t returned her calls. Maybe it was time to admit that hiring someone named Vinny who worked out of the back of a tarot reader\u2019s shop hadn\u2019t been the greatest idea. When he didn\u2019t answer, she left another message while e-mailing Scott to cancel lunch. After that, she called the local animal shelters to check if they\u2019d found Mr.</p><p>Snuggles. Her cat had been gone for days, and Hannah was beginning to fear that she was gone forever.</p><p>Her eyes teared up. She was going to have to take action and soon. She felt alone now that her three men were gone. It was a long time until her lunch with Dex and Slade. The office seemed big and empty. She wanted so much to call them back and tell them her trouble.</p><p>But why tell the busy men she loved\u2014who couldn\u2019t possibly love her in return\u2014that someone was trying to kill her?</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Slade\u2019s blood pressure rose as he looked down at the photographs in front of him. From listening to Dex and Gavin on the phone, he\u2019d figured out that someone was stalking Hannah, but seeing the sick evidence in front of him was staggering.</p><p>Gavin walked around his desk and sank into the huge wingback chair their father had sat in for forty years. Slade would have burned the big reminder of the son of a bitch, but Gavin had kept it, even after he\u2019d completely redecorated the office.</p><p>\u201cThey were addressed directly to Hannah,\u201d Gavin said, his voice clipped. \u201cNo return address.</p><p>No postage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this asshole brought the envelope into the building? It has to be an employee. No one can get past reception without a keycard.\u201d</p><p>Gavin went pale. Then he flushed with fury. \u201cGoddamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked through the security tapes?\u201d Slade picked up a photo of Hannah lying on her stomach across her bed, a book in her hand. He couldn\u2019t make out the cover, but he\u2019d bet it was a romance. She always had one in her bag. And every copy was battered and dog-eared as though it had been through many a hand before hers. For her birthday, he and Dex had bought her a new eBook reader and loaded it with credit. The look of delight in her eyes had done strange things to his heart.</p><p>Now, someone was watching her. Stalking her. And from the messages on the back of several photos, the creep knew how he and Dex felt about her. And, Slade suspected, Gavin too.</p><p>This threat seemed so surreal, but the proof was staring him in the face. Someone wanted to hurt Hannah.</p><p>Gavin frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t have cameras outside my office doors. Maybe I should have listened to Dex about that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s is in the mailroom now, interrogating the employees.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI think I should call in an outside firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between you two? He put his fist through a wall.\u201d Slade\u2019s stomach was turning at the idea of some asshole harassing Hannah, but he had to deal with his brothers\u2019</p><p>problems, too. Gavin would only be talking about calling in an outside security firm if things had gone terribly wrong between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Gavin looked down, a sure sign that he was ashamed of something.</p><p>\u201cHow about I uncomplicate it for you? You took one look at these photographs and blamed Dex. Because he wants her badly, you leapt to the stupid conclusion that he was desperate or impulsive enough to become a peeping Tom. And his only choice was to call bullshit and walk out. Simple enough?\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s gun metal gray eyes flashed back up, but there was a weariness to them that had Slade backing off. \u201cAlmost spot on. I thought Dex was using the photos to tempt me into joining the two of you in seducing Hannah. I know you want that, Slade. I can\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t. Dex took offense to my mistake, and now he says he\u2019s quitting as soon as she\u2019s out of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dex leaving is all right with you?\u201d Slade wasn\u2019t sure he wanted the answer to that question, but he had to ask.</p><p>Gavin clenched his fists. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Damn it, Slade, he\u2019s my brother, too. I have no intention of letting him walk out because of a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was listening in, Gavin. Dex didn\u2019t misunderstand. You flat out blamed him.\u201d Gavin sat back, raking his hand through his thick, chocolate-brown hair. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll rephrase.</p><p>I have no intention of losing my brother because I was an asshole. Nor do I intend to allow someone to stalk my admin.\u201d</p><p>Slade bit back a smile. Despite the horrors of the morning, he sensed a little progress. Gavin had admitted that he didn\u2019t want to lose Dex. He was still calling Hannah his admin, but that would change, if Slade had his way. \u201cHave you talked to Hannah yet?\u201d Slade wasn\u2019t looking forward to the conversation. Hannah was going to be terrified when she found out about these pictures. He stacked them, pulling out the least salacious one. They would have to show her so she grasped how serious this was, but he didn\u2019t want to embarrass her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet. I wanted to talk to you first. We\u2019ll do our due diligence and call the police to report the threat, but there\u2019s not much they can do unless this bastard has actually committed a crime.</p><p>They\u2019ll tell her to lock her doors and buy a dog.\u201d</p><p>Slade shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a cat person. I\u2019m sure Mr. Snuggles will be hell on intruders.</p><p>She\u2019ll purr them to death.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin frowned. \u201cMr. Snuggles is a she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah was fifteen when she got her,\u201d Slade couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cApparently, she didn\u2019t think to look for boy or girl parts. The name stuck.\u201d Gavin threw his head back and laughed. The rich, deep sound filled the room and made Slade realize just how much he\u2019d missed his older brother\u2019s laughter. It had been so damn long since he\u2019d heard it.</p><p>Gavin had tears of mirth in his eyes when he came up for air. \u201cShe has a transvestite cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says Mr. Snuggles is just gender confused.\u201d Hannah loved that damn cat. Slade knew he was going to have to learn to love the little furball, too.</p><p>\u201cSuch a silly, sweet girl,\u201d Gavin said, his gaze straying to the photos.</p> <p>There it was, that smile\u2014with a healthy hint of lust\u2014that told Slade everything he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cWe have to protect her,\u201d Slade pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI have a plan, and I hope you\u2019ll back me on it. It should keep Hannah safe and bring Dex back into the fold.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing Slade wanted more than that. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Gavin hesitated. \u201cYou heard Dex say that he would take Hannah with him when he left, Slade. I know how you feel about her. Maybe you need to talk to him. I don\u2019t want Hannah coming between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Slade\u2019s cock got hard. An image of Hannah between him and Dex assaulted his brain. She would be so small sandwiched by their bigger bodies. They would have to be careful, but they would get inside her, so deep that she wouldn\u2019t know where they ended and she began.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s going to be between us.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin flushed slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair to Hannah. She\u2019s not some club bunny for the two of you to fuck and forget.\u201d</p><p>Slade wasn\u2019t going to take this crap from his brother. He would never play games with Hannah. He\u2019d known from the moment he\u2019d seen her that she was different. \u201cDex and I love Hannah. We\u2019re not going to forget her; we\u2019re going to build a life with her. This isn\u2019t some one-night stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you both insane? No one will accept that kind of relationship here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to live my life by some societal dictate. And they will accept us. I have a billion-dollar trust fund. Let them talk all they like, but money opens doors. What would be unacceptable for a normal person is merely a quirk for the superrich.\u201d It was a harsh reality.</p><p>Slade and Dex had talked this out, hashing out plans over months to get what they wanted and protect Hannah from nasty gossip at the same time. Now if Gavin would just get with the program, their lives could begin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an argument for another time,\u201d Gavin conceded. \u201cNow, we have to figure out what to do with Hannah. I was thinking that, perhaps, she needs a small vacation.\u201d Slade frowned. \u201cThere is no fucking way I\u2019m letting her run off by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But maybe Alaska would be a good place for her now. You did say you have to go see to some trouble there. River Run is isolated, and we own the whole damn town. All three of us can take Hannah and hide out while the security team figures this out.\u201d It took all Slade had not to fist pump in victory. \u201cPerfect. When do we leave?\u201d Gavin sat back in his chair. \u201cToday. But I want to be clear. I\u2019m only going to work things out with Dex. I\u2019ll help with Hannah, if the need arises. But that\u2019s it.\u201d Slade wasn\u2019t fooled. His older brother could lie to himself, but Slade knew the truth. Gavin could more easily monitor the situation from Dallas. Since Slade had always been the go-between for Gavin and Dex, it seemed obvious that Gavin was coming along because he wanted to repair the relationship with Dex...and because he couldn\u2019t stand to let his two younger brothers have Hannah all to themselves.</p><p>Slade contained his excitement\u2014barely. \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll make the arrangements. Then we can talk to Hannah.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin nodded as though happy with the decision. \u201cExcellent. We\u2019ll have to convince her to go, you know.\u201d</p><p>Slade would have to convince her of more than just an impromptu trip to Alaska. He was going to have to persuade her\u2014and everyone else\u2014that this m\u00e9nage relationship could work. To do that, he had to restore peace between Dex and Gavin. Then he had to talk Gavin into sharing Hannah with them. Hell, he also had to convince Hannah that taking on three passionate, dominant men would be a dandy idea.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Gavin.\u201d Slade sounded way more confident than he felt.</p><p>But as he walked out of Gavin\u2019s office to start planning, he vowed to make it work.</p><p>Dex parked his Harley about a block away from Hannah\u2019s apartment and started walking.</p><p>His cell trilled, and he pulled it out of his pocket. Slade. Probably wanting to talk about Gavin.</p><p>Dex growled. He thought about ignoring it, but did what he always did when it came to Slade.</p><p>He gave in.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean Dex had to be nice about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose I should be happy you\u2019re using words and not just grunting.\u201d Dex had no comeback for that. Grunting was a perfectly acceptable form of communication in his book. It got the job done. So did growling, snorting, and just flat planting his fist in another guy\u2019s face. When he found whoever was stalking Hannah, he didn\u2019t intend to give the fucker a nice long lecture.</p><p>Slade\u2019s sigh came across loud and clear. \u201cDamn it, Dex. Where are you? You have to set aside this crap with Gavin and get your ass back to the office. Hannah\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Dex practically yelled into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to her place. I want to see if I can figure out where the jerk has been hiding when he does his stalkarazzi thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that will give us some clues about his identity. That\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s what I do for a living.\u201d</p><p>When would his older brothers finally understand that he was damn good at his job?</p><p>Dex looked up and down the cracked sidewalks of Hannah\u2019s neighborhood. It was old, with a ton of mature trees, but he\u2019d never liked her living here. Hannah\u2019s apartment was in a rundown fourplex. The paint was peeling, and one of her screens was propped against the side of the building. He\u2019d bet it was the one to her bedroom window, and that fucker had taken it off. Had Hannah not noticed? The nearby tree would be a great place for this scumbag to hide and snap pictures. But what the hell was Hannah doing lying around her bedroom with the shades wide open?</p><p>\u201cLook, you do your thing, but be back at the office by one. We\u2019re going to take Hannah to Alaska with us.\u201d</p><p>Dex stopped. \u201cWe are? Hannah wants to go to Alaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Slade admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk her into it. We\u2019ll say it\u2019s a business trip.</p><p>But we can keep her safe there until the police figure this shit out and nail this guy. I really do have to go up there. I\u2019m the head engineer. I\u2019ll convince her that she needs to take notes or something.\u201d</p><p>Dex knew he should stay here. He should be the one running the investigation. Damn, it meant Slade would probably sleep with Hannah. There was no way his brother would have such close access to Hannah and not claim her now that they\u2019d decided she was theirs. But he trusted Slade. \u201cTake care of our girl. You explain that I love her, too, but I need to find the bastard who\u2019s stalking her.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s safety was more important than his dick, though his dick was protesting mightily.</p><p>Dex walked up the stairs to Hannah\u2019s apartment. They wobbled under him. Ratty old place. It reminded him of his last foster home. The house had been falling down around them, but his foster father spent every dime on beer, cigarettes, and the lotto.</p><p>He was going to get Hannah out of here. She didn\u2019t know it yet, but she wasn\u2019t coming back to this dive. She would come home with him and Slade. Dex refused to accept any other outcome.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to Alaska with us,\u201d Slade said. \u201cGavin is putting the Lenox brothers on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me off? Without even consulting me?\u201d Dex stopped right in front of Hannah\u2019s door, his heart sinking to his gut. He\u2019d been hoping Gavin would apologize. Dex wouldn\u2019t accept at first, of course, but eventually he would and agree to stay on as Black Oak\u2019s Head of Security.</p><p>The fact that Gavin had actually removed him was a blow he hadn\u2019t been expecting\u2014and it was more painful than he\u2019d imagined. It might have been better for all concerned if Gavin and Slade hadn\u2019t come looking for him in that foster home.</p><p>Dex thought about that day often. He\u2019d been just about to age out of the foster system. He\u2019d had no place to go one day, then the next, he was moving into this huge mansion with the brothers he\u2019d never imagined he had. Starting over again was going to be hard, but he wasn\u2019t going to hang around to be Gavin\u2019s whipping boy.</p><p>There was a long huff from Slade\u2019s end of the phone. \u201cDude, you\u2019re just like him, you know?</p><p>Why does your brain always go to the worst possible place? Gavin wants you to come with us.</p><p>He set this whole thing up to include you. Come on, this is our shot with Hannah. We\u2019re going to talk to her about the pictures when we get to Alaska. We need to break this to her gently, then assure her that she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Dex pondered that. At least if he was close to her, he could protect her. Maybe he and Gavin could work things out, too. Burke and Cole Lenox would definitely track down this scumbag threatening Hannah. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go. And I\u2019ll pack Hannah some clothes so she doesn\u2019t have to come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you planning on doing that? Do you have a key to her place?\u201d Slade sounded miffed.</p><p>Dex tried the front door. It was locked, but just barely. He gave it a shove, and the door gave way. \u201cI don\u2019t think a gnat needs a key to get into Hannah\u2019s. No freaking security at all. I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Burke know he should watch her place and see if we can catch this guy. Do what you need and get your ass back here by one.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cThis is all going to work out.</p><p>I promise.\u201d</p><p>And that was Slade, always the optimist. Dex wasn\u2019t feeling so rosy. What if Hannah didn\u2019t want him? He\u2019d live with that. But damn it, she was going to get his protection. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and looked around her apartment. Hannah had never invited him in, and he was wretchedly curious. The place was neat and feminine with yellow curtains hanging in the small kitchen. There was a single coffee mug drying on a mat by the sink and a dish for her cat\u2019s food and water on the floor.</p><p>With zero remorse, he went through the mail she\u2019d stacked neatly on the counter, then pressed the button that started her answering machine.</p><p>Ms. Craig, this is Brenna from the South Side Animal Shelter. I\u2019m sorry, but your cat isn\u2019t here. I\u2019ll call if I find out anything.</p><p>Her cat was missing? Hannah loved that damn feline.</p><p>Hannah, it\u2019s Preston. Look, we need to talk. Why would you call HR in? It was one kiss. You were coming on to me, and we both know it. Let\u2019s work this out, just the two of us. What do you say, baby? Maybe over dinner?</p><p>Dex clenched his fists. Preston Ward III was fortyish, balding, married, and Black Oak\u2019s dickwad Chief Information Officer. Not a chance Hannah would voluntarily kiss that asshole. He must have forced it on her. Now Dex knew whose name to put at the top of the suspect list\u2014just before he broke the bastard\u2019s face. The machine beeped again and changed to a thin voice.</p><p>Hey, Hannah. I\u2014I was, uhm, calling to make sure we\u2019re still on for tonight. I have the part to fix your laptop. It\u2019ll only take an hour. So call me and let me know when I can head your way.</p><p>Dex had no idea who that asshole was, but a file folder on her tiny desk caught his attention.</p><p>He flipped it open, expecting to find some piece of work Gavin had given her, but his eyes turned stormy when he realized he was looking at a police report.</p><p>As he read it, his blood started to boil. Hannah wasn\u2019t going to be shocked by the photographs Gavin had found. She already knew someone was stalking her, and she hadn\u2019t bothered to mention that little fact to any of them. She\u2019d just smiled and pretended like she hadn\u2019t received threatening phone calls and letters for the last four fucking weeks.</p><p>She\u2019d called the police, who couldn\u2019t do a damn thing. But she hadn\u2019t asked him for help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew someone was after her, and she hadn\u2019t even installed new locks on her doors. What the hell was she thinking?</p><p>The Dom in Dex took firm control. He\u2019d been gentle with Hannah. He and Slade had intended to introduce her slowly to submission. But when she allowed herself to be in danger?</p><p>Slow was no longer an option. Hannah needed a firm hand now and was going to get a quick lesson in obeying her Masters.</p><p>He stomped into her bedroom and yanked a ragged suitcase from her closet. He tossed in a couple of pairs of jeans and shirts, a bathrobe, some socks, and a pair of sneakers. Dex pushed the bathroom door open and shoved her toiletries into the front pocket before striding back out.</p> <p>Her eBook reader was sitting on the nightstand. He grabbed it, then opened the top drawer of her dresser. There was a mass of pretty, frilly panties in every color imaginable. Dex shut that sucker fast, gritting his teeth. The one thing Hannah wasn\u2019t going to need for the foreseeable future was underwear. In fact, she\u2019d never need them again if he had his way.</p><p>He turned to leave, but paused when he heard a faint little whine. A single, small sound, like a baby sighing. Dex went to the window and opened it. There was that huge tree he\u2019d noticed earlier right outside her bedroom window. The mighty live oak that gave easy access to her window, just as he\u2019d suspected.</p><p>This was where the shitbag stalking Hannah sat. The branches were thick and would easily hold a man\u2019s weight. The foliage was dense. A stalker could hide here, and she wouldn\u2019t know.</p><p>The thought made Dex violent.</p><p>Rawwwwr.</p> <p>Dex dropped the suitcase as he caught a glimpse of orange fur. Mr. Snuggles. Damn.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s cat was stuck in the tree. Dex opened the window and leaned out, searching for the cat\u2019s hiding place. He found her clinging to a high branch. Dex sighed as he realized her fur was covered in blood.</p><p>Maybe Mr. Snuggles had gotten into a cat fight, which would be perfectly normal. But upon closer inspection, Dex didn\u2019t think so. Someone had tried to hurt the cat, and now she was clinging to life. And probably very terrified.</p><p>Dex sighed. He wished he hadn\u2019t taken off his suit coat.</p><p>He reached out for the nearest branch and hauled himself up. The cat hissed, but he moved in anyway.</p><p>Damn, the things he did for love.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Gavin was surprised at just how nervous he was when Hannah walked into his office, notepad in hand. She didn\u2019t dress like an executive secretary. Ms. Rogers, his former assistant, had never worn her dark hair in anything less than a professional twist or bun. Her perfectly tailored business suits had shown off her trim figure, which she\u2019d probably spent most of her off time honing. She would have been at home on the cover of a magazine. He could have kept ice frozen on her ass, too.</p><p>By comparison, Hannah wore a too-big skirt that couldn\u2019t conceal the erotic flare of her hips and a shapeless blouse that hid even less. Hannah had gorgeous breasts. She wore very little makeup, and her honey blonde hair fell in pretty, loose curls. She was lovely, but never flashy.</p><p>Why did his damn heart pound when she walked in the room?</p><p>\u201cHi, Slade. Mr. James. You wanted to see me?\u201d Hannah asked with her sweet West Texas twang.</p><p>Thankfully, Slade could at least say words when Hannah was around since Gavin felt incapable at the moment. Slade rushed from his seat to show Hannah to hers. Naturally, it was right next to Slade\u2019s, so close their knees would almost touch, and Gavin was stuck behind his mammoth desk. Alone.</p><p>It was where he belonged, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, love,\u201d Slade said with a smile.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t seem to mind the endearment. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at Slade. Gavin forced himself not to move. Every instinct told him to get out from behind the damn desk and join them. Hell, he could pick Hannah up and settle her on his lap, and they could conduct this little meeting with his cock pressed against her ass. Maybe then she would start calling him Gavin. Although having her call him Mr. James in that so-sweet Southern way of hers as he rammed his cock up her pussy would be a turn-on, too.</p><p>Fuck. He had way more in common with his brothers than he would ever admit. Shifting in his seat because his cock was at full mast, he settled for what he hoped looked like paternal concern. \u201cHannah, we need to talk about something.\u201d</p><p>Her spine straightened, and she held her pen at the ready. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Sir. That would be a good thing for her to call him as he forced her down on his cock. Or she could call him nothing at all, unable to talk because she was so overcome with pleasure.</p><p>Or she could be silent because she killed herself after you neglected her. Yeah, that\u2019s more realistic.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Mr. James?\u201d Hannah sat forward, her eyes wide with worry.</p><p>Gavin forced the thoughts from his head. He wasn\u2019t going to act on them. Hannah deserved far better than him. He briefly considered staying behind. Slade and Dex could handle her in Alaska. But if Dex left with Slade now, Gavin knew the chance that he\u2019d ever repair the relationship with his brother would be slim. Damn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Hannah. But I do have a problem you can help with.\u201d Her smile practically lit up the room. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Slade took over, his eyes bright with affection as he looked at Hannah. \u201cWe need you to come with us on a little business trip and play our girl Friday.\u201d She put the notepad down and turned to Slade, delight plain on her face. She really did have a connection to Slade. Though they weren\u2019t touching, Gavin couldn\u2019t miss the attraction that connected them like an invisible thread. \u201cAre we going to Houston? I\u2019ve never been.\u201d They had an office in Houston, near their refinery. It was a good bet that if they were going on a trip, it would be there. But that wasn\u2019t far enough away from Dallas and Hannah\u2019s stalker for Gavin\u2019s peace of mind. \u201cNo. We\u2019re going to our facility in River Run.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cAlaska?\u201d</p><p>Slade was on the edge of his seat. \u201cYes. It\u2019s beautiful, Hannah. We have a house there with plenty of rooms. The view is incredible. I have to do some work up there, but I think we can find the time to show you around.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. \u201cHow long would we be gone?\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s gaze found Gavin\u2019s. They hadn\u2019t actually discussed that. In the hours since finding the photos, they\u2019d made a lot of plans. They had canceled the board meeting. They had called private investigators Burke and Cole Lenox. The former Navy SEALs were already talking to Black Oak security about getting the keycard logs and security footage for the last twenty-four hours. Slade had made the arrangements to open the house in River Run and had the corporate jet fueled. Not once had they discussed how long they\u2019d be gone. There had been an unspoken agreement that they would be gone for as long as it took.</p><p>\u201cA few days,\u201d Gavin said with the smooth tones of a man who knew how to massage the truth. \u201cYou should be home on Sunday night at the latest.\u201d</p><p>Once they had her in Alaska and Burke had useful information, they could admit to Hannah why they\u2019d really spirited her away. Until then, he didn\u2019t want her to worry.</p><p>She shook her head, blonde hair swinging. \u201cI am so sorry. I can\u2019t be gone that long. I have a bunch of obligations. I\u2019m supposed to have someone over this evening. My laptop is giving me hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have IT give you a new one.\u201d Gavin could solve that problem easily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a new one. I\u2019m used to this one. Lyle said he can fix it, but he\u2019s only free tonight. And I\u2019m supposed to go home this weekend to see my grandma. I\u2019ll tell Wendy to get ready. She would love to go.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t like to think about Hannah driving all the way to West Texas in her beat-up Chevy. That car was on its last leg, and most of the road between Dallas and Two Trees consisted of mile after mile of nothing. If she broke down\u2014and the way her car sputtered, that was almost a given\u2014she would be all alone. And it would be easy for her stalker to follow her and possibly drive her off the road.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s blood pressure rose with each potential hazard he imagined.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need Wendy,\u201d Slade insisted. \u201cWe need you.\u201d</p><p>She shook that off with a wave of her hand. \u201cTrust me, Wendy has ten years\u2019 seniority on me. She\u2019ll be great. And she loves to travel. I\u2019ll give her a call. How long does she have before the plane leaves? She\u2019ll want to pack a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah.\u201d Gavin tried to hold his temper in check. \u201cThe plane leaves in less than an hour.</p><p>We\u2019ve already placed your name on the passenger list with the FAA. And don\u2019t worry about packing a bag. We\u2019ve taken care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s hand came out to cover hers. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine. Your grandmother will understand. You can call her when we get there.\u201d</p><p>Hannah pulled back. \u201cI can\u2019t just up and leave.\u201d</p><p>Gavin forced a placid smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right. Let\u2019s talk about your other responsibilities, and we\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re handled.\u201d</p><p>The door to his office came open with a crash. Gavin looked up, ready to yell at the intruder.</p><p>\u201cDex?\u201d Slade stood, staring with his mouth open. \u201cDude, what the hell happened to you?\u201d Dex was carrying a battered pink suitcase, but that was the most normal thing about him. His dress shirt was shredded and his arms covered in scratches, as though he\u2019d gotten into a fight with a chipper-shredder and taken the worst end of it.</p><p>Hannah stood, and her notepad fell to the floor. \u201cOh, my...Dex, you\u2019re hurt! We need to clean you up. Do you need to go to a hospital?\u201d She frowned. \u201cIs that my suitcase?\u201d Dex set the luggage down and turned to Hannah, his dark eyes laser-focused on his target.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a mental hospital, darlin\u2019. As for the damages, well, let\u2019s say I got into a little tussle with your pussy. I discovered that it has claws, rather like her owner. But I won\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found my cat?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice was a hopeful whisper.</p><p>\u201cFound, fought with, and saved,\u201d Dex confirmed. \u201cShe\u2019s at the vet being taken care of. Now it\u2019s time for round two.\u201d</p><p>Dex strode up to Hannah and didn\u2019t hesitate. He bent and shoved his shoulder in her midsection, his bulky arm curling behind her knees. She was over his shoulder in an instant. Her blonde head came up, and she looked at Gavin.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t company protocol, Mr. James.\u201d She said it so primly. Gavin would have laughed if he wasn\u2019t so perplexed by his youngest brother\u2019s behavior.</p><p>Dex turned around so all Gavin could see were her perfectly shaped calves and a backside to die for. \u201cIf you two are done pussyfooting around, I believe we have a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter Townsend, you need to put me down right this instant! I am not going to Alaska.\u201d Dex\u2019s free hand came out and slapped that perfect backside. The short smack resounded through the room right before Hannah\u2019s outraged yelp drowned it out. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be called Dexter, darlin\u2019. And you are definitely going to Alaska. Is the car here yet?\u201d Gavin wasn\u2019t sure if he should punch his youngest brother or congratulate him for doing what he and Slade had seemed incapable of. \u201cDex, you better set her down. You\u2019re going to scare her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? Really? Why don\u2019t you look at the folder in the side pocket of her suitcase and tell me if she seems afraid enough. We\u2019ll be out in the car. And Hannah, if you give me any trouble, I swear, I will tie you up and leave you bound until we get to Alaska.\u201d Gavin walked to the suitcase and pulled out the manila file folder. Hannah\u2019s head came up, and she looked to Slade for help.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop him. I can\u2019t go, and Dex\u2019s caveman ways aren\u2019t going to change that. Now you tell your Neanderthal brother to let me down this instant or I am going to scream until the cops come.\u201d</p><p>Slade merely looked to Dex. \u201cWe should gag her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jerks!\u201d Hannah tried to kick, but Dex merely tightened his arm around her legs. \u201cYou let me down.\u201d</p><p>She was still yelling as Dex walked out the door, Slade following behind. Gavin thought seriously about taking off after them and forcing Dex to let her go. They couldn\u2019t just kidnap her.</p><p>She could call the police.</p><p>Then he opened the folder and realized that Hannah had already called the police. Several times. His hands tightened as he read the incident reports. Hannah had known about her problem for over a month. And she\u2019d never said a word.</p><p>Gavin closed the folder. He picked up the phone and quickly advised his private investigators. They would get all the reports and follow up on their end. Gavin picked up Hannah\u2019s sad little suitcase. His own luggage had already been delivered to the airport.</p><p>He walked out of his office with a new sense of purpose. If Hannah didn\u2019t have the sense to protect herself, she\u2019d just found three men who did. Gavin checked his apprehensions at his office door. He could handle this. He might not be good for Hannah, but maybe his brothers were. It would be an odd relationship, but he loved all three of them. He wanted them to be happy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, wait. He didn\u2019t love Hannah. He couldn\u2019t. She was going to be like a sister. That was all.</p><p>He would get over this raging desire to have her underneath him.</p><p>He could hear her screaming as he walked toward reception.</p><p>Slade was right. She needed a gag.</p> <p>Hannah took a deep breath as the airplane finally leveled out.</p><p>Slade released his seat belt and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a drink.\u201d He walked down the aisle and opened a small door, revealing a surprising amount of liquor.</p><p>He poured a couple of inches worth of scotch into three crystal glasses and passed them to his brothers.</p><p>They offered Hannah nothing. Bastards. She wouldn\u2019t curse anywhere but in her own head.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t ladylike, her grandmother had taught her. But deep inside, she was using all kinds of four-letter words to describe the three men who had kidnapped her. Jerks. No, kinky jerks. She\u2019d known that since the minute Dex forced her into the limo and opened his own small suitcase to reveal a rubber ball with ties. He\u2019d threatened to gag her with it, and she\u2019d since refused to speak.</p> <p>Besides a ball gag, what else had the big cowboy packed? Probably some rope. She looked between Slade and Dex. She\u2019d heard the rumors. They liked to share the same woman, and they frequented several exotic clubs like the ones in those books on her eBook reader.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t taking her needs into consideration. So she wasn\u2019t going to fantasize about them tying her up and having their rough and ruthless way with her.</p><p>God, what was she thinking? They would laugh their asses off if they knew how often she thought about the three of them. They would laugh even harder if they found out she was a twenty-five-year-old virgin.</p><p>\u201cYou read the file?\u201d Dex asked as Slade passed him his drink.</p><p>Slade\u2019s face went hard as he looked her way. That wasn\u2019t good. Slade was the happy brother.</p><p>Gavin was the brooder, and Dex the bruiser. Slade almost always had a smile for her. Now he scowled as he pinned her with his deep blue eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI read it. Are we in agreement about how to handle this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the kid gloves are off,\u201d Dex said enigmatically.</p><p>\u201cI think you burned the kid gloves when you hauled her out of the building kicking and screaming,\u201d Gavin said drolly. He took a long swallow of his scotch. \u201cThat poor IT guy just about fainted when you shoved past him.\u201d</p><p>Dex gnashed his teeth. \u201cWas that the fucker who offered to fix your computer?\u201d She itched to give them the cold shoulder, but clearly none of them would accept that.</p><p>Something had changed. Her men were on edge, and her self-preservation kicked in. She folded her hands in her lap. She wished Lyle hadn\u2019t witnessed her abduction. What must he be thinking?</p><p>\u201cYes. Lyle is the head of the help desk. He\u2019d graciously agreed to come to my house tonight to fix my laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracious isn\u2019t the word I would use,\u201d Slade said under his breath.</p><p>Her little laptop was currently in its bag, sitting on top of her suitcase in the overhead bin.</p> <p>How had Dex gotten her things? And how had he known Lyle was fixing her computer?</p><p>\u201cYou broke into my house.\u201d It was the only explanation. Lyle had left her a message on her machine this morning. She hadn\u2019t gotten back to him, and now it looked like she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He shrugged his big shoulders negligently. \u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t hard. You don\u2019t even have a damn deadbolt.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never really needed one and hadn\u2019t thought about it until about a month ago. \u201cWell, now that I know you\u2019re willing to just barge in, I will certainly buy two or three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Dex said with a nasty smile. \u201cYou won\u2019t be going back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d What the hell was going on?</p><p>Slade turned to her. \u201cBesides, if Dex hadn\u2019t broken in, he wouldn\u2019t have found your cat.\u201d She softened. Her normally sweet cat must have gone through hell because she\u2019d obviously taken a few swipes at her rescuer. \u201cI really do appreciate that. Though, I would have liked to have seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vet said she was going to be fine,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cDo you have any idea who would want to hurt your cat? She had a knife wound in her gut.\u201d</p><p>She gasped in shock. Tears followed. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>All three men growled. Hannah shrank back in her seat. Gavin held up the folder she kept by her phone, the one in which she had been storing all her evidence. She winced.</p><p>Dex leaned forward. \u201cYou want to amend that statement, darlin\u2019? Because I\u2019m done playing around, and the next lie that comes out of your mouth is going to earn you some punishment.\u201d Punishment? \u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that, Mr. Townsend.\u201d Liar. She liked it way too much. She was pretty sure everyone in the Boeing could hear her heart pound. \u201cAnd it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>She had to put this on a proper footing. She couldn\u2019t let these men intimidate her. They were her bosses\u2014or had been. She couldn\u2019t go back to work for them now, not after they had kidnapped her. Right? Her grandma\u2019s etiquette lessons hadn\u2019t covered this situation.</p><p>Dex stood up, but Slade held a hand out. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get the full story before we start in on her?\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked between the two of them, an oddly indulgent look on his face. \u201cYou really were born far too late, Dex. Genghis Khan could have used you.\u201d Dex eased back into his seat. If the comment bothered him, he didn\u2019t show it. He simply grunted and nodded toward Slade, who turned to her, arms crossed over his wide chest. He reminded her of a prosecuting attorney about to slice and dice an opponent.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known someone was stalking you, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>The silky slide of his voice didn\u2019t fool her. He was pissed off. Maybe it was time to come clean. \u201cAbout a month.\u201d</p><p>All three men huffed.</p><p>\u201cTell us.\u201d Gavin didn\u2019t ask. He simply commanded.</p><p>What would it hurt now? Her secret was out, and maybe they could help. Though she wouldn\u2019t admit it, it felt like a huge weight had just lifted off her shoulders. \u201cIt was phone calls at first. I would answer but no one was there, just a lot of breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaller ID?\u201d Dex asked.</p><p>\u201cIt showed up as unavailable. He called my home phone, not my cell.\u201d Hannah remembered being annoyed at first. She\u2019d stopped answering the phone. \u201cThen, after a week or so, he left a message, but in a weird voice.\u201d</p><p>Slade sat back in his chair, his hand going to the folder, fingers tapping against it.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the police report, he used a computer-simulated voice. Burke should be able to get a copy.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took a deep breath and forced herself to go on. \u201cThen I changed my number and made it unlisted. He called me again two days later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Dex cursed. \u201cHe must work for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Slade nodded sharply.</p><p>Really? She couldn\u2019t imagine which fellow employee would go to this much trouble to scare her.</p><p>\u201cHannah sent HR a notification when she changed her number. Besides the three of us, HR</p><p>was the only one with a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s likely someone with access to the HR files. We should have known something was going on when she changed her number.\u201d Slade cursed under his breath.</p><p>Dex nodded, then turned back to her. \u201cHow many friends have your new number?\u201d She didn\u2019t have a horde of friends, but she did have a few good ones. \u201cUhm, I told Wendy and Heather. Oh, and a couple of people from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need you to write them all down,\u201d Gavin said.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Hannah replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Preston Ward, our CIO? You gave him your number after he kissed you?\u201d Dex arched a brow at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Slade stood, staring, his expression thunderous. \u201cHe what?\u201d Hannah flushed. \u201cI\u2019ve handled that. And no, I didn\u2019t. He must have gotten it from HR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me he\u2019d come on to you?\u201d Gavin demanded, looking none too pleased.</p><p>She looked at her boss\u2014former boss\u2014trying to understand the reason for this third degree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the CEO. You don\u2019t have time for my troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Gavin snarled.</p><p>Slade\u2019s mouth flattened into a thin line that Hannah couldn\u2019t help but think boded ill for her.</p><p>Dex speared her with another stare. \u201cWhat else haven\u2019t you told us?\u201d She confessed the rest. It was like ripping off a Band-Aid. Once she started, she just wanted to get it over with. She explained that this crazy man had somehow gotten her IM address and had started sending her long notes on her laptop about how beautiful she was and how much he wanted her. He\u2019d called one night in a rage threatening to hurt her because she\u2019d come home late. He\u2019d asked if she\u2019d been out with those perverted brothers.</p><p>\u201cI think he meant you and Slade,\u201d she said, biting her lower lip. Gosh, she didn\u2019t want to offend them. \u201cHe obviously doesn\u2019t understand that we just work together.\u201d Slade frowned. \u201cI think he understands all too well.\u201d</p><p>Hannah frowned. What did he mean by that?</p><p>She pressed on. \u201cThen Mr. Snuggles went missing, and I called the police again, but they said they couldn\u2019t do anything since cats run off all the time.\u201d Dex pinned her with his steely gaze, making her feel like a bug he was about to dissect. \u201cYes, the cops can do very little in a situation like this, which begs one question: Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your problem. Y\u2019all are very kind to me. It seemed like a crappy thing to pay back your kindness by pulling you into this mess.\u201d Hannah didn\u2019t mention that she desperately wanted them to see her as a capable woman, not a burden. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t just call the police. I hired a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>She waited for praise. They would see that she had this handled and they would lighten up.</p><p>Instead, they just stared at her. She tried not to but she squirmed in her seat.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Vinny. He came with great references.\u201d The psychic whose shop he worked out of had thrown in a free tarot reading.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with mine,\u201d Gavin drawled. \u201cBut Hannah, a private investigator isn\u2019t protection. You could be assaulted while your private investigator is digging into this.\u201d Hannah reached for her purse, because she had an answer for that, too. Her hand met with cold metal, and she pulled out her brand new pistol. \u201cThat\u2019s why I bought this. See? I\u2019m prepared.\u201d</p><p>Gavin turned a shade of white Hannah was certain no living human should ever be. Slade gasped, but Dex was on his feet in an instant, prying the gun away from her.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Hannah, the safety isn\u2019t even on. You could kill yourself with this fucking gun.</p><p>What were you thinking?\u201d Dex\u2019s voice resounded through the plane.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was surprised that I managed to get through security.\u201d Thank goodness security in a private airfield was very different than a commercial airport. They had just driven up to the plane. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know about the safety. Maybe I should have read the manual.\u201d She noticed that Slade\u2019s eyebrow was twitching slightly. \u201cAre you okay, Slade? See. This is why I didn\u2019t want to bring you all into this. It\u2019s very stressful. But I have it handled. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p>Slade closed his eyes. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not worried that the stalker is going to get you, honey.</p><p>I\u2019m worried about what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he reached across the aisle and pulled her over his knee. She gasped as her stomach hit his lap. \u201cSlade, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m regaining my sanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about damn time, brother,\u201d Dex said.</p><p>She forced her head up to look at Dex and Gavin. Both men stared at her, but neither moved a muscle to help.</p><p>\u201cDo something!\u201d she demanded of Gavin. She knew Dex would be no help.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to,\u201d he assured, leaning forward to brace his elbows on his knees. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took a deep breath. Nothing would ever be the same again.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Slade\u2019s big hand slid up Hannah\u2019s calf. Shock ricocheted through her body. Tingles skittered across her skin. She fought not to shiver as his palm worked up, up, up her leg in a slow slide.</p><p>\u201cSlade.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cWhat are you doing? We should talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for talking is past, baby.\u201d Slade\u2019s voice sounded hoarse, utterly unlike the sunny man she knew. This man had purpose, and it wasn\u2019t to make her laugh.</p><p>Dex was on his knees before her. He gently threaded his fingers through her hair and pulled, lifting her head until she caught his eyes. \u201cYou gave up the right to talk, darlin\u2019, when you didn\u2019t tell us that someone is trying to hurt you. So now we\u2019re going to go over the rules. Rule number one, you never hide anything from us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rules? Hannah might have thought they meant rules of employment...but with Slade\u2019s hand making its way up her thigh, she didn\u2019t think that was the case. What was he planning to do?</p><p>She was so damned confused. Tears welled in her eyes. One minute they were her friends.</p><p>The next, they thrust her over their lap, touched her in the most deliciously inappropriate way, and started talking about rules. If this was a joke, she wasn\u2019t laughing. She certainly didn\u2019t want to be the butt of it.</p><p>\u201cSlade, let me up.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s voice broke through her panic. \u201cSlade, release her. She asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the way this works. You don\u2019t understand, Gavin. Unless you\u2019re willing to rethink your position, stay out of this.\u201d Slade\u2019s hand was right under the cheek of her ass now, caressing her, lighting up her skin. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go, Hannah. We meant to do this slowly, but that\u2019s no longer an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cTeach you to submit.\u201d Slade\u2019s voice was husky as he bent to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cTo us. Open your eyes, darlin\u2019.\u201d The deep drawl she knew well wound through Dex\u2019s words, but there was an underlying note of command she\u2019d never heard him use before.</p><p>Shivering, Hannah did. She couldn\u2019t ignore that voice. But when she looked into Dex\u2019s dark eyes, the gravity there terrified her.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to me. I\u2019m not like the other girls. I have...feelings for you. I couldn\u2019t handle being your plaything.\u201d Her breath hitched, and she tried to control her tears.</p><p>Hannah had stupidly fallen in love with the three of them, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve. They never kept a lover for long. If she gave into her desires, she would have a few days of sex-soaked bliss with them before they left her behind for their next willing female. That would break her heart into a million tiny pieces.</p><p>Then she would definitely have to leave her job\u2014maybe even leave the city. Because no way could she be close to them every day, knowing they\u2019d found another lover and were lavishing all their attention on her.</p><p>But maybe if she held them off now, she could move on one day, find some nice guy and have a decent life. She would never let that nice guy know she longed for these three men. Hell, she could never let them know how much she truly loved them.</p><p>Dex and Slade shared a glance before the middle brother caressed her thigh. \u201cThank you for that, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>For admitting that she was a lovesick idiot? \u201cPlease let me up, Slade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that, baby.\u201d He sounded as tortured as she felt. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Dex leaned in, his face inches from hers. \u201cHannah, we know you\u2019re not like the others. We knew it the minute we met you. Do you have any idea how hard it\u2019s been to wait for you to get to know us? But that\u2019s over now, especially since we know how you feel.\u201d Behind her, Slade pushed her skirt up to her waist. She felt the cool air on her backside and she shrieked.</p><p>\u201cJust because I care about you doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be your plaything.\u201d Dex\u2019s jaw firmed, but he cupped her face tenderly. \u201cRelax, darlin\u2019, and listen to me. You\u2019re not our plaything. But don\u2019t think for a second that you\u2019re not ours, Hannah. You are.\u201d Ours? They couldn\u2019t possibly mean in any other way except to toy with and use. They would discard her when the fun and games were over because that\u2019s what they did with every woman.</p><p>Hannah wanted to believe that she was different, but she\u2019d be kidding herself.</p><p>She wriggled, trying desperately to force Slade to release her. \u201cLet me go. Take me home. I swear I\u2019ll tell you if this stalker contacts me again. Just...don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Slade demanded. \u201cThere is no going back, baby. We\u2019re going to keep you in Alaska until you agree to be ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry us, darlin\u2019. That\u2019s what he means.\u201d</p><p>Marry? Her head was whirling. They wanted her to marry them? How was that supposed to work? Or was this \u201cproposal\u201d just one way more they played with a woman\u2019s heart? If so, she already couldn\u2019t take it. The yearning was too deep and haunting. Their leaving would create scars she\u2019d never heal from. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHannah, baby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Slade,\u201d Dex snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We just need to move forward.\u201d</p><p>Relief poured through Hannah\u2014along with crushing despair. They\u2019d release her, and she could go back to her old life, minus the job she loved. She\u2019d carry on somehow. But since they hadn\u2019t really touched her, she\u2019d get over her broken heart someday. Maybe.</p><p>Instead of letting her go, Slade pulled her underwear down around her thighs. Hannah gasped. Her bare bottom was on full display.</p><p>Dex stood over her, leaving her to stare at the blue industrial carpet. \u201cLook at that beautiful ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it was gorgeous under all that crap she wears. Her breasts are going to be spectacular.\u201d Slade ran a palm over her backside.</p><p>Tingles danced everywhere he touched. Were they really talking about her sexually?</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that would make this gorgeous bottom look better is a nice shade of pink.</p><p>How many?\u201d</p><p>Slade continued his perusal of her ass. Hannah could feel the heat of his stare. \u201cI think her offense was pretty damn grave, but she\u2019s a novice. She didn\u2019t understand the rules. I say twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Hannah brought her head up. \u201cTwenty-five? You\u2014you\u2019re going to spank me twenty-five times? You can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>But Slade proved in the next instant that he could. His hand came down with a crack, and fire licked across her flesh. Horror and desire washed over her in equal waves. Hannah howled and bucked.</p><p>Dex knelt to her again. \u201cBe still, Hannah. No fighting us. You take your discipline with grace or there will be more of it.\u201d</p><p>It seemed wrong, but desire swelled as Slade palmed her ass. Still, nothing could dampen her fury. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Smack. Hannah stiffened and whimpered.</p><p>\u201cNo sarcasm,\u201d Slade growled. \u201cBut you can make that breathy little sound you just made, love. That went straight to my cock.\u201d</p><p>One smack. Then another. Hannah gasped, fists clenched. Slade didn\u2019t seem to notice. He simply went to work, his hand raining down blows on her backside. She bit her lip, forcing herself not to cry. Even if they thought she needed disciplining like a child, she refused to act like one.</p><p>Then something strange began happening. Heat permeated her skin. She cried out, her eyes still blurry from tears. The pain lingered, but it was being overtaken by a whole new sensation, a weird sort of pleasure she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cFifteen,\u201d Slade called out.</p><p>He had been methodically counting every time his hand slapped her flesh with firm male gusto. As he dealt her ass another blow, he announced the sixteenth whack. Hannah drew in a sharp breath and tried to focus on Slade\u2019s voice telling everyone how many times she\u2019d taken it.</p><p>Nine more and she\u2019d be done. Smack. Eight more and this punishment would be behind her.</p><p>Would that end the sweet heat and amazing floaty feeling taking over?</p><p>Hannah finally stopped tensing against Slade\u2019s hand. There was no use fighting it. Slade would have his way. Dex and Gavin would let him. They would spank her when she was bad. If it felt this good, she might be bad a lot.</p><p>With a sigh, she let go and melted into Slade.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I told you she was submissive.\u201d Dex\u2019s growl made the burgeoning ache right between her legs worse.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d Slade called out, his voice deepening.</p><p>Since her neck didn\u2019t seem capable of holding her head anymore, she let it fall. She was languid, her whole body centered on the riot of sensations screaming across her backside. Three more smacks, then a pause. Followed by utter bliss. The mere cessation of pain was its own pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d Slade\u2019s hands soothed now, pressing his palm into her skin in long, deep strokes down her spine and across her ass. Every touch reminded her that he\u2019d been the one to bring her to this place. Hannah sighed as he leaned over and kissed each of her cheeks.</p><p>Heat flamed through Hannah again, and she couldn\u2019t say it was all embarrassment.</p><p>Then another brush of lips on her ass. Dex.</p><p>\u201cSo submissive. I can smell you from here, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Hannah flushed at Dex\u2019s hoarse words, bringing her out of her relaxed state. Yes, she\u2019d had a very unexpected reaction to Slade\u2019s discipline. She was wet. In fact, she was pretty sure she\u2019d never been this wet before.</p><p>Cringing at Dex\u2019s words, she tried to arch and struggle to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHold still or I\u2019ll give you ten more,\u201d Slade said, his hand pressing down on her lower back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say another word or give an inch until she complied. Finally, when she had no choice but to lie still, he rewarded her with a caress as he slid her panties to the floor. \u201cGood girl, Hannah. Now, spread your legs. We want to see how much you enjoyed your spanking.\u201d Spread her...? Hannah was so embarrassed. He thought she would just show them what only her doctor had ever seen? If she did, they\u2019d know that she enjoyed Slade\u2019s handiwork far more than she could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cEvery second you delay earns you more punishment.\u201d Slade\u2019s voice had gone silky and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to hurt you, darlin\u2019. We\u2019d never hurt you,\u201d Dex vowed. \u201cBut we\u2019re also not going to let you up until you understand that you\u2019re ours and you submit to us. Spread your legs so we can see your pussy. Now.\u201d</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t want more spankings. Or did she? She shook her head. Maybe it was stupid of her, but she wanted their attention, just this once. She\u2019d deal with the inevitable heartache later.</p><p>Besides, what had propriety gotten her so far? She\u2019d always been a good girl. She\u2019d followed all the rules and taken care of everyone around her. Her mother had floated in and out of her life, coming back only when she needed money. When her grandmother had been unable to work anymore, her mother simply started hitting Hannah up for it. Hannah\u2019s sister, Crystal, had been the same. She\u2019d preferred boys and drugs to her little sister. In the end, she\u2019d just preferred the drugs, and they had taken her life.</p><p>Still, being good hadn\u2019t made her happy or kept a stalker away. It certainly hadn\u2019t kept her from being lonely or helped her find someone to love.</p><p>She loved Dex, Slade, and Gavin. Maybe...if she could be the kind of woman they wanted, they would never leave. Maybe they really would marry her, and they\u2019d all be happy together.</p><p>The thought was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cHannah, I gave you an order. Last warning.\u201d Slade\u2019s hand tightened on her thigh.</p><p>\u201cGive her a moment,\u201d Gavin insisted, speaking for the first time since the spanking had begun. \u201cHannah, they\u2019re serious. I know my brothers. Dex and I may fight from time to time because he\u2019s hot-tempered and pigheaded, but he\u2019s not a liar. Trust them, honey. They\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s words sounded a bit strangled, as though he\u2019d struggled to get them out. But one thing about her boss: he never spoke less than the truth to her. Knowing that worked magic on Hannah\u2019s overwrought nerves and fragile heart.</p><p>The brothers really cared about her?</p><p>If she did as they asked\u2014if she believed in them\u2014she\u2019d be taking a chance. But if she always played it safe, how would she know if she could find something wonderful?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Hannah let her legs slide open.</p><p>Slade\u2019s heart pounded. Spanking Hannah had been the single most erotic experience of his life. It had been everything he could have hoped for. Having her over his lap, her gorgeous ass in the air waiting for his discipline, made Slade feel like he was ten fucking feet tall. He\u2019d spanked subs in the club he and Dex belonged to, but never had it felt like this. Those subs hadn\u2019t been his, and spanking them had been a fun game. Disciplining Hannah was important because she was their woman, and teaching her to look to her Masters was their responsibility and pleasure.</p><p>And when Hannah tentatively parted her pretty thighs, his heart swelled at the trust she placed in them. They wouldn\u2019t let her down.</p><p>God, this was the rest of his life.</p><p>He exchanged a look with Dex, who clearly understood just how important the moment was.</p><p>Slade let his hand slide over her cheeks then glide down to her pussy. Her wet cream coated his fingers, making them slippery. Hannah gasped at his touch.</p><p>He looked up at Dex, fighting a smile of triumph. \u201cShe\u2019s soaking wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Slade froze. The command hadn\u2019t come from the person he expected. Dex\u2019s face was just as shocked as Slade knew his was. They both turned to their oldest brother. Gavin wanted to see?</p><p>Maybe they were closer to a breakthrough than Slade had hoped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed Hannah by the waist before Gavin could change his mind. She tensed a bit, but he dropped a kiss on her shoulder, and she became a sweet bit of languorous femininity, trying to show trust in her men.</p><p>With minimal fuss, she allowed him and Dex to pull her off his lap then sit her on his thighs once more, her back to his front. Slade arranged her legs on either side of his knees so that when he widened his stance, he parted her thighs.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s blonde hair flowed down her back, tickling Slade\u2019s face. She smelled like peaches and sweet sex. Her head fell back against his shoulder. She was closer to him than he\u2019d ever managed to get to her. The hugs he\u2019d stolen before were nothing compared to the intimacy of holding her in his arms after disciplining her.</p><p>Enfolding her in his arms, he turned his chair and faced Gavin.</p><p>His brother\u2019s serious face tightened, his brows a deep V over rain-cloud eyes. He was perfectly still as his gaze fused right on Hannah\u2019s very slick pussy. Gavin clutched the arms of his chair with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cPretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Slade couldn\u2019t resist baiting his brother.</p><p>Gavin swallowed in silence\u2014but didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Slade trailed his hands up her body. Hannah whimpered but didn\u2019t fight him, and her soft submission went straight to his cock and filled a place in Slade he hadn\u2019t known was empty.</p><p>He\u2019d been working to earn Hannah since that first night he\u2019d entered a BDSM club. Now she was here.</p><p>With seeking palms he found her breasts, gorgeously round and soft. His thumbs grazed her stiff nipples through her clothing. She whimpered a little.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I just want to play for a minute,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she settled back down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to tell him that you don\u2019t like it.\u201d Dex knelt between her legs. \u201cYour lips can lie, but your pussy doesn\u2019t.\u201d He peered at Slade then shot a glance over his shoulder at Gavin. \u201cShe\u2019s coated in cream and getting wetter.\u201d</p><p>Gavin clenched his jaw, but he stubbornly remained mute.</p><p>\u201cDex,\u201d she protested. \u201cDo you have to say it so bluntly? It\u2019s...impolite.\u201d His brother grinned, the expression making him seem younger than his twenty-eight years.</p><p>Dex never looked as open and young as he did when Hannah was making him smile. \u201cDarlin\u2019, you have your legs spread in front of three men. We passed polite a while back.\u201d Slade pinched her nipples again. \u201cAnd we like you this way.\u201d Her head lolled back on his shoulder. Even from his vantage, Slade could see the hint of a smile on Hannah\u2019s face.</p><p>She had entered the plane filled with self-doubt and no small amount of fear. Now she was relaxed, even somewhat happy. He\u2019d given that to her, and damn if it didn\u2019t make him smile.</p><p>He\u2019d almost be happy, too, if he could just get the reaction he wanted out of Gavin.</p><p>Slade rolled Hannah\u2019s nipples through her shirt. He couldn\u2019t wait to get those breasts in his mouth. What would Gavin do then?</p><p>\u201cDamn, darlin\u2019, you\u2019re so wet.\u201d Dex didn\u2019t hesitate. He put his nose right where Slade knew he wanted it. Hannah gasped as Dex inhaled loudly. \u201cAnd you smell so fucking good.\u201d She tried to dodge him, but Slade tightened his arms around her. If Hannah was concerned with the impoliteness of Dex talking about how good her pussy smelled, she\u2019d likely have a problem with him diving in for a feast. But that wasn\u2019t going to stop him.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d The breathy sounds that flowed out of Hannah\u2019s mouth told Slade that maybe they really had moved past simple courtesy. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it should, baby,\u201d Slade encouraged. \u201cIt\u2019s going to feel even better when you have one of us suckling your breasts and one eating your pretty pussy. It\u2019s going to feel so good then.\u201d Dex dropped back beside Gavin. \u201cShe tastes like sunshine. Get her off. We want to watch.\u201d Slade couldn\u2019t wait. He cupped her cunt. It was soft and slippery, swollen and pouting. His thumb went to the nub of her clit and caressed while he slid a single finger in. \u201cYou are so tight, love.\u201d</p><p>He groaned because he could feel her muscles clamping down on his finger. His cock protested. He wanted to be inside her so damn badly, but this was about her. She\u2019d submitted beautifully and deserved to be rewarded. Besides, Gavin needed to see what he was missing.</p> <p>Slade struggled to work a second finger into the tight clasp of Hannah\u2019s pussy. He doubted he could squeeze in a third. She was going to be so damn snug, but that was okay. He\u2019d do whatever it took to maneuver his cock in and make her like it. Dex\u2014and hopefully Gavin\u2014</p><p>would do the same.</p><p>As he felt his way around her cunt, he hit just the right spot. Hannah gasped. He pressed in and rubbed, rotating as he slid his thumb over her hard bundle of nerves. Her entire body stiffened. Her breath came even faster. She clawed at his thighs.</p><p>\u201cSlade...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel good, baby?\u201d</p><p>She nodded frantically, words seemingly eluding her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so fucking sexy,\u201d Dex purred as he moved in again and trailed a hand up her thigh.</p><p>His gaze fused with hers.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. You\u2019ve got to feel her.\u201d Slade pulled his slick fingers back, lavishing all his attention on her hard clit, paying close attention to the cues of her body. He kept her right on edge with soft, circular strokes.</p><p>Dex didn\u2019t waste a second before he slipped a thick finger inside her pussy. \u201cFuck, she is tight. You\u2019re going to be incredible.\u201d</p><p>As Hannah whimpered, Dex kissed the inside of her thigh and pumped another finger inside her, turning his wrist so his fingertips danced right over her most sensitive spot.</p><p>He and Dex didn\u2019t have to speak a word. They both knew it was time.</p><p>While Slade rubbed the hard little nub a bit faster, a bit harder, Dex prodded that spot inside her relentlessly. Hannah\u2019s back arched. As he worked his lips up her neck, her skin turned dewy and damp. She drew in sharp little breaths, one after the other.</p><p>\u201cGive it to us, darlin\u2019,\u201d Dex demanded. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, she shot off like a rocket, bursting high. She shook, screaming her pleasure in his arms. He wished he could see her face, but he watched Dex, who looked supremely pleased.</p><p>Slade could tell that Hannah in rapture was a beautiful sight.</p><p>He glanced at Gavin. Every muscle in his oldest brother\u2019s body was tense. Hunger darkened his eyes as he watched the explosive orgasm wrack Hannah\u2019s body until her mewls became whimpers, and she turned limp in his arms.</p><p>Still, Slade wasn\u2019t quite ready to let her go. He continued to brush her clit gently. Each time he did, her body spasmed with little aftershocks.</p><p>Dex withdrew his fingers and sucked them, closing his eyes with a moan. \u201cThat was gorgeous, darlin\u2019. I can\u2019t wait to see it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness. What was that?\u201d Hannah asked in a desperate, breathy voice.</p><p>Slade turned his face in to breathe her scent, his lips scraping across her cheek and chuckled.</p><p>She could be so adorable.</p><p>\u201cThat was a killer orgasm,\u201d Dex said with a grin as he stood, his hand on the button of his pants. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be even better when it\u2019s my cock inside you. Come on, baby. I want you to ride me.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, Hannah sat up, pulled her skirt down, then glanced at him. Brows knit, green eyes uncertain, she looked away. Slade reeled back at the confusion on her sweet face and forced himself to sit up.</p><p>He turned her in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had an orgasm before, baby?\u201d Hannah stared, blinked at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The entire room froze.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, what were those men thinking?\u201d Dex scowled.</p><p>\u201cWhat men?\u201d Hannah asked, her eyes innocent.</p><p>The clues slid into place for Slade. \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin?\u201d</p><p>With a pretty flush, Hannah scrambled off his lap, smoothing her skirt. \u201cYes.\u201d He and Dex exchanged a quick glance. This changed everything. They\u2019d been ready to introduce her to the pleasures of m\u00e9nage at thirty-thousand feet, but if this was her first time, she deserved a real bed and an enormous amount of patience from them.</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou don\u2019t like virgins. Because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, right?\u201d Hannah backed away. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me earlier. Let\u2019s just forget it happened.\u201d</p><p>Slade got to his feet. His cock was a hammer in his slacks, but it would wait for Hannah.</p><p>He took her hand and drew her closer. \u201cLook at me, love.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then finally met his gaze. He could see the courage it cost her.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t forget that it happened. And it\u2019s going to happen again. We are so honored that you trusted us with the truth. We hope you\u2019ll do the same with your body.\u201d Slade raised her hand to his mouth, palm up, and kissed her. \u201cWe\u2019ll take such good care of you.\u201d Dex was right there, taking her other hand. \u201cI promise. We\u2019re going to cherish you.\u201d Tears filled her eyes, along with a spark of what Slade could only describe as hope. \u201cYou\u2019re not disappointed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d Slade said. \u201cNow, sit down, and I\u2019ll fix you a drink. You should rest.\u201d He poured her a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. When he turned, she was sitting in her chair next to Dex. They had left a seat open beside her. That was his place, beside her. He passed her the glass and sat. Dex began to talk about her cat and how he\u2019d rescued the fur ball. By the time he was finished with the story, Hannah was smiling into Dex\u2019s face. When Slade found her hand with his, she squeezed back.</p><p>Slade couldn\u2019t help the smile creasing his face. The moment was perfect with the singular exception of Gavin on the other side of the aisle. Alone. His gray eyes were stark, miserable.</p><p>Slade didn\u2019t know what to say, but he figured he\u2019d better come up with something fast.</p><p>Before he opened his mouth, Gavin shook his head and stared out the window.</p><p>For the first time it really sank in that Slade could gain a wife and lose his brother.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The limo slid away from the tiny airstrip, its engine purring almost silently.</p><p>Gavin was well aware that it was utterly incongruous to have a limo in a backwoods town like River Run, Alaska, but his father had kept one for his infrequent trips, and it had seemed cruel to Gavin to fire the driver. The man had been with his family for almost fifty years, so when Gavin or any of the executives came to River Run, they were greeted by the elderly driver and late-model limo.</p><p>The vehicle seated six, not that they needed that much space. His brothers had practically sprawled Hannah across their laps. She didn\u2019t take up much room anyway. Nor, apparently could she walk. When the plane had touched down, she\u2019d tried to stand, but Dex had been there, sweeping her into his arms. He\u2019d passed her off to Slade when they reached the limo. Now she sat curled up like a sweetly rumpled, sexy kitten between them. The minute Dex had curled his arm around her she\u2019d let her head find his chest and fallen asleep. Dex had closed his eyes, too.</p><p>Lucky bastard. Gavin doubted he would be able to sleep even in his comfortable bed. His cock was still hard hours after watching Hannah spread her legs and come for the first time.</p><p>Gavin knew he\u2019d never touch her...but in that moment, he\u2019d felt so involved, sharing that brand new experience with her and his brothers. Fuck if he didn\u2019t want more.</p><p>He\u2019d never given much thought to the whole Dominance and submission thing Dex and Slade were into, but watching Hannah\u2019s pretty backside turn bright pink under Slade\u2019s hand had flat out done something for him. He\u2019d imagined it was his own hands holding her down, administering discipline. He would have turned her over and forced her to ride him.</p><p>But she was a virgin. God, he didn\u2019t want to think about that, about the fact that before too long, she wouldn\u2019t have her virginity anymore\u2014and one of his brothers would be the privileged man taking it.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from the Lenox brothers, yet?\u201d Slade kept his voice low, in deference to the sleeping pair.</p><p>Gavin was grateful for the reprieve from his dark thoughts. When he found Hannah\u2019s stalker, he would think of an excellent way to take more of his frustration out on the asshole. \u201cThey sent a text saying they have all the data. It will take them a few days to go through everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always hope this sick fuck walked past a couple of security cameras with the package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we can hope.\u201d</p><p>Gavin watched the terrain slide by. It was high summer in Alaska, and the ground was covered in colors he never saw in Texas. Rich, vibrant flowers formed a carpet that led from the road to the flat, plain that seemed to go on for days. Even the grass was a lush Technicolor green.</p><p>\u201cI always loved it here,\u201d Slade said, his gaze trailing to the mountains in the distance. \u201cI felt free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were certainly much freer than we were at home.\u201d Gavin knew his strict father thought that sending Slade and him up here every summer was some form of punishment. Stuart James had told his nine- and five-year-old boys that they needed to toughen up, and that Alaska would make them men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His father really had been blind. What he and Slade had discovered in River Run was real kindness and affection for the first time in their lives.</p><p>\u201cMarnie says her cabbage won first place at the fair this year.\u201d Slade smiled as he spoke of the woman who had met them at the airstrip that first day. Marnie ran the local tavern and knew how to handle roughnecks with ease. She\u2019d also known how to deal with two scared boys.</p><p>He wondered if she would have any advice for one conflicted man.</p><p>Gavin turned away, staring out at the landscape. Honestly, he had no reason to be conflicted.</p> <p>He was realistic. The past had proven to him, in the ugliest way possible, that he couldn\u2019t put anyone fragile in his hands. He was too broken to care for Hannah like she deserved. Getting aroused by watching his brothers touch her pussy and bring her to orgasm didn\u2019t mean anything except he was male and healthy.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dex have barely said two words to each other.\u201d</p><p>Gavin realized that, but at least Dex had gotten on the plane with him. \u201cDex was far too busy with Hannah to speak to me. And we shouldn\u2019t pretend like he isn\u2019t here listening to every word we say.\u201d</p><p>Slade waved off that thought. \u201cHe\u2019s the soundest sleeper I know. A nuclear bomb could go off, and Dex would sleep through it. He told me that he grew up in some of the loudest homes imaginable, and he had to train himself to sleep through anything.\u201d Gavin hadn\u2019t heard the stories, but he\u2019d read the files the private investigator had compiled.</p><p>Dex had grown up rough. His mother had been one of Stuart James\u2019s many girlfriends. She\u2019d been a stripper. When she\u2019d turned up pregnant, he\u2019d given Roxanne Townsend a check for ten thousand dollars and told her to get an abortion. Roxanne had ignored the orders, but she\u2019d died in a car accident when Dex was seven. He\u2019d spent the next ten years in and out of foster homes until the day Gavin and Slade had found him.</p> <p>\u201cHe looks up to you,\u201d Slade said.</p><p>Gavin doubted that. \u201cHe sees me as his boss.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s head shook. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. He\u2019s only closer to me because we went to college together. Dad had just died. You were twenty-two, and you had to take the reins of a multi-billion-dollar company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd deal with a hostile takeover.\u201d A group of board members had tried to wrest control, thinking that Gavin was just a kid. He\u2019d proven then that he could swim with the sharks.</p><p>Now he made sure they damn well knew he could lead them, as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd Nikki died just a few months after that.\u201d The soft words landed with a thud Slade couldn\u2019t possibly have intended.</p> <p>Gavin felt his whole body go cold. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should. She\u2019s been a ghost in your life all this time, holding you back. You have to move on. You loved her, and she died. You can\u2019t blame yourself. Gavin, wouldn\u2019t she have wanted you to be happy? What happened was tragic, but not your fault.\u201d Except it had been his fault, and it had cost far more of his soul than Slade could possibly know to keep that fact from everyone. But you also kept all the nasty stuff out of the papers. You protected the family\u2019s good name. Too bad that was all you protected.</p><p>He could still feel the cold air of the coroner\u2019s office as he received the news. Sometimes he had nightmares about that cramped, foul-smelling room. If he\u2019d never gone, if he\u2019d never known, would he have been able to move on? Could he have forgiven himself if it had only been Nikki he\u2019d killed with his neglect?</p><p>\u201cClearly, you\u2019re under some misconception that I\u2019m hung up on a sad event that happened a decade ago.\u201d Now wasn\u2019t the time to trot out the truth.</p><p>Slade sat back, obviously disappointed. \u201cI hate it when you lie to me. But I appreciate your help convincing Hannah of our sincerity earlier. She needed to hear that Dex and I are serious about her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d ached to include himself in that statement he\u2019d made to Hannah about his brothers\u2019</p><p>intentions. That had scared him more than anything. \u201cI know you care about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin envied the unrelenting sureness of Slade\u2019s statement, but he knew he\u2019d never be able to give his whole heart to another person now. \u201cShe seems to feel the same way about you two.</p><p>Be gentle with her.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s lips slid into a grin. \u201cYou think the spanking was a little rough?\u201d He\u2019d thought the spanking was absolute perfection. \u201cIt seemed to please her.\u201d One eyebrow crept up on Slade\u2019s face as he stared at Gavin. \u201cBut it did nothing for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt relieved me to see that she handled it well.\u201d She\u2019d been sweet and submissive and graceful. So unlike his typical women these days.</p><p>Sex had become an exchange for Gavin. He kept a companion, paid for her condo, and gave her an allowance. In exchange, she was his partner in social occasions and sex until he deemed otherwise.</p><p>The arrangement was good enough. It was all he deserved.</p><p>Slade\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Gavin was deathly afraid that Slade meant to continue this little interrogation. \u201cHow is Kristin doing?\u201d</p><p>Kristin? He hadn\u2019t talked to her in over a year. \u201cI think she got married, actually.\u201d Slade\u2019s fingers drummed along the arm rest. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019ve moved on to Tiffany.</p><p>She\u2019s your latest...girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He said girlfriend in a halting way, as though he knew the words didn\u2019t fit, but couldn\u2019t come up with anything better. Gavin could. \u201cShe was my mistress, Slade. And she\u2019s no longer with me, either.\u201d</p><p>His current mistress, Brooke, was exactly like Tiffany, and the sort of woman he needed\u2014</p><p>cold, skilled, and efficient.</p><p>Slade rolled his blue eyes. \u201cMistress. That makes you sound like some freaking nineteenth-century lord. No one has mistresses these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect accessory for the modern-day CEO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than a CEO, Gavin. I wish you would understand that there\u2019s more to life than work.\u201d Slade\u2019s eyes drifted to the woman at his side. She twisted in her sleep, and her head rolled from Dex\u2019s shoulder to Slade\u2019s. His brother cupped her cheek and kissed the top of her head, practically sighing at the contact. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more.\u201d Resentment bubbled up in Gavin. Of course Slade thought there was more to life than work.</p><p>He\u2019d been in college when their world had nearly been ripped out from under them. Gavin was the one who had to deal with the fallout of their father\u2019s untimely demise. Slade had been in college, and Dex had followed him there for fraternity fun and games. Given the fact that Slade and Dex were only a few months apart in age, it was no surprise they had fallen in together. By the time Gavin had been able to come up for air, Slade and Dex had bonded, and Gavin was on the outside.</p><p>In the years that had passed, nothing had changed</p><p>\u201cHow about you work on your little engineering projects, and I\u2019ll run the company.\u201d Slade frowned. \u201cMy \u2018little engineering projects?\u2019 You mean like the project that found a huge reserve in the middle of the Gulf? That billion-dollar project?\u201d Gavin was saved by the trill of his cell phone. He looked down at the caller ID. Burke Lenox.</p><p>The man worked fast. He stared for a moment wondering what he wanted from this call. If the Lenox brothers had solved the crime already, then he and his brothers could turn right around and take Hannah home. Or he could leave and let her, Dex, and Slade have a romantic getaway.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave. He wanted more. Damn it, he was tired of being on the outside.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t going to change.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry about the engineering crack,\u201d Gavin said shortly. If he wanted to get back in good with his brothers, he needed to stop being such an asshole. He slid the answer button on the phone, and was surprised at how fast his heart was beating. \u201cLenox? What have you got for me?\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s smooth voice came over the line. \u201cNot much yet. Cole is going over the tapes. I think you\u2019re definitely right. This is an insider.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known that. Part of him relaxed. He didn\u2019t have to decide yet what to do next. But Hannah was still in danger. \u201cRun deep background checks on everyone. Human Resources would have done some of the legwork, but you have resources they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start with anyone who has daily dealings with Hannah. This is a big company we\u2019re talking about, James. It could take awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I want you to be very thorough. Start with Scott in IT. The way I see it, he might be hung up on Hannah in a dangerous sort of way if he\u2019s suddenly demanding to have an important lunch with her. There\u2019s nothing so critical about the project she\u2019s coordinating that should require her to spend her lunch hour with him. And our CIO, Preston Ward III. He and Hannah had an...altercation recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny that you mention him. The other reason I called you was to let you know you\u2019ve got trouble up there in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there were some minor computer issues. It made a decent cover for us leaving, but it\u2019s nothing we\u2019re too concerned about.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cI was in your office this afternoon. Apparently, your minor trouble became something major. I overheard Ward saying that River Run is in serious trouble, and he\u2019s headed up there himself with a couple of techs to fix it. You\u2019re going to love this. One of the techs is Scott. The other is the head of your help desk, Lyle.\u201d Gavin didn\u2019t love it. It was the worst news possible. Preston was on his way down with two techs, and all three men were on Gavin\u2019s list of suspects. Any of them could be Hannah\u2019s stalker.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>While in Alaska, Gavin had imagined that he could go fishing with his brothers in an attempt to reconnect, but maybe a good old-fashioned ass-kicking was the ultimate bonding experience.</p><p>Because by the time the trio got here in the morning, he hoped they\u2019d figured out the identity of Hannah\u2019s stalker. The asshole was going to have a welcome party he would never forget.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Burke. Could you find out what flight they\u2019re on? One of the admins should know. I want to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just sent you an e-mail with that information. I\u2019ll keep digging, focusing first on the men you\u2019ve mentioned. But something is off here; I feel it. Watch your back, James. I\u2019ll call back when I know more.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead, and Gavin immediately opened his e-mail.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The expression on Slade\u2019s face told Gavin he\u2019d figured out something was up, but he couldn\u2019t move because Hannah\u2019s head was on his chest. Otherwise, they might be wrestling over the phone. \u201cWhat did he find out?\u201d</p><p>Gavin scanned the e-mail. It was a copy of the incoming employees\u2019 itinerary. Preston hadn\u2019t wasted a minute. He and two others were coming in on the redeye to Anchorage, followed by a puddle-jumper they\u2019d hired to get them to River Run. First Class for Preston, but he\u2019d shoved the techs into coach. Douche bag.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to have company. Have you checked your cell lately?\u201d Slade flushed slightly. \u201cI turned it off while we were in the air. I haven\u2019t turned it back on.\u201d Because he was far too busy with Hannah. Work was going to come second for Slade from now on. Gavin could deal with that. He scanned through his e-mail, reading a group of them from the foreman at River Run, which had started minutes after Gavin\u2019s plane had taken off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel too bad. I just started mine again. There was a system failure at the facility. They got it under control, but it needs to be looked at by an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be there in an hour,\u201d Slade said.</p><p>\u201cA computer expert. It isn\u2019t an engineering problem. The system crashed, and now that it\u2019s back online, it\u2019s giving off some strange numbers. Ben Kunayak, the IT guy who runs our facility up here, thinks the system has been hacked. Preston decided it was serious enough to investigate in person. Scott and Lyle apparently volunteered to come with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Slade\u2019s voice boomed through the car. \u201cHow convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the house, Slade caught him up on the Lenox brothers\u2019 call. Dex thought seriously about putting his fist through another wall. \u201cThat fucker is going to be here in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded from his seat on the couch. Dex couldn\u2019t sit. All he could do was think about the fact that Preston Ward III had followed Hannah to Alaska.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t say anything to Hannah until we know for sure, but he\u2019s not coming anywhere near her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Slade walked in from the hallway that led back to the bedrooms. \u201cI settled her in.</p><p>She\u2019s not particularly happy that she lost her cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Gavin eyed Slade. \u201cLost?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slade pulled the small phone out of his back pocket with a grin. \u201cIt got lost in my pants.\u201d Gavin sighed, the sound so familiar to Dex that he no longer winced at it. He was used to disappointing Gavin. But it was nice to know their oldest brother handled Slade the same way.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would her phone decide to hide in your slacks?\u201d</p><p>Dex held his hand out, and Slade turned the phone over. Dex immediately started going through her recent calls. \u201cSlade and I talked about it earlier. Hannah knows a lot of people.</p><p>Maybe one of them is her stalker. But if she has this phone, she\u2019s going to answer it. She might even call her friends to let them know where she\u2019s gone. We can\u2019t risk that.\u201d She\u2019d had twenty damn phone calls in the last ten hours. Dex ignored the ones from Wendy and the other female office workers Hannah had befriended. There were several numbers from inside Black Oak that Dex didn\u2019t recognize, and Hannah didn\u2019t have contact names for their numbers.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to keep Hannah\u2019s whereabouts quiet. Wendy is the only one who knows where she is. She\u2019s been with the company for over a decade. I would trust her with company secrets.\u201d Slade flipped open his laptop and started it up.</p><p>\u201cAnd Wendy loves Hannah,\u201d Gavin offered. \u201cShe views her as the daughter she never had and has lectured me several times on the importance of taking care of Hannah properly. Wendy wouldn\u2019t give up her whereabouts. She knows the danger.\u201d</p><p>Dex sat down beside Slade, who had pulled up the company directory. \u201cWho has extension 709?\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s fingers flew across the keys. \u201cScott Kirkwood. He works in IT. That\u2019s the guy she was supposed to have lunch with today so he could talk to her about something \u2018important.\u2019\u201d Dex remembered Scott. Short, scrawny. Pale hair to go with his pale face. When Dex had gone to the IT section to interrogate the little prick, he\u2019d been out with a \u2018personal appointment,\u2019</p><p>according to his supervisor. Scott was supposedly both reliable and punctual, but the timing smelled damn fishy to Dex. \u201cSend Burke his name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d Gavin advised.</p><p>Satisfaction rolled through Dex. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll bet we have dates and times on some of this damn stalker\u2019s actions. Maybe we can use those to narrow the list of suspects down and eliminate others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should have this conversation with Hannah,\u201d Gavin suggested.</p><p>Dex turned to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to scare her unnecessarily. Once we know something, we\u2019ll bring her in and tell her everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand not wanting to frighten her, but you can\u2019t pretend the problem doesn\u2019t exist when she\u2019s around. Isn\u2019t she our best resource on figuring this out? I mean, she does know who she speaks with on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her involved.\u201d Dex flipped through her phone. \u201cExtension 830?\u201d A few clicks on the computer, and Slade had the answer. \u201cThat\u2019s Heather Coleburn. She\u2019s in the business management office. She and Hannah have had lunch every Wednesday for the last year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe makes friends so easily,\u201d Dex murmured with a hint of a smile. She was a genuine friend, and some people took advantage of that. \u201c722?\u201d</p><p>Slade rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s Lyle. You know Lyle.\u201d</p><p>Dex knew him well. Lyle was the head of the help desk and a supposed computer genius. He just seemed like an unctuous prick to Dex. \u201cYeah. He left a message on her machine at home, I think. He was supposed to fix her laptop tonight. Maybe we should give his name to Burke.\u201d Gavin shrugged. \u201cNext time I talk to Burke or Cole, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now does someone here want to tell me why I didn\u2019t know that Hannah filed a sexual harassment complaint against our CIO?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, either,\u201d Slade added.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes hooded. \u201cShe told me it wasn\u2019t serious. He got a little handsy at happy hour a couple of weeks back. He and his wife are separating, and Ward was drunk. I talked to him yesterday, just after I found out. I told him I would fire him if he even looked Hannah\u2019s way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t bother to mention this to either of us, why?\u201d Slade asked, looking up from his computer.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s perfectly polished shoes tapped against the hardwood floor, a sure sign he was getting impatient. \u201cBy HR\u2019s standards, Hannah\u2019s complaint is confidential. The only reason I knew about it was Preston himself. He was worried HR would pursue the matter, and came to plead his case to me. Then I asked Hannah.\u201d</p> <p>Dex wouldn\u2019t have let the asshole plead anything. \u201cHow could you let him get away with harassing her like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took care of him. Broke his big toe by stomping on it. She\u2019s stronger than you give her credit for. You should be damn lucky you got the jump on her today, or you might have ended up limping like Preston.\u201d Gavin stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. I suggest the two of you do the same. And while I agree that Hannah is fragile in some ways, I think you\u2019d do well to remember that she is a very independent woman who has a brain.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stalked past them, heading toward the kitchen, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cGive him a little time,\u201d Slade said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand our relationship with Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not the only one,\u201d a soft voice said from the doorway.</p><p>Dex turned and saw Hannah standing there in one of the long, white terrycloth robes stashed in all the bedrooms for guests\u2019 comfort. Based on the flushed anger all over her face, he\u2019d bet she\u2019d been standing there for a while. \u201cHannah, you\u2019re supposed to be in bed.\u201d She adjusted her robe. \u201cYes, you put me to bed and tucked me in. Clearly, you expected me to stay there like a good little girl. If that was your goal, you should have just locked me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it.\u201d Dex got the feeling she wouldn\u2019t believe him if he lied. He\u2019d given serious consideration to locking that door and knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt where she was.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, live and learn. Maybe you can lock in the next girl. I would like my phone back.\u201d She strode up and held her hand out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Dex said, snatching it up in his big fist.</p><p>\u201cHannah, love,\u201d Slade said, getting to his feet and cupping her shoulders. \u201cYou don\u2019t need that phone. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who\u2019s going to keep me safe from your overprotectiveness?\u201d she drawled. \u201cI want my phone, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly do. How else am I going to call and make a reservation to fly out of here?\u201d Dex itched to mete out some discipline. But when he heard Slade\u2019s sigh, Dex knew his brother was going to try to gently talk Hannah out of her anger. That would be a mistake, in Dex\u2019s opinion. He took a moment to really read her body language. She was tense, her eyes narrow and tight. Her fists were clenched and every now and then she rolled them like she was digging her nails into the palm of her hand. Dex would bet that she was keyed up and itching for a fight...or something else that would take the edge off.</p><p>He was willing to give it to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, Hannah.\u201d He said the words with implacable surety.</p><p>Her head came up, and she went toe-to-toe with him. Dex couldn\u2019t hold in a little smile. Her perfectly painted pink toes were so obviously wrong up against his worn boots.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you laugh at me, Dexter Townsend. I want my phone\u2014now. I\u2019m leaving, and you\u2019re not stopping me. I\u2019m done playing whatever game you\u2019ve cooked up. Oh, and I quit. Please let Mr. James know. As soon as you give me the phone, I\u2019m going home. And by home, I mean back to West Texas.\u201d</p><p>Slade stood beside Dex, clearly no longer in the mood to reason with her. \u201cIf you think we\u2019re going to let you leave here when there\u2019s a stalker out there waiting for you, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d Hannah thrust her hands on her hips. \u201cYou don\u2019t own me. I can come and go as I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ours, and you\u2019re staying in this house if I have to tie you up.\u201d In fact, it would be Dex\u2019s pleasure. He would tie her hands to the headboard and place those shapely legs in a spreader bar that would leave her pussy on full display and ready for their use. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of that in the first place?</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m a captive here?\u201d</p><p>Dex paused, then nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s accurate, darlin\u2019. You\u2019re not leaving, and that\u2019s for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how you\u2019re going to convince me you\u2019re better than the guy stalking me? Whatever you thought we started on the plane is over.\u201d She turned on her heel and walked away.</p><p>Slade\u2019s jaw dropped as they watched her. Dex had a sinking feeling they\u2019d just fucked up big.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Hannah fought to contain her scream. She stomped down the hall toward her bedroom, plotting the whole way exactly how she\u2019d get the hell out of this mess.</p><p>She\u2019d been so stupid. She\u2019d thought because the brothers had shown her some affection, they really cared about her. But no. They\u2019d spanked her and flashed her to each other. That wasn\u2019t affection, just perversion.</p><p>But then...Slade picked her up and carried her down the steps. That felt like affection, just like waking cuddled between them in the big stretch limo.</p><p>She pushed the images aside as she strode through the bedroom door. The room beyond was bigger than her apartment, and the bed looked like it was built to sleep a football team. She could only imagine what the brothers had planned to do to her there.</p><p>With a little bit of malicious glee, she turned the lock on the door. No way was she letting them in after they\u2019d deceived her.</p><p>Now they\u2019d find out what she was capable of.</p><p>She\u2019d heard enough of their conversation to realize that Gavin alone thought she possessed a brain capable of independent thought. Slade and Dex...God, did they really think she was that needy? That stupid?</p><p>And where did Gavin fit into all of this? He hadn\u2019t touched her, but she could still hear his deep hypnotic voice telling Slade to turn her around so he could see her, still feel her boss\u2019s scorching stare right between her legs after her very first orgasm. And her last with them as well, because there was no way she was letting any of those men near her again.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d There was a tentative knock on the door. \u201cBaby, we need to talk to you. Let us in.\u201d</p><p>Slade. That tender voice urged her to trust him. After he had stolen her cell phone and told her he had no idea where it was? No chance. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Slade said in that cajoling voice. \u201cHannah, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d She felt a rush of satisfaction as the doorknob moved, but the door stayed closed. They probably didn\u2019t think she was smart enough to lock it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d Because they wouldn\u2019t talk, they would lie. They would tell her whatever it took to get her to open that door. She would fall for their sweet-talk. Then she would be right back where she started\u2014sweet, trusting Hannah letting them lead her into trouble.</p><p>Fat chance.</p><p>She could see now that they didn\u2019t really want her. They wanted someone submissive, a trusting little toy, and they thought she fit the bill. Despite her virginity, she wasn\u2019t completely na\u00efve. She\u2019d read books, heard the rumors. They were Doms, and they wanted someone pliable who wouldn\u2019t complain when they tied her up, spanked her bottom, and used her in a million delicious ways.</p><p>She was not that girl. No matter how much some part of her wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cHannah, you open the door this instant,\u201d Dex demanded.</p><p>He was the hard-ass. She\u2019d always known he was the one with the quick temper, but Dex\u2019s flare burned out quickly. Slade, however, would hold a grudge. He\u2019d always try to persuade and cajole first. If that didn\u2019t work, he had no problem using force.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018no\u2019 don\u2019t you understand? Is it the \u2018N\u2019 or the \u2018O\u2019 that\u2019s confusing?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>Seconds later, the door burst open, the finely crafted piece of wood no match for two Doms.</p><p>What was left of the door hung on busted hinges. Dex prowled straight in, all caveman. Hannah forced herself to stand her ground. What now?</p><p>Slade glared at Dex. \u201cI had a key, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t fast enough.\u201d Dex stalked toward her. \u201cYou were going to stand in the hallway and sweet talk her all night.\u201d</p><p>Hannah thought about running, but one of them would catch her. Besides, it would likely incite their tempers. She needed to calm them down.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. At least your brother has a modicum of civility,\u201d Hannah pointed out.</p><p>Slade crossed his arms over his chest and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe was wasting time.\u201d Dex took her by the shoulders. \u201cHannah, you can\u2019t leave. I am willing to sit down and talk this out with you, but you need to understand that I will not allow you to step foot off these grounds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own me, Dex. I already quit, so you can\u2019t stop me from leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me, darlin\u2019.\u201d His arrogance came off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cI have to agree with him.\u201d Slade sent her an apologetic but implacable glance.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I call the police?\u201d</p> <p>Slade smiled and proved he could be just as difficult as his brother. \u201cThere are no cops in River Run. There\u2019s a sheriff, but good luck getting him away from his fishing pole. This whole damn town is owned and operated by Black Oak Oil. No one here will help you leave us.\u201d He was dead serious, and Hannah had to shove down her panic. \u201cI will not be held captive.\u201d Slade scrubbed a hand across his hair, frustration evident in the tense set of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHannah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not a captive, then give me back my phone.\u201d</p><p>A long sigh fell from Slade\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhoever is out there knows your habits. He knows your friends. Promise me you won\u2019t call any of them.\u201d</p><p>She was done bargaining with them since all the compromises were heavily in their favor. \u201cI won\u2019t promise you anything, Slade. I want my phone, and I want to go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see how dangerous that would be?\u201d Slade asked.</p><p>Was it really any more dangerous than staying with them? They\u2019d probably use her for fun and games, tie her heart to theirs, then cut her loose when the fun ended. All their talk of marriage and forever was bunk, and she\u2019d let herself believe it on the plane because she\u2019d wanted to so badly.</p><p>\u201cI understand that it\u2019s a risk. The only concession you\u2019ll get from me is that I\u2019m not going back to Dallas. I\u2019m going straight to Two Trees to see my grandmother. I seriously doubt that anyone would follow me. Once I\u2019m gone, this guy, whoever he is, will give up.\u201d She had to believe it. Really, why would anyone follow her?</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though she was aware the gesture didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cWell, then I\u2019ll know who he is. The first person from Dallas who sets foot in Two Trees will realize that I\u2019ve purchased another gun. And I\u2019ll be ready to shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah, tell me what went wrong. I get that you\u2019re upset about the phone. I really do think that a complete communications blackout is necessary until we catch this man.\u201d Slade sounded so reasonable she almost found herself agreeing with him.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe explaining that to me like I had a brain in my head would have worked.\u201d She could be reasonable. Or, she would have been, had they given her the chance.</p><p>Slade took her hand in his. She found herself turning her face up to him. He was so beautiful, with high cheekbones, a strong chin, and thick, dark lashes that framed blue eyes able to go from kind to hot in an instant. She wanted to run her hands through his inky hair and wrap herself around him. She wanted, in that moment, to be everything he desired\u2014soft, submissive, cared for. She could just push the whole problem off in their laps and worry about nothing more than what she would have for breakfast the next day.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t give up everything she\u2019d worked so hard for just for momentary comfort.</p><p>As a girl in Two Trees, missing her absent mother and watching her sister self-destruct, she\u2019d known then that a girl had to be able to take care of herself. If she let Dex and Slade have their way now and gave over her independence, they would grow bored with a clinging vine, even though they thought that was what they wanted. She couldn\u2019t build anything with them if they didn\u2019t respect her.</p><p>She took a step back and pulled her hand from Slade\u2019s. His face fell.</p><p>\u201cHannah, please. Can\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe could have talked earlier in the day. I would have listened. But now that I understand exactly what you want, I can\u2019t be that woman.\u201d Dex\u2019s face had gone shock white. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you listening? I\u2019m saying I want to go home and I don\u2019t want either of you to call me. I don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d She hated the words. She might regret them, but she would regret it more if she stayed and they walked away when the sex wore off.</p> <p>Dex\u2019s face was a stony mask. \u201cMessage received. You\u2019re still staying here for a day or two so we can hunt down your stalker. If you want to call the cops after that, I\u2019ll take whatever they want to give me. I promise I won\u2019t touch you again. If we can\u2019t figure this out in a day or two, I\u2019ll let you go home, but you\u2019ll have bodyguards until this man is caught.\u201d Hannah didn\u2019t like the tense set of his jaw. She wanted to soothe him, but forced herself to stand strong. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I see the wisdom of your plan. No more than two days. After that, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s face was bunched in a sad sort of confusion. \u201cIs this because I took your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. Let\u2019s call it a pattern of behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d Slade said. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re regretting the spanking thing, we don\u2019t have to do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Dex put a hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s done. She doesn\u2019t want us. We can\u2019t force her, as much as we\u2019d like to. It\u2019s against the rules. We never gave her a safe word, but if we had, she would have spit it out by now. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s mine. I come on too strong.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s right. I\u2019m a fuck-up. Now let\u2019s go and give her some privacy. I\u2019ll start running those reports.\u201d</p><p>Dex turned back to her, his face so polite it tore at her heart. \u201cHannah, I swear we\u2019ll catch this bastard. We won\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s stare burned into her. \u201cThat\u2019s a promise. In the meantime, if you need anything, we\u2019re just down the hall. And here\u2019s your phone. Please, I\u2019m begging you, don\u2019t call anyone.\u201d He slipped the phone into her hand. She clutched it, her stomach in turmoil. They were leaving. That was what she wanted, demanded even. But she couldn\u2019t stand the defeat on their faces. Or the way Dex almost looked through her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a fuck-up,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>Dex shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI am, darlin\u2019. Your rejection isn\u2019t a big surprise. I guess, deep down, I knew you could never really want me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hurt for him. She knew his background. Not a lot had worked out for Dex Townsend. \u201cIf you had talked to me, maybe we could have worked it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d only make the same choices again. I\u2019m like a dumb old dog. I\u2019m never going to learn a new trick. I see you in danger, and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to protect and shelter you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah,\u201d Slade jumped in. \u201cWe really were trying to protect you, not take away your independence. I can see why you\u2019d be upset, but this wasn\u2019t some ploy to trick or deceive or use you. We were trying to wrap you up so tight that nothing and no one could ever hurt you. We only wanted a chance to keep you, make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand this. One day we\u2019re friends, and the next you\u2019re all over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe overwhelmed you, I see that now,\u201d Slade said. \u201cThe idea of a relationship with two dominant men would be daunting for most women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationship? You didn\u2019t even ask me on a date. You just went straight for the panties. No preliminaries.\u201d</p><p>The righteous scowl on Dex\u2019s face made her take a step back. \u201cNo dates? No preliminaries?</p><p>You think that I just woke up this morning and decided I wanted you and took you?\u201d It had sure seemed that way, but his tone suggested something much different. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all the lunches and dinners don\u2019t count?\u201d</p><p>He and Slade had taken her out at least once a week for almost six months. \u201cThose were about business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were excuses, Hannah,\u201d Slade said with a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re not our admin. You\u2019re Gavin\u2019s. When we decided we wanted you, Dex and I decided to go slow, ease you into this. It\u2019s not exactly a traditional relationship.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, but she\u2019d been crazy about the entire James Gang from the moment she\u2019d met them. Something had fallen into place the first time she\u2019d been in a room with all three.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we fucking smooth?\u201d Dex said, bitterness dripping. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even realize we were interested.\u201d</p><p>Only because she was brutally inexperienced. Hannah hadn\u2019t dated much in high school.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to the local college, but by then her grandmother was ill. She\u2019d never had much time to herself, even since coming to Dallas. She was usually busy with work. Now she thought back over the last year and could see some signs she shouldn\u2019t have missed.</p><p>\u201cYou remembered my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we did,\u201d Slade replied. \u201cWe planned it for weeks. We\u2019ve already started planning next year\u2019s, though I will admit it was going to be better than a little cake and a couple of presents.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d given her the eBook reader she\u2019d been coveting, and she loved it. Maybe they\u2019d paid more attention to her as a person than she\u2019d thought. \u201cI liked my party.\u201d They had thrown it for her at one of Hannah\u2019s favorite diners. It wasn\u2019t really their speed.</p><p>When she\u2019d gone after work for a down south, home-cooked meal, they\u2019d been waiting for her.</p><p>If they\u2019d had nothing but seduction on their minds, it would have been more advantageous for Slade and Dex to take her some place quiet and upscale, get her alone and tipsy, then whisk her back to their lair. Instead, they had invited her friends, sipped iced tea with her, and smiled all evening. When they\u2019d walked her to her door, neither had asked for a \u201cnightcap.\u201d Instead, they\u2019d hugged her, kissed her forehead, watched her walk into her apartment, and left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it, Hannah.\u201d Slade sent her a sad smile.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you see in me. Or maybe I\u2019m afraid I do, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think we see in you?\u201d Dex asked.</p><p>\u201cA quiet submissive? Do you like me because I do what I\u2019m told?\u201d Dex almost choked, and Slade slapped a hand over his face, howling.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do what you\u2019re told, Hannah. Didn\u2019t I ask you a couple of days ago to stock my office with Cokes?\u201d Dex asked.</p><p>Hannah winced. He had. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen tea is very healthy.\u201d She\u2019d expected him to complain more, but when she\u2019d smiled at him, he\u2019d just said thank you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Dex replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd he drank every single one,\u201d Slade countered. \u201cHow about the time you took the keys to Dex\u2019s motorcycle and my car after we had a beer at the office happy hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dex nodded. \u201cI still have that written down in a note for future punishment.\u201d Fine. So she wasn\u2019t always obedient. \u201cI gave them back when I knew you\u2019d be sober. And I only did those things because I was trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>The second the words were out, she wanted to take them back.</p><p>Slade sent her a sly glare. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound an awful lot like the reason I took your phone, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he shot back. \u201cYou said that you were trying to protect us. Well, we tried to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it because I didn\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Slade crossed his bulging arms over his big chest. \u201cStill not seeing how it\u2019s different.\u201d Were they both dumb? \u201cI wasn\u2019t just looking out for my sex toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, we\u2019re not either. I could have one of those in the next five minutes if I just wanted to get laid. Dex, too. We\u2019re in it for way more than sex. If you haven\u2019t figured that out yet, tell me how we can prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you kidnapped me, forced me to come to Alaska with you, and lied to me, you made that impossible.\u201d</p><p>They stared at her. She could feel displeasure coming off them in waves. This was how a relationship with them would work. Everything would be a fight. They would always want to control and protect her.</p><p>Hannah could handle them. She wasn\u2019t really afraid of being steamrolled, but of herself and how much she wanted them. How much of herself she\u2019d be willing to surrender in order to keep them.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to believe that,\u201d Slade insisted. \u201cSo we screwed up. You\u2019ve already stopped caring for us?\u201d</p><p>No. Never.</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand that I\u2019m not fragile.\u201d It was a bit of a revelation. She\u2019d always thought of herself as quiet. But that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t strong.</p><p>\u201cIf you think we don\u2019t know that, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Slade smiled again, as though he knew she was coming around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHannah, darlin\u2019...\u201d He started to reach for her, then yanked his fist away. \u201cWe never meant to imply that you aren\u2019t strong and smart.\u201d</p><p>Dex, for all his arrogance, required a softer touch. He didn\u2019t believe in himself yet. Didn\u2019t think he belonged. But she could help him. After he answered a simple question.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wants to know why we want her. I believe she\u2019s under the mistaken impression that we selected her almost at random simply because she\u2019s pretty and submissive.\u201d Slade nearly read her mind.</p><p>When Dex looked at her again, his face was gentler than she\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cI remember the day you walked in the door. You were wearing a denim skirt to a job interview.\u201d She flushed. She\u2019d only been off the bus from Lubbock, which didn\u2019t even bother to stop in Two Trees, for a handful of hours. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t fashion forward. And I was interviewing for a mailroom job, if you recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I recall. I watched you wait in the lobby. There was another woman interviewing for the same position. I listened to the two of you talk. Do you remember what you did?\u201d He\u2019d seen that? \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You got up and told the receptionist that you were no longer available for the job because the other applicant had three kids and a husband who\u2019d just walked out on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was going to get kicked out of her apartment. I couldn\u2019t take that job away from her. I knew it was down to just the two of us. If I hadn\u2019t been very sure she would get the job once I bowed out, I wouldn\u2019t have left. Besides, I never made it to the door because the receptionist...\u201d She frowned. \u201cWait, you called her. You told her to stop me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe ran all over the building trying to find me,\u201d Slade said. \u201cWhen I came down and talked to you, I realized that I wanted you as much as Dex did. You smiled at me and started talking about your cat, and I was a goner. I scrambled to move enough people around to secure you a junior admin position. A month later, when Gavin\u2019s admin quit, we moved you where you belonged.\u201d</p><p>Dex took a long breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re just some submissive to put in our bed. I admire the hell out you, Hannah. You\u2019re feminine and giving and sweet, things I didn\u2019t grow up knowing a whole lot about. I learn from you every day. In fact, I think that I became a better man the minute I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gasped. That wasn\u2019t desire on his face, in his voice, but true, genuine love. Tears welled up, then rolled in hot streaks down her face.</p><p>\u201cYou made me see a future,\u201d Slade murmured, taking her hand in his. \u201cI had everything money could buy, but I was a hollow bastard who only thought of the next conquest, whether business or pleasure. You taught me about making someone happy, not because I expected something in return, but just to see the smile on their face. That was all you, Hannah.\u201d She sobbed, bit her lip, and looked at them with her heart in her eyes. Goodness, she\u2019d misunderstood them completely. She\u2019d let her insecurity get in her way. Did she really want to let her best chance at happiness walk through the door because she was afraid?</p><p>Dex turned to go. \u201cBut if we aren\u2019t what you want, Hannah...we\u2019ll protect you until this is settled, then we\u2019ll leave you.\u201d</p><p>He was heading for the door? Slade stood, watching, waiting and hopeful. Dex had obviously missed her signs. That\u2019s okay. She would rather show him.</p> <p>Hannah walked straight up to Dex and grabbed his elbow.</p><p>He turned, eyes wary. \u201cHannah?\u201d</p><p>Dex spoke her name like a question, but Hannah only answered by standing on her tiptoes and staring straight into Dex Townsend\u2019s gorgeous eyes. \u201cYou two spanked me, but neither of you bothered to kiss me. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, frowned. Then her words hit him, and he wrapped his big hands around her face, his gaze delving into hers. The care he saw shining there made him wilt with relief. \u201cThat was a mistake on our part. We\u2019ll fix it now.\u201d</p><p>She felt Slade slide in behind her. His hands grazed her hips, and she felt the sweet stirrings of arousal.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019ve never been kissed, Hannah.\u201d Slade\u2019s breath was hot against her neck.</p><p>She was caught between two hard bodies, and she couldn\u2019t stop quivering. \u201cI\u2019ve been kissed Slade. I\u2019m a virgin, not a nun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho kissed you?\u201d Dex asked, his mouth hovering over hers. He was right there. So close.</p> <p>\u201cBrandon Powers kissed me at the church social behind the elm trees. He used his tongue. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d There had been a few other boys. She\u2019d dated a little in high school and once in college, but it had been hard. Her family had demanded so much of her time. She\u2019d been asked out a couple of times in the year since she\u2019d moved to Dallas, but she\u2019d always said no. She\u2019d told herself it was because she was too busy, but she knew the truth. She\u2019d been waiting for these men.</p><p>\u201cHmm, do you think we can change her mind about kissing, Slade?\u201d Slade\u2019s hands ran up her torso, dangerously close to her breasts. \u201cLet\u2019s try and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>Dex\u2019s lips touched hers, and she realized this wasn\u2019t going to be some sloppy precursor to the main event. His mouth played with hers, skimming before pulling away. He nibbled at her lips, heating her up, making her want so much more. Over and over he pressed their mouths together, while Slade kissed her ear. Who could have guessed her ear was so alive with nerves?</p><p>Slade was making every one of them light up.</p><p>Hannah opened her mouth. She wanted Dex deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, darlin\u2019?\u201d The deep chuckle that rumbled from Dex\u2019s chest told Hannah that he already knew.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He began that maddening play at her mouth again. Tantalizing, but never fulfilling.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t like kissing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer nipples like it.\u201d Slade skimmed her breasts, his fingertips dusting over their hard tips.</p><p>Hannah gasped and tried to catch a breath, but sensations rushed through her, wild and electric. She\u2019d never known anything like it. Lord, she ached for more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kissing her nipples. At least not yet,\u201d Dex pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m kissing her pretty mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not with your tongue. I want your tongue.\u201d Her cheeks heated at the words, but darn him, she was done waiting.</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d Dex tightened his grip on her and took control of the kiss.</p><p>He parted her lips with his own and his tongue slid in, dancing against hers. Her knees went out from under her as her entire body melted. Yep. She liked kissing. A lot.</p><p>Dex teased her while Slade let his hands wander everywhere. He pushed back her borrowed robe. Cool air floated over her skin, which was quickly replaced by a breath-stealing burn when Slade pinched her nipples.</p><p>\u201cBrother, I believe it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Slade\u2019s low growl made her heart skitter.</p><p>Dex kissed her one last time then turned her to Slade. \u201cNever let it be said I don\u2019t know how to share.\u201d</p><p>Hannah felt deliciously languid. This was exactly what she craved. Now that she was in the moment, she felt safe, cared for. These two men might be overprotective, but she understood now. They cared for her as much as she cared for them. And she reveled in it.</p><p>Then Slade\u2019s mouth covered hers, and he proved that he knew how to kiss just as well as his brother. He dominated her mouth, his tongue plunging and caressing, keeping her under his body, under his spell, and under no illusions that she wouldn\u2019t be giving all of her herself to them tonight.</p><p>Dex tugged the robe off her shoulders and down her body. Suddenly, she was naked between them. Her nipples rubbed against the cotton of Slade\u2019s dress shirt. Dex\u2019s rough denim abraded her tender backside. The heat built between them. The musk swirled. With the gentle touches and drugging kisses they gave her as they passed her back and forth, Hannah drowned in sensation.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how long we\u2019ve wanted this?\u201d Dex whispered against the back of her neck, making her shiver all over.</p><p>Slade feathered his lips across her jaw line and worked his way down until he found the pulse in her neck. \u201cOr how badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this, too.\u201d Hannah echoed back. \u201cI think, deep down, I secretly waited for you.\u201d In fact, she\u2019d waited her whole life to feel this connected to another human being. The fact that she was surrounded by two of the men she loved so much felt right. The only one missing was Gavin. But she put him from her mind. For tonight, it was about her, Dex, and Slade.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re happy you waited, love.\u201d Slade pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take it slow, baby.\u201d Dex ran a hand down her torso, toward her aching sex.</p><p>\u201cI want you. Both of you.\u201d That husky tone sounded nothing like her own voice.</p><p>Slade hunched over briefly and swept her into his arms. She felt delicate against him. She looked over his shoulder to find Dex following them, his hands on the buttons of his shirt. She watched as he shrugged it off and tossed it aside, revealing the kind of cut chest and abs she\u2019d only seen in magazines. Dex\u2019s body was big and muscular, covered in sun-kissed skin that she wanted to run her hands over. She could touch him, hold him. Give herself to him.</p><p>Slade strode to the big bed dominating the room. He tossed her lightly on the mattress.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s eyes widened as Dex kicked off his boots and shoved his denims off his hips. He was obviously not a great believer in underwear. His cock sprung free, big and thick with a bulbous, purple head. Dex\u2019s body was a thing of beauty.</p><p>Slade shucked his clothes, and Hannah watched, unblinking. His wide shoulders and so-ripped chest had her dropping her jaw. As his pants fell to the floor, her gaze slipped down to his cock. She felt her heart stutter. Long, thick...oh-so ready.</p><p>Honestly, she didn\u2019t know which way to look. Both men were gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cDarlin, we\u2019re going to go easy because it\u2019s your first time, but I believe in beginning as we mean to go along,\u201d Dex said, his Texas drawl thicker than ever.</p><p>Slade stood beside his brother. \u201cWhat he means, love, is that you\u2019re going to obey us in the bedroom. We can talk about most of the other decisions, but here, we are your Masters. All you have to do is trust us, darlin\u2019. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Hannah blew out a nervous breath. She was naked with two men who wanted her utter and complete obedience. She shivered at the thought of all the things they could do to her. Even so, she knew they would never hurt her physically. If she wanted this relationship to work, she had to believe they\u2019d never meant to hurt her emotionally. And she had to believe in herself.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Slade murmured. \u201cGive us the words. This has to be a conscious choice on your part. Can you obey and give yourself over to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word was barely more than a breathy murmur, but they heard it.</p><p>A sexy smile split Dex\u2019s face as he reached for her. \u201cThen spread your legs, darlin\u2019. We want to see our pussy.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took a deep breath to quell her nerves and let her legs fall open. She knew she wasn\u2019t the most beautiful woman ever, but she felt that way when they looked at her, attention rapt, eyes hot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to set up a schedule for training and maintenance. I\u2019ll call the spa when we get home.\u201d Slade stared, his eyes going straight between her legs.</p><p>\u201cTraining? Maintenance?\u201d What were they talking about?</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Slade commanded. \u201cNo talking. It\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t handle, baby. I have faith in you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth. Oddly, she took their word that whatever they had in mind, she would have no problem managing it. They sought her submission now, but as long as her voice was heard outside the bedroom, she could give them what they needed.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. When we talk about training, we\u2019re talking about teaching you to be our perfect submissive. We\u2019re going to train your body to accept pleasure and dominance, while you learn to please us in return,\u201d Dex explained. \u201cWe\u2019ll introduce you to bondage and some forms of exotic play.\u201d</p><p>To someone with so little experience, it all sounded ridiculously over her head. But this was Dex and Slade. They would take care of her. They would open a whole new world for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd the maintenance refers to a regular waxing regimen we\u2019ll insist on for that pretty pussy.\u201d Slade\u2019s lips curved into a wicked grin. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so pink and pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always shave her in the morning. I would do it tonight, but I don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d If anyone would have asked her in the past how she felt about altering her body in such a personal way to suit them, she would have balked. But now it sounded so simple. They weren\u2019t asking a lot, and it pleased them. Pleasing them made her happy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slade got down on one knee. \u201cDo you understand what he\u2019s saying? Soon, we\u2019re going to take you into that shower and spread your legs. I\u2019ll hold you down, and he\u2019s going to shave that pussy of ours until it\u2019s ripe and bare and pretty as a peach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-all right.\u201d Her voice shook almost as much as she did. She wanted to say it was nerves, but Hannah knew better. Excitement coursed through every muscle until she shook.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t think I won\u2019t taste her just the way it is. Slade, you got to spank her. It\u2019s my turn to play.\u201d</p><p>Slade climbed onto the big bed and wedged himself behind her. She could feel the hard line of his erection against her spine as he pulled her back, his chest to her back, cradling her in his arms. He caught her ankles with his legs and spread her wide, kissing her temple, her neck, as Dex climbed between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to eat your pussy, love. He\u2019s going to make a feast out of you.\u201d Slade\u2019s voice had gone dark and deep, seducing her with words. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch and feel every shudder and twitch you make.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Her womb clenched. She could hardly wait.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you smell.\u201d Dex took a deep breath, letting his nose touch her labia. Hannah felt so vulnerable, and somehow that excited her even more. She loved the way Slade\u2019s body wrapped around hers, anchoring her. In other circumstances, she would be horribly embarrassed by what they were doing to her, but now it seemed right.</p><p>And then she wasn\u2019t thinking about anything but the slow slide of Dex\u2019s tongue rasping against her flesh, lighting up every one of her nerves. She tried to arch, to demand more, but Slade\u2019s grip tightened.</p><p>\u201cNo, Hannah. You be still. Take what Dex gives you.\u201d</p><p>He licked his way up her swollen folds slowly, followed by a torturous flick over her clit.</p><p>She gasped, every sensation so stirring. He made her dizzy. He made her feel alive. She writhed between the two men, wondering how she\u2019d ever survive such pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLet him lead, Hannah,\u201d Slade insisted. \u201cIf you misbehave, we\u2019ll tie you down. We\u2019re fully equipped here. We can bind your hands to the headboard and strap down your torso, but my favorite part will be fitting your legs to the spreader. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re comfortable, but you won\u2019t be able to shift even an inch. Your pretty thighs will be so wide.\u201d Hannah moaned as Dex continued to nibble on her pussy. He pulled one soft fold into his mouth, sucking briefly, then the other. He was devouring her like a sweet treat. His tongue slipped in and out, plunging deep, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough. There wasn\u2019t an inch of her he didn\u2019t taste. The orgasm built inside her. Now that she\u2019d had one, she recognized the sensations.</p><p>And she longed for it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dex.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s hands went straight to her nipples. He pinched them with a punishing little twist.</p><p>Hannah gasped as that tiny bite of pain opened a livewire straight to her pussy. Arousal jolted her, hovered, like it played on a knife\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cThat got her juices flowing, brother.\u201d Dex chuckled, the vibration resonating against her sensitive flesh.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to talk.\u201d Slade pinched her again, making Hannah mewl. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll put these incredibly sensitive nipples in clamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have them pierced. Hmm...\u201d</p><p>Hannah started to say something, but Dex nipped the nubbin of her clit between his teeth.</p><p>She whimpered as he toyed with her, gently biting and laving.</p><p>\u201cI like that thought. Dainty little bejeweled rings.\u201d Slade\u2019s tongue traced the shell of her ear.</p><p>His fingers still played with her breasts. \u201cWe can run a chain through them and tug when we want to arouse her. You\u2019d never get me off you then, baby.\u201d</p> <p>Even the thought made her tremble. But all they needed to do to arouse her was to walk in the room. It had always been that way.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip to keep from pleading again. She wanted to come. She was so close.</p><p>And Dex merely toyed with her, pulling away when he knew he\u2019d driven her close to orgasm.</p><p>As she tensed and cried out again, Dex eased away to lave her thigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to begin her training as soon as possible. She has zero discipline. She\u2019s almost gone off three times since I put my mouth on her.\u201d</p><p>Slade tsked behind her, as if she was a naughty school girl. \u201cThat won\u2019t do. We can\u2019t have her coming every time we touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was the point,\u201d Hannah groused, and then hissed as Slade tortured her nipples once more. This time the punishment was accompanied by Dex\u2019s short slap to her pussy, which had Hannah bucking. But Slade\u2019s iron grip wouldn\u2019t allow her to move. He forced her to lie still and take it.</p><p>\u201cYour orgasms belong to your Masters,\u201d Slade explained. \u201cJust like your body belongs to us.</p><p>We\u2019re going to teach you to accept pleasure and to discipline your responses so you can come on command. Would you like that, love? Would you like for us to look at you during one of our office parties, and with a simple touch or one word be able to get you off? You\u2019ll be so well trained that no one will know what\u2019s happening besides you and your men. We\u2019ll always be close, always willing to bring you pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to receive it,\u201d Dex added. \u201cI can picture that party. After we make our girl come a few times, we\u2019ll find a nice place away from the crowd so we can lift your skirts. Then you\u2019ll take our cocks. You\u2019ll know to keep quiet or everyone will hear you. Everyone will know just how well we\u2019re fucking you.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought she could get aroused merely with words, but her sex clenched and spasmed. It felt so good\u2014far beyond anything she\u2019d imagined. She wanted everything they were offering.</p><p>\u201cBut I think since she\u2019s a novice, we can forgo the rituals tonight. It would just delay the good stuff.\u201d Dex\u2019s tongue came out to lick at her clit.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019m very eager to get my cock inside that cunt, but I\u2019ll leave the actual deflowering to you, brother. I did get to spank her first, and you were the one to find her.\u201d Dex groaned. \u201cLet\u2019s get her ready.\u201d</p><p>Dex\u2019s fingers poised at the entrance of her pussy. He gently worked one inside her. Then another. Hannah fought not to squirm as he filled her, his rough hands oddly gentle, but providing friction that sent her even closer to the edge. It felt so good, even as he stretched her, scissoring his fingers, and it burned. What would it feel like when he was inside her? And Slade, too? She might be a virgin, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve. If they intended to share her, she knew what that meant. They would fill her front and back. What would it feel like then? A wave of heat scorched her at the thought.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still so fucking tight.\u201d Dex shoved his fingers in a bit farther.</p><p>Slade held her closer and ran his tongue up her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll bet. She\u2019s going to have the tightest pussy we\u2019ve ever fucked.\u201d</p><p>She was going to be their last one, too. A savage possessiveness was overtaking her. They thought they were the barbarians, but maybe she could be one, too. Hannah reveled in the passion she felt. Love had been a quiet thing before this moment. Her feelings for her grandmother had been a gentle camaraderie. Loving her mother and sister had required sacrifice and patience. But this, oh, this required a kind of trust she\u2019d never given. It challenged her courage...yet it was as natural as breathing. She was allowed to be greedy in her love for them.</p><p>Hannah grabbed it with both hands and held it to her heart. These men were steady anchors, and for the first time in her life, she felt certain that she could fly.</p><p>\u201cCome for us, baby.\u201d Dex growled the words, then sucked her clit between his lips. His fingers moved in time, curling up and finding some sweet spot Hannah hadn\u2019t known existed.</p><p>Sensations piled up under her clit, inside her body, building, converging. The orgasm rushed over her like a tidal wave, sure and powerful, drowning her in need and leaving her gasping for more. Her body jerked, but Slade continued to hold her tight, utterly safe in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat was so beautiful.\u201d He kissed her temple with a sweet affection that softened her after the violent orgasm.</p><p>\u201cAnd she tastes so good. She came all over my mouth.\u201d Dex dropped a similarly gentle kiss on her pussy, before looking up at her through the thick fringe of his dark lashes. \u201cWe want you so badly, Hannah. Let me make you ours.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled into a shy smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Dex looked up at Hannah, and his heart constricted. She was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen. As she rested against Slade, her soft honey hair spread out across his brother\u2019s chest.</p><p>She arched and slowly blinked, revealing slumberous green eyes. Her lips parted; her mouth relaxed. Hannah looked so well loved. He and Slade had put that look on her face. That fact made him proud\u2014and hungry to do it again.</p><p>And she\u2019d said yes. She\u2019d invited him into her untouched body. Dex\u2019s cock swelled, and he\u2019d been pretty damn sure he couldn\u2019t get harder than when Hannah\u2019s cream pulsed from her pussy onto his tongue. He\u2019d been wrong. Now, his entire body was hard, excruciatingly aware of what he was about to do. Still, he hesitated. God, he wanted to get it right.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s lips curved up invitingly. She reached out and touched his hair. \u201cJust love me, Dex.\u201d</p><p>That was his Hannah. So giving. He loved her wild and wanton side, but her soft heart pulled him to her every time. \u201cI love you, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>She should know that the man who claimed her body first was mad about her. Dex looked up at his brother, who stared down at Hannah with desire and joy. The second man who would claim her adored her, too. They would wrap her in their love. She wouldn\u2019t want for anything.</p><p>Dex got to his knees, his cock standing straight up his body. He stroked himself a few times, enjoying the way Hannah\u2019s eyes widened. He reached over to the nightstand and pulled out a condom.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was sure of himself.\u201d Her words were sassy, but she kept watching the way he rolled the condom over his rock-hard erection.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to put that fucking condom on. He wanted to take her bare, to spend himself deep inside her body, but he didn\u2019t have that right yet. When they were married and settled, he and Slade would talk with Hannah about starting a family. Until then, his caveman urge to fill her with every drop of his seed would have to wait.</p><p>\u201cWe were sure of the three of us being right together,\u201d Slade clarified.</p><p>Dex settled himself between her legs. Her pussy still glistened with moisture from her recent orgasm.</p><p>Slade palmed her luscious, round breasts, thumbing her nipples until she moaned. \u201cYou\u2019re so precious, baby. We\u2019re going to make you feel so good. So loved.\u201d Dex wanted to show her just how much. Taking a calming breath, he lined his cock up to her pussy and watched as he began to sink inside that warm, sweet body.</p><p>Tight. God, she was so tight. He\u2019d never been in a pussy that gripped him and threatened to rip his control away so immediately. It was a gorgeous sight, his big cock disappearing into her pussy. Dex gritted his teeth and forced himself to take her inch by inch, slowly plunging inside, gritting his teeth as he gave her time to adjust.</p><p>When she whimpered, fingers clasping Slade\u2019s thighs, his brother kissed her mouth, his tongue rolling in slow and deep, while Dex\u2019s dick sank down, thrusting past her barrier.</p><p>Hannah stiffened, and Slade thumbed her nipples, his lips soothing against her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s almost in, baby. Just a little more and you\u2019re ours. It\u2019ll be all pleasure then. Take a deep breath.\u201d She did, and relaxed enough for Dex to delve in another inch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big,\u201d Hannah moaned, wriggling.</p><p>He paused, cupping her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to be careful, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just give me all of you.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, that turned him on. Heat sliced through his belly, fired through his balls. She was going to get all of him. No way could he hold back now.</p><p>With a grunt, Dex tilted his hips up and shoved deep inside her pussy. After a second of resistance, her flesh parted like melted butter, and he finally sank in all the way to his balls.</p><p>Hannah gasped, holding Slade tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ours now, Hannah,\u201d Slade murmured, tilting her chin up and fisting a hand in her hair for another possessive kiss.</p><p>Dex held himself still, watching her soften under his brother\u2019s mouth. While Dex filled Hannah, their mate, completely with his cock, he took a moment to enjoy the feeling of rightness. But she constricted like a hot, silken vise on his dick. He wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, brother,\u201d he said, desperate for her to find pleasure in the act.</p><p>Slade\u2019s hand left her breast and trailed down to her clit, gently pressing. Hannah\u2019s eyes widened. Her breathing shallowed.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She spoke the one plea Dex couldn\u2019t refuse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slade smiled. \u201cHer clit is hard and so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s clamping down on me. I don\u2019t know how long I can hold out.\u201d Dex withdrew almost entirely, then thrust back in.</p><p>The walls of her pussy sucked at him, clung, shoving him ever closer to release. He set a gentle pace, unwilling to let himself go just yet, though every muscle of his body screamed at him to fuck her until neither one could see straight. Instead, he eased in and out, so slowly that his eyes nearly rolled into the back of his head from the pleasure. Damn it, he was close. His spine was tingling. His balls drew up.</p><p>\u201cHannah, darlin\u2019, come for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor us,\u201d Slade whispered, his fingers continuing to circle her clit. \u201cNow, baby.\u201d Dex pressed up, his cock as deep in Hannah\u2019s body as he could go. She clutched at him, her nails digging into his arms. He welcomed that bite of pain. He loved Hannah submissive, but this time he wanted her wild.</p><p>He got his wish when he poured everything he had, that he was, into each and every stroke, sliding in and up with a slow force that had her wrapping her legs around him. Then she clawed at Slade, who took her mouth in another fierce kiss and swallowed her whimpers. Dex gripped her hips and shoved in again. But deeper wasn\u2019t deep enough for him. Never would be. She took him completely, passing her passion onto Slade through their frantic joining of lips.</p><p>God, desire had never seared Dex so much that the pleasure was its own kind of pain. He and Slade had shared women\u2014lots of them. He\u2019d never felt this urge to keep one close forever.</p><p>Nothing had ever felt so right. He\u2019d never felt so...complete.</p><p>She pushed up against him, fighting for her pleasure. As her pussy gripped him in rapid pulses, she cried out, her face contorting beautifully as she looked up at Slade as if silently begging for mercy. His brother had none, rubbing her clit in an insistent rhythm. Neither did Dex as he pounded her like a piston. She screamed and clenched down on him like she never wanted to let him go.</p> <p>Fuck, it was coming. He was coming. And he couldn\u2019t wait another second.</p><p>Dex plunged in again and let himself go. A shout tore from his chest. His back bowed as every drop of come erupted from his body with unstoppable force. The orgasm felt like it went on forever.</p><p>Finally sated, his shaking arms gave way, and he collapsed onto Hannah, utterly surrounded by her softness. Dex rested his head against her breast, listening as her heartbeat gradually slowed. She smoothed back his hair. This was what he\u2019d longed for all of his freaking life.</p><p>Unconditional acceptance, peace. Love.</p><p>\u201cWould you really have let me go home?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice was breathless.</p><p>Slade chuckled. \u201cYes. We would have let you go home, but you would have taken two bodyguards with you.\u201d</p> <p>Dex smiled. Hannah\u2019s nipple stood all pretty and pink, inches from his mouth. He lifted up long enough to kiss it. \u201cExactly. If you went home, you had to accept the protection we gave you. But that deal isn\u2019t available anymore. You\u2019re staying with us, Hannah. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stroke his hair, and he had to bite back a satisfied groan. He was the Master, but right now, she was the one with all the power.</p><p>\u201cI realize that. I was just surprised that you\u2019d let me go home with two men...wait, you were going to be my bodyguards, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dex looked up, and she wore the cutest pout on her face. He grinned at Slade. \u201cShe\u2019s a smart one.\u201d</p><p>Slade nodded. \u201cWe had already cleared our schedules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two move fast,\u201d Hannah groused. \u201cYou had a plan in place before I even walked out of the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to. We\u2019ll never take chances where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d Dex rolled off her and quickly disposed of the condom. She didn\u2019t need to get crushed under his weight. And he had the feeling his brother was about to stake his claim in a far more physical way.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say anything else, I need to tell you something,\u201d Hannah said, sitting up in the middle of the bed cross-legged. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls around her shoulders, cascading down her arms. He\u2019d thought she was beautiful before, but sitting here, naked, her skin glowing, she was nothing short of a goddess.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, baby? We\u2019ll always listen.\u201d Slade sat up behind her, cupping her shoulders and angling her to face him.</p><p>She hesitated, as if uncertain how to proceed. \u201cI love you both. You know that. But...I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have feelings for Gavin, too. I don\u2019t really know how this kind of relationship works. Or how you want it to work. I won\u2019t jeopardize what we have. I promise. But I want to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dex shared a long look with Slade. Despite the differences he and Gavin had, Dex didn\u2019t want to lose his brother. And he feared he was. But Gavin belonged with them\u2014and with Hannah.</p><p>Dex had only briefly known the Gavin who existed before Nikki\u2019s death. He\u2019d been serious about work, but had made the time for his brothers in those days. Gavin had been the one to pay for Dex\u2019s college and offer him a place in the family. They might argue from time to time, but Gavin was his brother. Dex had always assumed they\u2019d work through their issues someday and truly be a family.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably talk about that, darlin\u2019.\u201d Dex clasped her hand.</p><p>Slade brushed her hair from her cheek and took over. \u201cGavin is in love with you, too, Hannah. I can\u2019t tell you how happy it makes me to hear that you have feelings for him. We want him to share this happiness with us. His past hasn\u2019t always been an easy one. We\u2019ll have to move slow with Gavin, but I think he\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d</p><p>If Hannah had been in love with any other man, Dex would rip the bastard\u2019s heart out in an instant. But if Hannah could save Gavin from whatever dark path he stalked down alone, Dex would lock them in a room together and not let them out until Gavin stopped lying to himself about his feelings.</p><p>\u201cThree men.\u201d Hannah shook her head. \u201cI guess that when I go wild, I really go wild.\u201d Slade twisted on the bed and was on top of Hannah in an instant. \u201cAnother reason we love you. I think it\u2019s time you went wild again, love.\u201d</p><p>He reached for a condom and spread her legs. Dex watched, his own cock hardening again as Slade captured her mouth, eased inside her pussy, then possessed her so completely that she screamed, sobbed, and finally sighed contentedly in his arms.</p><p>The wall behind him thudded in a mocking, insistent rhythm, and Gavin wondered if his brothers were trying to set a world record for how many times they could fuck the same girl in one night. He\u2019d given up trying to sleep hours before and now sat in the darkness, staring sightlessly out the window, listening to their erotic slaps and moans. There was no doubt his brothers were having the night they had longed to share with her for a year.</p><p>He might have grinned, but they had Hannah, and they weren\u2019t just fucking her. They were making love to her, bonding with the woman they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with.</p><p>Despair crashed through him. Once again, Gavin felt just how completely he was on the outside.</p><p>Swallowing a curse, he strode across the room, unable to listen to their passion anymore.</p><p>Though their voices were muted, he knew what they were saying. His brothers were telling Hannah that they loved her. And Hannah loved them back, giving herself to them, proving her devotion. She had waited for love, and what she\u2019d given his brothers tonight was a precious gift.</p><p>Goddamn it, he\u2019d wanted to be a part of that.</p><p>Gavin slammed the door behind him. They were mere feet away. The door stood right there.</p><p>Five steps and the turn of a knob, and he could be with them. Would she turn him away? Would Dex punch him in the face? Gavin actually doubted both. For all he and Dex misunderstood each other, they shared the same desire to love Hannah thoroughly.</p><p>And Gavin couldn\u2019t forget the way she\u2019d looked at him with desire in those pretty green eyes while he\u2019d watched her come. She\u2019d welcome him, he was almost certain.</p><p>That knowledge was killing him.</p><p>Gavin stayed on the other side of the door. From here, he could love his family at a distance, take care of them without worrying that he\u2019d get too close, drag them into his shit, and destroy their lives. It was for the best.</p><p>But he would be forced to watch as Hannah married Slade and Dex. He could picture her, so lovely in her wedding dress, her eyes glowing with happiness. Eventually, the babies would come. Hannah would make a wonderful, nurturing mother. Not being a part of that felt like someone stabbing him in the heart and dragging the blade through his chest. He yearned so badly to give her at least a sliver of that happiness, to see her wear his ring or bring his child into the world.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t know that. Ever.</p><p>Gavin walked into the great room. The bay windows stood open, revealing the beauty of the Alaskan starlit darkness. It was truly nighttime here in a way that was impossible in Dallas. The twinkling stars wove together to create a blanket of diamonds overhead. The sight would fill Hannah\u2019s eyes with wonder. It would move her.</p><p>He\u2019d never brought a woman here. Never wanted to. Hannah was the first woman he\u2019d ever thought about sharing much of anything with. Then again, she was the first woman he\u2019d ever really loved.</p><p>For hours, he\u2019d sat in his darkened bedroom, listening to her moans and cries of pleasure, hoping that he could find the jealousy that would rip her from his heart. All he\u2019d managed was to adore her more for opening herself so completely to the men she loved. Envy pierced Gavin. He should probably be appalled at the thought of sharing a woman with his brothers, but somehow it made sense. If they were all truly together, they would rely on each other, take their family unit to the next level. When Hannah frustrated him, his brothers would figure her out. She would always be taken care of, no matter what. Someone would always answer her calls, hold her when she cried. She wouldn\u2019t be left alone like Nikki had been.</p><p>Nikki. God, if his brothers knew what Gavin had done to her, they wouldn\u2019t be so interested in sharing Hannah. Slade would be appalled. Dex would threaten to kill him if he so much as looked at Hannah. Gavin figured he\u2019d deserve it.</p><p>Behind him, he heard a firm knock and a familiar deep voice. \u201cGavin? Is that you?\u201d Slade. Speak of the devil.</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting someone else?\u201d Gavin quipped.</p><p>His brother turned on the light to reveal a frown. He\u2019d pulled on a pair of jeans, but wore nothing else. His hair was mussed as though Hannah had run her fingers all through it. His brother wore an unmistakable air of satisfaction on his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently half the damn company has followed us to Alaska. You never know. They might just show up on our doorstep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Preston might be that obnoxious, but I talked to Marnie. He checked in an hour ago and has been complaining about the accommodations ever since. She promised to call me if he leaves the lodge.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s face broke into an easy grin. \u201cI can imagine he\u2019s not used to dealing with anyone like Marnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told him that if he didn\u2019t like his room, he should feel free to take a hike. I believe she put him in 108.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s laugh boomed through the room, making it seem alive when just moments ago it had felt so lonely. \u201cChester will love Preston. Tell me she didn\u2019t fix the window. Tell me that old moose still sticks his head in at six in the morning, looking for treats.\u201d Gavin felt his own lips turn up. He\u2019d missed this place. Chester, despite being a moose, was known to walk into any establishment with a door big enough to accommodate his bulk. Long ago, a man had stayed with Marnie in room 108. He\u2019d thought it was funny to have the moose greet him every morning, so he\u2019d trained Chester to seek treats. Though the man had moved on, the people of River Run continued the tradition. Preston was in for a rather rude awakening.</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d Slade sobered as he sat in the chair nearby. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be here alone.\u201d His brother\u2019s soft words made his gut clench. He attempted to maintain a placid demeanor. \u201cI prefer the solitude, Slade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Come on, man. Talk to me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your head.</p><p>Hannah has feelings for you. She admitted it to me and Dex. She wants to be with all of us.</p><p>You\u2019re the only one maintaining distance, and I don\u2019t get it. I know you love her.\u201d Gavin\u2019s irritation rose like a kettle getting ready to boil over. \u201cDo I need to put it in the plainest terms possible? I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. This is about Nikki. She\u2019s dead, and you feel guilty for being alive. I never understood why you\u2019d waste your emotion on her. I can\u2019t keep this a secret any longer. I overheard her telling one of her trailer-trash girlfriends that she was only interested in your money and your position. She didn\u2019t love you. Damn it, Gavin, she came onto me just before she died, when she thought she was losing you. I had planned to tell you, but when she died, it didn\u2019t seem right to pile that knowledge on top of an already tragic incident. Now I wonder if I made the right decision. You\u2019ve damn near buried yourself with her. I can\u2019t stand to watch a ghost drag you down any more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cold filled Gavin\u2019s gut. He\u2019d known most of that, but it didn\u2019t change anything. What right did his younger brother have to throw this shit in his face? He might have started the relationship with Nikki with the best of intentions, but the most they had ever had together was good sex.</p><p>He\u2019d never intended to marry her, never been in love with her. He hadn\u2019t even cared when she\u2019d threatened to kill herself.</p><p>Do what you have to, Nikki.</p><p>His own cold words echoed in his brain. All he needed to keep him away from Hannah was to think about the past. He didn\u2019t deserve another chance after Nikki\u2019s demise. And especially not after what had happened to...</p> <p>Gavin didn\u2019t dare finish the thought. Instead, he turned to his brother, eager to strike back. It was the only way to end his constant beating at Gavin\u2019s well-built defenses. \u201cHannah is a lovely girl, Slade. I am very happy that you and Dex have finally gotten between her legs. If you want to marry her, hell, I\u2019ll pay for the wedding, but she\u2019s not for me. I need someone with more style, more polish. Can you imagine me inviting investors over? She\u2019s a sweet thing, but she wouldn\u2019t last a minute with society matrons. They would eat her alive. Sure, I\u2019d enjoy fucking Hannah, but marriage and kids?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly build a life with her.\u201d A little gasp from the doorway froze Gavin\u2019s heart. He turned, and Hannah stood in the hallway, Dex by her side. She was wearing a robe that couldn\u2019t quite conceal the gorgeous bounty of her breasts. Dex\u2019s arm came around her middle, pulling her to him. Even in the low light, Gavin couldn\u2019t mistake his hard eyes and furious snarl.</p><p>But Gavin couldn\u2019t take it back, no matter how much it hurt to cause Hannah pain. It was better this way. They were all better off without him. He could plainly see that if he didn\u2019t end their hope now, they would never stop hounding him to get over Nikki and build a family with Hannah. And it might be cowardly, but he much preferred that they hate him for maligning Hannah than know the truth. Perhaps one day, when they were older, they\u2019d forgive him for a few cruel words. They\u2019d never forgive what he\u2019d done to Nikki.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Hannah,\u201d Gavin managed to say in an even tone, though his heart wrenched. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled as though she was holding in some strong emotion. Pride obviously won because her chin came up. \u201cWhat you just said tore my heart out. And you\u2019re wrong. I can hold my own with anyone. I would have made a great wife. You won\u2019t find a woman who would have been a better mother to your children. But if all you\u2019re looking for is someone to keep your social calendar and look pretty at company parties, then I don\u2019t want you. I suggest you find another admin, Mr. James.\u201d</p><p>God, he\u2019d planted the knife in his own chest, but with her words, she\u2019d just turned it. But that was for the best, too.</p> <p>She turned her face up to Dex\u2019s. \u201cI think I lost my appetite. I just want to go to bed. Could we do that?\u201d</p><p>Dex didn\u2019t hesitate. He pulled her closer, his big arms cradling her, protecting her from the world. \u201cOf course, darlin\u2019. You go on. Slade and I will be down in a minute.\u201d He kissed her forehead, and she walked down the hall, as regal as any princess. She was right. She would make a hell of a wife. Now, he would never marry because the only woman he wanted was one he could never have.</p><p>The instant Hannah walked around the corner, Dex turned on him. His fists were balls of fury. Slade stepped between them, but Gavin almost wished he hadn\u2019t. Letting Dex beat him might provide some small atonement. It would sure as hell be better than living with Hannah\u2019s face haunting his dreams.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a despicable son of a bitch,\u201d Dex snarled his way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprised?\u201d Gavin tossed back. He felt like burning down everything. Something nasty had ahold of his gut. If he destroyed everything, maybe he could finally be alone with his guilt.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Slade snapped at him, bracing both hands against their youngest brother\u2019s chest to prevent a pending assault. \u201cDex, he didn\u2019t mean a fucking word of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop talking for me.\u201d Slade\u2019s insistence on his innate goodness was starting to grate on Gavin. No matter what he did or said, Slade simply wouldn\u2019t let him be. \u201cI meant everything I said. Hannah is fine, but my position is all about image, and I can\u2019t take a little country girl as my bride. If the two of you want to saddle yourself with a girl who has a community college education and no real manners, then good for you.\u201d</p><p>Dex paused. His arms came down, unwilling to continue the fight. That disappointed Gavin.</p><p>\u201cSlade\u2019s right. You\u2019re full of shit. I know you love that woman. What the hell are you hiding?\u201d Dex demanded.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s stomach turned. The last thing he wanted was Dex checking into the past. Slade would wait, never imagining that his brother would keep something from him. For Dex, trust came hard. He\u2019d dig up everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything. I\u2019ve stated plainly that I don\u2019t want a relationship with Hannah.\u201d Dex glared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to marry Hannah. You\u2019re far too interested in your corporate image, right? Well then explain this to me, Gavin. As Black Oak\u2019s CEO, there isn\u2019t a woman more involved in your life or your business than your secretary. You\u2019ve allowed Hannah to plan your parties, act as your hostess. She\u2019s always handled herself perfectly. You\u2019ve said it yourself. So don\u2019t give me this crap. She\u2019s practically been your wife in every way but one. Now you find fault with her? There\u2019s something else going on, and I intend to find out what it is. Do you want to save me the trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Dex. And stay out of my business.\u201d He charged.</p><p>Slade slapped a hand to Gavin\u2019s chest to ward him off. His eyes narrowed as he pushed back, then glanced Dex\u2019s way. \u201cLet\u2019s go and take care of Hannah, brother. Gavin has some serious thinking to do about coming clean because I think he\u2019s definitely hiding something. If he is, we\u2019ll find it. And there will be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>In silent unison, Dex and Slade strode toward the bedroom, where Hannah was probably crying.</p> <p>Gavin flipped off the lights again and slumped down into the nearest chair, completely weary. He had to find a way to distract them from digging into Nikki\u2019s death. He could handle rehashing it; he did that nearly every day in his head. But he couldn\u2019t handle their censure, their disgust, when they learned the truth. Fuck, no matter what he did, he was going to lose his brothers. He\u2019d already lost Hannah. He wouldn\u2019t have her cheery smile to look forward to any more. No longer could he fool himself into thinking that someday he\u2019d find a way to be with her.</p><p>That dream was over.</p><p>It was always over. It was over the minute you hung up the phone and left Nikki to die.</p><p>He sat for the longest time and finally managed to fall asleep. His dreams were filled with visions of Hannah and her teary eyes.</p><p>It seemed like an instant later when he felt his phone vibrate, and came awake. There was a horrible pain in his neck. He\u2019d slept at an odd angle, but he hadn\u2019t been able to make his feet move to his bedroom. It had been one thing to listen to Hannah\u2019s cries of pleasure. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle her tears.</p><p>The phone chirped again. It was, as always, close to him, tucked into the pocket of his pants.</p><p>Work was the only place where he hadn\u2019t heinously fucked up, and he meant to keep it that way.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he pulled out the device to find a text. He looked at the clock. It was almost eight in the morning. Light flooded the room, and Gavin wished he\u2019d closed the curtains.</p><p>He could smell coffee percolating somewhere in the kitchen.</p><p>When he pulled up the text, he didn\u2019t recognize the number.</p><p>Stay away from Hannah. I know everything, Mr. Hot Shot. You can\u2019t bury it. If you don\u2019t let Hannah go, I\u2019ll release all the documents related to your girlfriend\u2019s death and take you down.</p><p>Gavin stared at the words, reading them again, dread drumming through him. After the longest time, he stood and walked toward his study. He didn\u2019t need coffee. He needed a lot of mind-numbing alcohol because his fucking past was finally going to catch up with him.</p><p>No way would he turn Hannah loose so this creep could get his hands on her. He would never give up her future to protect his past.</p><p>He loved her, and she\u2019d never know how much. She\u2019d never know that he\u2019d willingly sacrificed everything for her.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Slade walked into Black Oak Oil\u2019s Alaska offices feeling like a new man. He\u2019d left Hannah at the breakfast table, spooning a bit of sugar into her coffee. He\u2019d kissed her forehead and told her he\u2019d be back soon. It had been the perfect picture of intimacy. A man and his wife parting ways for the day.</p><p>Of course, Dex had kissed her, too. Maybe not totally conventional, but it worked for Slade.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to kill Ward, or do I get the honors?\u201d Dex asked.</p><p>He smiled at the threat from his hotheaded brother. Slade could always count on Dex to offer up a good, old-fashioned ass kicking to anyone who deserved it. \u201cHow about we figure out if he\u2019s the one who\u2019s been stalking Hannah before we bury him somewhere?\u201d Dex sighed in disappointment. \u201cI hate it when you\u2019re logical.\u201d The site office was small and underwhelming compared to the corporate offices. The place was utilitarian with white walls and concrete floors. Somehow, Slade felt more at home here than he ever did at corporate. He loved fieldwork and had been behind a desk far too long. He preferred roughnecks and spending time on platforms. He felt perfectly comfortable with the employees at River Run, but it was obvious, even from a distance, that Preston Ward III didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><p>\u201cThis is not protocol.\u201d Preston\u2019s voice rang through the small building. It was worse than nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>Dex\u2019s eyes rolled. \u201cBe sure to call me if you change your mind and need someone to kill the son of a bitch. I\u2019m going to get an update from Burke and Cole. Then I\u2019ll do a little snooping of my own.\u201d</p><p>Slade nodded. He would handle Preston better than Dex, and they had both agreed it was past time they figured out what was eating at Gavin.</p><p>After Dex walked toward the main office, Slade wound his way to the small group of IT</p><p>cubicles. Preston Ward stood in the middle of the room, incongruous in his thousand dollar suit, staring down his Harvard nose at the squatty man with the mop of black hair and a face that proudly proclaimed his Inuit heritage. Ben Kunayak ran this place. He was shorter than Preston, but given the mulish set of his mouth, he was also meaner. Slade thought seriously about just stepping back and letting Ben do their dirty work, but then he wouldn\u2019t get the necessary information\u2014or the satisfaction.</p><p>Two young men had joined Preston from corporate, both obviously IT employees. Slade thought he recognized the thin, sad-looking, brown-haired man as Lyle Franklin, the head of the help desk. Lyle stood with Preston, but the other twenty-something man, a pencil pusher dressed in a checked shirt with pale hair and fingers flying over his keyboard, sat behind his laptop. Crap, Scott Kirkwood. The little punk who\u2019d tried to have an \u201cimportant\u201d lunch with Hannah. Bullshit.</p><p>With a sigh, Slade let his presence be known.</p><p>\u201cSlade, thank god you\u2019re here. You need to fire this man this instant.\u201d Preston pointed at Ben. \u201cHe\u2019s rude to his superiors and obviously has no understanding of Black Oak protocol or regulations. I believe the men up here have been using company computers to access pornography.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what had Preston\u2019s panties in a twist? Slade snorted. Of course. These were a group of roughnecks in a city where men outnumbered women five to one and reliable Internet was tough to come by. He would have been shocked if they weren\u2019t accessing online porn.</p><p>\u201cThis employee has been allowing it to happen.\u201d Preston\u2019s fingers tapped against Ben\u2019s desk in a rapid, irritating accusation. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s all but defended the practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found at least four machines with restricted IP addresses in their browsing histories.\u201d Lyle Franklin had a thin face and obviously believed in sunscreen. \u201cI don\u2019t think bugs caught from porn sites are the actual reason for our shutdown, but they could certainly cause problems in the future. It shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201d</p><p>So now the corporate IT department had become the morality police. Great. Slade had the urge to fire all three of them. If he got rid of them, he\u2019d almost certainly be cutting off whatever access this stalker had to Hannah. But that wasn\u2019t going to make the son of a bitch go away, and Slade wanted to nail this bastard for good.</p><p>\u201cIf Internet porn isn\u2019t the problem now, let\u2019s focus on what is.\u201d Slade turned to the IT</p><p>executive. \u201cPreston, I\u2019m sure that Lyle and Scott can figure it out.\u201d He might not trust any of them with Hannah, but he knew from experience that they were more than competent at writing code and keeping a system safe. They\u2019d do their jobs. And if either of them was Hannah\u2019s stalker, they\u2019d want to do whatever necessary to maintain professional ties to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Slade\u2019s money was on Preston.</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir,\u201d said Scott. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. I isolated this virus. It\u2019s nasty, but I can fix it in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d The sooner Scott fixed the problem, the sooner Slade could ship the corporate men back to Dallas. Until then, he had to watch these three like hawks. Once they left Alaska, Slade could breathe a sigh of relief, let Burke and Cole do what they did best, and focus on Hannah.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have things up and running in no time,\u201d Scott assured.</p> <p>\u201cGo make it happen.\u201d Slade shot Scott a nod, and the IT guy scurried off to work. Ben and Lyle took the hint and followed. Soon, the trio looked deeply entrenched in their computers.</p><p>Slade nudged Preston into an adjacent room. \u201cLet\u2019s talk, Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyle and Scott are very good at their jobs. They\u2019ll fix the mistakes arising from that native idiot\u2019s lax adherence to policy.\u201d</p><p>God, Preston just didn\u2019t know when to shut up. \u201cGlad to hear it. But that\u2019s not what I want to talk about. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll congratulate me on my engagement.\u201d Preston shot him a bland smile. \u201cCongratulations. I had no idea you were seeing anyone.</p><p>What is the lucky young lady\u2019s name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe you know her. Hannah Craig.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s smile instantly faded. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying Gavin\u2019s secretary?\u201d Slade took a step in and lowered his voice. \u201cI am. Would you like to explain why you molested my fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>Preston swallowed once and then again. \u201cI didn\u2019t molest her. It was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like nothing to me, especially when you leave messages after calling her new, unlisted phone number and telling her to withdraw her HR action against you while calling her \u2018baby.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He had the good sense to look sheepish. \u201cShe\u2019s a cute thing. I guess...I misread her signals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can assure you, if you were reading Hannah\u2019s signals, she wasn\u2019t giving you any green lights.\u201d</p> <p>Preston held up his hands in defeat. \u201cSince my wife and I separated recently, I haven\u2019t been myself. I-I was looking for comfort in the wrong place. I didn\u2019t hurt her. And she broke my toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will break way more than that if you even look at her again. When we get back to Dallas, we\u2019re going to have a long discussion about your employment with this company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, you can\u2019t fire me. I didn\u2019t even know the girl was dating the boss\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that made her fair game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she might be amenable. There\u2019s a rumor that she\u2019s sleeping with all three of you. I figured that if she was working her way through the executives, why couldn\u2019t I have a turn?\u201d Before the last word was out of Preston\u2019s mouth, Slade\u2019s fist was flying. He connected to the middle-aged executive\u2019s ruddy face with a satisfying thud. Preston hit the ground and immediately started whining. A thick line of blood dripped from his nose.</p><p>Slade crouched down and got in the man\u2019s face. He was pleased with the fear in the other man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re fired. I want you on the first plane back to Dallas. Your secretary can clean out your office. If I catch you on Black Oak property again, I will have you arrested. If I see you near our fianc\u00e9e again, I will have you killed. No one will ever find your body. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Preston hobbled back with a nod, and Slade had to wonder if this coward would climb a tree to take pictures of a woman. It didn\u2019t seem like his speed, but Slade wasn\u2019t about to underestimate anyone\u2019s desire for Hannah. He knew firsthand how it burned, how it made a man crazy. Even if everything didn\u2019t add up perfectly, Slade still didn\u2019t want the bastard anywhere near his woman.</p><p>He heard footsteps behind him and turned to find Dex sauntering up. His younger brother stared at Preston, who whimpered and tried to cover his face.</p> <p>\u201cPunching him feel good?\u201d Dex nodded with malice at the other man.</p><p>Slade smiled. \u201cImminently satisfying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll let the receptionist know to book him on the first flight to Anchorage and to make sure his ass travels in coach.\u201d Dex started to walk away, then stopped short. \u201cOh, and I came in to get you. We have a conference call with the Lenox brothers in five minutes.\u201d As Dex left, Lyle rushed through the door, then knelt to help his former boss to his feet. Lyle pulled Preston up, and the rolled-back cuffs of his shirt sleeves slipped up, revealing wiry arms covered in scratch marks. Slade suppressed a smile. The quiet ones always had the freaky sex lives. He wondered who would have scratched the hell out of a twerp like him.</p><p>Slade turned toward the door, but before he could leave, Scott, the blond tech who had supposedly identified the problem, stopped him. \u201cSir. Can I talk to you privately?\u201d Slade hesitated then opened the door to a small conference room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d If Scott said a word to him about Hannah, Slade swore he\u2019d lay the prick out flat, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the bug, sir. Like I said, it\u2019s a nasty virus, but fairly common. Mr. Ward thinks it\u2019s Internet security issues from the porn, but it\u2019s not. It looks like someone uploaded this bug directly on to the system. Someone who had access to our software wanted this system to fail and at a very precise time.\u201d</p><p>Slade felt his body go cold. Then he paused. Believe Scott or not? Too early to tell. He needed more information. \u201cWhen was it uploaded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a firm time right now, but the bug crashed the system around eleven a.m.</p><p>yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Right around the time the corporate jet took off with Hannah, himself, and his brothers, on their way to Alaska. Lyle had seen Dex carry Hannah out the door. Since the guy was still hovering protectively around his former boss, Slade could guess that Lyle was Preston\u2019s bitch.</p><p>He would have told Mr. Harvard that Hannah had been whisked away. Ironic how perfectly timed that virus was. Preston was definitely smart enough to write the code to crash a system.</p><p>Hell, depending on Lyle\u2019s loyalties, the little asswipe might have helped his former boss.</p><p>Slade marched into the IT cubicles, pinning a hard stare on Lyle. \u201cThanks. Get back to work.</p><p>Fix that bug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, then watched Slade drag a sputtering Preston away.</p><p>Building security joined him to walk the former CIO out. Slade vowed to sic Burke and Cole on him the second Preston\u2019s feet touched Dallas ground again.</p><p>After finishing her lunch and finding some halfway decent clothes, Hannah explored the house. She was never again letting Dex pack for her. He hadn\u2019t brought along a single pair of underwear and refused to tell her where to buy some. She was commando under her cotton skirt.</p><p>Bras, it seemed, didn\u2019t make Dex\u2019s list of necessary items, either. Her silk blouse brushed against her hard nipples making her so aware of her body and all the ways it ached. Now that she\u2019d had sex, she couldn\u2019t seem to get it off her mind.</p><p>She peered into each room. Last night, Slade had recounted a few stories about this place and his time with Gavin here as kids. Now she was fascinated by this grand log home and its remote majesty, which skirted a placid little lake framed by snow-capped mountains in the distance. The sky was such a bright blue that it almost hurt her eyes. She\u2019d never seen anything like this.</p><p>As she wandered into the office, Hannah peeked out the window at the grounds. Everything from every view seemed vibrant and alive. There were a couple of golf carts at the back of the house that she\u2019d been informed by the staff she could use to get to the stables. She definitely wanted to see those before she left. She was a West Texas girl, so horseback riding had been part of her upbringing. Dex and Slade had promised to take her on a ride sometime this week. She was far too sore today since she\u2019d spent her whole night riding hungry men.</p><p>Hannah felt her face flush at the thought. The night before had been perfect\u2014with one exception: The terrible incident between her and Gavin.</p><p>Dex and Slade had sworn that Gavin hadn\u2019t meant a word of his ugly speech and that he was wrestling some inner demons. Perhaps. Gavin might be very corporate, but deep down, the man had a heart. She knew about his mistresses. And she knew that he had too much to give to be happy with such a cold arrangement forever. But right now, he didn\u2019t seem inclined to change the status quo, and his inner demons were winning. That made her reconsider her decision to be with Dex and Slade. She couldn\u2019t be the reason their family broke apart. Those brothers needed each other, and unless Gavin figured out how to conquer whatever ate at him, Hannah seriously feared she\u2019d only stand like a wall between the younger two brothers and the eldest, squarely dividing them.</p><p>When Gavin had claimed she wasn\u2019t good enough, the barbs struck too close to home.</p><p>Hannah had cried while Slade held and rocked her, assuring her she was everything they all needed. He\u2019d teased her that he\u2019d be a mess without her organizational skills. Dex would be a constant bull in a china shop without her calming influence. Even if Gavin wasn\u2019t admitting it, he needed her for her heart. Slade had insisted that if Gavin truly found fault with the way she represented him or Black Oak, he would have fired her long ago. Hannah knew Gavin never let any situation go unaddressed if he thought changes were due. But even if he was lying to her\u2014</p><p>and himself\u2014she\u2019d still be between him and his brothers.</p><p>Next, Dex had drawn a bath for her, complete with bubbles. They had led her back to the huge bathroom with a whirlpool\u2014then made her forget everything. She\u2019d felt like a princess as they worshipped her, passing her back and forth, washing her body and her hair, assuring her that she was perfect for them. That given time and patience, Gavin would come around.</p><p>Then Slade held her while Dex shaved her pussy. Afterward, both men had taken turns lavishing her newly bare flesh with affectionate tongues. For a few blissful moments, she had forgotten all about the ache Gavin\u2019s words had caused.</p><p>This morning had been the same. They\u2019d cuddled her and loved her before they\u2019d begun her training. She\u2019d knelt before them, Dex patiently explaining the slave position while Slade had been preparing her for something else.</p><p>Her bottom clenched around the plug he\u2019d lodged deep in her backside. It was a continual reminder of everything they wanted from her. Everything she ached to give them.</p><p>But now, Hannah found herself alone. Gavin crept back into her mind.</p><p>She wandered into the hallway and heard the haunting sound of a piano being played with deft hands. Gran had loved music, and Hannah had studied well. This piece, a sad etude by Chopin, was one of her favorites.</p><p>As she sought the source of the sound, she peeked into a parlor they\u2019d passed on the brief tour Slade had given her the night before. Now, Gavin sat at a huge black grand piano, his fingers working the keys like a master. Of all the things she\u2019d gleaned about her former boss, Hannah hadn\u2019t known that he played the piano, much less so beautifully. Music filled the space, the poignant melody battering her heart. Dumbstruck, she stopped, stared.</p><p>A bottle of vodka sat on the piano, and it looked like Gavin had made his way through most of it. She glanced at the clock on the wall. One o\u2019clock in the afternoon. She\u2019d never seen him drink more than a few sips of a vodka and tonic, and never in the middle of the day. What had him imbibing now? The fight with his brothers? His usually perfect, dark hair was unkempt, his charcoal gray pajama pants wrinkled. He hadn\u2019t bothered with a shirt at all.</p><p>As he played each note, every muscle of his shoulders, biceps, and chest rippled, bunched.</p><p>Hannah had never seen Gavin James\u2019s bare chest. She clasped her hands to keep them to herself.</p><p>Like his face and persona, even the way he handled the keys, everything about him was strong, commanding. His wide shoulders were capable of making a multi-billion-dollar company thrive for a decade. They also looked equally capable of dragging her under him, then holding her down and taking...</p><p>No. She would not let him exploit the small-town girl he\u2019d sworn wasn\u2019t good enough for him.</p><p>But as his body swayed with the music, he clenched his jaw furiously. With one hand playing the next series of notes, the other reached for the bottle. He took a long, deep swallow.</p><p>Gavin looked...tormented. Had she done that to him?</p><p>The playing stopped suddenly with an abrupt clash of keys, and he straddled the piano bench, his gray eyes red rimmed, almost accusing. She doubted he\u2019d slept much last night. \u201cHannah.</p><p>Just who I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>There was a little slur in his angry voice that made her wince.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you. I\u2019ll go.\u201d She began to back out of the room, but his voice held her.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You\u2019ll never go away, my pretty little Hannah. That\u2019s the problem. You don\u2019t even go away when I sleep. You\u2019re always there. And now it will be so much worse because you\u2019ll be near, but with Slade and Dex. I\u2019ll have to hear them fuck you every damn night, listen to your whimpers of pleasure. Now, I won\u2019t ever be rid of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears started to blur her eyes. It was worse than she thought. Never mind that he didn\u2019t want her. He didn\u2019t even like her. If he had this much contempt for her because she wasn\u2019t good enough for him, he probably felt the same about her relationship with his brothers. No doubt, he wished they\u2019d settle down with some well-bred society women.</p><p>As much as she\u2019d loved last night, Gavin\u2019s words proved that staying with Slade and Dex would tear apart their family and shred their brotherly rapport. And they\u2019d end up hating her for it. She couldn\u2019t risk that. She had to put their needs beyond her own.</p><p>\u201cYou will, Mr. James. I know you need your brothers. So I won\u2019t be the wedge that drives you apart. I love them too much for that. And I know you don\u2019t feel the same way, but I care about you, too.\u201d</p><p>He rose from the piano bench slowly, his every move predatory. His stormy eyes pinned her in place. Even from across the room, she sensed the menace in him. \u201cYou care about me?\u201d Hannah\u2019s breath hitched. Fight or flight? She had to decide. Everything about Gavin, from the set of his broad, naked shoulders to the dangerous gleam in his eyes, told Hannah that something nasty brewed inside him. Definitely, she should run. Yet she couldn\u2019t make her feet move.</p><p>Fight it was.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. James. I care about you.\u201d She took a step toward the angry, inebriated male.</p><p>At six feet three inches, Gavin towered over her. She should definitely run from the room, screaming. Yet all she could think about was taking him in her arms and soothing his hurt. This was her last chance to fight for the future she wanted, to try to heal this proud, strong man. If she couldn\u2019t somehow stop him from drowning in his own pain, then she feared all was lost. If she failed, at least she would have the comfort of knowing that she\u2019d given it her all.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to come between me and my brothers?\u201d He stalked toward her. He didn\u2019t wobble or hesitate, merely strode forward with dangerous grace.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Brow raised sardonically, he moved closer. Hannah fought the urge to back up and stood her ground. He needed to stop lying to himself and understand that she was right for all of them.</p><p>Gavin invaded her space. This close, she could feel the heat of his body, smell the vodka on his breath. She knew it should turn her off, but her body was singing.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a little liar, Hannah. I think that being between me and my brothers is exactly where you want to be. I heard you last night. I heard your every cry and moan. You liked being between Dex and Slade. Tell me something, Hannah, did they fuck your pussy? Did they shove their cocks into that tight, virgin cunt?\u201d</p><p>His challenge, his language, his aggression\u2014none of that should turn her on. But it did.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hated the breathless way the word came out, sounding not strong, but submissive.</p><p>\u201cDid you like the way it felt? Did they hold you down, make you take every inch? Pound you?</p><p>She nodded as her pulse leapt. Her breathing turned unsteady. She didn\u2019t trust her own voice.</p><p>He moved closer, his body a wall of warm, muscular flesh. \u201cAnd did my brothers fuck your ass, too, Hannah? Did one of them tunnel into your tiny hole back there and make you howl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They said I needed to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared. His hands twitched at his side, coming out as though he wanted to touch her, but he forced them to behave. In the end, he lost. He grabbed her arm and dragged her against his body, her chest against his. Her head snapped back, and she looked directly into his eyes, gleaming with unslaked desire.</p><p>\u201cI know my brothers, Hannah. Did they shove a plug up your pretty virgin ass?\u201d Hannah looked away, feeling a flush crawl up her face. God, she could feel the plug even now, and Gavin\u2019s words made her so aware of her body. Slade had promised her the pink plug was small, but it felt huge. She clenched around it again, as she had all day, lighting up nerves she didn\u2019t know she had.</p><p>Gavin took her chin in his hand and forced her to look up at him again. \u201cTell me what my brothers did to you, Hannah. Don\u2019t be shy. Tell me how it felt when they pushed that plug against your ass for the first time. Did you shiver when you felt the cold lube against your warm, puckered skin?\u201d</p><p>She fought her embarrassment, wanted to look away. Gavin wasn\u2019t going to let her. And this was too important to simply give up. Gavin wasn\u2019t acting like a man who didn\u2019t care. He might not like the fact that he cared, but he wanted her. She could feel it. If details would bring him to his knees, she would give them.</p><p>\u201cYes. It was very cold. Slade\u2019s fingers warmed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he play with you, then? Rim your rosette with his fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for a long time. Then he pressed in, so deep. I gasped. I\u2019d never felt anything like it.\u201d It had been an odd sensation. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it at first.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stroked her chin. \u201cOnly at first? Then you changed your mind, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. I think that, after a while, you liked Slade putting his fingers up your ass. You liked it a lot. In fact, I have no doubt he kept at you until he figured out exactly what you like. Until you came, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Hannah shifted, trying to back away, find a little breathing space. Gavin wasn\u2019t having any of that.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded, gripping her tighter.</p><p>\u201cYes, I came.\u201d</p><p>The truth relaxed his body, but he fired his next questions out at her just as rapidly. \u201cBecause he also played with your pussy with his other hand? Because Dex sucked those pretty nipples that are poking through your silk blouse at me right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Dex used his mouth down...there.\u201d</p><p>Understanding flared hotly across Gavin\u2019s face. \u201cSo Slade shoved his fingers up that virgin ass to get you all ready? Did he tell you how much he loves anal sex?\u201d Hannah knew she couldn\u2019t help the shock jolting across her face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Yeah, nothing our middle brother loves more than to bend a woman over and shove his cock straight up her ass. Every day. More than once a day, if she\u2019ll take it.\u201d A little smile smeared across his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSlade ordered me to spread my legs, bend over, and present my backside.\u201d She remembered how insistent Slade had been and how obeying him made her feel like the sexiest goddess. But the way he\u2019d stripped her of control had left her vulnerable, trembling. Excited.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Did you obey, or did he have to spank you?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Gavin had liked watching her spanking. No matter what he\u2019d said before, he was interested in her. Hannah couldn\u2019t help but remember the conversation she\u2019d overheard between Dex and Slade about Gavin. They believed Gavin was hiding something.</p><p>\u201cI obeyed, Mr. James. I felt scared and vulnerable, but I did it. I placed my hands on the bed and presented my ass.\u201d</p><p>His eyes tightened, and his breath became ragged. Hannah glanced down. Gavin\u2019s cock tented his pajama pants.</p><p>\u201cThen Slade plugged your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He worked the plug in. He kept playing. He pushed it in and out, gaining a bit of ground each time. I thought it would never end. The sensations were so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it turned you on all over again?\u201d His narrowed eyes warned her not to lie.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cYes. Slade pushed and pulled until the plug slid home. And I got...aroused again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Dex still eating that sweet little pussy? Because you know Dex loves pussy. Between the two of them, they are going to keep you constantly busy and sated, sweetheart, front and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDex didn\u2019t stop until I was boneless and wrung out. Until I almost couldn\u2019t catch a breath.</p><p>Then he talked to me about all the things he wants to teach me.\u201d Gavin stroked down her throat before his hand settled on her nape. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow to suck his cock.\u201d Dex\u2019s words still heated her skin and made her tremble. While Slade had played behind her, Dex had leaned in and whispered to her. \u201cHe wants to teach me how to take his cock in my mouth and swallow him down.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened around her nape, the slight pain cutting through her system. The pain heightened her arousal to almost unbearable heights. Her nipples were so hard she could feel her blouse chafing them.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou call me Sir when we\u2019re alone. I won\u2019t allow you to respect me any less than my brothers.\u201d</p><p>She brought her gaze up to meet his. If there wasn\u2019t any room for disrespect, then there wasn\u2019t any room for shame or shyness, either. \u201cHe wants to teach me to suck his cock, Sir.\u201d One hand tightened on her hair. The pain tingled across her scalp. \u201cThey didn\u2019t force you to fellate them, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on her hair, forcing her to her knees. Hannah hesitated only an instant before sinking down. As her knees hit the plush carpet, the plug shifted in her ass. She had to clench to keep it in. It was a constant reminder of Slade and Dex. Even if they weren\u2019t in the same room, it marked their possession of her in a real, physical way.</p><p>\u201cYou care about me?\u201d Those words ground out of his sneering mouth again. He looked slightly cruel, but she could hear the want behind his words.</p><p>\u201cI care about you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had been alone for too long. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but he needed this. Needed her now.</p><p>He loosened his hold on her hair. His hands went to the waistband of his pajama bottoms.</p><p>\u201cSo you say now. I wonder how you\u2019ll feel after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter?\u201d Hannah\u2019s heart started racing.</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019ve had a little taste of me, sweetheart. Open your mouth. I want what my brothers haven\u2019t had.\u201d His cock sprung forth. He was his brothers\u2019 match. It was big and gloriously hard.</p><p>No matter what he said, he definitely wanted her.</p><p>He was on the edge. She could sense it.</p><p>With a secretive smile, Hannah leaned forward toward Gavin\u2019s cock.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>What the hell am I doing?</p><p>Deep in his alcohol-rattled brain, some scrap of common sense screamed the question at Gavin, pounding at his consciousness. All of that fled the instant she lowered her tongue toward his cock.</p><p>He\u2019d intended to scare her, push her away. But Hannah hadn\u2019t run. Instead, she\u2019d answered every one of his questions with that sweet West Texas twang that made him hard. She\u2019d told him how she\u2019d submitted to Slade\u2019s fingers and Dex\u2019s mouth. Fuck, Gavin could picture it, could see himself there, watching, with her tongue lashing his dick. Though he teetered on the knife\u2019s edge, he knew he should push her away.</p><p>Instead, he pushed for more.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to learn how to suck cock, then by God, I\u2019m the man to teach you.\u201d She stared up at him with big, green eyes and nodded. Fuck, she turned him on.</p><p>\u201cNow what, Sir?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cLick the head.\u201d God, he was a bastard, but he was going to enjoy every second of this.</p><p>Her pink tongue peeked out from her lush, berry lips. Gavin\u2019s cock twitched and strained toward her as if the fucking thing had a mind of its own. It was wrong, but his cock wanted Hannah. Who was he kidding? His soul wanted Hannah, too. Only his brain knew better.</p><p>Tentatively, she leaned in. He felt her breath on the swollen head. Every muscle in his body tightened. The wait was pure torture. Gavin knew his brothers had thoroughly debauched Hannah last night, but when she looked up at him with that innocent stare, all he could think about was that he\u2019d be the first man on her tongue.</p><p>She licked him slowly, like an ice cream cone on a summer day. Then she eased back, waiting, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cMore, Hannah. Lick the whole head. Pull it in your mouth.\u201d She\u2019d responded so beautifully to commands before, he hardened his voice now. He made it deep and unrelenting.</p><p>Almost instantly, that little tongue ran all over the sensitive head of his dick. Gavin gritted his teeth as fire sizzled up his spine. Desire scalded him.</p><p>Sweet Hannah was so submissive, so willing. He\u2019d never had the urge to have a woman call him Sir or itched to spank her ass and watch it turn pink under his hand. Hannah changed everything. Gavin could envision her tied up and so trusting, waiting for him. She would be a beautiful sight.</p><p>Hannah worked his cock over with little butterfly licks and kisses. She trusted far too much.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t trust him at all if she knew who he was deep inside. And his brothers would never forgive him.</p><p>Fuck, he shouldn\u2019t do this to her. The command to stop her perched on the tip of his tongue, but then Hannah swallowed him down, nearly to the back of her throat. He hissed, groaned. It felt so good. He\u2019d had women give him head more times than he could count, so why did Hannah\u2019s untutored mouth send him reeling? He looked down at his cock disappearing into her virgin mouth. Her eyes were closed, her face almost beatific.</p><p>He\u2019d waited so long to touch her. The minute they\u2019d met, Gavin had known on some level that her goodness and light was the perfect reflection of his terrible, dark soul. If he were a better man, he might have deserved her. If he were a better man, he would move heaven and earth to make her sublimely happy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But this stolen moment would be the only time he\u2019d ever touch her.</p><p>\u201cTake more, baby. You can take all of me. Work it in.\u201d Gavin gentled his voice, but tangled his hands in her hair, grabbing fistfuls. Long and soft, her hair made the perfect handle to grip as he fucked his way deeper into her mouth, forcing his way in inch by delicious inch. \u201cBreath through your nose, Hannah. You can handle this.\u201d</p><p>Her hands found his thighs, fingers gripping almost desperately. She trembled as she parted her lips wider to accommodate his short strokes. He sank another inch into her hot mouth.</p><p>\u201cTouch my balls.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate, cupping, rubbing. He shuddered. His balls were tight against his body and felt so heavy with come. Every ounce was meant for her. All the reasons he shouldn\u2019t be here fell away. She sat on her knees before him, touching him, accepting him. Hell, she\u2019d opened her mouth and welcomed him. For this precious moment, she belonged to him, was his to do with as he pleased. No amount of guilt or self-loathing could keep him from taking her in every way he wanted.</p><p>Ruthlessly, he pressed even deeper into her mouth. Hannah tried to roll her tongue over his cock, but there wasn\u2019t any room in her tight, hot mouth. His balls drew up, so damn close to orgasm. But if he would only have this once with her, spewing down her throat, though hot, wasn\u2019t how he wanted to go.</p><p>With a grimace, he pulled from her mouth.</p><p>Hannah fell back. She panted, dragging oxygen into her lungs, as she stared with uncertain eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you. My brothers had all night. Did you think I would settle for a quick head job then send you on your merry way? Not a chance, baby. Take off your clothes.\u201d Hannah rose, her body shaking. She held his eyes as she unbuttoned her blouse with trembling fingers. Slowly, almost uncertainly, she revealed her creamy skin, inch by inch.</p><p>When she peeled the blouse off her shoulders, he sucked in a stunned breath. God, she was fucking gorgeous. He\u2019d said she wasn\u2019t worthy of him, but it hadn\u2019t been true. Looking at her now, he knew exactly how much he\u2019d lied. Hannah was magnificent, with dainty shoulders, a trim waist, and large breasts topped with tight, pink nipples begging to be sucked. Everything a man could hope for.</p><p>And she belonged to his brothers.</p><p>She could belong to you, if only you would reach out, trust her. Stop everything and tell her your story. Ask for forgiveness.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t risk it. She would know\u2014and loathe\u2014him soon enough. The press would tell everyone, and life as he knew it would be over.</p><p>Her blouse fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo bra?\u201d he choked out.</p><p>Hannah shook her head, blond curls caressing her pale shoulders. \u201cDex didn\u2019t put one in my suitcase.\u201d Her hands went to her skirt, but she stopped when he reached out and cupped her breast, brushing her nipple with his thumb. It peaked, flushed. Hannah\u2019s breast fit his hand perfectly, every inch soft and silky.</p><p>\u201cDid my brother neglect to pack your underwear as well?\u201d Gavin could just imagine Dex\u2019s sinful glee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to wear panties anymore unless your brothers choose it.\u201d At her implication, Gavin nearly swallowed his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing any now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Every word out of her mouth made him harder. He stood back, stepping out of his pajama pants, then tossed them across the room. He stood naked before Hannah. She looked at him, her gaze taking him in, and she gasped. Then she met his gaze. No way he could miss the desire burning there.</p><p>When she reached out to touch him, he thrust her hand away. \u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to touch me. Present me that ass. Show me that plug. Now.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to see exactly what Slade had pressed deep inside her, how she clenched around the plug to keep it lodged. He wanted her to bend over and show him how wet and swollen her pussy was because of it.</p><p>Hannah pushed the skirt down her hips, revealing lush curves. She had an hourglass figure that made his mouth water. Her teeth bit into her lower lip, eyes wide with hesitation as she removed the garment and left it on the floor. She turned away and leaned over, but had nothing to hold on to, so she bent and braced her hands on her thighs. Her ass was gorgeous and round, the cheeks a perfect upside down heart. But he couldn\u2019t see what he wanted to see.</p> <p>\u201cLower, Hannah. You bend lower and use your hands to spread your cheeks.\u201d She mumbled something he couldn\u2019t quite hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He drilled her with a hard stare.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Sir.\u201d</p><p>With zero hesitation, Gavin swatted her ass. He loved the sound, the sting, the way her skin pinkened. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. What did you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you a bastard, Sir.\u201d Her voice sounded high-pitched, thin.</p><p>He spanked her other cheek, watching as she turned pink there, too. God, he could get used to dominating Hannah. \u201cYou don\u2019t use that language around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will always push you.\u201d He would push her right out of his life. He was just that stupid, and it was the right thing to do. But he wasn\u2019t going to deny himself this one moment with her. He would hold it close to his heart for the rest of his life. \u201cNow do as I told you. Hold your cheeks apart.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t mistake her reluctance, but those hands came up and slowly pulled the globes of her ass apart. There it was, peeking out, a little pink plug shoved tight inside her. Gavin got to one knee and peered closer. That plug would prepare her to take a cock up her ass. She could also fit one in her pussy and another in her mouth. He and his brothers could possess her body all at once.</p><p>No. That wouldn\u2019t happen. He couldn\u2019t risk her and allow it to happen.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Hannah.\u201d He touched the plug then palmed her ass, loving the way she quivered. \u201cDo you still care about me?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cI love you, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Her breathy words finally broke him. He couldn\u2019t take another second of waiting. He needed to shove himself inside her, be surrounded by her. He just fucking needed her.</p><p>Gavin hauled her into his arms and carried her to the piano\u2014the nearest flat surface. Hannah gasped as he set her bare ass down on the keys. They made a discordant sound, but her breathy cry as he shoved his cock between her legs was music to his ears.</p><p>As she curled her fingers around his shoulders and clung, Gavin drew her closer. He could feel how wet she was. She might think he was a bastard, but she wanted him all the same.</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t hesitate. She wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him in when she should be pushing him away. His cock nudged the entrance to her pussy, but he held back. He needed more than to simply fuck her. He needed to connect with her.</p><p>Gavin thrust his hands in her hair and tugged, pulling her mouth beneath his. He covered that pretty, red bow, her lips swollen from sucking his cock. God, she tasted sweet. His tongue delved deep, and she accepted. No, she submitted, allowing him to pillage and plunder. Nothing but soft, sweet whimpers came from her throat as she held on, her body writhing restlessly against him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get enough. He kissed her mouth, her nose, her chin, and her throat. She tasted sweet on his lips. His brothers could take her as many times as they wanted, but her innocence would remain. She would always taste sweet, always have a pure heart that pulled at him. He kissed her again, possessing and ravaging, but his cock demanded more. He probed her slick, soft folds then pressed in slowly.</p><p>He watched as her lovely, bare pussy accepted his cock, clamping down in welcome with every inch he gave her. Gavin pressed in farther. Fuck, she had the tightest hole he\u2019d ever been in. Her pussy sucked at him, drawing him in, holding him deep. She wrapped her arms around him like she never wanted to let go.</p><p>When her head fell back on a moan, exposing her throat, he kissed the fair skin there. He couldn\u2019t get enough of the taste of her. He nipped at her shoulder while his cock stretched her cunt.</p><p>Finally, he thrust completely in. She felt so fucking good wrapped around his dick, Gavin didn\u2019t know how he was going to survive.</p><p>A warning bell went off in his head, but Hannah\u2019s soft moans and softer kisses across his jaw drowned out that insistent voice screaming at him that his world was about to go to hell. The trouble was, hell felt really good right now. In fact, hell felt perfect.</p><p>Gavin took her hard, holding nothing back. Right now, she was his to fuck and fill, arouse, plunder, and consume. She was his to hold and love.</p><p>God, he loved her.</p><p>\u201cHannah.\u201d Her name was a benediction. He pulled on her hips, sealing them together, fusing their bodies until he couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and she began. He thrust harder, deeper, faster, wanting more and more of her\u2014everything, in fact. Heart, soul, future...everything he\u2019d never wanted from any other woman. She made his heart nearly fucking burst.</p><p>Hannah nodded, gasped. \u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>Her voice sounded frantic. Her pussy clenched down on him even tighter. He had to work to withdraw, then shoved his way back in ruthlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to come, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d She grabbed at his short hair with desperate fingers, her green stare so wide and needy. She looked at him as if he had the power to destroy or fulfill her.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Hannah,\u201d he demanded as his own orgasm roared closer. \u201cDo you need to come?\u201d She nodded frantically. \u201cGavin!\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened wide as she came and screamed his name. He could feel the muscles of her pussy pulsing hard, milking his cock until he couldn\u2019t hold off a second longer. His balls drew up painfully. He thrust in to the hilt one last time, captured her cry of pleasure with his mouth, then orgasm slammed him. He poured everything he had into his Hannah, the feeling so good it had to be a sin.</p><p>In fact, it was a sin. Oh, God. He hadn\u2019t worn a condom.</p><p>The voice he\u2019d ignored had been trying to warn him. He\u2019d fucked Hannah, his brothers\u2019</p><p>woman, without protecting her. He\u2019d fucked up again.</p><p>His stomach turned. His vision blurred.</p><p>Way to go, ruining another woman\u2019s life. And your brothers will really love you for killing this one.</p><p>Self-loathing boiled in Gavin\u2019s blood as he withdrew roughly. Muttering an ugly curse, he turned away. The jarring notes of the piano, followed by soft footfall, told Gavin that Hannah hopped off the piano.</p><p>\u201cGavin?\u201d She touched his shoulder tentatively, softly. With concern.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fucking deserve it.</p><p>Everyone knows how great you are to your lovers. You use them and forget them. You do nothing as they lay dying. What a great guy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hannah angled herself in front of him, her eyes searching.</p><p>He just glared. What the hell could he say?</p><p>She backed away, reached to the ground for her blouse, and started to cover her breasts. She knew something had gone terribly awry.</p><p>Gavin wanted to hold her. The words were perched on the tip of his tongue. I love you. I\u2019ll take care of you always. He could say them. He would even mean them.</p><p>His cell phone chirped, reminding him that his time had run out. There would be no white picket fence for him.</p><p>But what if Hannah could forgive his past mistakes? What if his brothers understood? But what would any of it matter if he couldn\u2019t forgive himself? He didn\u2019t have any right to drag her into the scandal that was about to hit. If the stalker held true to his threat, the papers would soon get the full story on how he\u2019d covered up the facts surrounding Nikki\u2019s death, and they would hound him and anyone near.</p><p>He had to push her as far away from him as possible, even if he had to make her hate him.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Hannah. But I\u2019m done. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>Gavin retrieved his pajama bottoms and slid them on, eyeing the last of the vodka, before he forced himself to walk away. He couldn\u2019t look at the confusion on her face for another second.</p><p>She\u2019d been sweet and giving, and if he was a better human being, she might have been able to make him whole.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me. Please, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Gavin resisted the urge to go to her. He couldn\u2019t touch her again or he would weaken. He had to be strong for both their sakes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong, Hannah. I told you yesterday, I would love to fuck you. I did. It was okay. Now I\u2019m done. You\u2019re an attractive girl, but I don\u2019t want a second round. I\u2019m used to more experienced lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore experienced?\u201d The words fell from her mouth with a dull thud. Her eyes lost their light.</p><p>His heart fell, but he managed a casual shrug. \u201cOne night with my brothers didn\u2019t teach you much, honey.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie. He was so used to lying, it came easy. The truth was, he would dream about having her every night for the rest of his miserable life. If he could ever work up the will to fuck another woman, it would be Hannah\u2019s face he saw. He would never forget the way she clung to him, the way they fit together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he would also never be able to get this broken-hearted Hannah out of his head. This Hannah wasn\u2019t smiling. This Hannah groped around for her skirt in an attempt to hide from him.</p><p>She dressed in utter silence, with her back to him. He wished she would just walk away. He wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the quiet dignity she would surely toss his way any moment. Still, he forced himself to stand there and wait as the guilt poured in.</p><p>Hannah turned after smoothing down her skirt, but it wasn\u2019t quiet dignity on her face. No, pure feminine fury reigned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, Mr. James. I never would have expected this from you.\u201d He had to keep being a jerk. \u201cWhat, Hannah, are you going to play the scorned woman now?</p> <p>I never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never told me the truth either. Why did you hire me?\u201d Because he wanted her close. He wanted to bask in her light. \u201cIt was a favor to my brothers.\u201d Her eyes narrowed, sharp intelligence clear in their depths. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Dex and Slade could have just as easily pursued me without bringing me into your office. And why did you keep me as your executive admin if I was just \u2018okay\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Why was everyone questioning him? Why wouldn\u2019t they just leave him the fuck alone?</p><p>Because he deserved whatever shit rained down on him. God, he\u2019d taken her without a condom. If she was pregnant, it would kill him. No, if she was pregnant, Dex and Slade would kill him.</p><p>\u201cI told you before that I didn\u2019t have a problem sleeping with you. You have a certain charm, both in the office and flat on your back. But I won\u2019t give up my social standing to marry a girl so utterly lacking grace and upbringing.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips curled up in a cynical smile. It was the first he\u2019d ever seen on her. Gavin swallowed down a throat full of bile. His Hannah had learned a lot in the days since he and his brothers had kidnapped her, not all of it good.</p><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m just a country girl without manners or education. I\u2019m nothing but a good time to a man like you. Rest assured, I won\u2019t forget that again.\u201d</p><p>It made him sick, but Gavin nodded. \u201cGood. I hope you won\u2019t make a fuss with my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Her shoulders sagged. Her cynical smile fled, and tears welled in her eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t cause any trouble between you and your brothers. We dumb country girls at least know better than to mess with family.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk out of the room, her head held high.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPiss off,\u201d she snapped, without even turning back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay in your room until my brothers get back.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see her again.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t turn back to him. \u201cI don\u2019t need to follow your orders any more, Mr. James.</p><p>You\u2019re not my boss. You\u2019re not even my lover. You\u2019re just a jerk who used me.\u201d That summed him up in a neat little package. Pain slammed through him, but he swallowed it down. \u201cThis jerk thinks it would be best if you remained in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you think doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a humorless sound. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t love me after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d She sighed and kept walking.</p><p>With two words, she dismantled him. Gavin staggered back to the piano, clutching his stomach. He felt fucking eviscerated. He grabbed the bottle of vodka and drained the last of it, staring at the piano. He\u2019d never be able to play again without seeing Hannah there. He\u2019d never be able to come back to this house without aching for her all over again.</p><p>He was a miserable bastard, and it was only going to get worse. But he knew what he had to do, the only honorable thing he could do. He picked up the phone and dialed his lawyer\u2019s number.</p><p>Maybe someday Hannah and his brothers would understand.</p><p>Hannah walked through the house like a zombie, her feet shuffling across the hardwood floors. The events of the past days played through her brain as she made it to her room. She\u2019d been briefly happy here, but that was over.</p><p>She took off her clothes and started the shower. God, she felt dirty. Funny how she could be with two men and feel like an angel, but Gavin had made her feel slutty and cheap.</p><p>After washing away the evidence of her mistake, she climbed out and dressed the best she could. With tears blurring her eyes, she packed her things and closed her suitcase. She opened her laptop. With a few keystrokes, she found the phone number to the charter service that flew from River Run to Anchorage. She could find a flight home from there. In a day or so, she would be back in Two Trees. Maybe she could pick up the pieces of her life.</p><p>If she could find a way into town.</p><p>Next, Hannah pulled up her word processing program and typed out a note to Dex and Slade.</p><p>After searching the nearby study, she found no evidence of a printer, so she left the computer open so they would find her goodbye.</p><p>Hannah cried as she dragged her suitcase behind her and searched the whole house futilely for car keys or the driver. Neither were anywhere to be found. Darn it, she needed to be gone before Slade and Dex returned. They wouldn\u2019t understand. They\u2019d convince her that Gavin was like a lion with a thorn in his paw\u2014snarling and mean, but really just hurting deep down. They\u2019d convince her that she could heal him. But Hannah knew better. If she remained, she would just cause trouble between Gavin and his brothers.</p><p>God, she\u2019d miss these men, and she would never love anyone half so much again, but she couldn\u2019t break up a family.</p><p>Why had she thought she could be involved with three men? She hadn\u2019t been thinking at all, at least not with her brain. Her heart and nether regions had proven that they couldn\u2019t make a halfway decent decision between them.</p><p>She wandered into the great room where she\u2019d confronted Gavin earlier. If only she\u2019d listened to him. She\u2019d been so sure he was hiding something. Maybe he was, but nothing she\u2019d done had cut through his protective walls. He didn\u2019t want her help or her love.</p><p>She stared out the window, wondering how far the walk was into town when the golf carts caught her eye.</p><p>She smiled for the first time. Country girls might not be polished, but they knew how to make do.</p><p>She pulled her golf cart into a parking space behind the Angry Moose Saloon, Grocery, and Lodge. It was the biggest building in the tiny little town. Made of large logs, it resembled a huge cabin. Two burly men walked out of the saloon doors and stopped in their tracks when they saw her.</p><p>Both of them towered over Hannah. They stared openly at her, and then the one wearing a hat walked right back into the saloon without a word.</p><p>Fabulous. Everywhere she looked today, she found a man willing to be rude to her. She lifted her chin and walked through the saloon\u2019s double doors.</p><p>The Angry Moose was unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen. The walls were covered with animal heads. These people took their hunting very seriously. Moose, bears, dear, even a gopher, all had heads hanging on the wall, a testament to human prowess with a shotgun.</p><p>A quick image of Gavin\u2019s head on the wall sprinted through her mind. She shook her head.</p><p>Violence wouldn\u2019t change anything. It wouldn\u2019t make her feel better. Maybe it would assuage her for a moment, but she still loved him. In fact, she loved all three of them. The ache from leaving the James Gang behind was going to last forever.</p><p>She clutched her suitcase and walked to the bar, ignoring the crowd of men who stopped to stare at her. What was going on? They acted as if they\u2019d never seen a woman before.</p><p>A young man with dark hair and Native American features stood behind the bar. His eyes widened as she approached.</p><p>\u201cMiss, can I help you? Are you lost?\u201d He leaned over. \u201cDo I need to call the sheriff? He\u2019s not exactly effective, but he\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>Hannah frowned. \u201cWhy would I need the sheriff? I just need to find Billy.\u201d Billy Harris ran the small charter service that would take her from River Run to Anchorage.</p><p>From there, she was on her own. But she could find her way back to Texas.</p><p>The young man\u2019s face fell. \u201cUhm, are you Harry Crag?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHannah Craig.\u201d</p><p>The bartender winced. \u201cSorry. Billy isn\u2019t really great with names when he\u2019s plastered.</p><p>Unfortunately, that\u2019s most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, a stranger\u2019s hand gripped her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about nothing, Harry. I\u2019ll have you out of this hellhole in no time.\u201d</p><p>She could smell the liquor on the man\u2019s breath. This was Billy, her pilot?</p><p>Hannah turned to the bartender. \u201cCan anyone else take me home?\u201d The bartender frowned and pointed behind her. Hannah turned. Every man in the bar stared at her. Most had moved way too close for comfort.</p><p>\u201cI can take you home,\u201d a deep-voiced man with faded jeans and a naughty smile said. She got the distinct feeling he was not talking about Texas.</p><p>\u201cI should take her home, you old coot. I\u2019m way closer to her age.\u201d A man who looked barely old enough to drink pushed to the forefront.</p><p>Hannah eased back\u2014and felt the hard edge of the bar at her back. She swallowed. This could get ugly.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Dex walked into the house, an unaccountable sense of confidence clinging to him. Despite the fact that the conference call with the Lenox brothers hadn\u2019t yet yielded the name of Hannah\u2019s stalker, Dex had a feeling that they were close. Of course, now they had another problem, a corporate saboteur. Someone had purposefully uploaded a virus to their drilling sites\u2019 computers.</p><p>Dex had already put out a call to their other drill sites to lock down their systems and accept no updates until further notice.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Slade walked in behind him, through the kitchen doors, and into the mud room.</p><p>\u201cSince we got all the crap settled with the computers, I was thinking we should show Hannah around a bit. She\u2019s probably too sore to ride a horse today, but we could climb in the Jeep and take her up into the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good thinking.\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cWhat about Gavin?\u201d</p><p>Big brother was another problem they were going to have to solve. Hannah loved him. Slade would miss him. Hell, if he was really honest with himself, Dex didn\u2019t want Gavin left out, either, despite the awful lies he\u2019d snarled at Hannah last night. If they allowed Gavin to pull away this time, it would likely be permanent. Dex knew it deep in his bones.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Are you asking if we should we invite him along?\u201d Dex shook his head. \u201cNo, we need to figure out what\u2019s eating at Gavin and how to stop it before we let him anywhere near Hannah again. What do you know about Nikki and the night she died?\u201d</p><p>Slade zipped a sharp stare his way. \u201cNot much. Nikki was really beautiful. You know, one of those girls who just catches everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Dex tended to steer clear of women like her. Anyone who needed that much attention typically didn\u2019t know how to give it back. \u201cSociety girl, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The worst kind. Her family had fallen on hard times, and she was willing to screw her way back to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting with Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Slade shook his head. \u201cHell, no. She\u2019d worked her way through a bunch of men before she got her hooks into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin has always been so smart. Why would he let someone like her get close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a difficult time for him,\u201d Slade said slowly. \u201cOur father was gone. We had just found you. Gavin got lost trying to save the company. I let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were barely eighteen.\u201d Dex remembered that time as the greatest of his life. He\u2019d found brothers who\u2019d seemed to embrace him, and he\u2019d started college. Until Gavin and Slade had shown up, he\u2019d been pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t see a college campus unless he was cleaning it.</p><p>Many rich families would have never contacted him, much less welcomed him with open arms and offered to pay for his education.</p><p>But those years had been hard for Gavin. He\u2019d barely graduated from college himself when he\u2019d been forced to delve into the shark-infested waters of corporate life. If their father hadn\u2019t stubbornly held onto the majority of the stock, Black Oak Oil would have likely been savaged and broken up.</p><p>Gavin had saved it for his brothers. Yeah, he owed Gavin.</p><p>\u201cI remember Nikki, but only a bit.\u201d Dex flushed. He hadn\u2019t wanted to admit this. \u201cShe came on to me one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club. What kills me is that Gavin wasn\u2019t in love with her. I think he liked the sex.</p><p>She was very passionate. They fought constantly. At the time, some demon in him craved that drama. Maybe it took his mind off everything else.\u201d Slade shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And Dex could just bet that Nikki had made up for all that arguing in bed. \u201cI remember a couple of breakups. They always seemed permanent, but the next week she\u2019d be back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe always managed to lure him in again. But finally, he\u2019d had enough and decided to break with her for good. Two days later, she died from an overdose. The police report says it was an accidental suicide\u2014a cry for attention\u2014but Gavin hasn\u2019t been the same for the last decade. I don\u2019t get it. He isn\u2019t pining for her.\u201d Slade shook his head. \u201cMaybe he feels responsible, but he didn\u2019t shove a bunch of pills down her throat.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it didn\u2019t take having an actual hand in something to make a man feel guilty. Dex knew that. He felt guilty about his own damn birth. His mother had been sweet, but not too smart. She\u2019d had to work two jobs to try to support him after her lover had shoved a ten thousand dollar check her way and told her to get an abortion. When he was a kid, he\u2019d often thought she would have been better off if she had. If she\u2019d followed Stuart James\u2019s instructions, she wouldn\u2019t have been working late in a bar. She wouldn\u2019t have been in a car that broke down. She wouldn\u2019t have been hit by a passing drunk driver.</p><p>Dex shook it off. His mother had loved him and done her best to provide. She wouldn\u2019t want him to feel guilty for anything. Maybe that\u2019s why Dex could let go of the guilt and Gavin couldn\u2019t. If Nikki could see Gavin\u2019s torment, she\u2019d be eating it up.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk to him, convince him to let this go,\u201d Dex insisted. He was going to make this right with his brother and give Hannah the complete happiness she wanted and deserved.</p> <p>Slade smiled and put a brotherly hand on his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much that means to me, man. Yeah, let\u2019s find him and have a chat. Then we\u2019ll all take our girl out and show her the mountains.\u201d</p><p>Hannah would look beautiful lying back on a field of green grass. It had only been a few hours since he and Slade had cleaned her up and begun preparing her ass. His dick got hard at the memory of Slade sliding that pink plug deep inside her. Her eyes had widened, and a breathy moan had oozed from her throat. He\u2019d almost come in his jeans right then and there. If he and Slade hadn\u2019t made the agreement to let her recover during the morning, he would have pulled her close and seen just how tight her pussy would be when her ass was filled.</p><p>He glanced down at his watch. Four p.m. He smiled. They had really only agreed to leave her alone for the morning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d Slade grinned. When it came to Hannah, they were always thinking the same thing.</p><p>They rounded the corner that would take them to the bedroom they shared with Hannah when they saw him.</p> <p>Gavin stood in the doorway, his eyes haggard, staring at them. Dex had never seen his brother look so disheveled and distraught. Something had gone terribly wrong. How much had he heard? Had their discussion about Nikki put him in this state?</p><p>\u201cGavin, what the fuck?\u201d Slade grabbed the empty bottle of vodka in his brother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you? Did you drink all of this today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I came looking for another, but I didn\u2019t want to interrupt your brotherly chat.\u201d Slade stopped, cursed at the haunted look in their big brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cTell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s lips quirked up, but he radiated pure self-loathing. \u201cEverything. Some of it was so long ago. But no matter how deep you bury it, that shit always comes back to haunt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf talking about Nikki is upsetting you this much, I\u2019ll back off,\u201d Dex vowed. Gavin needed to heal, but he wasn\u2019t willing to hurt his brother to force the issue.</p> <p>Shaking his head, Gavin stepped carefully across the room. His defeated mien contrasted sharply with the sunny kitchen table. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The entire ugly story will be out in the papers by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Slade slid Dex a long, worried look as he sat down beside Gavin. \u201cThe whole story about Nikki?\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded, eyes squeezed tightly shut, torment clearly wracking him.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill her?\u201d Dex asked calmly. \u201cHave they dug up evidence? Is there time to make it go away?\u201d</p><p>Gavin turned to him with a solemn frown. \u201cWould you really cover it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d Dex replied. \u201cI would be pissed that you hadn\u2019t come to me in the first place. If you have a body to hide, you call your brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sometimes wonder if you consider me a brother at all. I haven\u2019t been close to you. I accused you of behaving impulsively.\u201d</p><p>Dex managed a smile. \u201cIn the past, I have behaved impulsively. You had to bail me out of jail more than once in college.\u201d</p> <p>Slade grinned. \u201cAt least you\u2019re not fighting in bars anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a text from Hannah\u2019s stalker.\u201d Gavin\u2019s words turned the conversation on end and stopped Dex\u2019s heart for a painful second.</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d He couldn\u2019t get the words out fast enough.</p><p>\u201cAbout eight this morning.\u201d</p><p>Before they\u2019d confronted Preston.</p><p>Slade glanced his way, then back to Gavin. \u201cFrom what number? Let me see.\u201d Gavin shook his head. \u201cNothing you can do. I just forwarded the whole text conversation to the Lenox brothers. They\u2019re working on it, but this guy isn\u2019t stupid. The number will be from an untraceable, prepaid cell. The gist of his little message was that he knew my secret, and he\u2019s going to tell the world unless we release Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does he even know we have Hannah?\u201d Slade asked. \u201cUnless it\u2019s Preston, then he knows from Lyle because the pipsqueak saw you carry Hannah out of the office yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Slade fired Preston, Gavin. The guy is a prick who treated Hannah like shit.\u201d Gavin shrugged. \u201cThe firing of our CIO is the least of my worries. This shit that\u2019s going to come out will tear us apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out now if Preston made it on that plane back to Anchorage or if he\u2019s still hovering around here,\u201d Dex told Slade as he made a mental note to call the Lenox brothers ASAP to track down Preston\u2019s current whereabouts.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cYou really think Preston would stalk her? He\u2019s been in her face a lot. Why the sudden subterfuge?\u201d</p><p>Who knew why a psycho did anything, Dex thought darkly.</p><p>\u201cUntil we know who the stalker is for sure, let\u2019s focus on keeping Hannah close and protected,\u201d Gavin suggested. \u201cThe rest of it is over and done. The fucking past is going to come out, and I\u2019ve made suitable arrangements to deal with the fallout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of arrangements? How bad is this story?\u201d Slade grabbed Gavin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIs our stock going to take a hit? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain. I\u2019d rather you hear this from me than the press. And the stock won\u2019t take a hit.</p><p>I\u2019ve made sure of it. I\u2019ll be stepping down as CEO Monday morning. I\u2019ve split the stock our father left me between you and Dex. My lawyer is finalizing the details now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Slade exploded, standing and staring in disbelief.</p><p>Dex had always wanted a piece of the company his absentee father had built, but only because he\u2019d wanted to be on an equal footing with his brothers. He sure as hell hadn\u2019t wanted it this way. \u201cCall him back and tell him to unfinalize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Gavin said, his voice taking on a grave finality. \u201cThis is what\u2019s best for the company and what\u2019s best for the two of you and Hannah. You\u2019ll think so, too, in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d Slade crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the heart of Black Oak Oil.</p><p>You make it run.\u201d</p><p>Gavin barely managed a shrug, as if lifting his shoulders was too much effort.</p><p>\u201cTell us. Just spit out what\u2019s going to hit the press so we can deal with it.\u201d Whatever he was about to confess had been a festering wound poisoning his oldest brother for years.</p><p>Dropping his elbows to his knees, Gavin hunched over and stared at the floor. \u201cI did kill Nikki, but worse, I killed my own child.\u201d</p><p>Dex slumped into his chair, the truth hitting him. Compassion welled up. He might not have been raised with Gavin, but Dex knew him. Guilt about Dex\u2019s rough childhood had brought Gavin to his unknown brother\u2019s door in the first place. Thinking that he\u2019d been even a tiny bit responsible for his own child\u2019s death would crush him.</p><p>Gavin locked stares with Slade, then Dex. Clearly, he was braced, waiting for condemnation, rejection. Hatred.</p><p>Dex reached out and put a hand on his. He said the words he\u2019d never said before\u2014to either of them. \u201cI love you, brother. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>Gavin pulled his hand back. Of all the things Dex could have had said, this shocked him most. He turned to Slade and saw the same look of concern and compassion on his face. No anger. No horror or exclusion. They simply waited for him to tell the story.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>Slade nodded. \u201cYes. I heard. I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing Dex said. I love you, and I\u2019m here for you. Just get it all out so we can deal.\u201d</p><p>Their faces were grim, but they hadn\u2019t walked out on him. They\u2019d shown solidarity, offered support. Fuck. His brothers had told him that they loved him.</p><p>Dex sent him a solemn stare. \u201cI take it Nikki was pregnant when she decided to down a bunch of pills. How is that your fault, Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me enlighten you.\u201d He hated the nasty edge to his words.</p><p>Gavin had known this would be hard, but their seeming acceptance made it harder. What if they heard the details and decided that he was a murdering prick after all? He scrubbed his raw eyes with the heels of his hands. Then they would finally understand. None of that changed the fact he owed them the truth before the press splashed it all over the front page.</p><p>\u201cNikki and I had a volatile relationship, as you know. It was interesting at first. A nice diversion from all the other shit in my life. We had some hot sex. She loved to fuck, and I enjoyed obliging her. For a while, it was worth all the drama. Then she got demanding. I found myself in this constant state of making up and breaking up with her. I have to admit, the more we fought, the hotter the sex became. It was damn good. And when the former Black Oak board was trying to eat me alive, I needed the release.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI got addicted to the sex and the anger. They made me forget work for a while. Our parents were dead. We didn\u2019t have a lot of other family. You two were in college, far away...so Nikki became a fixture in my life. I never planned to marry her. I knew she was bad for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was there and we weren\u2019t.\u201d Guilt ravaged Slade\u2019s face. He shook his head, his shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two had to go to school,\u201d Gavin rebuked. The last thing he needed was Slade or Dex feeling responsible. \u201cThis fiasco was all my doing. I was an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were twenty-two, Gavin,\u201d Dex growled. \u201cMost twenty-two-year-olds are drinking beer and trying to figure out where to get a job. They aren\u2019t dealing with multi-billion-dollar companies and hostile takeovers. They aren\u2019t trying to keep everything together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to justify this, Dex. Being young doesn\u2019t absolve me of anything.\u201d The liquor was wearing off. He needed more to get through this, but he felt sure his brothers would object at the moment. After he told them the rest, though, they might decide they didn\u2019t give a damn after all and let him drink himself to death.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fucking perfect. Don\u2019t expect yourself to be,\u201d Slade insisted.</p><p>\u201cPerfect?\u201d Gavin scoffed even as his stomach threatened to revolt. This was the part he\u2019d dreaded. \u201cHell, I wasn\u2019t even close. When I decided to break this perverse cycle Nikki and I were in, I told her we were done for good. I made the break clean. I got a new phone. I told the security at the office and the condo to keep her out. She still managed to get my number. And she\u2019d call, leave these long messages begging me to come back because she needed me. Then she told me she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad she ever told you that before?\u201d Slade asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d had a couple of scares, even though she claimed she was on the Pill. And I always used condoms with her.\u201d</p><p>But with Hannah he hadn\u2019t. He hadn\u2019t even thought of protecting her. He\u2019d just lost himself and flooded her with every ounce of his seed. God, his brothers were going to hate him\u2014and they had every right to.</p><p>Gavin sighed. \u201cNikki had tried to get me to marry her twice before by claiming that she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when she announced it this time, you didn\u2019t believe her for good reason.\u201d Slade sat back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI also didn\u2019t believe her when she said she was going to kill herself because I\u2019d heard that before, too.\u201d Gavin\u2019s stomach turned again. \u201cShe called. I was at a party. I didn\u2019t even bother to step outside to talk to her. She asked if I even cared about our baby. I told her there wasn\u2019t a baby. She said she\u2019d taken some pills. She\u2019d threatened suicide before and hadn\u2019t followed through, so I didn\u2019t alert anyone. I didn\u2019t lift a damn finger.\u201d Dex\u2019s face softened. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. You couldn\u2019t have known she was serious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should have guessed or done something, just in case. Instead, I told Nikki to do what she had to do. Then I hung up on her. An hour later, her sister called me to tell me that she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gavin, you didn\u2019t force her to take the pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t even try to save her.\u201d Gavin stood and kicked the chair across the room. \u201cShe really was pregnant, a few weeks along according to the coroner.

If I had taken her threat seriously, that child would be alive today.\u201d</p> <p>Dex shook his head. \u201cYou would never have intentionally hurt her or that baby. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obviously missing the fact that through my negligence, I killed both a woman and a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Slade said in an even tone. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You broke up with a woman who wasn\u2019t stable, and she decided to go off the deep end. She needed help, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give it to her. Damn it, you two are not listening to me.\u201d It was maddening. \u201cI left her there. I let her die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe chose to take the pills herself. She didn\u2019t care about the baby in her belly. She didn\u2019t call for an ambulance. She didn\u2019t want to live. That\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Slade stood and began to pace, his hand running through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve seriously wasted years of your life over this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was my child!\u201d Gavin yelled. Years of anger threatened to bubble to the surface.</p><p>\u201cShe took the kid down with her,\u201d Dex said quietly. Gavin couldn\u2019t mistake the sadness in his brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019re grieving most of all. I know. And I am so sorry.\u201d Slade\u2019s hands rested on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. I wish you\u2019d told us sooner. We would have done anything to help you through this.\u201d</p><p>Gavin pushed them away. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dex frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t what, give a damn? Don\u2019t get pissed that you\u2019ve wasted years of your life over something you couldn\u2019t control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forgive you? That\u2019s what you\u2019re really upset about it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Slade challenged.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want us to forgive you.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin sat for a minute, his thoughts racing. Slade\u2019s words hit him squarely in the chest. He didn\u2019t want forgiveness. He\u2019d held the pain in for so long. The thought of releasing it terrified him. He\u2019d hidden behind it, used it as barrier to keep him from everything that could hurt him again. He\u2019d used it to push people away.</p><p>Like Hannah.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t loved Nikki. He\u2019d had some vague affection for her in the beginning\u2014and nothing but contempt at the end. That hadn\u2019t seemed abnormal to Gavin. He\u2019d watched his mother and father\u2019s utterly loveless relationship and decided he was incapable of true devotion. He\u2019d held onto that lie until now, even in the face of his feelings for Hannah.</p><p>Fuck. He wasn\u2019t afraid of what he would do to Hannah. He was scared of what he felt for her\u2014and how vulnerable that would make him.</p><p>She could die or walk away. Hannah could love his brothers more than she would ever love him. Any of those scenarios would demolish him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Forgiveness is scary. Your loathing would have been easier. And now I\u2019ve fucked up again.\u201d Gavin let his head fall to his hands.</p><p>Regret, deep and cutting, sliced through him. He\u2019d allowed his own fear to push Hannah away. She\u2019d offered him everything he could have hoped for, and he\u2019d acted like an animal.</p><p>\u201cBecause you pushed Hannah away with insults?\u201d Slade clapped him on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re human. You make mistakes. An apology fixes things most of the time. You\u2019ll do better in the future. But now, it\u2019s long past time to forgive yourself. There\u2019s a woman in this house who loves you. Don\u2019t push her away again because you\u2019re scared. Do you have any idea how precious she is? She has a heart big enough for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shook his head. \u201cNot for me. Not after what I did earlier. God, she\u2019ll never forgive me.</p><p>Neither will you.\u201d</p><p>Dex\u2019s face got hard and unrelenting. \u201cWhat happened with Hannah?\u201d This might be worse than telling them about Nikki. \u201cHannah found me shortly after I\u2019d talked to the attorney. I had been drinking for a while\u2014hard.\u201d Slade slapped at the bottle. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hurt her?\u201d Dex demanded.</p><p>Filled with shame, Gavin nodded, reluctant to say the words that might really sever his relationship with his brothers. He had only started to understand that he wasn\u2019t responsible entirely for what had happened with Nikki. He couldn\u2019t say the same thing of Hannah.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known until this moment how much he\u2019d needed his brothers\u2019 support and comfort. Now it might all be gone. But he owed them the truth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt her physically,\u201d Gavin choked. \u201cBut I tore her heart apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpit it out,\u201d Slade insisted.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to push her away. I thought it would be easier on everyone if she hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you\u2019ve been hating yourself?\u201d Slade asked pointedly.</p><p>God, put that way, his behavior sounded pathetic. \u201cI love her. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought that she would find out what I had done and look at me like I was a monster.\u201d Slade\u2019s eyes rolled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her at all. She would have hugged you and told you to forgive yourself. She would have understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew that, deep down. But like you said, he wasn\u2019t ready to forgive himself. Now...\u201d Dex loomed over him. \u201cTell me what you said to her.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, Gavin figured out why this relationship with Hannah had a chance. They would keep each other in line. When one of them was cranky and difficult, the other two would set him straight. They would all be there for Hannah and each other. They would be a family.</p><p>If he could find the courage to be a part of it.</p><p>\u201cI called her graceless and classless. I told her that she wasn\u2019t good enough to be my wife.\u201d Gavin had been prepared for the fist that flew his way. He wasn\u2019t prepared for just how hard his youngest brother hit. Gavin\u2019s head flew back, the pain in his jaw a welcome wake up call.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that about her again. It\u2019s bullshit, and you know it. Understand?\u201d Gavin nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it, Dex. I love her. God, I love her so much. I think she\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Dex pointed an accusatory finger at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it up to her. You\u2019re going to treat her like a princess. You\u2019re going to apologize, and if she wants you to kiss her feet, then you\u2019re going to get down on the floor and kiss them.\u201d</p><p>Slade cut in. \u201cExactly. And you\u2019re also going to tell that fucking lawyer to stop whatever it is you have him doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. I\u2019m going to go find Hannah. We\u2019re going to talk this out. You better be ready to grovel.\u201d Dex turned and stomped out of the room.</p><p>Slade calmly got up and walked to the fridge. He came back with a bag of frozen peas and handed it to Gavin. \u201cPut that on your face. Is anything broken?\u201d Gavin moved his sore jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad you weren\u2019t standing up. I\u2019ve been in bar fights with our shitkicker baby brother.</p><p>He\u2019s mean. He might have kicked you in the balls.\u201d Slade\u2019s head shook affectionately. \u201cBut he\u2019s always quick to forgive when he gives a damn about you. I think you\u2019ll find Hannah is, too.\u201d He hoped so. Gavin put the frozen vegetables to his swelling jaw. Something had eased inside of him. Gavin realized he hadn\u2019t taken a full breath in years. That guilt and fear had always been pressing down on his chest. But that ball of self-hatred had begun to ease with his brothers\u2019 acceptance. Gavin hoped it would dissolve to nothingness under Hannah\u2019s love.</p><p>What was he going to do if Hannah rejected him?</p><p>His lips curled up as the answer came to him. She could reject him all she liked, but he would win her in the end because he would wear her down with his love. He would always be there, opening the door for her, seeing to her needs, telling her how beautiful she is. He was fucking Gavin James. He had stared down a room of greedy executives at the age of twenty-two and beat them all back. He\u2019d taken care of his brothers. He was stronger than he\u2019d ever given himself credit for.</p><p>And he would take a page from his shitkicker brother\u2019s book. When he found this little asshole who threatened his family, he was going to beat the fucker to death.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad that look isn\u2019t directed toward me,\u201d Slade said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I am not stepping down as CEO.\u201d Gavin needed to say those words\u2014and more. \u201cI am not giving Hannah up. And I\u2019m not holding myself back anymore. I am done. I might be a shit, but I\u2019m a member of this family.\u201d</p><p>Relief was palpable on Slade\u2019s face. \u201cThank God. Every now and then Dex just has to start a fight. You can be his combination babysitter slash punching bag, at least part-time. He\u2019s exhausting.\u201d</p><p>Gavin smiled. That sounded fun. He could fight with his brothers and they would still love him. Except...</p><p>He should probably tell Slade everything. \u201cI didn\u2019t use a condom with Hannah.\u201d He wasn\u2019t prepared for Slade\u2019s fist to slam right into his cheek. The other side of Gavin\u2019s face lit up. Crap, when had Slade learned to do so much damage?</p><p>\u201cMother fucker!\u201d Gavin yelled. He hoped there was another bag of frozen peas.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do that again until she\u2019s right and properly married.\u201d Slade frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cEven then, we talk about that shit in this family. Are we clear?\u201d They weren\u2019t going to exclude him for that fuck up. Gavin breathed a sigh of relief that flooded his very soul. \u201cI agree. Guess that means we have to get her to the altar soon.\u201d The door to the kitchen swung open, and Dex ran in, his eyes wild with worry. \u201cI can\u2019t find Hannah. She left us a note on her computer that she\u2019s gone. She left us. If we can\u2019t find her, I\u2019m going to break more than your jaw, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Slade raced to the kitchen drawer where the keys to all the vehicles were kept. \u201cThe keys to the limo and the Jeeps are still here. God, do you think she went on foot?\u201d He doubted that. Hannah was stubborn, but she was also smart. Gavin stood, his face aching, and peered out the window. \u201cOne of the golf carts is missing. Depending on when she left, we might be able to catch up to her by simply running after her.\u201d Dex started for the door, apparently willing to do just that. Gavin put a hand out. \u201cWe could run her down faster in the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dex said. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Gavin picked up the keys to the Jeep and handed them to Slade.</p><p>It was time to get their girl.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Hannah stared at all the unfamiliar men at the Angry Moose crowding in on her with expressions ranging from curiosity to downright hunger. What the devil was she going to do?</p><p>\u201cYou boys take a big step back now,\u201d a firm, feminine voice rang out.</p><p>An older woman, her steel gray hair in a braid that ran almost to her waist, stepped out. The roughneck who had stared at Hannah outside the bar stood at this woman\u2019s side wearing a sheepish expression.</p><p>\u201cTobias, you little traitor!\u201d The biggest cowboy in the group growled, but the woman hushed him with a single glare of her brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe first one to make a move on the young lady loses bar privileges.\u201d Every man in the bar took a big step back. Hannah grinned. Apparently, her charms weren\u2019t as coveted as a cold mug of beer.</p><p>She breathed a deep sigh of relief as the older woman walked forward wearing a friendly smile on her face. The woman was slender but built solid, a fact underscored by her no-nonsense blue jeans and standard flannel shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou, young lady, look like you could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took a seat on the nearest stool and peeked at her inebriated pilot, still happily snoring. It didn\u2019t look like she was going anywhere for a while.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes and two tequila shots later, she grinned at Marnie. \u201cI want another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Hannah pondered that question. Probably. After all, she\u2019d spent the last few days biting off way more than she could chew. Did she want just one James boy? No, that was too simple. Two?</p><p>Bring it on! Three? Well...three had proven one too many. Would a third tequila shot put her over the edge, just like that third man? It didn\u2019t matter. She might as well have another drink\u2014</p><p>one for each James brother.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take another.\u201d She slapped firmly at the bar, missed and hit her own thigh. She probably didn\u2019t need more alcohol, but the tequila made her stomach feel warm and tingly. And that made her think of those men again, being naked and entwined with them, bringing her the kind of pleasure that even romantic fiction hadn\u2019t adequately described. She missed them, wanted them. She needed more tequila to drown that out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marnie shrugged and reached under the bar. She came back up with a shot glass filled with amber liquid. Without a second thought, Hannah picked it up and slammed it to the back of her throat. No feminine sipping for her this time.</p><p>Unlike the first two she\u2019d had, this drink lacked bite. It was silky smooth and sweet. She put the empty glass down and stared with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is tequila. I like this one, Marnie. I could drink this all night.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d probably have to. Glancing at the pilot again, Hannah asked, \u201cDo you have any idea when Billy might be sober?\u201d</p><p>It was rude to make her wait while he slept off his vodka. She\u2019d planned a grand exit. She was supposed to be halfway to Anchorage by now. She couldn\u2019t sit here much longer or the brothers would find her. What would happen then? She shivered in anticipation. No, you\u2019re supposed to be leaving them forever, not thinking about all the delicious ways they could punish you.</p> <p>Marnie leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, girl. Why don\u2019t you tell me about it? I have a feeling this is about my boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t know your boys. I just flew up from Dallas yesterday with my boss\u2014well, my former boss\u2014and his brothers. I haven\u2019t exactly seen much past the bedroom, if you know what I mean.\u201d Had she just said that out loud?</p><p>Hannah felt herself flush. Where had her manners gone? Fled in a haze of alcohol, she suspected. Except she didn\u2019t feel very drunk. Tipsy, maybe. She picked up the last shot glass and sniffed it. \u201cHey, is this apple juice?\u201d</p><p>Marnie merely poured another. \u201cNow see, it sounds like you have met my boys. Gavin and Slade would be just the type to hide a woman away. And though I didn\u2019t have a hand in raising Dex, he\u2019s become like one of my own, too. He can be a caveman when it suits him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Hannah downed the drink. \u201cI flee, and I run straight into their surrogate momma.</p> <p>If you\u2019re not going to help me get drunk, will you at least get me a cup of coffee?\u201d A rustling against the beat-up hardwood floors sounded behind her. Hannah sighed. The men of the bar had been watching her every move since she\u2019d walked in. Initially Marnie had scared them, but Hannah had heard them whispering. Now, they began belting out offers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a drink, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. One of them fruity drinks, if you want,\u201d added another.</p><p>\u201cI have some of that fancy beer back at my place. We could get...comfortable and drink a few.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, Hannah turned. The dozen or so roughnecks had closed in. The big, burly men in faded jeans and flannel shirts, clearly used to hard work if their battered boots were any indication, hovered. If she hadn\u2019t already given her heart away, she might have found these guys attractive. But not a one could hold a candle to her men.</p><p>Except Gavin, Slade, and Dex weren\u2019t her men anymore.</p> <p>Hannah smoothed back her hair. \u201cI appreciate the offer, gentlemen, but I\u2019ve had enough of men to last me a lifetime. And Miss Marnie is probably right, I really don\u2019t need more alcohol. I could, however, use a general store. Is there one around so I can pick up a few necessary items?\u201d Her head spun a bit. Hannah felt a deep gratitude to Marnie for cutting her off while she could still stand. She wasn\u2019t used to drinking, except the occasional glass of wine Slade ordered for her.</p><p>\u201cThe store is next door. What do you need?\u201d Marnie asked. \u201cI\u2019ll have someone pick your items up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need some underwear, for starters. Dex didn\u2019t pack any. He said I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear them, but now that I\u2019ve left, I\u2019ll wear anything I like. And I like underwear.\u201d She heard the men behind her erupt into a rumble of chatter. She turned to find some of them texting. Others blatantly talked amongst themselves.</p><p>\u201cThe new girl ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 no underwear.\u201d</p><p>Hannah held her head high and glared at the man who\u2019d made that statement. He had to be at least six foot five and all of twenty-one, but neither trait excused him from using double negatives, at least not in Hannah\u2019s book. \u201cIt\u2019s more correct to say that I am not wearing any underwear. It\u2019s also rude to point that out.\u201d She turned back to Marnie. \u201cI would also love a bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you she didn\u2019t have no bra on. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>Hannah glared over her shoulder at yet another man. He was smaller, but seemed to have his height-advantaged friend\u2019s trouble with grammar.</p><p>\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, a flush turning his skin a dark brown. \u201cI meant to say that you haven\u2019t got a bra on.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, resolved to ignore him and the others.</p><p>Marnie set a cup of coffee in front of her. Hannah picked it up, wondering if she could pour it down the pilot\u2019s throat instead. Time was running thin.</p><p>The older woman grinned, mirth lighting her dark eyes. \u201cI can see why my boys are interested in you. You can handle yourself, girl. But I\u2019m sorry to tell you that unless you like boxer shorts in an extra large, you\u2019re out of luck. And I definitely don\u2019t stock bras, although the way some of these men have gained weight, a few of them might need a little support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my thyroid, Marnie,\u201d a particularly large man said as he crossed his arms and hunched his shoulders as though trying to hide his chest.</p><p>Marnie\u2019s eyes rolled. \u201cRoughnecks. Suddenly, they\u2019re so sensitive. Now, which of my boys is giving you trouble? I bet it\u2019s Gavin. Unless you\u2019re leaving over the underwear thing. Then I\u2019d say that\u2019s either Dex or Slade. I like my briefs, to tell you the truth. I don\u2019t think I could give them up.\u201d</p><p>Hannah could probably live without the underwear, though she\u2019d intended to fight them on the bra issue. She also needed to figure out how to get the plug out of her bottom. It was still there, a subtle reminder every time she moved of the pleasures she\u2019d be missing now that she\u2019d left those perverted, wonderful men. \u201cIt\u2019s just...Gavin isn\u2019t interested in me.\u201d Marnie\u2019s dark eyes turned shrewd. \u201cI doubt that. I know him. I\u2019ve been worried about him for the last ten years. When I heard he\u2019d brought a woman here, I was so damn happy. Now that I\u2019ve met you, I\u2019m even happier. You\u2019re what he needs. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re already involved with Slade and Dex, while Gavin is being the stubborn holdout.\u201d Hannah flushed. \u201cYou\u2019re perceptive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sweetie, men don\u2019t usually give edicts about whether a woman can wear delicates unless they\u2019re involved, and I know Slade and Dex have been looking for a woman to share for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a way of life around these parts, Miss,\u201d the large man with the thyroid issue said with a big smile. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got a lot of women here. We have to share. And if the James boys are only offering you three men, well, me and my brothers are willing to offer you five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really a selling point,\u201d Hannah said, unable to keep the horror from her voice. What on earth would she do with five men? Most likely, she would go crazy. The amount of cooking and laundry alone would make her suicidal.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind them.\u201d Marnie reached out and covered Hannah\u2019s hand with her own. \u201cSo you say Gavin doesn\u2019t want you?\u201d</p><p>Tears threatened. \u201cYes. He\u2019s made it clear that I\u2019m not good enough for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse pucky,\u201d Marnie replied. \u201cHe\u2019s been on a path to self-destruction for years. Ask yourself why he brought you here if he isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I seem to have some sort of stalker...\u201d</p><p>Marnie shrugged. \u201cDex\u2019s area of expertise. That don\u2019t require Gavin being here.\u201d Good point. Hannah hadn\u2019t considered that. Everything lately had been such a whirlwind.</p><p>The time to think between all those orgasms had been short.</p><p>Why would Gavin need to be here? The trouble at the site was either computer or mechanical. That was Slade\u2019s end of the business. Dex was security, and he\u2019d taken the lead on working with the Lenox brothers, as well as looking into the malicious virus at the River Run office. Gavin didn\u2019t need to be here at all. Had he come simply because he wanted to?</p><p>\u201cYou might be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course I am.\u201d A satisfied smile crossed Marnie\u2019s face. \u201cI talked to him yesterday. He always calls me when he\u2019s coming in. I asked him what he was doing here, and he did that sputtering thing that men do when they can\u2019t really explain themselves. I\u2019ll bet Dex and Slade could have handled everything. Gavin should probably be in Dallas, but he chose to come here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying makes sense, but he pushed me away, Marnie. He said some really ugly things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t always make the best decisions when it comes to admitting they\u2019re in love. Stop thinking about what he said. Start thinking about how he\u2019s treated you since you met him. That\u2019s what his heart is telling you, even if his mouth is lying.\u201d</p><p>How had Gavin treated her? She\u2019d been so hurt by his slurs that she\u2019d almost forgotten everything else between them.</p><p>He\u2019d trusted her with a job she hadn\u2019t been entirely qualified for. He\u2019d been patient and kind while she learned. When she\u2019d been rear-ended on the freeway, she\u2019d called Gavin to let him know she would be late to work. Minutes later, he\u2019d appeared at the scene, just as the police were taking her statement. He\u2019d lifted all the responsibility off her shoulders, including getting her car towed and driving her to work while it was in the shop.</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t do that for all his employees.</p><p>She also bet he hadn\u2019t put his last secretary on his piano and made love to her like he was a dying man and she was the only one who could save him. She could be pregnant with his child right now...and a part of her didn\u2019t hate that idea. At the time, all she\u2019d been able to think about was getting closer to him. Because she loved him. Maybe Gavin had been under the same spell.</p><p>And maybe she was making excuses for him because the alternative hurt too badly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Hannah said with a sad sigh. \u201cHe might have feelings for me, but he won\u2019t face them.\u201d</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t come between him and his brothers. Her own family had been so fractured that she couldn\u2019t stand being the reason Slade, Dex, and Gavin fought.</p><p>Would Slade and Dex accept her goodbye? She doubted it. They would probably be on the next plane to Texas once they figured out she\u2019d gone. They would hunt her down. Because they loved her.</p><p>Was it too late? Had she already come between them and Gavin? Was she giving up Dex and Slade for nothing?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being very smart about this, am I?\u201d Hannah asked Marnie.</p><p>\u201cWalking away isn\u2019t the answer, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Hannah\u2019s misery washed over her. There was a big part of her that wished none of this had happened. Then she would just be at home, cuddled up with her cat, continuing to dream about her men.</p><p>But that was no longer an option. So now what? She\u2019d always thought that love would be easy-breezy and bring her nothing but joy. Nope. It was hard, like everything in life. Maybe harder because it was so precious. Yet, she hadn\u2019t fought for it at all. She\u2019d gotten almost everything she wanted, and now she was willing to throw it all away because it wasn\u2019t quite perfect enough?</p><p>Marnie leaned across the bar, propping her chin on her fist. \u201cDo you think you gave Gavin any reason to push you away?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, fighting tears as she remembered that horrible scene. \u201cNo. He had no reason to talk down to me that way. Bastard.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d treated her like an annoying pest when all she\u2019d done was offer him comfort. Well, and a blowjob. She\u2019d given the man her very first blowjob. Shouldn\u2019t that count for something? Yes.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t fought, hadn\u2019t told Gavin how his words made her feel. She hadn\u2019t stood up for herself.</p><p>She pounded a fist on the bar.</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re getting mad.\u201d Marnie grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s the reaction you should have had.\u201d The woman was right. Gavin had been a total jerk to her. Why had she cried over him and been willing to walk away from two men who did treat her right? She knew he was hurting, but that didn\u2019t give him the right to hurt others. Why should she give up her future with Dex and Slade because Gavin wanted to wallow in the past?</p><p>\u201cHey, Marnie, why\u2019d you have to go and do that?\u201d Six-foot-five-guy frowned. \u201cShe was real sad. Sad women are easier to comfort than mad ones. Now we ain\u2019t ever going to get her to come back to our place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou step one inch closer to her and your place is going to be a pine box six feet under,\u201d a low voice threatened.</p><p>Afternoon sunlight slanted in through open saloon doors. Slade, Dex, and Gavin stood in the doorway, looking like gunslingers about to start an Old West-style fight. Hannah\u2019s heart took a nosedive. Individually, they were gorgeous. Together, they were positively heart-stopping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not one of them had on their usual, expensive suit. Instead, they all wore jeans and cotton shirts that proved they were far more rugged and male than the average executive. Slade was long and lean and bulged in all the right places. His face had such beautiful angles, it looked chiseled. Those blue eyes were sharp with intelligence. And under it all, a barely concealed power that pulled at her.</p><p>Dex was all dangerous cowboy. He was built more like a linebacker than his brothers. His biceps were huge and that cut torso of his tapered into a lean waist and the finest butt she\u2019d ever had the joy to see on a man.</p><p>And Gavin looked like a fallen angel. His face was all kinds of stunning, which matched his body. Those lips of his, so skilled, so demanding, just unraveled Hannah completely. She couldn\u2019t help but think about how it had felt to have those lips on her skin, loving her.</p><p>None of them looked very loving now, though. As they stared down the crowd, they looked ready to kill.</p> <p>All the other men froze.</p><p>\u201cNow, Dex,\u201d Gavin said in that smooth-as-silk voice of his, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to spend the money on a pine box. We\u2019ll just toss his carcass off the mountain or let the bears take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Hannah slid off her barstool and faced them. It was time to start putting her dainty foot down.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to talk to them that way. You don\u2019t own me, Gavin James.\u201d Slade stepped forward and grabbed her arm. His grasp was gentle but unmistakably firm. \u201cHe might not own you. But we damn sure do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Dex crossed his arms over his massive chest and pinned her with a dark stare.</p> <p>Hannah narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you have any idea how arrogant the two of you sound? I\u2019m not a piece of property. No one owns me. Let\u2019s get that straight right now.\u201d Dex shook his head. \u201cYou became ours when you gave yourself to us, darlin\u2019. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve earned some swats from all of us for leaving without explanation, except that little note on your computer,\u201d Slade said, his voice taking on that dark, deep tone that let her know she was in trouble.</p><p>Hannah turned to see if any of her admirers planned to back her up. Only Marnie stood behind her.</p><p>\u201cThey left the minute the James Gang walked in the door,\u201d Marnie murmured. \u201cThey ran out the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know they have survival instincts.\u201d Gavin snorted. \u201cGet ready to feel my hand on your ass, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He stood in between his brothers, as though he had some sort of right to be there.</p> <p>Hannah fumed. \u201cI might be willing to hear this from Slade and Dex. Maybe. But why are you here, Gavin? You\u2019re no longer my boss. I quit, remember? You denied being my lover or having any feelings for me, so what I do is none of your business. You certainly can\u2019t threaten to spank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll do more than threaten once we get all this settled.\u201d Gavin raised a brow, then his expression gentled. \u201cHannah, I didn\u2019t mean a word of anything I said this afternoon. I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to prove that.\u201d</p><p>His words made her pulse jump, but Hannah hesitated. She had to be careful that she didn\u2019t misunderstand him. \u201cIf you\u2019re just trying to hire me back, the answer is no.\u201d Gavin smiled, looking supremely amused. \u201cI loved having you as my assistant, and I\u2019d hire you again in a heartbeat. But baby, my interest in you right now isn\u2019t at all professional. I\u2019ll be happy to prove it, starting with that spanking.\u201d</p><p>She managed to hold in a gasp\u2014barely. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch me. I don\u2019t want you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you think you\u2019re reading my mind?\u201d Hannah thrust her hands on her hips, her expression all but daring him to claim he was psychic.</p><p>\u201cNo, your nipples are telling me everything I need to know.\u201d Hannah gasped. She glanced down. Sure enough, the little traitors were standing straight up, poking out from behind her shirt. Hastily, she crossed her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s an involuntary reaction. It doesn\u2019t mean I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, baby. You said that you care about me. I admit, I care about you.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cNow tell me, do you want me?\u201d</p> <p>His voice had become a deep, male caress. Hannah actually felt more blood rushing to her nipples...and down between her legs, making it hard to think. Why was Gavin pushing this? Had he truly had a change of heart or was this some new game?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d A huge lie. Hannah bit her lip. But darn it all, she wasn\u2019t ready to confess everything in her heart again only to have it thrown in her face.</p><p>\u201cBoys, do you think she wants me?\u201d Gavin slanted gazes to Dex and Slade, who flanked her in an instant. Dex grabbed her free arm and reached for the hem of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she screeched as he lifted her skirt to her thighs. \u201cThis is a public place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s gone, including Marnie. She just slipped out the back.\u201d Of course the woman would choose her \u201cboys\u201d over someone she met less than an hour ago, but still, with Marnie went her last hope for an ally.</p><p>A second later, it didn\u2019t matter because Slade had popped the buttons of her blouse open, exposing her hard nipples, and Dex\u2019s fingers skimmed the embarrassingly wet folds of her pussy.</p><p>She caught her breath then moaned when he grazed her clit.</p><p>Flashing her a wicked smile, Dex withdrew his fingers and held them up for Gavin. \u201cWould you look at that. All pretty and very, very wet.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made my point,\u201d Gavin drawled.</p><p>She smacked Slade\u2019s hands away and folded the edges of her blouse back together as she twisted away from Dex. Her skirt fell to her knees. \u201cThat was for your brothers,\u201d she told Gavin.</p><p>\u201cThey were touching me. My arousal has nothing to do with you.\u201d Gavin paused, shrugged. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll just sidle your way and see if I can make you come. That should prove something.\u201d</p><p>It absolutely would. She\u2019d melt quickly into a puddle at his feet. Then he\u2019d know he could play with her anytime he wanted, and her body would respond.</p><p>Maybe she should stop fighting him and just ask what the hell he wanted.</p><p>\u201cFine. I want you. I admit it. What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, things aren\u2019t right between us. We have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just listen.\u201d Slade turned to her and sighed. \u201cGavin has a few things he wants to say to you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had already said enough. She\u2019d been hauled bodily to Alaska, forced to miss her visit with her grandmother. She\u2019d had her cell phone taken away. She\u2019d lost her virginity and her ability to wear underwear. Gavin had ripped her heart out, forced her to admit that she wanted him, and now he had something to say? Marnie had told her to get mad. Well, she was mad.</p><p>Hannah picked up her shot glass and threw it straight at Gavin\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Gavin cursed as the shot glass whizzed past his head and smashed against the wall behind him, shattering.</p><p>Hannah reached for another on the bar nearby. Gavin strode toward her, the promise of punishment ripe in his eyes. She threw the glass in her grip. It pulled left again.</p><p>Slade and Dex seemed content to just watch the whole thing play out with barely repressed smiles.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gavin, before you spank her, you did promise to grovel.\u201d Dex leaned against the bar.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI can\u2019t grovel if she\u2019s throwing shit at my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, groveling? Ha!\u201d Hannah reached for a nearby glass tumbler and raised it over her head. If she was having trouble with the smaller missiles, she\u2019d go bigger. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen.\u201d</p><p>Hannah aimed carefully. She would only get so many chances before Slade or Dex put a stop to her retribution.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to hit him, aim for the face, darlin\u2019,\u201d Dex said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be tender there.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Slade agreed. \u201cDex and I both slugged him earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hit Gavin?\u201d And now that she thought about it, why had they allowed her to pitch fastballs at their brother\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t like them. One of them should have had her over their knee before she could let the first one fly. Yet here they stood, watching as she took out her frustrations on the barware.</p><p>\u201cFor a couple of reasons,\u201d Slade explained. \u201cFirst, he should never have said the things he said to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you?\u201d Why would he have told them? If he\u2019d really been trying to push her away, he should have used the opportunity to shove a wedge between her and his brothers.</p><p>\u201cI told them everything, sweetheart.\u201d Gavin stood up, the look on his face so regretful that Hannah put the glass down. She hadn\u2019t really looked at him before. She\u2019d simply reacted to his presence. His handsome face was slightly swollen on his left jaw, and his right cheek, near his eye, had started to swell.</p><p>\u201cDex hit him for what he said to you. I hit him for not using a condom,\u201d Slade explained.</p><p>Dex\u2019s eyebrows climbed up his forehead. \u201cHe did what?\u201d Hannah set down the wine glass and held up a hand. \u201cStop. Back off on the barbarian act.\u201d She turned back to Gavin. \u201cWhy did you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was confessing at the time. Everything.\u201d Gavin stared at her. She could feel his will pounding at her. \u201cI told my brothers all the mistakes I\u2019ve made. Pushing you away was one of the stupidest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly just tired. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gavin, but I don\u2019t know if I can trust you. I believe that you think you mean what you\u2019re saying. I can even believe that you have feelings for me, but I\u2019ll always be a country girl with a community college education. I can\u2019t change that. I won\u2019t ever really care about the stuff those society women do, like fashion designers or what kind of car I drive. I can\u2019t be the kind of wife you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly the kind of wife I need.\u201d Gavin closed the last few steps between them.</p><p>\u201cLoving. Kind. Smart. Loyal. Hannah, I can\u2019t imagine loving another woman the way I love you.</p><p>I screwed this up. I just hope you\u2019ll give me a second chance.\u201d She wanted to, but he\u2019d battered her heart pretty badly.</p><p>Dex\u2019s phone trilled. He cursed under his breath as he pulled it out and answered it. \u201cIt\u2019s the site. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Dex stepped away. Slade\u2019s hands came out to cup her shoulders. \u201cHannah, he\u2019s been scared.</p><p>Please give him a chance. He really is crazy about you, just like I know you are about him.\u201d Gavin was willing to admit he cared about her right now, but what happened when people questioned him? And how was the relationship supposed to work? If Gavin was ashamed of her for her background, how was he going to react when people got wind of his m\u00e9nage relationship?</p><p>Dex strode back into the room, his face pale. He clutched the phone tightly. \u201cThat was the one of the sheriff\u2019s deputies. They found Preston dead. He apparently hanged himself in one of the conference rooms.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s hands dropped. \u201cDear God. What... I escorted him off the premises. How did he get back inside?\u201d</p><p>Hannah hadn\u2019t much liked Preston Ward III, but she certainly hadn\u2019t wanted him dead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he wanted to make a statement.\u201d Dex turned to Hannah. \u201cWe fired him earlier today. We think he might have been your stalker. Damn it. I need to go to the site.\u201d Slade stepped close to Dex. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I\u2019m the one who fired him. He didn\u2019t take it well, but I never expected this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Hannah said, wrapping her arms around him. \u201cHis wife had left him recently, too. There could be a lot of reasons he chose this.\u201d She could feel the coiled tension in Slade\u2019s body, but he hugged her close. Dex came around her back and held her. She was surrounded by their warmth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later,\u201d Slade replied. \u201cI would feel safer if you went home with Gavin.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to talk to him. Just don\u2019t beat him to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Hannah.\u201d Dex\u2019s hand tangled in her hair. He tilted her head up, twisting her slightly, brushing his lips against hers. \u201cGive him a chance.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She couldn\u2019t tell them no. She kissed Slade and they left.</p><p>Hannah was left alone with the man who\u2019d broken her heart.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Gavin turned the Jeep onto the road that led home. The gravel crunched beneath the wheels.</p><p>His brothers were going to have a fun time coming home in the golf cart on these rustic roads. It was a testament to Hannah\u2019s desire to be away from him that she\u2019d managed to drive to town in the miniature vehicle.</p><p>He glanced at the woman beside him. Her beautiful face was set in stubborn lines, her focus firmly on the road ahead. She hadn\u2019t looked at him once since they\u2019d left the Angry Moose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin sighed. Of all the people he\u2019d hurt with his refusal to forgive himself, he regretted Hannah the most.</p><p>God, he hoped he hadn\u2019t lost his chance with her.</p><p>\u201cHannah, I would really like to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it would do any good,\u201d Hannah said. Her West Texas drawl always deepened when she got serious. That twang dripped now as she spoke. \u201cI think we\u2019ve said just about all we have to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I told you a bunch of lies meant to protect myself. Will you let me explain?\u201d She hesitated, and after a halting nod, Gavin went on. \u201cIn college, I met this girl named Nikki...\u201d</p><p>He explained the entire story, every terrible detail, including his failure to act on her suicide threat. When he finished, the car was dead silent. She was probably judging him, and he deserved it, but Gavin wasn\u2019t ready to give up. It had taken a lot of courage to tell someone with a heart as big as Hannah how small he\u2019d been in the past.</p><p>Finally, she said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. Nikki made a choice. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been living with so much guilt.\u201d</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief. She didn\u2019t hate him. \u201cI have utterly regretted my part in Nikki\u2019s death. And I\u2019ve been convinced since you walked in my office and shook my hand that, while I might love you, I\u2019d be poison to you. When you said you loved me, my first instinct was to push you away. But you just wouldn\u2019t be deterred, my lovely, stubborn girl.\u201d She smiled softly, and the crushing weight began to ease off his chest.</p><p>\u201cI promise, I didn\u2019t mean a word I said to you.\u201d His hands tightened on the steering wheel as he tried to figure out how to convince her of his sincerity.</p> <p>She turned those green eyes on him. They were so big and pure. God, nothing he or his brothers could do would ever wipe away the innocence that seemed an innate part of Hannah.</p><p>\u201cBut on some level, you did mean it, Gavin. There was a lot of truth in those words.</p><p>Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have hurt so much. I don\u2019t fit into your world. I don\u2019t even know that I want to. It\u2019s easier with Slade and Dex. They don\u2019t really care what others think.\u201d Gavin sat back in the driver\u2019s seat with a sigh. Just because she was innocent didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t wise. Hannah wouldn\u2019t fit easily into his world. She would always run the risk of being ridiculed. It would happen behind her back because he had the money and clout to hurt whoever rejected her, but he was too worldly to believe it wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>But Hannah was wrong about one thing. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaking political savvy for caring, sweetheart. I don\u2019t give a damn what anyone outside my family thinks. I am very good at corporate politics, but they don\u2019t mean anything to me. Outside of work, none of that matters.\u201d He would never go to another party, charity event, or social gathering if it meant making Hannah miserable.</p><p>\u201cBut all you do is work, Gavin. That\u2019s your whole life.\u201d</p><p>It had been, until he\u2019d realized how important she was to him. Now he wanted something so different. He\u2019d chosen his executive team carefully. Black Oak Oil could do with less micromanaging from him and still run like a well-oiled machine.</p> <p>Gavin tentatively reached out and put his hand over hers. She didn\u2019t wrap her fingers around his hand, but she didn\u2019t move away, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made me realize that I want something different. I\u2019ve proven myself as a CEO. Now I want to prove to you and my brothers that I can be a good husband and someday, hopefully, a father.\u201d</p><p>She slanted her gaze his way and pulled her hand back. Gavin missed its warmth. \u201cAfter this afternoon, someday might come around sooner than you think. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure you are, either.\u201d</p><p>He let his hand find the steering wheel again. He\u2019d dug a very deep hole with Hannah. He needed to patiently fill it back in. \u201cI am ready. If you\u2019re pregnant\u2014and even if you\u2019re not\u2014I want to prove to you that I\u2019ll be here every step of the way. We\u2019ll all be here for you.\u201d Because he and his brothers were in this together, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Hannah or their children if anything ever happened to him. Dex and Slade would protect and shelter her and the kids. They would pick her up if she was down. No way would his tragic history repeat itself with her.</p><p>Something warm and infinitely secure settled in Gavin\u2019s heart. It felt so right. This was exactly the family he wanted, three planets rotating around one beautiful sun\u2014with lots of little moons to follow.</p><p>\u201cIf I have a baby, and he\u2019s not biologically yours, I won\u2019t let you turn your back on him.\u201d Hannah\u2019s words hit him straight in the gut. She really believed he\u2019d abandon her or any of her children? Of course, what else would she think after hearing his part in Nikki\u2019s death? His satisfaction and rosy outlook for the future dissipated. A million gut-wrenching worries rushed to the surface. How could he convince her that he\u2019d changed?</p><p>He raked his hand through his hair then pinned her with an earnest stare. \u201cNever. I will never put myself before you again. I will never turn away if you or one of the children needs me. I know it must seem like I would after hearing about Nikki, but I really didn\u2019t think she was serious or pregnant. Please believe me.\u201d</p> <p>The long silence nearly sliced him in two. He had way more fences to mend with her than he\u2019d believed. What the hell was he going to do?</p><p>\u201cGavin?\u201d Her voice trembled and went straight to his heart.</p><p>God, he was afraid to look at her if her opinion of him was that low. But he\u2019d promised just moments ago to be there for her. He couldn\u2019t renege now. He faced her.</p><p>Her eyes were wide, pooling with unshed tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to live with that. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been hurting. The man I know would never abandon his own child\u2014or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d Hannah shook her head, her blonde hair brushing her shoulders. She reached for his hand, and he gave it to her. \u201cWhen you found out Dex existed, you moved heaven and earth to find him. You paid for his college, gave him a good job, and brought him into your family. Many people wouldn\u2019t have done half so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave him there. He\u2019s my brother. I just wish I\u2019d known sooner.\u201d Gavin remembered walking into the dingy house where Dex had lived for the last year of his stay in foster care. More like confinement. The house had been filthy. His foster mother had cared far more about herself and her damned dogs than the kids in her care. Before Dex could even say hello, Gavin had tossed a wad of cash at the woman and packed his brother up in the Benz. Everything Dex had owned fit into a grocery sack.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou mean the world to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t always done a good job of showing that I care for him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a great father, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best every day. I can\u2019t promise everything will be perfect, Hannah. I can only promise that I\u2019ll try. You\u2019ll get everything I have to give, if you give me a chance.\u201d She sniffled and released him, then folded her hands together in her lap. He wanted to hold her, but he hadn\u2019t earned the right yet. \u201cCan I think about it for a while?\u201d At least she wasn\u2019t saying no. Or blaming him for the deaths of Nikki and their unborn child.</p><p>Or throwing things at him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t admit it to her, but she\u2019d been hot as hell when she was mad. Hannah in a fury had done all sorts of things to his cock. Even as he\u2019d ducked, all he\u2019d been able to think about was throwing her on the pool table and fighting his way inside her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart. Take all the time you need. I want you to be sure.\u201d The house loomed ahead. He wished the drive was longer. Even with all the tension between them, he enjoyed just sitting with her.</p><p>He sincerely hoped that Preston had been Hannah\u2019s stalker. If so, with him dead, she would finally be safe, and he and his brothers could all concentrate on loving her. Gavin knew he should feel something for his former CIO, but after the way he\u2019d treated Hannah, Gavin merely wished he\u2019d gotten a piece of him before he\u2019d taken the coward\u2019s way out.</p><p>If the threat to Hannah was gone, they had no reason to rush back to Dallas. He hadn\u2019t taken a vacation in years. Maybe they could keep Hannah captive just a bit longer.</p><p>With a grin, he thought about the items his brothers had brought. Whips and handcuffs and paddles, not to mention vibrators, nipple clamps, and that pretty pink anal plug\u2014all the things a Dom would need to torture and pleasure a pretty little submissive. The idea of Hannah in nipple clamps, bound and trussed for his pleasure, really turned him on. Because it would be the woman he loved truly trusting him in every way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that mischievous look on your face.\u201d She frowned, lips pouting.</p><p>He\u2019d like to shove his rock-hard cock past those plump lips. \u201cWhich look is that, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of a wolf about to eat a fuzzy little bunny.\u201d His dick twitched. If she knew just how predatory he felt, she might jump out of the car.</p><p>\u201cThanks to my brothers, the little bunny I\u2019m thinking of tasting right now isn\u2019t fuzzy anymore.\u201d Hannah gasped and turned the most perfect shade of red. \u201cGavin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely got the time to look earlier. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>As he parked the car, Hannah stayed utterly silent. Finally, she turned, wearing the naughtiest grin on her face. \u201cThis bunny might not be fuzzy anymore, but she is hopping away. For now.\u201d She opened the door and slid out. Gavin followed, watching her ass sway.</p><p>Their talk had been more promising than he could have hoped. She hadn\u2019t condemned him, hadn\u2019t judged. Her understanding warmed his heart and made him more certain than ever that Hannah was the perfect woman for him. Gavin prayed like hell that he\u2019d get his second chance.</p><p>Slade\u2019s stomach turned as he looked down at Preston\u2019s body. On the surface, the man didn\u2019t look so terribly different from the one he\u2019d fired just hours before. He wore the same suit. His eyes were closed, but he lay too still to be merely sleeping. There was nothing left of Preston Ward in the vessel that lay before him. He was a cold, dead being.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d Slade forced himself to acknowledge Preston\u2019s identity. He was relieved when the sheriff pulled the sheet back over the man\u2019s lifeless face.</p><p>The sheriff nodded shortly. Mike Akna was a quiet but professional man. As far as Slade knew, he\u2019d never had to handle a case like this. River Run was hardly a hotbed of activity, but Mike radiated a competence that earned Slade\u2019s trust.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr. James. We knew who it was, but paperwork demands a formal identification of the body. We have witnesses who say you and Mr. Ward had an argument earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fired him and told him to fly back to Dallas, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not threaten to kill him?\u201d</p><p>Slade felt his eyebrows raise. He looked to his younger brother.</p><p>\u201cI thought this was a suicide,\u201d Dex asked. \u201cWhen your deputy called, he said Preston had hanged himself.\u201d</p><p>Mike held Dex\u2019s stare, gripping a notebook in his hand. \u201cSomeone wants me to believe that.\u201d Slade\u2019s stomach plummeted to his knees. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d Dex thumped a hand across his chest to shut him up then slipped into professional mode.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the time of death?\u201d</p><p>Slade thought if Gavin hadn\u2019t offered Dex a cushy job, he would have made a damn fine homicide detective.</p><p>\u201cNo TOD yet. Doc\u2019s not here to take a liver temp. I have a timeline, though. The last time anyone talked to the victim was 2:35 p.m. Preston called the two techs he\u2019d brought with him from Dallas, Scott Kirkwood and Lyle Franklin, and advised them to make arrangements to return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d been fired,\u201d Slade ground out. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t his call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they stayed put here for that very reason, according to Ben Kunayak. Ben said that Preston was madder than a wet hen when you threw him out of the office, not depressed. In the parking lot, security heard him shouting that he was going to call Gavin and demand his job back or sue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check Preston\u2019s cell?\u201d Slade asked. \u201cHad he called Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found his cell, but it was demolished.\u201d The sheriff pointed to a table off to the side. Slade could see the decimated phone. It didn\u2019t just look broken, but like someone had tried to disintegrate it.</p><p>\u201cIs the SIM card inside?\u201d The SIM card would tell them who Preston had called. Slade stepped toward the table, but Dex put a hand out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it. Chain of evidence is important. If this isn\u2019t a suicide, then we don\u2019t want to fuck up the evidence since you might be the prime suspect in a murder investigation.\u201d Dex always knew how to put things as succinctly as possible. Slade looked to the sheriff, who solemnly nodded his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re involved, either way,\u201d Mike explained. \u201cHe was your employee, and you had an altercation with him shortly before his death. I am definitely going to need a statement. Now, rumor has it that you and both of your brothers were at Marnie\u2019s recently, and there was quite a scene. This man hasn\u2019t been dead for long. There\u2019s no rigor, and his body was still warm when we tried to revive him. I think the TOD will clear you, but we have to go through the motions first. And you\u2019re right, the SIM card is missing. There are also some signs of struggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI punched him before his death,\u201d Slade admitted. \u201cThat should account for the bruising on his face.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded, jotting a few notes. \u201cThanks, but there\u2019s more. Quite frankly, his skin isn\u2019t the right color for a hanging. I don\u2019t believe for a second this man died of asphyxiation. This room has an eight foot ceiling, not high enough for the long fall necessary to break someone\u2019s neck.</p><p>Yet it appears that\u2019s what happened. It takes more force than you would guess to kill a man that way. None of this adds up.\u201d</p> <p>Dex looked around the room. The belt that had been used in the hanging still swung from the ceiling. \u201cHow did he get up there? Did you move a chair? A table?\u201d Mike wiped a hand across his face and looked like he would really rather be fishing. \u201cThat would be question number three. Nothing has been moved except the body, and that was only moved in an attempt to revive him. Ben took him down and tried CPR, but he was gone.\u201d Slade came to several conclusions, none of them pleasant. Preston hadn\u2019t been the tallest man, maybe five foot nine inches. The ceiling was at most eight feet. He would have needed something to lift him to the right height. \u201cSo unless he jumped, then someone helped him up there. That means someone killed Preston because he knew something or did something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything going on at Black Oak that I should know about?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cAny takeover attempts? Corporate espionage?\u201d</p><p>Corporate politics could be nasty, but Black Oak Oil was solid. They weren\u2019t developing anything another company would want. They were in the business of finding oil and refining it.</p><p>Slade had a bad feeling that this wasn\u2019t about Black Oak Oil at all. This was about Hannah.</p><p>Everything had been about her, he suspected, like the virus being uploaded to the site. Someone had followed his obsession over three thousand miles. That was sick dedication.</p> <p>Someone had watched Hannah much more closely than they\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the techs, Scott and Lyle?\u201d Slade asked, his voice hoarse.</p><p>He ran through the series of events and came to one conclusion: The murderer\u2014and Hannah\u2019s stalker\u2014had to be one of them. Lyle had been in the office when Dex had carried Hannah out. Scott had planned an \u201cimportant\u201d lunch with her that very day. Gossip being what it was, either could have easily found out where he and his brothers had taken her. Either could have uploaded the virus.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, they\u2019re at the lodge. I was going to head over there and talk to them as soon as we wrapped everything up here. They can\u2019t go anywhere until tomorrow. The only way out is by plane, and Jimmy is passed out, according to Marnie,\u201d Mike explained.</p><p>Whichever tech was the guilty party, he wouldn\u2019t want to leave. He would still want Hannah\u2014quickly\u2014before anyone had time to figure out that Preston had been murdered and who\u2019d been the culprit. Reaching Hannah meant traveling to the house. Anyone with access to a car could do that.</p><p>His blood running cold, Slade punched in Gavin\u2019s number. He would tell his older brother to take Hannah into the mountains. Gavin knew that terrain in a way Scott and Lyle wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Hunting cabins dotted the mountainside. Anyone who wasn\u2019t familiar with the area would need a map to find them. She would be safe. Gavin would shoot anyone who came her way.</p><p>But damn it, the call wasn\u2019t connecting. Poor signal all of a sudden. His phone was useless.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get a signal.\u201d Panic threatened to overtake him. He picked up the nearest landline and dialed the house.</p><p>After ten rings, he gave up. Dex stared at him as though willing Slade to give him good news.</p><p>Slade wished he could lie. \u201cHe isn\u2019t answering.\u201d</p><p>Dex swore. \u201cI\u2019m not wasting time. I\u2019m going after her.\u201d</p><p>Slade agreed. \u201cSheriff, we\u2019re going to need to borrow a car.\u201d</p><p>Hannah left the bathroom feeling a bit more relaxed. She\u2019d showered and finally taken that darn plug out. She\u2019d likely get in trouble for removing it, but she seriously doubted that Dex or Slade had intended that she wear it all day.</p> <p>Besides, she wouldn\u2019t really mind the spanking she would get. In fact, she might actually like it.</p><p>Hannah Craig liked spankings. Bye bye, good girl.</p><p>But maybe enjoying a good spanking didn\u2019t make her a bad girl. Maybe it just made her honest with herself. She\u2019d spent so much of her life trying to be what everyone around her expected that she\u2019d forgotten to just be her.</p><p>As hard as she might try, Hannah couldn\u2019t see anything really wrong with loving three men.</p><p>They weren\u2019t hurting anyone. Why did there have to be a boundary on love?</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to close the curtains as she walked into the bedroom suite. Someone had left them wide open, and the big bay windows offered an amazing view of the mountains. Alaska was stunning. It was such a change from the big city and encroaching summer heat of Texas.</p><p>Everything seemed lush and vibrant in air so fresh and crisp that it was a joy to breathe.</p><p>She felt truly alive for the first time in her life. Being in Alaska helped that feeling, but it was more about her men. Was she really going to let that feeling go because she was mad at Gavin?</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d said some ugly things. But the Lord above knew that she\u2019d said some things in the past that she\u2019d regretted. She didn\u2019t think Gavin would hurt her again. And if he did, Dex and Slade would kick him back in line.</p><p>The sun streamed through the windows, and Hannah opened the French doors that led to the patio with a smile. She was only dressed in her robe, but there wasn\u2019t anyone around to see her.</p><p>It was nice to be alone for a minute. If those boys had their way, it wouldn\u2019t last for long.</p><p>She breathed in the slightly chilly air and thought seriously about dropping the robe to feel the breeze on her skin. If she did, the brothers would find her that way, lounging naked on the patio, reveling in her newfound sensuality. Dex would be the first to attack her, and Slade would follow, their hands, lips, and tongues roaming her body feverishly.</p><p>She would look up, and Gavin would be watching, waiting to see if she would let him in.</p><p>Making love with him would be a nice way to let him know she was willing to talk. Well, maybe not to talk, but she was willing to try. She couldn\u2019t let her fear rule her. If Gavin walked out again, then she would deal with it. That was a risk every woman took.</p><p>Her hand grasped the tie of her robe. She was just about to let it drop when she heard a voice.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d</p><p>She looked up\u2014and realized that she wasn\u2019t so safe here after all.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cScott?\u201d Hannah blinked, unable to believe he\u2019d come here and found his way to the patio beside her bedroom. Why would he do that? He\u2019d been desperately trying to see her the day the James Gang had dragged her off to Alaska. She could only think of one reason he\u2019d come now.</p><p>He was her stalker.</p><p>Hannah took a step back, panic flooding her system. She was brutally aware that she was alone. The quiet of the afternoon, once so peaceful, now felt ominous. She glanced over her shoulder, past her bedroom, to the empty hallway. Where was Gavin?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I found you.\u201d Scott sighed. \u201cI feel like I walked miles to get to you. But I couldn\u2019t stop. I had to see you. Hannah, I need to talk to you.\u201d Scott\u2019s face was bunched up, some unnamed emotion animating him. He looked young and slightly vulnerable standing there with the early evening light lighting up his pale hair like a halo. But it was all an illusion.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to talk to me, you should have given me a call.\u201d Of course, it wasn\u2019t as if she and Scott were best friends. A phone call would have been suspicious. If he had, that likely would have tipped her off. Or if she hadn\u2019t grasped his guilt right away, one of her hovering men would have.</p><p>She wished those men were here now. Slade and Dex were back in River Run investigating Preston\u2019s suicide. Or had his death been suicide at all? Hannah nibbled nervously on her bottom lip as all kinds of possibilities rolled over her. Had Scott killed Preston? How far was he willing to go to take her?</p><p>Would Gavin be able to hear her if she screamed?</p><p>\u201cI tried to call. I can\u2019t get cell service.\u201d Scott\u2019s gaze bounced all over, clearly skittish. \u201cI think he\u2019s blocking it. There are several ways to block local signals. He\u2019s way smarter and more devious than I gave him credit for.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked back to the French doors. Could she make it through them and into her bedroom before he caught her?</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been so damn stubborn, she would have been with Gavin, talking through their problems.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Townsend? I tried the front door, but no one answered. I really need to talk to him, or Mr. James. Hannah there\u2019s something you need to know.\u201d Hannah stopped and let his words sink in. \u201cYou tried the front door?\u201d Scott nodded. \u201cYeah. I knocked. I didn\u2019t, like, open it or anything. This is a rich folks\u2019 place.</p><p>You never know, they might release the hounds or something. I thought maybe everyone had come out back, but...Hannah, someone\u2019s after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the fear from her voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap. You think it\u2019s me.\u201d Scott shook his head and held his hands up, showing her he\u2019d come unarmed.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re here, not in Dallas where you\u2019re supposed to be. The whole reason Slade, Dex, and Gavin brought me up here was to escape this stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense. I was on my way to your office to pick you up for an early lunch so I could warn you when I saw your...exit. But he saw it, too. An hour later, a virus had crashed the River Run facility. So I volunteered for this assignment, hoping I\u2019d get a chance to see you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho saw my exit? Who are you trying to warn me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyle.\u201d</p><p>The truth washed over her. Lyle Franklin. She\u2019d met him her first day on the job. He\u2019d brought her laptop and helped her set it up. He was the head of the help desk, but he\u2019d found time to help a new girl out. He\u2019d been patient with her. She\u2019d heard rumors that he was difficult to work with, but brilliant when it came to systems upkeep and repair. She\u2019d never found him difficult. Anytime she\u2019d had trouble and called the help desk, he\u2019d come personally.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d thought he\u2019d taken care of her because she was the boss\u2019s admin. There wasn\u2019t an employee at Black Oak who didn\u2019t want Gavin James to owe him or her a favor. She\u2019d had lunch with Lyle on a couple of occasions in large groups, but turned him down for dinner because it had seemed too much like a date, and she hadn\u2019t wanted to lead him on. She\u2019d never felt anything beyond vague friendship for the lanky, self-conscious man.</p><p>How much had he hidden from her?</p><p>\u201cI think I should go and find Gavin.\u201d Hannah knew she needed to be cautious. She wasn\u2019t about to fully trust anyone except her men. She would go and get Gavin, and they could talk to Scott together.</p><p>Unless Scott was lying to gain her trust. Then he wouldn\u2019t let her move an inch off this patio.</p><p>She backed toward the French doors, easing closer to them. She would lock them behind her and find Gavin. They could get the sheriff, who could sort out everything in a nice, safe interrogation room where all the employees had guns and the right to shoot people.</p><p>That sounded like a plan.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, Hannah.\u201d Scott\u2019s voice had taken on a soothing quality. He sat down at the patio table, carefully placing his hands on top. \u201cPlease tell Mr. James not to shoot me on sight. I get that you have to be cautious. I do. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d Hannah still didn\u2019t turn her back on him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Hannah, if your computer\u2019s on, turn it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She\u2019d turned it on earlier in the day hoping to check her e-mail. It was still sitting open on the desk in her suite. She almost always left it up and ready to use.</p><p>\u201cYou have a webcam on that computer, Hannah. He\u2019s been watching you through it for months. It\u2019s how I figured out his scheme. Preston made us share a conference room back in Dallas for one of those installation task forces on Monday. Lyle left to go do something, and I was looking for a missing file. Instead, I saw videos of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Scott flushed a bit. \u201cYes. He has a ton of videos of you. He\u2019s been watching you day and night. Some are just long videos of you lying around in your undies reading a book or talking on the phone. It looks like you\u2019re in the bedroom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That bastard. He\u2019d set up her computer. Lyle knew how computer illiterate she was. He\u2019d told her she didn\u2019t need to know more, that he knew enough about computers for both of them.</p><p>They had laughed about it at the time.</p><p>All along he\u2019d been watching her, stalking her.</p><p>He\u2019d been the one sending her threatening notes. He\u2019d tried to kill her cat.</p> <p>His expression earnest, Scott went on. \u201cWhen that virus hit the site\u2019s computer, I knew someone with access and knowhow had uploaded it. Lyle fits the bill.\u201d Everything Scott said made perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go get Gavin. Don\u2019t go anywhere. I believe you, Scott. Thank you.\u201d She was just about to turn when a bang cracked the air around her. Scott grunted, and his face became strangely blank. Red bloomed across his shirt.</p><p>Blood. He\u2019d been shot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, Hannah.\u201d Lyle stepped from behind the house and pointed the gun at her.</p><p>Scott slumped forward, his head hitting the table with a nasty thud. Bile crawled up her throat.</p> <p>Lyle Franklin stood roughly five feet seven inches tall. His hair was cut far too short for his round features. His eyes were too close together, giving him a slightly seedy look. His body was awkwardly thin, as though he\u2019d never outgrown his teenage years and would never have the body of a man. But Hannah didn\u2019t doubt for a second that he could overpower her. His arms looked scrawny compared to her men\u2019s, but Lyle had already proven he had plenty of nerve and few qualms.</p><p>\u201cY-you killed him.\u201d Hannah couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d shot Scott right in front of her. How could he be lying there dead? She\u2019d just been talking to him moments ago. Scott couldn\u2019t be much older than her. He should have had a whole lifetime to look forward to, but now, because he\u2019d tried to help her, he\u2019d taken his last breath.</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to keep us apart, dear. I can\u2019t allow that. How can I call myself your man if I let other men come between us?\u201d Lyle lowered his arm, letting the gun rest at his side. But Hannah didn\u2019t doubt that he could have her in his sights in an instant.</p><p>She had to be careful. \u201cDid you kill Preston, too?\u201d</p><p>His small eyes softened, and he smiled as though inordinately proud. \u201cI did it for you. I heard what he did to you, trying to force you to kiss him. I couldn\u2019t let him live after that. If I\u2019d been there, I would have protected you, Hannah. That\u2019s what I do. I protect you.\u201d By trying to kill her cat? By terrorizing her? She could try to reason with him, but she doubted negotiating with a lunatic would work. He was either here to rape or kill her\u2014or both.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve been watching over you for a while now. I knew the moment I saw you that we were meant to be together. You felt it, too. Don\u2019t try to deny it. I saw the way you looked at me that day.\u201d</p> <p>She barely remembered that day. Hannah wanted to scream, but the trail of mayhem and murder was too long to risk making him angry. Heck, the proof of his evil was still warm and slumped over the patio table. She took a tentative step back.</p><p>Lyle\u2019s face hardened like he was about to explode in a tantrum. Unfortunately, his tantrum included a gun. \u201cDon\u2019t run, dear. I\u2019m done playing games with you. If you run, I\u2019ll chase you down. I want our first time together to be special.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. She needed time. Her men would come for her. Sooner or later, Gavin would come looking for her. Slade and Dex would figure out her stalker\u2019s identity, and they would try to find her.</p><p>And Lyle would shoot them.</p><p>The thought of Gavin\u2019s big body slumped over, never to rise again, made her nauseous. Why hadn\u2019t she told him she loved him?</p><p>She loved all three of them, and she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to let this deranged creep kill them.</p><p>Hannah looked around, seeking any sort of weapon she could use against him. Then she noticed Scott\u2019s body jerk slightly. His chest still moved up and down with shallow breaths.</p><p>Thank you, God! He was still alive.</p> <p>Lyle sighed and moved toward the man at the table. \u201cMotherfucker. He\u2019s tougher than I gave him credit for.\u201d</p><p>Lyle lifted the gun.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Hannah yelled. She couldn\u2019t stand there and watch him kill Scott.</p><p>Lyle\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou want to save him, Hannah? He wants to split us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he just wanted to talk to me. You know, we were supposed to have a meeting yesterday to talk about how the CEO can work better with his teams. It was just business.\u201d God, she hoped he hadn\u2019t heard much of their conversation.</p><p>His face turned vicious, and he gripped the gun more tightly. \u201cYou like your co-workers too much, Hannah. Didn\u2019t I tell you to stay away from those perverted brothers?\u201d Scott\u2019s previous words buzzed in her head. Lyle had watched her through the webcam. She\u2019d had her computer open the night before. He might well have seen her give her virginity to Dex, then turn around and fully embrace Slade while Dex felt his way up her body and whispered hot encouragement.</p><p>\u201cWe should discuss this Lyle.\u201d If she could keep him talking, he\u2019d be too busy to shoot people.</p><p>\u201cThe time to talk is over. I loved you, Hannah. I protected you. I was your angel.\u201d He heaved an angry sigh. \u201cBut you\u2019re just like the rest\u2014a whore willing to spread her legs for rich men.</p><p>Tell me something, Hannah. How could you let those perverts degrade you? Spank you and shove that...thing up your ass? I would have treated you like a princess. I wouldn\u2019t have let anyone else touch you. But they passed you around like a toy. How do you like being someone\u2019s live blow-up doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d She tried to keep her voice calm. Scott\u2019s hand twitched. Still alive. How was she going to get him out of this before he bled to death?</p><p>He sneered. \u201cI watched it. I heard it. It was disgusting. You let them turn you into a whore.\u201d Then his face fell, and he looked close to spilling furious tears. \u201cI just...tried to love you.\u201d Arguing with the crazy man holding a gun seemed very dangerous. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to save you. I knew what they were like.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou tried to tell me. I didn\u2019t understand. But I do now. I\u2019m listening to every word.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his black eyes narrowing. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it like this. I\u2019d rather love you gently. But you don\u2019t like it that way, do you, Hannah? You\u2019re a little slut. I\u2019m going to have to prove I\u2019m more of a man than the three of them put together, aren\u2019t I?\u201d She didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cThey won\u2019t let you take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re investigating Preston Ward\u2019s death. They won\u2019t be around for hours. I was surprised they left you here with the boss. I would have assumed they would protect their little slut, but maybe they\u2019re done with you.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Gavin make love to her in the parlor. Lyle had no idea that Gavin would protect her. If she could just find a way to stall him and get help...</p><p>The cameras. During their brief tour of the estate yesterday, Slade had shown her the security cameras that dotted the estate. She let her eyes roam carefully as he continued on his diatribe.</p><p>She was a whore, a slut, a bitch. That gun scared the hell out of her, and she couldn\u2019t stop trembling, but his words didn\u2019t touch her. She was loved. She was their woman, and anything she did with them was beautiful. Lyle was the perverse one.</p><p>There it was. A small, white camera pointed directly at her. It wasn\u2019t moving, but the red light was on. It was working. Of course, none of it mattered if Gavin wasn\u2019t watching. Even if he was, she feared that all he would see from that angle was her standing alone in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cBitch, are you listening to me? Maybe I need to put another bullet in Scotty-boy to get your attention.\u201d Lyle put the gun to the back of Scott\u2019s head, and Hannah saw Scott tense. He wasn\u2019t as far gone as she\u2019d feared. Scott had a chance to survive, but only if Hannah played her cards right.</p><p>And she really only had one card left.</p><p>\u201cI heard you, Lyle. I just didn\u2019t understand everything. You didn\u2019t show yourself before.</p><p>How was I supposed to know it was you? It could have been anyone.\u201d The gun eased back, and he looked thoughtful. \u201cI thought you would realize it was me. It was obvious.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot to me.\u201d Not to anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying, little whore. Why should I believe you?\u201d A nasty grin came across his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Hannah. I\u2019ll let Scotty here live if you get in my car. We\u2019re going to go away, you and me. I\u2019ll show you a real man.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she couldn\u2019t get in that car. No way. No how. But if she got him away from Scott, she could run.</p><p>\u201cA-all right.\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy, dear. First, I want a taste of what you\u2019ve been giving the bigwigs. Take off the robe. Since you\u2019re a slut, you can ride without clothes. You didn\u2019t want to be my pure love?</p><p>You can be my sex slave. I can beat you just like they did. I\u2019ll show you what kind of man I am.\u201d Hiding her shudder, Hannah feared she already knew. He was a hateful misogynist who was so damaged, he would never heal. She wasn\u2019t sure what had warped Lyle\u2019s soul, and she didn\u2019t care. She only cared that he didn\u2019t kill anyone else.</p><p>Trembling, she let her hand find the tie on her robe. She\u2019d wanted to be naked in the sunlight.</p><p>She wanted to wait for her men to find her and love her.</p><p>Now she could only hope that they would save her.</p><p>Gavin found just what he needed in the kitchen. Chamomile tea. Hannah\u2019d had a rough day.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to back off, give her time and space. But leaving things unresolved between them was eating at him. He had to see her. So after a few minutes that had felt like months, he\u2019d made her a nice cup of the steaming brew. It would give him an excuse to walk into her room. He\u2019d listened in earlier and heard the shower running.</p><p>Trying to maim a man with shot glasses was dirty business. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Hannah was trying to unwind.</p><p>Maybe if he talked smoothly enough, he could coax her into resting her head on his shoulder.</p><p>It would be an easy move to put an arm around her and hold her. That was all he wanted.</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>His inner voice was back, but there was a marked change in it. Gavin found a saucer for the teacup as his new inner voice spoke to him.</p><p>You want to ease her back and kiss her. You want to show her you can be as tender as you were rough earlier. You want to prove you can be everything she needs. You can love her and protect her. You can change for her.</p><p>It isn\u2019t really change. It\u2019s getting back to who you are.</p><p>Gavin liked his new inner voice. He was surprised to find it sounded an awful lot like his Hannah.</p><p>He picked up the cup and started down the hall. He wasn\u2019t going to make love to Hannah right now, no matter how much he wanted to. He was going to hold her. The next time he made love to her, his brothers would be there. They would be a team, the way they were meant to be.</p><p>There was a distant ping, a sharp, familiar sound. Gavin had spent enough time in Alaska to know the sound of a gun firing. Hunters? They sounded awfully close to the house to be shooting big game.</p><p>There was a small room just off the kitchen that served as the housekeeper\u2019s office. It housed a computer and all the keys to the various buildings. Everything electrical in the house could be monitored from the office, including the security cameras.</p><p>Gavin let the teacup clatter to the desk as he flicked through the cameras. They had various views of the grounds. Nothing, nothing... His heart nearly stopped when he came to the feed for camera number four. Hannah stood on the patio outside the master bedroom. She wore a robe and faced the camera. Her hand was on the belt, and she slowly unknotted it.</p><p>A memory of Nikki assaulted his brain. She would fight him like a mad cat. Then she would tease him.</p><p>Just like Hannah was teasing him now.</p><p>Her hands fumbled as she released the tie. Slowly, very slowly, she brought her hands up to the lapels of the robe. He couldn\u2019t see her face clearly, but she seemed to be playing for the camera.</p><p>She took off her robe slowly, almost stiffly. To tease him even more? Her breasts came into view, nipples hard and pointed in the cool air. She looked beautiful...but then he noticed her tense expression, the terror in her eyes.</p><p>Gavin understood instantly. Hannah was nothing like Nikki. She hadn\u2019t invented a reason to fight merely for the drama. If she wanted to make up, she would tell him so straight to his face.</p><p>Hannah wasn\u2019t teasing him on camera; she was being forced.</p><p>The CB radio squawked, the sound jarring in the quiet room.</p><p>\u201cGavin. Gavin, this is Dex. Can you hear me? Please, God, hear me.\u201d He picked up the radio, but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off the monitor. Who was just outside the camera\u2019s view? He prayed it was one of his brothers playing around with their soon-to-be wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDex, are you and Slade here on the grounds?\u201d Please say yes. Make this all a fun, little joke.</p><p>I\u2019ll run out there and play with Hannah, too.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re in one of the sheriff\u2019s cruisers,\u201d Dex shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re almost home, but you need to keep an eye on Hannah. Preston was murdered, and one of the techs is Hannah\u2019s stalker. I think it\u2019s Lyle. Slade noticed that he had scratches all over his arms. I have similar scratches from rescuing Mr. Snuggles. Is Hannah with you now?\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest. \u201cNo, but I think someone else might be. Hurry.\u201d</p> <p>He tossed the radio down. He didn\u2019t have time to explain. He needed to get to Hannah.</p><p>After pulling out the key that opened the small gun cabinet, he yanked out a shotgun and quickly loaded it. He wasn\u2019t going to fail her.</p><p>Gavin ran down the hall and out of the house.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Gavin took a deep breath. The gun in his hand felt like an old friend. He silently thanked Marnie for teaching him how to use it years ago. She\u2019d taken him and Slade hunting every summer when they were supposed to be learning accounting and how to work a rig. They\u2019d learned those things, all right\u2014but so much more. Most importantly, they had learned that they were brothers and could depend on one another, no matter what. Every time their father had tried to turn them into rivals, Gavin would remember bonding with Slade during those summers, teaching him the true importance of family for the first time. When Dex had come along, he\u2019d become another brother to depend on, even if Gavin hadn\u2019t always shown it.</p> <p>Now, he wanted his family to be one close-knit unit, sharing Hannah and her love.</p><p>As soon as he took out whoever threatened her.</p><p>He flattened his body against the brick and listened, trying to figure out the bastard\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful body, Hannah. Let the robe drop so I can see more than just your breasts. I want to know if that blonde hair of yours is real. I know how whores change their appearance to entice men.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was going to kill that fucker. Gavin didn\u2019t care how or why this man had gotten so screwed up. No one was going to talk to Hannah that way.</p><p>Gavin peeked around the corner. Even from the back, he recognized Lyle from his severely short hair and his clothes. Goddamn the bastard.</p> <p>Hannah stood with sunlight bathing her, clutching her robe around her waist, her green eyes flared with fear. She looked so young and vulnerable. So alone. She was his to protect. He couldn\u2019t let her down. He would rather die with her than live knowing he\u2019d failed her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have some trouble figuring that out, but I\u2019ll tell you that I don\u2019t bleach my hair.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s sweet twang flowed over him. No panic in his girl. Her steady voice was music to his ears.</p><p>Gavin was a possessive man. He could share with his brothers, but anyone else was out of the question. Yet, he found himself willing Hannah to do whatever necessary to stay alive. No matter what, he would love her. And, in time, his unwavering love\u2014and that of his brothers\u2014would heal her.</p><p>Gavin edged around the corner and checked everyone\u2019s position. Hannah stood in the background. Lyle, the fucker, was roughly ten feet in front of her, with his back to Gavin.</p><p>Another person sat at the table, head down on the wrought iron.</p><p>The other tech, Scott? He wasn\u2019t moving. Blood dripped slowly onto the stone patio. Maybe Lyle shooting Scott had been the noise Gavin had heard. If Lyle had already killed someone, then Gavin could fire at will\u2014if he could just get Hannah out of his direct line of fire. As it was, if Gavin shot at Lyle and missed, Hannah would suffer.</p><p>With a brief nod, he caught Hannah\u2019s gaze. Her bright green eyes widened. He willed her to do whatever she had to.</p> <p>I love you, Hannah. He mouthed the words.</p><p>With a gaze that told him she understood his reassurance, Hannah dropped the robe, fully displaying her beautiful body. Then she jumped out of his line of fire.</p><p>It had the intended effect. Lyle cursed savagely and charged her, intent on attack. That left Gavin free to act.</p><p>Sucking in a calming breath, he stepped out from behind the house, aimed, and fired.</p><p>After a quick pull of the trigger, Lyle\u2019s body jerked. Then blood began soaking his shirt at the right shoulder. Hannah screamed and ran toward Gavin. But Lyle wouldn\u2019t let her go that easily. He lunged for her, catching her ankle in a death grip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with me, whore,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s heart lodged in his throat.</p><p>\u201cLet her go and you might live,\u201d he growled at Lyle, circling in front of the asshole and closing in.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine. If I go down, I\u2019ll take her with me.\u201d Lyle raised his gun with his free hand. A ghastly smile contorted on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not, motherfucker.\u201d Gavin didn\u2019t hesitate. He raised the shotgun and fired again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>Finally, Lyle\u2019s grip loosened. Hannah broke free and ran for him. Gavin caught her in his arms just as he heard his brothers shouting from the driveway.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s arms twisted around him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I should have told you sooner, Gavin. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His heart swelled as he kept the gun trained on Lyle, just in case. \u201cBaby, I love you, too. So much.\u201d</p><p>His brothers raced onto the patio. Dex kicked Lyle\u2019s gun away, then bent down, fingers on the tech\u2019s carotid. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>Gavin thought that perhaps he should feel bad that he\u2019d taken a life, but all he felt now was profound relief. Peace and rightness followed when his brothers surrounded them. Their arms encircled Hannah.</p><p>Their woman was safe, and his family was finally complete.</p><p>Hours later, Hannah walked into the house, her hands still trembling. She could still see Lyle\u2019s desperate face, feel the bite of his grip as he clutched her ankle, trying to drag her down with him. So much pain and anger had flared in his eyes just before Gavin had delivered the fatal blow. She\u2019d never forget the rage bubbling in his expression just before he\u2019d fallen back, dead.</p><p>Hours later, she was still shaking.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d Slade inquired softly as he entered the room. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like to know, Scott made it to Anchorage. He\u2019s in surgery now, but the doctors said he\u2019s going to be fine. The bullet missed his lungs. If Lyle had shot him again...\u201d</p><p>Lyle would have killed him, like he would have killed her in the end. Like he could have killed them all.</p><p>Slade\u2019s arms wrapped around her, pulling her into the comfort of his chest. \u201cBaby, you can cry. Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>She allowed Slade to wrap her in his protective embrace. \u201cI was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We all were. But you were magnificent, Hannah. You didn\u2019t panic. You held your ground and bought Gavin time to bring Lyle down .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear my life flashed before me when I saw you on that security monitor.\u201d Gavin stood in the doorway.</p><p>She sobbed, and it felt good to cry. She\u2019d forced herself to be strong while they\u2019d taken care of Scott and waited for an ambulance. She\u2019d held it together at the sheriff\u2019s office as she had given her statement. Now, she wanted the comfort of their arms around her, but only Slade seemed willing to come near her. She didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I was doing something I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d Hannah asked. When she\u2019d stood in front of the camera, she\u2019d known that Gavin would only be able to see her. What had he thought she was doing?</p><p>His flush told her all she needed to know. \u201cFor a moment, I thought you were teasing me, like Nikki used to.\u201d</p><p>Dex turned on his brother, his face going mulish and stubborn. \u201cAsshole, she\u2019s nothing like Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I figured out quickly that something was wrong.\u201d But Gavin still hadn\u2019t held her since that moment when she\u2019d run into his arms. After that, he\u2019d picked up her robe and covered her, his touch almost impersonal. He\u2019d found her skirt and blouse, but he hadn\u2019t offered to dress her. Nor had Dex. They were both so polite and distant.</p><p>She needed to feel alive\u2014and loved. But Dex merely leaned back against the wall, watching her, his eyes hooded with anxiety. Gavin held back, his face concerned, but he made no move toward her.</p><p>Slade smoothed back her hair and tilted her chin up to him. \u201cI see that you need something, baby. Tell me what.\u201d</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cAll of you. Together with me.\u201d</p><p>She needed to lose herself in the pleasure they gave. She needed them surrounding her.</p><p>\u201cHannah, you\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d Gavin said one thing, but his eyes said another. They were eating her up, and her sex clenched at his hungry expression. So why wasn\u2019t he moving toward her?</p><p>\u201cYou should rest,\u201d Dex insisted softly, but he refused to look at her. \u201cI can sleep in one of the other bedrooms. You need your rest tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the same,\u201d Gavin offered, the desire on his face dissipating. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another room for Slade. I\u2019ll have it made up, too.\u201d</p><p>Slade\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cI\u2019m staying with Hannah.\u201d He was the only one? The others didn\u2019t want her anymore? Her first instinct was to cry, but anger rose faster.</p><p>Before she could confront them, Slade stepped in. \u201cYou\u2019d better explain yourselves, brothers.</p><p>Or she might start throwing things again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Hannah couldn\u2019t believe they were done with her. But if Dex and Gavin didn\u2019t want her, then she would take Slade and pour all her love into him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine on our own. They can sleep wherever they want. But they should go now because I\u2019m going to kiss you, Slade James. I want you.\u201d</p><p>A long, slow smile crossed his ridiculously handsome face. \u201cI want you, too, baby. You wanna play?\u201d</p><p>That sounded wonderful and mind-consuming. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to play now?\u201d Dex stared at her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the lady. Find your position, Hannah,\u201d Slade murmured. \u201cAnd stop topping from the bottom.\u201d</p><p>Hannah fell to her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>A low chuckle rumbled from Slade\u2019s chest as he touched her head. \u201cIt means you\u2019re trying to manipulate me to get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shrugged. She wasn\u2019t going to stop doing that. Slade would have to get used to that bottom topping thing.</p><p>\u201cIt makes you a bratty little sub,\u201d Dex said, his voice taking on the low growl that made Hannah\u2019s heart race. When he finally looked her way, his stare was hot and dark with the threat of sin.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed to give her time,\u201d Gavin said. But he was pushing away from the wall, closer, stalking her.</p><p>\u201cTime to what?\u201d Hannah shivered as they closed in.</p><p>They all could have died today. She didn\u2019t want to waste time. She just wanted to feel them.</p><p>Slade\u2019s hand tangled in her hair. The little bite of pain made her moan. \u201cAre we playing?\u201d Hannah knew where he was going with this. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen obey me. Your Masters need to talk. No interrupting.\u201d He smiled. \u201cListen for a bit.</p><p>You might learn something.\u201d</p><p>Maybe...but she\u2019d probably have trouble keeping quiet. Even so, Hannah was done questioning whether she was capable of this relationship or good enough for them. She was exactly what these three men needed.</p><p>And she needed them. She needed the deep understanding and soul connection she\u2019d found with Slade. She craved Dex\u2019s crazy alpha male dominance. And she wanted Gavin\u2019s duality. He was all smooth operator on the surface, but underneath he needed her more than the other two.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been through a terrible ordeal. She\u2019s got to be traumatized. Do you really think she needs us to spank her and tie her up now?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>That was exactly what she needed, especially if they brought out that spreader thingee.</p><p>Hannah opened her mouth to tell them, but Slade\u2019s expression made her stop.</p><p>\u201cI think Hannah has stated what she needs. I believe playing rough with her would reassure her that we\u2019re here for her in whatever way she needs.\u201d Slade sounded very reasonable. He always understood her.</p><p>\u201cLyle made her undress. We don\u2019t really know what else he did to her. How will we know if something we do will bring it all back?\u201d Dex sounded tortured.</p><p>Hannah looked up at Slade, trying without words to make her needs plain.</p><p>Slade sighed. \u201cTell them. They won\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything awful to me. Gavin got to him before he\u2019d really laid a hand on me. I took off my robe because it bought me some time. I didn\u2019t like him looking at me, but even if he\u2019d raped me, I would still be yours. I\u2019d still need this. But you\u2019re hesitating. Should I be worried that you don\u2019t want me anymore? Maybe now that the danger is over and your protective instincts are down, you don\u2019t find me as appealing. If that\u2019s the case, then you should run along to your own beds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was very satisfied when Gavin\u2019s mouth dropped open and Dex\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s over-the-line bratty.\u201d Dex\u2019s body language changed. He popped his shoulders back and firmed his jaw. His demeanor went from hesitant to commanding in a heartbeat. \u201cI don\u2019t like that, Hannah. What do you call me when we\u2019re playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d She repressed a smile. Yes, she was probably going to top from the bottom a lot.</p><p>\u201cI prefer Master, baby,\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnd I have a few questions for you. Care to explain why you were alone outside the house when you had a stalker after you?\u201d Hannah bit her bottom lip. Put that way, it sounded a bit careless. \u201cI was getting some fresh air and enjoying the sunlight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat were Master Gavin\u2019s instructions?\u201d Dex barked.</p><p>Boy, when he decided to go into Dom mode, he went all the way.</p><p>\u201cHe told me to stay in the house. But I didn\u2019t really think about the patio not being a part of the house.\u201d She hadn\u2019t been thinking at all.</p><p>\u201cI like the way Master Gavin sounds, Hannah.\u201d Gavin looked down at her, hovering close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me that in the bedroom from now on. Let me hear it.\u201d Hannah knew he was still worried about being on the outside. \u201cYes, Master Gavin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you disobey a direct order given for your safety?\u201d Gavin growled.</p><p>She nodded, wincing. She might be in more trouble than she\u2019d imagined. She suspected that her backside was about to get very sore.</p><p>\u201cHannah, pick a safe word.\u201d Dex touched her head, his hand stroking her. She couldn\u2019t miss the way his cock strained against his jeans.</p><p>They were all so worried about her. Only Slade understood that she needed them full throttle and hard to handle. And she needed them now. She wanted everything the James Gang could dish out.</p><p>\u201cHow about elephant? I promise to use it if things get to too tough to take, but I want something from you, too, Dex.\u201d</p><p>His eyes warmed. \u201cI might be willing to grant you a favor, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChange your name.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, scowled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dex might be shocked, but his brothers were smiling.</p><p>\u201cWe tried to convince him to do it, sweetheart.\u201d Slade\u2019s hands were on the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHe refused because he said he didn\u2019t want the last name of the man who\u2019d abandoned him,\u201d Gavin explained.</p><p>Hannah looked up at Dex. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be my name, too. Unless you think I should keep mine. We could have a very modern marriage, keep everything separate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. There isn\u2019t going to be any of that, Hannah. You will take your husbands\u2019 name and that\u2019s that,\u201d Dex said with finality. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the lawyer tomorrow. We need to tell him to stop the mess Gavin started, too.\u201d</p><p>Slade knelt behind her and slid his hands under her shirt, slipping it off and exposing her to the chilly air and his brothers\u2019 heated gazes. He cupped her breasts, and she sighed in his arms.</p> <p>This was what she\u2019d needed. She felt safer now that they surrounded her.</p><p>Gavin watched the hands on her breasts. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll stop the distribution of stock, merely alter it. I\u2019m going to split the company four ways. I think our wife should have a say, too.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Hannah\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. Gavin, I was ready to sign whatever prenuptial agreement you wanted.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened. \u201cNo, Hannah. This is going to work, and this is going to be your company, too. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They were giving her a great gift, but it went far past the monetary value. They were giving her a family she could count on. \u201cI love you, all of you.\u201d Gavin got to one knee and kissed her soundly. \u201cI will never make you regret that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I might,\u201d Dex said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had all the concessions you\u2019re getting for the night. Now present that ass to your Masters for punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, pass me the clamps. I want to see these nipples decorated.\u201d Slade pinched at them, rolling Hannah\u2019s nipples between his thumbs and forefingers.</p><p>Hannah tried not to squirm. She watched Dex walk to the small closet and pull out a box.</p><p>Slade thumbed and twisted her nipples while Gavin tossed his shirt aside, exposing his wide, hard-muscled chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re hard enough yet.\u201d Gavin tweaked one of her nipples.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a little tongue play would get them where we need,\u201d Slade suggested.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same thing.\u201d Gavin bent his head and sucked a hard tip into his mouth.</p><p>As he drew her nipple into his hot mouth, the sensation shot straight from her breast to her pussy. Hannah gasped. Gavin sucked hard, his teeth just grazing the edge of her flesh, lighting her up. He bit down gently as his hand found her thigh.</p><p>Dex knelt beside Gavin, a small piece of jewelry in his hand. He held it up for her perusal.</p><p>\u201cThis is a clamp, Hannah. I\u2019ll clamp your nipples when you\u2019ve been a bad girl, or simply because I want to decorate my gorgeous girl\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>Hannah hissed a little as he pinched her free nipple, then clamped it. Gavin worked on her other nipple, sucking and laving it with affection. Then Dex clamped that one, too, before gently hauling Hannah to her feet. The clamps jangled, the weight of them making Hannah incredibly aware of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s just pretty,\u201d Gavin said with a sweetly lecherous smile.</p><p>Dex tugged carefully at one, grinning when Hannah shivered. \u201cSo sensitive. It\u2019s time to light up that lovely backside of yours. Bend over and put your hands on the table. I want that ass in the air. Do you need a gag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Will I?\u201d The question came out as a breathless little squeak.</p><p>\u201cI love hearing your cries, baby. It makes my cock weep, but Gavin is new to all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me decide what I can handle?\u201d Gavin shot back.</p><p>Slade\u2019s lips quirked in a sarcastic grin. \u201cWe could give him a safe word, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Slade. Hannah, your Master gave you an order. Why aren\u2019t you obeying?\u201d Gavin demanded, his voice all deep and dark.</p><p>Slade chuckled, and Hannah breathed a sigh of relief. She had her men exactly how she wanted them\u2014working together.</p><p>She walked to the table and placed her palms flat on the walnut table. She arched, raising her ass to them.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do,\u201d Slade said as he yanked on her skirt, tugging it down, then kicking it away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Do you have any idea how much I love you? Sometimes I think my life really began the day you walked into it.\u201d</p><p>Hannah twisted to gaze up at him. The warmth in his blue eyes made her heart well with emotion.</p><p>Slade\u2019s hand caressed down the line of her spine, then he dropped a kiss between her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to die when I realized how close that asshole had gotten to you.\u201d Dex chimed in, his big, rough hands caressing her hips. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if he\u2019d hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been bad, brother,\u201d Gavin said, his hand tangled in her hair. He moved closer, then whispered in her ear. \u201cYou did what I couldn\u2019t. You made us a family, sweetheart. I promise to love you for the rest of my life. I won\u2019t let you down again.\u201d He kissed her cheek\u2014and dropped a blindfold over her eyes.</p><p>Hannah barely had time to wallow in the sweetness of their devotion before it began. Smack.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to go easy, darlin\u2019,\u201d Dex intoned, his Texas accent more pronounced as he became aroused. \u201cYou owe us twenty-five for disobeying.\u201d</p><p>Smack. This one on her right cheek had to have come from Slade. Tears formed, hot and desperate, in her eyes. \u201cAnd another five for trying to top from the bottom.\u201d She didn\u2019t point out that she hadn\u2019t tried; she\u2019d done it. She had everything she wanted, including this spanking.</p><p>Smack. The hardest one yet, and it had landed right between her cheeks, heating up the crack of her ass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for throwing glassware at my head.\u201d Gavin hummed. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s pretty. It\u2019s so pink.\u201d</p><p>She felt someone pull her cheeks apart.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the plug, Hannah?\u201d Displeasure resonated in Dex\u2019s voice.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten about that. \u201cI took it out.\u201d</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d thrown it away.</p><p>All three men growled.</p><p>The smacks rained down, one after another. She heard them counting, but somewhere at ten they seemed to recede until all she felt was her body and its sensations. Tears squeezed from her eyes. Even that felt good. The pain released not only the fears and worries she\u2019d buried deep inside her, but it freed up some reserve and uncertainty that she\u2019d kept chained up. She was safe here. She could trust her men and discover herself.</p><p>Heat lit up the flesh of her ass. It only started out as sharp, stinging pain. Then...it morphed into a deep warmth, seeping beneath her skin. Every nerve in her body leapt to life, kindling need in her veins. Her breasts, weighed down by the clamps, brushed the cool wood of the table, setting off another wave of awareness. Everything inside her seemed awake and alive.</p><p>\u201cAdd another twenty for taking out the plug.\u201d Slade\u2019s demand brought Hannah out of her pleasant haze.</p><p>A hand smacked her already sore ass once more. God, how was she going to take another twenty? They were going to make her, and that fact sent pleasure hammering straight between her legs.</p><p>She gasped as big, male hands, Slade\u2019s she thought, pulled her cheeks apart and cold lube dribbled onto her rosette.</p><p>\u201cIs she ready?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>Hannah tensed, her stomach knotting. She knew what they were talking about. She was nervous but ready. Her first brush with real anal sex might be rough, but she wasn\u2019t about to shy away. She wanted to be filled with her men.</p><p>\u201cGod, she\u2019s going to be so tight.\u201d Dex\u2019s voice spoke as she felt a new plug begin to breach her ass. A familiar ache started. Jittery, jangled sensations sparked to life deep inside. \u201cThis is the medium plug, baby. You should know that I\u2019ll regularly plug you as a part of our play. If you take one out without permission, I\u2019ll just use a bigger one next time. We\u2019ll never run out of ways to fill you up.\u201d</p><p>She knew they would keep her full in more ways than sexually. They would fill her life, her heart, and one day, her womb. What had seemed so empty just days before now burst at the seams, giving her hope, anticipation for the future, and perfect contentment.</p><p>She breathed out and arched her back further. The plug slid home. She would never deny them what they needed.</p><p>\u201cVery good, baby.\u201d Dex walked around and lifted the blindfold. A warm smile creased his face, and his voice had softened. \u201cAre you trying to get out of the last count?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo. I want it. I want everything my Masters want to give me.\u201d He chuckled and kissed her forehead. \u201cMasters. We all know who\u2019s really in charge. Give it to her. I\u2019m dying to get to the part where we make her come.\u201d The slaps started again, Slade and Gavin seeming content to take turns. When the heat sank into her skin, they caressed her with a gentle but firm hand. One of them pressed and played with the plug while the other found her pussy. She whimpered at the feel of deft fingers teasing her folds and brushing her clit for a moment before retreating. Then the spanking began once more.</p><p>Over and over they repeated the process until Hannah was so aroused she thought she would scream.</p><p>Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, Gavin finished counting, then teased between her legs again. \u201cShe\u2019s very wet. I think our little sub liked her spanking.\u201d So much. Hannah was taut with hunger, her body nearly screaming in need. \u201cPlease.\u201d Dex bent to her. \u201cWhat did you say, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dex. I need you.\u201d</p><p>His lips split into a wide smile. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what she\u2019s saying, and you know it.\u201d Slade was the soft touch. Hannah felt fingers press against her clitoris. \u201cShe\u2019s desperate to come. Are we going to give our bratty little sub permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Dex insisted.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Slade.\u201d</p><p>A thunderous frown rolled across his face. \u201cNot until we get inside you. What are you supposed to call me?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he wasn\u2019t all that soft on her, after all.</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d Hannah sighed as Slade hauled her into his arms. She wrapped her arms around his neck as he carried her to the bedroom.</p><p>She looked over his shoulder. Dex and Gavin walked side by side. Both had shucked their clothes, and their gorgeous bodies were on full display, complete with impressive full-staff erections.</p><p>Slade set her on her feet and turned her face up to his. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this, sweetheart? We\u2019re going to be demanding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah\u2019s tender backside could attest to that. \u201cI can handle the three of you.\u201d He leaned over and brushed his mouth against hers, licking across her lips until Hannah allowed his tongue to slide against hers in a silky dance. As she kissed Slade, she felt another body at her back.</p><p>\u201cGive me a little of that, darlin\u2019.\u201d A rough hand turned her face to the right.</p><p>Dex kissed her long and slow while Slade toyed with her nipples and the jewels that dangled from them.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t forget me.\u201d Gavin pulled her his direction. He kissed her hard, his mouth dominating hers with commanding, seductive power.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, baby.\u201d Gavin released her. \u201cRide Slade.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked to the huge bed. Slade laid across the soft comforter, holding his big cock up, waiting for her to sheathe him.</p><p>\u201cGo on, darlin\u2019.\u201d Dex urged her forward, his hand smoothing across her tortured backside.</p><p>Hannah crawled up on the bed, careful to keep the plug in. She kissed her way up Slade\u2019s body from his feet to his strong thighs to his lean waist, all the way up to his lips. Slade. Her soul mate.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, too, darlin\u2019.\u201d Dex took his place at the head of the bed. His cock thrust toward her.</p><p>Hannah let him plunder her mouth once more. Dex. Her champion.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s strong hands cupped her hips. \u201cI\u2019m here, too. And I\u2019ll never leave you alone again.\u201d He planted soft kisses along the sensitive skin of her neck, making her shiver. Making her feel so adored. Gavin. Her savior.</p><p>Her men. It was past time to be with them all.</p><p>Slade had a condom in his hand. He rolled it on that big cock, stroking himself as he prepared to fill her. \u201cCome here, baby. Let me get inside you.\u201d</p><p>Dex held her hands, and Gavin moved her hips into place. She sighed as Slade\u2019s huge cock eased inside her pussy.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love the way you feel.\u201d Slade pushed up, deeper into her. \u201cShe\u2019s so tight with the plug.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Her pussy felt stretched and deliciously invaded.</p><p>Gavin groaned behind her as he gently pushed her forward. \u201cShe\u2019s going to get a lot tighter. I think Dex needs a little attention, too.\u201d</p><p>Dex was at the head of the bed on his knees, cock in hand, waiting for her. The bulbous head wept with a creamy drop of semen. Hannah sighed as she licked at it, then pulled the head into her mouth. Dex tasted masculine and salty and she reveled in it as Slade thrust up and impaled her on his cock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take the plug out, Hannah.\u201d Gavin\u2019s voice was a deep groan. \u201cDon\u2019t you lose Dex.\u201d</p><p>Hannah whimpered around Dex\u2019s cock as it filled her mouth, while Gavin slowly removed the plug from her ass. She felt its loss, but there was no time to bemoan it. Dex fed her his length inch by inch. Slade pumped softly up, finding a place deep inside her pussy that had her pleasure building to a crescendo.</p><p>More lube coated her anus. Fingers massaged here there. She\u2019d never imagined it could feel so good. Gavin rimmed her, preparing her to take something she knew was far bigger than the plugs they\u2019d used.</p><p>She tensed when she felt Gavin\u2019s cock at her tight entrance. It burned as he pressed against her tight, untried muscles, but she wasn\u2019t about to back down.</p><p>\u201cSteady, sweetheart. You\u2019re very, very tight.\u201d Gavin\u2019s hands felt like brands on her hips. He held her tightly as though he was afraid to let go.</p> <p>\u201cGod, that feels good.\u201d Slade\u2019s breath came in deep pants, his control obviously slipping.</p><p>\u201cArch a little, baby. Let Gavin slip deeper inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry. Her mouth is killing me.\u201d Dex pushed his way back in, filling her up.</p><p>Hannah felt like she might splinter into a thousand pieces as she followed Slade\u2019s order.</p><p>When she raised her ass, Gavin\u2019s cock tunneled deeper. More burning and stretching. She wasn\u2019t sure how much more she could take, but the delicious bite of pain tore at her composure. She moaned and clawed at Dex\u2019s thighs.</p><p>\u201cRelax, baby,\u201d Dex\u2019s voice soothed. His hands petted her hair, and he gentled his strokes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking gorgeous. You\u2019re more than enough woman for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our everything, Hannah,\u201d Slade added. \u201cRelax and let us take care of you. Take a deep breath and push out. Allow Gavin in so we can all love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Christ, let me in, Hannah. I\u2019m dying to be deep inside you. I\u2019ve never wanted anything as much as I want this sweet ass.\u201d Gavin pressed in, inexorably forcing her to take a bit more of his wide cock with every little stroke.</p><p>Slade pulled on the clamps, twisting her nipples. As she moaned, he reached around and spread her cheeks wider for Gavin. \u201cCome on, baby. Don\u2019t resist. Take all of him.\u201d Hannah whimpered in little cries of pleasure around Dex\u2019s cock as Gavin slid completely into her ass. The burn was there, but so was a crazy jangle of sensation, a fullness that stimulated a host of new nerve endings.</p><p>As he eased back, Slade pumped deep into her pussy. \u201cGod, that\u2019s tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gavin hissed. \u201cShe\u2019s taking every inch of my cock and it\u2019s so pretty. I\u2019m never going to leave you, baby. I\u2019m always going to want to be inside you like this.\u201d His words made the warmth inside her flash hot. As he shoved inside her again and praised her once more, Gavin pushed her closer to climax. As he slid back, Slade thrust up, nudging her cervix. She cried out in bliss. Inflamed, aroused, desperate, she pulled on Dex\u2019s cock, bringing him almost to the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck, guys, I\u2019m dying here.\u201d Dex\u2019s voice sounded strangled.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Slade said. He shoved his cock up again</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like a vise on my dick. This is too good. I won\u2019t last. Hannah, you come for you Masters.\u201d Gavin fucked her in long, luxurious strokes.</p><p>The others joined in. They were like a well-oiled machine. When Gavin pressed deep in her ass, Slade pulled out. When Slade fucked into her pussy, Gavin dragged his cock out, almost withdrawing. Every pleasure sensor in her body lit up. They exchanged panting breaths and devotion. Slade plied his tongue around her sensitive, clamped nipples. Gavin nibbled at her neck, his hot affection making her shiver all over.</p><p>\u201cFinish off,\u201d Slade told the others. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I can hold out. She feels so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close.\u201d Dex\u2019s hands tangled in her hair. \u201cRelax, baby. Just breathe deep and take me.\u201d He fucked into her mouth in deep strokes, his cock swelling against her tongue as the other two grew larger and more insistent inside her. Pleasure built fast and hard, tearing at her composure. With every stroke, they sent her farther into an abyss of need so deep, Hannah wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever leave. She didn\u2019t want to. Her body rode the wave of sensation they heaped on her. All she had to do was let go and feel.</p><p>She softened her throat. Dex surged into her mouth, and his body stiffened. He shouted, sounding desperate, dying. Then warm seed coated her tongue. Tangy, an unexpected salty shock. Then instinct took over, and she drank him down. All the while, Slade and Gavin plundered her mercilessly, their hands tightening on her like they never wanted to let her go.</p><p>When Dex withdrew from her mouth, she fell against Slade, reveling at the feel of his heart pounding against her. Almost immediately, he propped her up until her stare met his. Dex eased his hand onto her belly, forcing it between them.</p><p>\u201cThis is just what you need, baby.\u201d Dex\u2019s finger found her clit. \u201cRide it. Come for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Hannah,\u201d Gavin commanded. \u201cI\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I can\u2019t hold off any longer.\u201d Slade surged up, keeping his head up long enough to remove the clamps.</p><p>Blood rushed back to them in a hot surge of delicate pain as Dex circled her clit. The pleasure overload, coupled with the friction, catapulted Hannah into a blinding ecstasy she\u2019d never experienced. She gasped as the orgasm raced through her body. It started in her core, building, building, and then spread like a wild fire until it culminated in one huge explosion that engulfed her, ripping a scream from her throat.</p><p>As she took off flying, Slade and Gavin gave in to the need. Slade\u2019s cock pulsed inside her.</p><p>His gorgeous face contorted, his blue eyes fused to her like his world began and ended with her.</p><p>Gavin came in strong bursts, coating her ass with his essence, his hands clutching her like he\u2019d never let her go.</p><p>They fell together in a heap of warm, satisfied flesh. Her head rested on Slade\u2019s chest. She could hear the strong beat of his heart as he wound down. Gavin\u2019s body pressed her into Slade\u2019s, the weight a welcome warmth. Dex stretched out beside her, his face in line with her own. He looked satisfied and happy, as though a huge weight had been lifted.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Hannah,\u201d he said solemnly and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThe best thing we ever did was kidnap you and take you to our lair.\u201d Slade smiled.</p><p>She could feel their connection all the way down to her bones. Even when they were apart, she would be able to feel them.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you boys treat a captive,\u201d she said, snuggling down. She suspected she was in for a long night.</p><p>Gavin pressed her hot cheek to his. \u201cGet used to it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever letting our captive go.\u201d</p><p>That was fine with Hannah.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>One year later</p><p>With a fully-healed Mr. Snuggles purring around his ankles, Gavin took off his tie and tossed it aside. It felt so good to leave work today. His new Vice President of Operations had given him hell. She\u2019d been in place for almost nine months and had big plans for changing the way Black Oak Oil did business. She was very employee oriented. Already the woman had opened a day care on site, talked him into a better health insurance plan, and forced him to build better facilities at the Alaska site. She had a head for business and could argue all day long when she believed in something.</p><p>Of course, he always took it from her because she looked awfully good in a bikini.</p><p>\u201cHey, you took off early!\u201d Slade walked in from the pool. \u201cDex was just about to start up the grill. You want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m on vacation, after all. Does she know?\u201d Gavin stared outside where Hannah splashed in the pool, her blonde hair in a messy pile on the top of her head. Her baby bump wasn\u2019t showing yet, but in a few weeks, it would. Knowing he\u2019d soon see the evidence of their passion, of the life they\u2019d created, growing inside her turned him on.</p><p>Slade smiled. \u201cShe has no idea. She thinks she has a meeting with the head of technology tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Gavin shrugged out of his suit coat. Scott had proven not only a great manager, but a successful conspirator. \u201cEverything is in place. The plane is ready. Marnie knows we\u2019re coming. Have the contractors finished out the playroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just today. I sent you the pictures. I assure you we now have the perfect space to play with our wife for the next month. And Dex decided he\u2019s going to tie her up this time. He\u2019s going to march into the conference room and lasso her before we pick her up and take her out. You know she likes the cowboy thing.\u201d</p><p>Gavin threw back his head and laughed. His sweet Hannah had a vivid imagination. She had taken to play like a duck to water.</p><p>He looked forward to spending the month focused on nothing but her.</p><p>Hannah looked up, and he knew the moment she saw him. Her green eyes lit up. She rushed to the edge of the pool and raced up the steps. Dex turned from the grill and nodded his way.</p><p>Dex James. His brother. It was all legal now. He smiled.</p><p>Hannah walked toward him, her breasts barely encased in a yellow bikini top. She never wore that suit in public, but damn he liked to see it on her in private.</p><p>\u201cWatch out,\u201d Slade said, pressing a cold beer into his hand. \u201cShe\u2019s going to throw herself in your arms. If you don\u2019t want to get those clothes wet, I would run.\u201d She would just chase him down. His wife never let him get too far. Anytime the pressure got to him, she drew him back in with the sunshine of her smile. His world finally had a center, and he was content to orbit around her.</p><p>Hannah did just what Slade had promised. She threw herself into his arms, plastering her body to his.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Mr. James.\u201d She pressed a little kiss on his lips. \u201cI missed you.\u201d He missed her every minute he wasn\u2019t in her presence. \u201cMe too, love. Are you ready for your meeting tomorrow, Ms. VP?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, boss.\u201d Hannah loved her new responsibilities, and the employees adored her.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you\u2019re not late.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him and wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019m never late, Mr. James. Are you going to come swimming with me? The water\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019m already wet, I think I will.\u201d He slapped her ass playfully as she walked back to the pool.</p><p>Gavin stripped off his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHas our little pool party taken a distinctly adult tone?\u201d Dex asked, a wide smile on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cHannah likes to play cowboys and captive, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Gavin asked. \u201cI think the James Gang is going to ride tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner can wait,\u201d Dex said. He dove into the pool.</p><p>\u201cHallelujah. She kills me when she wears that bikini.
