You imagine every detail in crisp, vivid color and high-definition sound. And when that one perfect moment finally arrives, you pray the reality will come close to the fantasy you\u2019ve built up in your mind.</p><p>And then there are those precious few times\u2014when the reality blows your fantasy out of the f**king water.</p><p>That\u2019s what this is like for me.</p> <p>Because that devilishly handsome man, in the perfectly fitted Armani tuxedo, standing at the altar of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral\u2014that\u2019s me. Drew Evans.</p><p>And Katherine Brooks just stepped into the church. Waiting in the back, a stunning vision in white, ready to take her first step down the aisle.</p><p>To me.</p><p>Most guys don\u2019t dream about their wedding\u2014you don\u2019t need me to tell you that. But this isn\u2019t just any wedding. This is a landmark event. Revolutionary. Because for most of my life, I didn\u2019t entertain the slightest possibility that I\u2019d end up here.</p><p>Sand to the beach, books to the library\u2014it wasn\u2019t what I wanted, remember?</p> <p>But Kate did the impossible. She changed all that\u2014she changed me. I think we can all agree I was pretty frigging awesome before . . . but now I\u2019m even better.</p><p>The road to this day wasn\u2019t all rainbows and boners. There were some potholes\u2014mistakes\u2014and misunderstandings worthy of a Greek f**king tragedy. But we made it through those times with our inexhaustible lust, boundless admiration, and everlasting love for one another intact.</p><p>That being said, some unexpected developments last weekend could have been a problem. It was . . . kind of . . . my final test.</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: What the hell did you do this time?</p><p>Relax. Let\u2019s hold off on the judgments\u2014and the calls for my castration\u2014until you hear the whole story. Just remember: even though the noblest intentions can go awry, and they do, this story has a happy ending.</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>One week earlier</p><p>The apartment is silent. Still. The kind of quiet that can only be found in the predawn hours when the sky is dark and gray. The place has changed since you saw it last. Take a look around. Sterilized sippy cups lie in wait on a countertop; a green-cushioned, wooden high chair sits in the corner of the kitchen. Framed photographs clutter the walls and shelves.</p><p>Some are of Kate and me, but most of the captured images are of a dark-haired two-year-old, with brown, soulful eyes and a devilish smile.</p><p>Cut to the bedroom. Two bodies writhe on the bed, partially covered by rumpled silk sheets; my h*ps rotate in long, slow circles. I think the missionary position has gotten a bad rap. It\u2019s not boring. It allows the guy to take control\u2014set the pace. To reach all those secret spots that make women moan and dig their fingernails into our shoulder blades.</p><p>Kind of like Kate is doing right now.</p><p>My head dips and I grasp one perky nipple with my lips, suctioning hard and flicking with my tongue. Kate arches her back. Her chin rises and her mouth opens, but no sound comes out. Her thighs squeeze harder, her pu**y clenches tighter.</p><p>Even with the birth of a child on its r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Kate\u2019s cooch is just as snug and feels just as amazing as it did that first time. God bless you, Dr. Kegel.</p><p>My h*ps speed up and change their trajectory, thrusting to and fro in hard, quick strokes. When I know she can\u2019t take it anymore, I cover her mouth with mine, muffling her blissful cry. As much as I crave the sound of Kate\u2019s voice, these days it\u2019s all about staying quiet. Covert.</p> <p>Why? you ask.</p><p>Let\u2019s pause here a minute and I\u2019ll explain.</p><p>It\u2019s our golden rule. Our first commandment: Don\u2019t wake the f**king baby.</p><p>I\u2019ll repeat that in case you missed it:</p><p>DON\u2019T WAKE THE FUCKING BABY.</p><p>Like . . . ever.</p><p>Still don\u2019t get it? Must not have kids then. See, children are beautiful. Precious. Angelic. Particularly when they\u2019re asleep. If they\u2019re disturbed mid-sleep-cycle, however? They\u2019re monsters. Irritable, angry little beasts who bear a striking resemblance to gremlins fed after midnight.</p><p>And the cold truth is, even when they\u2019re well rested, babies are pretty frigging selfish. Self-centered and demanding. They don\u2019t care what you were doing before they needed you, or\u2014more important\u2014whom you were trying to do. They only care about themselves. They\u2019re hungry. They\u2019re wet. They want you to pick them up because the view from the crib has gotten old.</p><p>For all you happy couples out there awaiting the arrival of your own darling little cockblocker? I\u2019m gonna tell you how it really is\u2014not the utopian bullshit they feed you in those What to Expect books.</p><p>Here it goes: In the days after they\u2019re born, when you\u2019re still in the hospital, all infants do is sleep. I think the numbers are like twenty-three out of a twenty-four-hour day. I think they\u2019re slipping something into those bottles in the nursery.</p><p>Anyway, after a day or two, if all goes well, the hospital sends you home. And that\u2019s when the baby decides that it\u2019s slept enough. And finds something else to do to pass the time.</p><p>Did you know an infant\u2019s cry is twenty decibels higher than a train whistle? I shit you not. Look it up if you don\u2019t believe me.</p><p>By day three, I was convinced something was wrong with James. Maybe he had a gastrointestinal disorder. Maybe he was allergic to the wallpaper.</p><p>Maybe he just didn\u2019t f**king like us.</p><p>Whatever the reason, he was not a happy camper. And he was all too eager to let us know it. In the morning. In the afternoon. And\u2014his favorite\u2014all through the night.</p><p>Once in a while, just to screw with us, he\u2019d mix it up and pass out for a while. But if he was awake? Yep\u2014he was bawling. And I\u2019m not talking about lip-quivering whimpers, either. Hell no. I\u2019m talking lung-expanding, arm-and-leg-kicking, bansheelike screeching.</p><p>Shaken baby syndrome? I totally get that now.</p><p>Not that we were gonna go nuclear on his ass, but honestly? It wasn\u2019t fun.</p><p>My mother came over a lot, and at first I was relieved. I figured she\u2019d done this twice before, she\u2019d know how to fix him. Moms always make everything better.</p><p>Only . . . she didn\u2019t.</p><p>All she did was smile in that infuriatingly calm way while she bounced our squawking newborn on her shoulder. Then she\u2019d tell us it was normal. That all babies cried. That Kate and I just had to figure out our own way of doing things.</p><p>I\u2019d never before had the urge to strangle my mother. I\u2019d never understood psychos like the Menendez brothers or Jim Gordon. But in those dark days when sleep\u2014and blow jobs\u2014were a distant memory, I\u2019m sorry to say matricide was looking pretty damn attractive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because I was sure my mother knew the secrets of a happy baby\u2014that she held the Keys to the Kingdom in her grasp. But for some evil, vengeful reason, she just wasn\u2019t handing them the f**k over. And sleep deprivation can drive you crazy. Even the most absurd ideas suddenly look like viable options.</p><p>One time, it was around four in the morning and I . . .</p><p>Actually, it might be better if I just show you, so you can get the full effect. Yes, it\u2019s a flashback within a flashback\u2014but you\u2019re smart, you can handle it. I\u2019ll speak slowly, just in case:</p><p>James, five days old:</p> <p>\u201cWhaaa, whaaa, whaaa, whaaa.\u201d</p><p>In the time it takes my eyes to crack open and interpret the numbers on the alarm clock, Kate is already sitting up, ready to spring out of bed and scoop up the swaddled ball of angry in the bassinet beside the bed.</p><p>Four a.m.</p><p>Mentally, I groan\u2014because it\u2019s been less than an hour since he fell asleep. Although my first egotistical instinct is to close my eyes and let Kate deal with it, the part of me that wants to help out while I can\u2014because I don\u2019t want her to lose her mind\u2014backhands the selfish part.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaaaa, whaaaaaaaa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got him, Kate.\u201d I toss the covers off and slip on a pair of sweats. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d I\u2019m kind of hoping she fights me over it . . . but she doesn\u2019t. She flops back down against the pillow.</p><p>I pick James up and hold him against my bare chest. His cheek nuzzles my skin before he unleashes a heartbroken cry. I walk out of the bedroom with him to the kitchen. From the fridge I grab a bottle of breast milk, which Kate filled this afternoon with that weird dairy-cow pump thing she got from Delores at the baby shower. Holding James with one hand, I run the bottle under hot water the way the lactation adviser at the hospital instructed us to do.</p><p>After it\u2019s warmed, I make my way to the living room with bleary eyes and tired, wobbly legs. I sit on the couch, cradling James in my arms, and run the nipple across his lips.</p><p>I realize it\u2019s a bad idea to feed him every time he wakes. I know all about the importance of a feeding schedule and burping and teaching him to \u201cself-soothe.\u201d I understand he shouldn\u2019t actually be hungry, since he just ate an hour ago. But sleep deprivation is a torture technique for a reason. So all that crap goes right out the window, in the hopes of getting him\u2014and me\u2014back to sleep as quickly as possible.</p><p>He takes two drags on the bottle, then rejects it, turning his head with an openmouthed squawk: \u201cWhaaaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>I look up at the ceiling and curse God.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, James?\u201d My voice has a frustrated edge. \u201cYou\u2019re dry, I\u2019m holding you, I\u2019m trying to feed you\u2014what the hell do you want?\u201d I walk back to the kitchen and grab the checkbook off the counter.</p><p>\u201cWill money make you happy?\u201d</p><p>Ridiculous\u2014yes, I know. Don\u2019t judge me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you ten thousand dollars for four hours of sleep. I\u2019ll write the check out right now.\u201d I wave the checkbook in front of his face, hoping to distract him.</p><p>It just pisses him off more.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaa . . .\u201d</p><p>I toss the checkbook back on the counter and return to the living room. Then I pace the floor, rocking him softly in my arms, patting his ass. You know I must be really desperate\u2014because I try singing:</p><p>Hush, little baby, don\u2019t say a word</p> <p>Daddy\u2019s gonna buy you a . . .</p><p>I stop\u2014because why the f**k would any baby want a mockingbird? None of those nursery rhymes make any goddamn sense. I don\u2019t know any other lullabies, so I go for the next best thing, \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d by Metallica:</p><p>Take my hand,</p><p>We\u2019re off to never-never land . . .</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>When that doesn\u2019t help, I sit down on the couch. I lay James on my thighs and support his head with my hand. I look into his little face\u2014and even though he\u2019s still bawling, I can\u2019t help but smile. Then, in a low, calm voice, I talk to him.</p><p>\u201cI get it, you know. Why you\u2019re so unhappy. One minute you\u2019re floating in amniotic fluid\u2014it\u2019s dark and warm and quiet. Then a minute later, you\u2019re freezing and there\u2019s bright lights and some ass**le is pricking your heel with a needle. Your whole world is turned upside down.\u201d</p><p>The tide of tears starts to recede. Though there\u2019s a sporadic whimper, for the most part his big, brown eyes keep contact with mine. Interested in what I\u2019m saying. I know the accepted theory is that babies have no understanding of language at this stage, but\u2014like men attempting to get out of household chores\u2014I think they know more than they let on.</p><p>\u201cI felt the same way when I met your mother. There I was, cruising along, making the most of a fan-fucking-tastic life\u2014and your mom came along and shot it all to hell. I didn\u2019t know which way was up\u2014with work, with my Saturday nights. This is a talk for another time, but it\u2019s true what they say: you spend nine months trying to get out, and the rest of your life trying to work your way back in.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle at my own joke. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but your mom is gorgeous\u2014the finest ass I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. Still, I really liked my old life and I couldn\u2019t imagine anything better. But I was wrong, James\u2014falling in love with her, earning her trust, having you, are the best things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not crying at all anymore but simply regarding me with quiet attention. \u201cThe adjustment might be hard . . . but it\u2019s worth it. So could you cut us some slack, please? We love you so much\u2014I can\u2019t wait to show you how f**king great life is on the outside. And you don\u2019t have to be scared, because we\u2019ll keep you warm and fed. And I promise I\u2019ll never, ever let anything bad happen to you.\u201d</p><p>His little mouth opens in a stretching yawn. And his eyes slow-blink. I stand up and pace the room again\u2014slowly.</p><p>Kate\u2019s hushed voice comes from the across the room. \u201cYou certainly have a way with words, Mr. Evans.\u201d Her hair is wild, messy; my college T-shirt is baggy on her and almost reaches her knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fall back asleep. And I heard you whispering out here.\u201d She walks up to us and rests her head against my arm\u2014gazing down at the baby. \u201cHe\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>And so he is.</p><p>\u201cDo I risk putting him down, or should I learn to sleep standing up like a frigging horse?\u201d</p><p>Kate loops her arm through mine and guides me to the couch. She sits and pats the spot next to her. Like a member of the bomb squad handling a device with a hair trigger, I shift James so he\u2019s on my chest, his head resting on the steady beat of my heart. Then I sit down and put my feet on the table and my head against the back cushion and my arm around Kate\u2019s shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sigh. \u201cGod, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>Still not better than sex\u2014I don\u2019t give a shit what the new-mom magazines say. Sleep is good, but screwing will always be better.</p><p>Kate curls her feet under her and rests her head against my arm. \u201cIt sure does.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, all three of us are sound asleep.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible James understood my offer of bribery, because that night he slept there on my chest for three whole hours. Before he woke up\u2014and it started all over again.</p><p>But I have a theory. I think it\u2019s all deliberate. I think God plans for those first days home with a new baby to suck donkey balls. Because afterward? Everything else\u2014the shitty diapers, the regurgitation, the constant changing of clothes and bed linens, teething\u2014they all feel like a walk in the park.</p><p>After a few more days, I realized my mother wasn\u2019t just being a bitch. She was actually giving us solid advice. Because together, Kate and I were able to figure it all out.</p><p>You know how dogs have a bark that says, Let me out or I\u2019ll piss on your recliner? And another that says, Just give me the squeaky toy, you sadistic son of a bitch? And even another one that says, I\u2019m not playing. I\u2019m literally going to chew your face off now?</p><p>Babies aren\u2019t much different from dogs. There\u2019s a cry when they\u2019re hungry. One when they\u2019re tired. Another one when they\u2019re bored, or when maybe their nose itches and they just don\u2019t have the manual dexterity to scratch.</p> <p>In any case, once you figure out the Language of Crying Baby? Life is a whole lot sweeter. And quieter.</p><p>Plus\u2014here\u2019s the kicker\u2014in spite of the exhaustion? The frustration? The crying that makes you want to puncture your f**king eardrum with a meat thermo?</p><p>You love them anyway. Fully. Fiercely.</p><p>Intensely.</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t change a thing about them\u2014wouldn\u2019t trade them for all the freaking iPhones in China. Sounds strange, I know. But that\u2019s just how it is.</p><p>Screw the Peace Corps. Parenthood is the toughest job you\u2019ll ever love.</p> <p>So now, two years later, back to the p**n -worthy sex . . .</p><p>I slide my hands under Kate\u2019s ass\u2014kneading and lifting\u2014bringing us closer. Rocking us faster. My forehead hovers close to hers and I open my eyes. So I can watch.</p><p>I\u2019m greedy like that. I want to soak up every gasp\u2014every flicker of pleasure that dances across her exquisite face. Pleasure I\u2019m giving her.</p><p>I know Kate\u2019s body as well as I know my own. There\u2019s a contentment, a confidence, a power, in that knowledge that I can\u2019t fully explain. We\u2019re completely in sync. Joined body and soul. A well-lubed machine working in tandem toward that moment of pure, hot paradise that I\u2019ve only ever experienced with her.</p><p>Kate\u2019s breathing changes. It turns panting and desperate, and I know she\u2019s close. Sweat trickles down my chest. I move harder, grinding against her\u2014inside her\u2014with every forward push. Warms sparks tickle my spine and tighten my balls. Heat spreads down and out until every nerve in my body is shaking. Quivering. Begging to explode.</p><p>Sweet Jesus.</p><p>My h*ps rock back, and I pull almost all the way out. Then, for a second, I freeze. We teeter right on the edge. Together. Savoring the sensation of that perfect moment\u2014right before you come\u2014where it feels so f**king good. But you know it\u2019s about to feel even better.</p><p>I slam my c**k inside her, burying deep as Kate\u2019s h*ps jerk upward. She spasms hard around me, gripping me tight over and over, while ecstasy wracks my body, making me shudder.</p> <p>I hold on to Kate\u2019s ass as if my life depends on it. I press my lips against her neck to soften the sounds I can\u2019t control. \u201cKate . . . Kate . . . f**k . . . Kate . . .\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s astounding. Fantastic. But not unusual. \u2019Cause we\u2019re just that frigging good together.</p><p>I exhale harshly against Kate\u2019s skin as I come back down to earth. But I don\u2019t move yet. I just don\u2019t have the will. I\u2019m considering going back to sleep. On top of her.</p><p>She won\u2019t mind.</p><p>At least that\u2019s what I think, until Kate performs the move that seems to amuse every woman on earth. And causes every man on earth to want to squeal like an impaled pig. Without warning, she uses her powerful pu**y muscles to squeeze my extremely sensitive dick.</p><p>Guys hate that. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny. Kate knows this.</p><p>I jerk back, pull out, and roll off her.</p><p>I try to look annoyed\u2014but don\u2019t quite pull it off. Because Kate\u2019s eyes are sparkling. And she\u2019s giggling. And she looks so messy-haired, flushed-faced, just-fucked beautiful, that it\u2019s impossible not to grin back.</p><p>She knows that too.</p><p>I whisper, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my back and Kate scoots closer, resting her head on my chest and her palm on my stomach.</p><p>My tattoo? Noticed that, did you? Yeah\u2014I got another one right after James was born. It\u2019s straightforward, nothing flashy. But it\u2019s as meaningful as Kate\u2019s name on my right arm.</p><p>It simply says James. Right over my heart.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Kate starts, \u201cbig day today, huh?\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through her hair. \u201cNo. Next week is a big day. Today\u2019s just a technicality.\u201d</p><p>One hundred sixty-eight hours. Eight thousand six hundred and forty minutes.</p><p>Not that I\u2019m counting or anything.</p><p>That\u2019s when it\u2019ll be official. That\u2019s when Kate Brooks is gonna marry me. When she\u2019ll not only sleep in my bed because she wants to\u2014but because she\u2019s legally obligated to be there.</p><p>Husband and wife. Flesh of my flesh. What God has joined together, let no one who wants to keep his arm attached try to pull asunder.</p><p>Kate bites her lip. \u201cHave the guys told you what the plan is?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s referring to the bachelor party. My bachelor party.</p><p>My Las Vegas bachelor party.</p><p>The stag party is a night to celebrate the demise of a man\u2019s singlehood, in the rankest, most depraved manner possible. Sex and alcohol are big themes. You\u2019ve seen the movies\u2014The Hangover, Bachelor Party . . . it\u2019s the last hurrah. Like the night before you ship off to war or, if you\u2019re a woman, start a diet.</p><p>The groom is expected to gorge himself on all the stuff he supposedly won\u2019t be getting anymore, once he slips that ring on his bride\u2019s pretty little finger.</p><p>Of course, Kate is not the average bride. And because our relationship\u2014and our sex life\u2014is better now than it\u2019s ever been, at first I didn\u2019t want a party. I just didn\u2019t see the point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a few men, such as me, once you\u2019re in love, all the other tits and asses in the world just sort of . . . blend together. It\u2019s like . . . cars in the city\u2014the honking, the revving, the screech of tires on blacktop. I hear them, I know they\u2019re there, but I just don\u2019t give a shit. I don\u2019t glance their way, don\u2019t stop to look. Not anymore\u2014because I\u2019ve got a top-of-the-line classic in my garage, just waiting for me to come home and ride her.</p><p>She\u2019s the only one I want.</p><p>But eventually, the guys convinced me. Jack, Matthew, and Steven cornered me in the conference room and explained that the bachelor party wasn\u2019t really for me. It was for all the other guys, who actually had to work to get laid.</p><p>Meaning the single guys and . . . you know . . . the ones who are already married.</p> <p>After hearing them plead their case, I was on board. Between work, Kate, and the adorable little dictator that is our son, I haven\u2019t had a lot of quality time with the boys. I figured it would be a good time\u2014a night of bonding\u2014a way to make some lifelong memories with my closest friends.</p><p>So when Kate asks if the guys have told me what the plan is, I answer, \u201cNot really.\u201d Matthew\u2019s exact words were \u201cThe less you know, the better. Plausible deniability.\u201d But I don\u2019t want to tell Kate that. It\u2019ll just make her worry.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t let it go, however. \u201cWell, if you had to guess, what do you think you\u2019ll do?\u201d</p><p>I shrug again. \u201cSteak dinner, casino, drinking . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrippers?\u201d</p> <p>Did you hear the change in her voice? The preemptive anger? The bite?</p><p>My eyebrows rise. \u201cA visit to a strip club will probably be on the itinerary, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She scoffs. In that you\u2019re-such-a-prick kind of way. Then she sits up and crosses her arms. \u201cOf course. Figures. Because you haven\u2019t spent enough time in the company of strippers\u2014you have to squeeze in another night\u2019s worth before our wedding.\u201d</p><p>Have you ever heard of the Missile Defense System\u2014the MDS? Started by Reagan in the eighties, its sole purpose is to defend against another country\u2019s attack. To destroy their missiles before impact. To deflect damage. The system doesn\u2019t analyze the opposition\u2019s argument. It doesn\u2019t take the time to consider that maybe they have a valid reason for attacking. It simply reacts. Immediately. Defensively.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get pissy\u2014it\u2019s a bachelor party. Are you trying to tell me Dee-Dee\u2019s not gonna have a guy . . . or ten . . . shaking their junk in your face?\u201d</p><p>Did I not mention that the girls will be coming along on our weekend adventure? They are. Delores thought it\u2019d be fun to make it a group excursion, then split up for our separate nights of debauchery. I thought it was a fabulous suggestion\u2014made me almost like Dee.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s different and you know it,\u201d Kate argues.</p><p>\u201cExcept it\u2019s really not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it bother you if Dee hired strippers?\u201d</p><p>For years, Sister B told us there were no stupid questions. Boy, was she full of shit.</p><p>The mere thought of a half-naked guy who isn\u2019t me grinding on Kate? It makes me want to destroy something\u2014like a face. Go all Fight Club and break someone into mangled, bloody pieces until he\u2019ll never resemble a human being again.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s caveman. Maybe it\u2019s irrational and sexist and unfair. But that\u2019s just how I am.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019ll f**king bother me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee-Dee says what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMatthew needs to learn how to muzzle his f**king gander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you muzzle me?\u201d</p><p>I can be biting too. \u201cNo, sweetheart\u2014I enjoy your mouth way too much to muzzle it. I prefer it wide-open and waiting.\u201d</p><p>Kate gasps, and I expect her to come back at me, guns blazing. Because this is what we do. You\u2019ve been around long enough\u2014you know the drill. It\u2019s foreplay, afterplay, it\u2019s jabs and zingers. They\u2019re just words\u2014a way to vent our frustrations or turn each other on.</p><p>They don\u2019t mean jack shit. Only on rare occasions is there any real anger or hurt feelings behind them. And this isn\u2019t one of those times.</p><p>Only . . . apparently it is.</p><p>\u201cSee\u2014this is exactly what I was afraid of. We haven\u2019t even left yet, and you\u2019re already being a bastard. I knew this would happen again.\u201d</p><p>Kate turns slightly away from me, shaking her head stiffly. That\u2019s when I see them. Tears. Welling in her eyes, ready to fall, being held back by her sheer stubbornness alone.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised. And aching. Like I got shot in the heart with a rock-size rubber bullet.</p><p>Kate throws the sheets off and moves to get out of bed. But I\u2019m faster\u2014Flash Gordon can eat my dust. Before her feet hit the floor, I\u2019m in front of her, hands up. Remorseful and apologetic.</p><p>And naked.</p><p>When you\u2019re trying to plead your case? Being na**d doesn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cKate . . . wait . . . just slow down. Back up a minute.\u201d I grab for her wrist.</p><p>But she pulls away. \u201cStop touching me!\u201d</p><p>Right\u2014like that\u2019s gonna happen.</p><p>But I don\u2019t get a chance to tell her that. A dreaded sound echoes across the room and halts all action, grabbing our full attention. Because it\u2019s coming from the baby monitor.</p><p>It\u2019s a rustling, the sound of cotton rubbing cotton. Like snipers in the jungle, we don\u2019t move a muscle. We don\u2019t say a word. We wait. Until the rustling stops. And all is quiet again.</p><p>That was a warning sign\u2014a shot across our bow. A \u201cshut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t have to be told twice.</p><p>What ensues next is a comical soundless argument only true parents will understand. It\u2019s all mouthing and miming, facial expression and hand flailing. Until eventually, Kate flips me the finger.</p><p>Then I smile. And mouth, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I mean, if she\u2019s ready for round two, who am I to deny her?</p><p>I tackle her. We roll around on the bed for a minute until I pin her down\u2014sitting on her waist\u2014trapping her hands over her head. The physical exertion defuses some of the tension, and Kate looks a little less devastated. When I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t try to escape, I grab the comforter and pull it over both of us, so we\u2019re shielded in a conversation-muting cocoon.</p><p>I flop down on my side facing Kate, and in a half-whispered tone I get right to the point. \u201cIf the idea of strippers being part of the entertainment bothers you so much, why the hell did you say it was okay to have my bachelor party in Las Vegas?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strippers in Las Vegas are like corn in Iowa. They\u2019re kind of what the city is known for.</p><p>Kate squirms. Then she sighs. \u201cBecause everyone was so excited about going to Las Vegas. I didn\u2019t want to be the downer. Bachelor and bachelorette parties in Vegas are like . . . tradition, right?\u201d</p><p>Not too long ago, sacrificing goats was a tradition too. Doesn\u2019t make it a good idea.</p><p>\u201cNot all traditions have to be followed. If you\u2019re really that uncomfortable about it, I\u2019ll tell the guys no. We\u2019ll stick to gambling, cigars, and alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>She pauses a moment\u2014thinking. \u201cYou would do that for me?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. Because by now, how can she not know? \u201cOf course I would.\u201d</p><p>Kate tucks her hands under her cheek. It makes her look young, vulnerable. My chest tightens with the desire to protect her. From anything\u2014everything\u2014that could cause her pain.</p><p>Including my own tongue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care about the strippers, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>Now I\u2019m confused. \u201cAre you saying that because you really don\u2019t care\u2014or because you think that\u2019s what I want you to say?\u201d</p><p>I have to ask, because in my experience, women will tell you to do something and then slit your f**king throat when you actually do it. Since you were supposed to know they didn\u2019t really want you to do it. That they don\u2019t really mean what they say.</p><p>Except for the times when they do.</p><p>It\u2019s like an undiscovered form of schizophrenia. God gave you a mouth for a reason, ladies. Well . . . several reasons actually.</p><p>But the point is\u2014use it. Be up-front. It\u2019ll save us all a lot of time and energy.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m being honest. Now that I know you don\u2019t want to go to a strip club, it doesn\u2019t bother me so much if you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why were you upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, deep down, I\u2019m just . . . afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Gotta say, that one kind of hurts. Like an old knee injury that acts up so infrequently, you almost forget it\u2019s there. Until it reminds you. And you\u2019re bedridden for a week.</p><p>Kate sees my expression and elaborates. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to do something . . . that you\u2019re going to see something, or hear something, and that you\u2019ll take it the wrong way. That there\u2019ll be a misunderstanding, and you\u2019ll react . . . badly.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes. And sigh. \u201cI thought we were past all that, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She grabs my hand and squeezes. \u201cWe are past it. We forgave each other, and we\u2019re so good now. But . . . you have to admit . . . there\u2019s a pattern.\u201d</p> <p>Rose Kennedy once declared, \u201cIt has been said, \u2018Time heals all wounds.\u2019 I do not agree. The wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But it is never gone.\u201d</p><p>Preaching to the choir, Rosie. Preaching to the choir . . .</p><p>My hand trails out and cups Kate\u2019s cheek to reassure her. \u201cI\u2019m not that guy anymore, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Okay, you\u2019re right: deep down I am still that guy. But I\u2019m smarter now. More. I\u2019m a father. In a week, I\u2019ll be a husband. And I would cut my dick off before I would ever hurt Kate like that again.</p><p>I\u2019ve grown, God damn it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kate. And I trust you. I trust us. We talk about things\u2014I don\u2019t just react now. So I\u2019m not gonna screw this up. Not this weekend; not ever again.\u201d</p><p>Oh, irony. You ugly bitch.</p><p>Kate\u2019s hand covers mine. She stares into my eyes, looking for truth or sincerity or I don\u2019t know what. Whatever it is, she finds it. Because she smiles. And kisses me softly. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>Then she pulls back and asks, \u201cWould you feel better if I tell Dee to cancel any stripper plans she may have made for us?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Hell yes.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . maybe.\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. I want you to have fun with the girls. You know, do what ganders do.\u201d</p><p>See? If that\u2019s not evidence of f**king growth, I don\u2019t know what the hell is. Besides, male strippers aren\u2019t that big a deal. Because most of them are aspiring dancers. And we all know what that means. . . .</p><p>Anyway, no girl wants to bang a guy in a banana hammock. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re built like a brick shithouse and hung like a freaking horse\u2014if you\u2019re wearing a man-thong? You look like a tool.</p><p>As we sit up, Kate tells me, \u201cWatching a greased-up guy shaking his ass is not really my idea of fun, Drew.\u201d She wiggles her eyebrows my way. \u201cNow, you greased up and dancing, on the other hand, that sounds like a good time.\u201d</p><p>This is why I love her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the perfect woman.\u201d</p><p>I pull her in for a kiss\u2014longer than the last one. But just as our tongues come out to play, a small voice chirps out from the monitor.</p><p>\u201cMummy? Daaaddy? Up-o. Up-o.\u201d</p><p>I pull back. \u201cThe beast has risen. You shower first, I\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I slide on a pair of sweats as Kate pulls some clothes from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cDaaddy! Mummy! Up-o. Up-o. Up-o!\u201d</p><p>My son is not a big fan of patience. Wonder where he gets that from?</p><p>\u201cOh, and Drew?\u201d</p><p>I turn toward Kate. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother used to say, \u2018Look with your eyes, not with your hands.\u2019 When you\u2019re at that strip bar? Make sure you do that.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cGot it, boss.\u201d I stride forward and grab her chin, freeing her lip from her teeth\u2019s grip. Then I kiss it better\u2014making her just a little dazed and confused. \u201cStop f**king worrying. We\u2019re gonna have a great time with our friends this weekend. Nothing bad is gonna happen. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Famous last words, right? How\u2019s that for a jinx? Idiot.</p><p>I spin her back around and slap both cheeks with one hand. \u201cNow get that ass in the shower before I decide to tap it again.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughs, \u2019cause she thinks I\u2019m kidding. Only\u2014</p><p>\u201cDaaadddyyy! Up-o! Up-o!\u201d</p><p>Right. Duty calls. Kate heads for the bathroom, and I go to spring James from his cage.</p><p>So that\u2019s how it started. Everything was awesome. We were talking. Laughing. Communicating.</p><p>Fucking.</p><p>It was like a fairy tale, for Christ\u2019s sake.</p><p>Did you ever notice how fairy tales all start off great? The beautiful princess, the happy kingdom? Then it all turns to shit. One minute Hansel\u2019s feeling no pain, chomping on a window made of sugar, and the next minute some old hag is trying to shove his ass in an oven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For any of you out there who still think I\u2019m an unworthy, self-absorbed douche? I have a feeling you\u2019re going to enjoy this.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>James\u2019s room is dim. The shades are drawn and the only illumination comes from a Buzz Lightyear night-light in the corner. It\u2019s the mother of all boy\u2019s rooms. Yellow and green? No thanks. The walls are navy and cream, the furniture dark cherrywood. A toddler-size basketball net is against one wall, and a full-size train table against the other. A comfy rocking chair is stationed between two arched windows, with a well-worn copy of Goodnight Moon lying in wait on the seat. Framed pictures of family\u2014and the new Yankee Stadium\u2014hang on the walls. A Metallica poster is taped to the back of the door.</p> <p>I wanted it front and center but Kate shot me down.</p><p>James\u2019s big, dark eyes light up when I walk in. He\u2019s the perfect mini-me\u2014his nose, his chin, his black hair that sticks up at all angles.</p><p>\u201cMorning, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He holds on to the rail of his crib and bounces like a cotton-clad chimpanzee.</p><p>His words are carefully pronounced, with stresses on the consonants. Kind of like a robot. \u201cHel-lo, Dad-dee.\u201d</p> <p>So f**king cute.</p><p>I pick him up, hold him high, and nibble on his belly, making him shriek. Then I bring him back down and give him a squeeze. His head turns and rests on my shoulder, and his breath tickles my neck. I kiss his hair again\u2014just because I can.</p><p>I\u2019ll never understand those guys who refuse to hug and kiss their kids\u2014particularly their male kids. Coldhearted pricks, if you ask me. The idea that too much affection can make a boy soft is a big steaming pile of crap.</p><p>If you want your kid to be confident\u2014secure? You have to give them a good foundation\u2014set the right example. Take my old man, for instance. I grew up knowing he was fully capable of kicking my ass whenever I stepped out of line. Which he did. Frequently. But he also showed me every day that he had my back. That he loved me, was proud of everything I did or tried to do. James is gonna grow up the exact same way.</p><p>A rancid aroma invades my nose. \u201cJesus, James.\u201d I lay him on the table to get him changed.</p><p>You look surprised. You shouldn\u2019t be. Real men change diapers.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about putting that on a T-shirt.</p><p>In fact, anything Kate can do\u2014bath time, bedtime, midnight feedings\u2014I can do too. I kind of have to.</p><p>Kate was only twenty-eight when James was born. For a professional in our field, that\u2019s young. And as happy as she was to do the mom thing\u2014and despite a boatload of guilt\u2014she just wasn\u2019t ready to trade in the corporate ladder for Mommy and Me\u2019s and goddamn Wiggles songs.</p><p>A nanny or day care was out of the question. When I was young, I didn\u2019t even like to board our dogs. No way was I handing my kid off to some strangers, hoping every day that they didn\u2019t cause harm.</p><p>But I did promise Kate\u2014once upon a time\u2014that I\u2019d make all her dreams come true. So, we compromised. Here\u2019s how that played out. You\u2019ll find the ending of this exchange particularly gratifying . . . or at least I did:</p><p>James\u2014four weeks old.</p><p>It\u2019s ten thirty by the time I walk through the door of our apartment. These may seem like late hours to you, but in the field of investment banking, it\u2019s pretty much par for the course. One seven o\u2019clock meeting runs over, then a conference call with Indonesia, a couple more hours spent reviewing contracts, and here we are.</p><p>When James was first born, I took two weeks dad-ternity leave, but now I\u2019m back at the office full speed ahead. Kate\u2019s doing the stay-at-home-mom thing. We used to alternate the middle-of-the-night feeding shifts, but because it\u2019s difficult to form a coherent sentence\u2014let alone manage millions of dollars\u2014when half your brain is asleep, they now fall on her, so I can get a night of decent shut-eye and not decimate my clients\u2019 fortunes.</p> <p>I toss my keys on the table and nudge the door closed with my foot. I step into the living room\u2014Kate\u2019s sitting on the couch with a basket of laundry at her feet, folding tiny pants that will join their onesie brethren stacked on the table. Her long, soft hair\u2014which I relish feeling draped across my thighs\u2014is tied up in a bun. She\u2019s wearing short pajama shorts and a navy T-shirt, and I can\u2019t help but notice her still-larger-than-normal-from-breast-feeding tits are free from the usual bra constraints.</p><p>Bonus.</p><p>In a louder voice than I\u2019d intended, I say, \u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d She attacks. \u201cIf you wake that baby, I\u2019ll pluck out every pubic hair you have the next time you fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. She\u2019s been spending way too much time with Delores these days.</p><p>I lower my voice. \u201cSorry.\u201d I sit beside her on the couch and lean over for a kiss.</p><p>My lips coax a smile from her\u2014as usual. \u201cHi,\u201d she greets me in a much-happier-to-see-me tone. \u201cDo you want me to heat you up a plate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll just make myself a bowl of cereal.\u201d</p><p>Kate yawns as she picks up a my mom is hotter than your mom bib and continues to fold.</p><p>\u201cRough day?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot so much. He was just really cranky around six\u2014it took me forever to get him down for the night.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Then tilt my head toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go check on him.\u201d</p><p>Kate shoots me down. \u201cNo\u2014no, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be really quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t even touch him.\u201d</p><p>Wryly she points out, \u201cWe both know you\u2019re incapable of seeing James and not touching him.\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he\u2019ll be up and I\u2019ll have to feed him to get him back down. And his whole schedule will be blown for the night.\u201d</p><p>I see the wisdom of what she\u2019s saying. Doesn\u2019t mean I have to frigging like it.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him all day!\u201d I had to run out the door earlier than usual this morning, to make a meeting with a client uptown. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy for a baby to go days without laying eyes on the man who fathered him.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if this is a fact\u2014but it sounds good, so I stick with it.</p><p>Again, Kate\u2019s not having it. \u201cHe\u2019s four weeks old. He needs a schedule more than he needs to see his daddy.\u201d</p><p>I frown. I think my feelings are hurt. \u201cThat\u2019s a f**ked-up thing to say.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any less true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sigh. And decide on a more subversive course of action. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just go make that bowl of cereal.\u201d</p><p>Kate watches me as I get up. Then softly calls to my retreating back, \u201cStay away from the nursery, Drew\u2014don\u2019t even look at the door.\u201d</p><p>I neither agree nor disagree. Even though Kate and I have been together for years, loopholes still apply. I enter the kitchen, grab the milk out of the fridge, and pour myself a bowl Lucky Charms. I take two bites and\u2014</p><p>Did you hear that? It sounded like a baby\u2019s cry, didn\u2019t it?</p> <p>No?</p><p>Then I recommend you get your hearing checked, \u2019cause I definitely heard it.</p><p>I slip through the kitchen door and stealthily make my way down the hall to the nursery. The door is cracked a few inches\u2014just wide enough to stick my head in. The night-light casts a warm glow on the dark wood furniture, rocking chair, and stuffed animals stacked in the corner. I listen. And all I hear is the sound of James\u2019s deep, rhythmic baby breathing.</p><p>Guess it wasn\u2019t a cry I heard, after all. But . . . since I\u2019m here and all, it won\u2019t hurt to have a peek, right? Right.</p><p>Like a kid sneaking downstairs before sunrise on Christmas morning, I step softly into the room. I stand next to the crib and gaze down at my sleeping boy. An instant smile appears on my face. Because he\u2019s so goddamn adorable.</p> <p>He\u2019s on his back, head turned to the right, one fisted little hand bent at the elbow above his dark-haired head. He\u2019s dressed in a cotton, feet-covering, dark-green romper. I can\u2019t resist running my finger across his plump, baby-soft cheek.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t flinch or stir. So I continue to look at him\u2014and it\u2019s kind of crazy how entertaining it is just watching him breathe.</p><p>After I\u2019ve had my fill, I take one step toward the door.</p><p>Then something f**king dreadful happens.</p><p>You had to have seen this coming.</p><p>Yep, James\u2019s head turns to the left, and his feet kick out and his sweet features scrunch up. Then\u2014like a baby bird fresh out of the egg\u2014he lets out a cry.</p> <p>\u201cWhaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap to the door, then back to him, as the second squawk leaves his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Shhh,\u201d I whisper. \u201cJames . . .\u201d I rub his belly. \u201cShhh, go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Of course, that does a whole lot of nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhhaaaaaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>Screw it. I pick him up and bounce him against my shoulder. \u201cYou gotta be quiet, buddy. If your mom finds me in here, she\u2019s gonna lock up her pu**y like a steel safe. It\u2019ll take me hours to crack that bad boy back open.\u201d</p><p>Technically, the safe is closed for maintenance anyway. We still have two weeks to go before the doctor will give us the green light. Until then, there\u2019s a strict \u201cThou shalt not pass\u201d policy. I\u2019m not even allowed to make her cum with my mouth, or the ever-so-popular-with-teenagers dry-humping method. Roberta said her uterus needed to recoup, which means no orgasmic spasming permitted.</p> <p>That being said, you get my analogy. My son, on the other hand, does not. Or he just doesn\u2019t f**king care.</p><p>\u201cWhaaa, whaaa, whaaaaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>Then Kate\u2019s standing in the doorway, looking righteously pissed off. \u201cKiss the pubic hairs good-bye, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cWhat? I heard him crying\u2014I just got here before you.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t count as a lie if the person you\u2019re lying to knows it\u2019s a lie.</p><p>She lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches for the baby. \u201cGive him to me.\u201d</p><p>I tuck him against me and turn my body, like a football player trying to keep the ball from getting snatched in the pileup. \u201cNo, I got him. Go back to whatever you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t settle down for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll never settle down for me if you\u2019re the only one holding him all the time.\u201d I kiss the top of his screaming head. \u201cI got this, Kate. Go take a bath or something.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t that what all new mothers want?</p><p>\u201cIs that your way of telling me I smell?\u201d</p><p>Guess not.</p><p>\u201cNo . . . I\u2019m saying I stirred the shit, I\u2019ll deal with the stench.\u201d</p><p>Still looking unsure, she runs her hand down James\u2019s back. \u201cAll right. Just . . . holler if you need me.\u201d</p><p>I give her lips a peck. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Finally she smiles, then she leaves.</p><p>Most men are inept when it comes to babies. Either from lack of experience or because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to irreversibly screw something up. Give us an appliance that needs fixing, we\u2019ll take it apart, figure it out, and put it back together again, even if we\u2019re unfamiliar with it.</p><p>Babies? Not so easy to put back together.</p><p>And there\u2019s all these perils we have to be mindful of\u2014soft spots, necks that can\u2019t support heads, nasty-looking belly buttons waiting to fall off . . . don\u2019t get me f**king started on the circumcision. Men aren\u2019t good multitaskers, remember?</p><p>So for most, infant care is an activity best left to the mothers.</p><p>Most\u2014but not me. Because I cut my teeth on Mackenzie. When she was an infant, I wasn\u2019t around for the nighttime routine stuff, but I learned a lot about everything else. If a man can change a baby girl\u2019s diaper, there is nothing he can\u2019t accomplish. So, because I have her infancy under my belt, and because I\u2019m pretty much awesome at anything I do, I\u2019m not intimidated by James\u2019s crying. It\u2019s not a fun part of fatherhood\u2014but I can deal.</p><p>I shift him from my shoulder to cradle him in my arms.</p><p>\u201cWhaaa, whaaa, whaaa . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, what\u2019s with the tears? You don\u2019t have to cry\u2014I\u2019m gonna have you back to sleep in no time.\u201d</p><p>I grab a pacifier off the dresser and tease it into his mouth. Whimpering, he gives it a few sucks before opening his mouth to screech because he realizes it\u2019s not the real thing. I catch it before it falls to the floor.</p><p>Then I sit in the rocking chair. \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s not what you really want. And I don\u2019t blame you\u2014your mom\u2019s boobs are spectacular. But . . . you gotta take what you can get. And right now, this little piece of plastic is the next best thing.\u201d</p><p>I slide it between his lips again, and this time he doesn\u2019t reject it. He sucks rapidly and his eyes fall closed for a moment before he drags them back open\u2014a sure sign he\u2019s exhausted but fighting it. I rock slowly in the chair and tap his ass gently in a steady beat.</p><p>In a soothing whisper I tell him, \u201cYou want to hear what your old man did today? I set up a fifty-million-dollar acquisition for a man who invented a new app. He\u2019s kind of a tool. When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll learn the world is full of tools. Anyway, this particular tool didn\u2019t think the deal was good enough, so Daddy had to explain to him why it was. First I showed him . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You don\u2019t really want to hear the rest, do you? Suffice it to say, twenty minutes later, James was out cold. I kiss his forehead and lay him back in his crib. Then I go out to the living room looking for some quality time with my girlfriend. I find Kate on the couch, with a still-half-full basket of clothes next to her.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t acknowledge me right away\u2014and she\u2019s not folding clothes anymore. She\u2019s holding a pair of baby socks in each hand, unnervingly staring off into space. In deep thought.</p><p>Usually for guys, when our women are contemplating something serious? It\u2019s a bad sign.</p><p>Cautiously I sit down next to her. \u201cThe baby\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p> <p>Her blank expression doesn\u2019t change. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Snapping out of wherever she was, she turns to me quickly and tries to blow it off. \u201cOh, yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Fine\u2014a red flag if there ever was one.</p><p>I don\u2019t waste time with pleasantries. \u201cFuck fine\u2014what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She focuses her attention on the socks. \u201cI just realized . . . this is my life now.\u201d</p><p>I try hard to decipher the hidden female message in that statement\u2014and come up with zilch. \u201cO-kay . . . and . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd folding clothes, dirty dishes, afternoon walks, naptimes, changing diapers . . . that\u2019s my life. That\u2019s what I have to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . changing diapers won\u2019t last forever. And in two more weeks I\u2019ll be able to make you cum again in numerous, illicit ways\u2014that\u2019s something worth looking forward to.\u201d</p><p>That gets a chuckle out of her, but it\u2019s halfhearted. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible person.\u201d</p><p>I rub her shoulder. \u201cIf you\u2019re a terrible person, I\u2019m in some seriously deep shit.\u201d</p> <p>This time her smile is a bit more genuine. \u201cI love James, Drew. Love . . . isn\u2019t even a strong enough word . . .\u201d</p><p>I nod, because I and any parent know exactly what she means.</p><p>\u201c. . . and I know how lucky I am. Lots of women would kill to be able to stay home full-time with their kids. I really am grateful for the life I have\u2014but I never thought this would be all I\u2019d have.\u201d</p><p>And the tears start to fall. Big ones.</p><p>In the days after James\u2019s birth, he wasn\u2019t the only one on a bawling binge.</p><p>Kate was a mess.</p><p>I thought I understood the havoc hormones can wreak on the female personality\u2014but I didn\u2019t understand jack. Pregnancy hormones are a whole other animal entirely. She cried because James was beautiful, she cried because she loved me so much, and because of how much I love her. She cried when James cried, and when he slept or if he sneezed. She cried because she hadn\u2019t lost all the baby weight two days after he was born, the way those motherfucking evil, narcissistic celebrities make women feel they should.</p><p>Even though I\u2019m accustomed to my son\u2019s crying jags, seeing Kate cry will never be something I\u2019m okay with.</p> <p>My chest tightens, squeezing my heart as she wipes at her cheeks. \u201cI feel so guilty for missing work\u2014for watching you walk out that door in the morning and wishing it was me. How screwed up is that?\u201d</p><p>I rub her back and tell her the truth: \u201cIt\u2019s not screwed up at all.\u201d</p><p>Kate looks at me with surprise in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to quit my job, either\u2014I\u2019d be a miserable bastard if I couldn\u2019t go to the office anymore.\u201d Then I ask, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would pass, once I got used to being home\u2014had a new routine going. But it\u2019s just gotten worse.\u201d</p><p>The strange thing is, I know just how she feels.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled with the arrangements we have now, either.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, her tears have dried. The vise grip on my heart lessens. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m missing all the good stuff. I go for days without seeing James awake even for a minute. It sucks ass. Like the other day, when he smiled for the first time.\u201d</p><p>She tries to make me feel better. \u201cThat was just gas, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was, because boys think passing gas is funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent you a video.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. At this rate, I\u2019ll miss everything\u2014his first word, his first step, the first time he realizes he can aim and piss on things\u2014all the big moments.\u201d</p><p>Kate takes my hand. \u201cSo . . . what are we talking about here? Are you saying you want to stay home part-time?\u201d</p><p>Once the words are actually said, I realize that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted all along. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll work part-time. I\u2019ll go the office Monday, Wednesday, and Friday . . . because I\u2019m still the frigging man in the relationship . . . and you\u2019ll do Tuesday and Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of our clients aren\u2019t going to be good with that. Jefferson Industries\u2019 CEO is a prick\u2014he\u2019ll have major issues.\u201d</p><p>Like I give a damn. \u201cWhoever isn\u2019t okay with it, I\u2019ll make sure they stay in-house. Pass them off to Jack or Matthew\u2014and if we lose a few, my father will get over it. Nepotism has its advantages, Kate. I say we f**king exploit them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bonuses will take a hit.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s only money.\u201d</p><p>If you don\u2019t have a boatload of extraneous cash and investments lying around, I wouldn\u2019t recommend adopting this attitude. But since I do . . . I can.</p><p>Then I point out, \u201cIn six or seven years James will be in school, then we can both go back full-time. Unless we have a few more kids between now and then\u2014and since the activity that gets them here is at the top of our Favorite Things to Do list, that\u2019s a definite possibility.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a light in her eyes that wasn\u2019t there when I came home. Knowing I help put it there makes me proud of myself\u2014not that that\u2019s an unusual feeling, but in this case it\u2019s especially awesome.</p><p>Kate squeezes my hand enthusiastically. \u201cSo, we\u2019re doing this? We\u2019re really doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I and James will go into the office tomorrow and have a sit-down with Dad, George, and Frank.\u201d</p><p>She throws herself at me\u2014chest to chest, arms around my neck, legs straddling my thighs. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs excited as you are about getting the go-ahead from Roberta in two weeks?\u201d</p><p>Kate squints. \u201cAh . . . not that excited\u2014but very close.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then we\u2019re kissing\u2014tongues dancing and tasting. I fall back on the couch, taking her with me\u2014keeping her on top.</p><p>Her lips tease their way to my ear. \u201cI love you,\u201d Kate breathes, before licking around the shell. Heated lust gathers in my gut, then furrows out to my thighs and arms\u2014and my dick.</p><p>I return the sentiment. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s mouth lowers to my neck, torturous in its feather-light brushes against my skin. \u201cAnd I love our life.\u201d</p><p>My hand tangles in her hair, loosening the bun, making it fall. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She drops to her knees on the floor and I sit up, legs spread so she can nestle between my thighs. She looks up at me with hungry, dark eyes and a naughty-girl smile\u2014my favorite combination.</p><p>Kate unbuckles my pants and I lift up to accommodate her as she yanks them off. More slowly, she peels my boxers down and my impatient dick bounces up to greet her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love your cock.\u201d She drives the point home by running her wet tongue up and down it, then swirling around the head.</p><p>I look at her beautiful face and grin. \u201cI love my c**k in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her lips vibrate against me as she chuckles\u2014and the sensation make my legs tremble. Then she suctions with her lips from base to tip\u2014tauntingly\u2014without actually taking me inside. When I\u2019m on the brink of losing my f**king mind, she opens up and slides my dick into the tight, hot wetness of her mouth.</p><p>My head lolls back and I groan.</p><p>She swallows me slowly, inch by inch. It\u2019s maddening and feels eye-crossingly fantastic at the same time. I can\u2019t decide if I want her to suck me hard and fast or to draw out the blissful torture for hours. Maybe days.</p><p>When I\u2019m nestled in Kate\u2019s throat, she pauses, breathing softly.</p><p>And I hiss, \u201cFuck . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate was always skillful at giving head\u2014a real natural. But in these last years, her talents have reached epic proportions. She\u2019s a maestro and I\u2019m her well-endowed instrument. She practically trained the gag reflex right out of herself, and she actually enjoys deep throating\u2014and swallowing.</p><p>She once told me it made her feel powerful. Watching my face as she works me over. Seeing the signs of pleasure she\u2019s controlling\u2014letting me revel in. It\u2019s a pretty accurate take on the situation, because at the moment I\u2019m at Kate\u2019s complete and total mercy.</p><p>And that, kiddies, is the best f**king seat in the house.</p><p>She sucks me hard as her head glides up, so just the tip remains between her beautiful lips. She swirls with her tongue again\u2014this time with more pressure, less teasing. Then she bobs up and down quickly\u2014meaning business\u2014all tongue, decadent sloppy wetness, and rough brushes of teeth. Her cheeks hollow out and her hand massages my balls, giving them a gentle, erotic tug.</p><p>I moan and curse and chant her name.</p><p>I grip her hair and guide her up and down on my dick with just enough force to make her hum in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, just like that. So f**king good.\u201d I gasp.</p><p>Kate\u2019s lips tighten and her head moves faster.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kate, I\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p> <p>My hand clenches and I hold her in place, and every muscle in my body contracts in screaming, unanimous pleasure. My teeth grind and my h*ps thrust, and with moans of her own, Kate swallows enthusiastically until I have nothing left.</p><p>My breathing is harsh as she gifts me with one last flick of her tongue. Then she comes up smiling and climbs onto my lap. And I\u2019m boneless\u2014totally, sublimely relaxed. Screw wine: a b**w j*b is the best way to unwind after a long day at work.</p><p>The only thing that would make it better is if I could return the favor.</p><p>As I enclose Kate in my arms, I add another tick to the running total of orgasms I owe her. This makes . . . fifteen. And I plan on settling up all in one night\u2014the night Roberta says Kate\u2019s good to go. Don\u2019t worry\u2014as long I keep her hydrated, there\u2019s no physical danger from too many orgasms. I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go take that bath you mentioned,\u201d she purrs. \u201cWant to join me?\u201d</p><p>I run my knuckles along her jaw. \u201cJoining you is just one of the things I\u2019m dying to do right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like washing my back?\u201d</p><p>I brush my lips against hers. \u201cI want to wash lots of places\u2014every nook and cranny.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, washing her back and rubbing her shoulders are all I\u2019ll be able to do tonight. But it\u2019ll be enough for now.</p><p>I keep her legs wrapped around me as I stand up, bare assed, and walk us to the bathroom.</p><p>Having two working parents in the house isn\u2019t always perfect\u2014schedule conflicts and work-related stress can get in the way. But it works for us.</p><p>Now, where were we again? Before we cut to the gratuitous blow-job scene?</p><p>That\u2019s right\u2014elbow deep in the massacre that is James\u2019s diaper. Try mouth-breathing\u2014it helps with the stench.</p><p>\u201cGood God, kid . . . what\u2019d you do last night? Sneak out of the crib and eat a T-bone steak?\u201d</p><p>Which brings me to the greatest invention of our time. Nope\u2014it\u2019s not the Internet. Or the automobile. It\u2019s not female birth control\u2014though that\u2019s a good one too. The best innovation of the last century is the Diaper Genie. It\u2019s a lifesaver.</p><p>I drop the toxic ball into the holy can and quickly close the lid. Then I get him cleaned up with the heated wipes and sprinkle on baby powder. Next I head over to the closet to pick out his clothes. A black, collared shirt, jeans, and Nike sneakers. Clothes make the man\u2014and it works the same way with boys. It\u2019s all about first impressions. If you actually want your kid getting knocked on his ass in the sandbox? Put him in one of those pansy sweater vests. That\u2019ll pretty much guarantee it. James is a cool kid\u2014and I make damn sure he dresses like one.</p><p>After I gel James\u2019s hair and brush his teeth\u2014with some helpful suggestions on his spitting technique\u2014I carry him to the kitchen airplane style. Zoom. And strap him in his high chair so he can\u2019t escape.</p><p>Next up? Breakfast. You remember how I love cereal, right? That hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s Lucky Charms for me\u2014with extra marshmallows.</p><p>But for my son? No Lucky Charms.</p><p>Those Breakfast Club kids actually knew what they were talking about. And we really do turn into our frigging parents. And phrases like We\u2019ll see and Because I said so just pop into your head and fly out of your mouth. It\u2019s disturbing. Like Exorcist-possession kind of shit.</p><p>Anyway, for James\u2019s breakfast? Organic-apple slices and whole-grain Cheerios\u2014without sugar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know\u2014it\u2019s official\u2014I\u2019m a hypocrite. I can live with that. It\u2019s not like his taste buds know what they\u2019re missing. And when they do, I\u2019ll shove it down his throat anyway. Because it\u2019s good for him. If one day he decides to hate me for that? That\u2019s okay too.</p><p>Because sometimes being a father is hard. And if it\u2019s not? You\u2019re not doing it right.</p><p>I pour some Cheerios onto the tray and back up halfway across the room. \u201cHey, James, set it up.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth wide and keeps it open. I hold a single Cheerio between my fingers while I bend my knees and bounce my hand as if I were dribbling a basketball. \u201cThree seconds left on the clock, down by one, Evans gets the ball. He fakes left, he drives in, he shoots. . . .\u201d</p> <p>I toss the Cheerio in a high arc. It lands right in James\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe scores! The crowd goes wild!\u201d</p><p>James holds both hands over his head. \u201cCore!\u201d</p><p>Then I give him a high five. See\u2014told you. Cool, right? I shovel a spoonful of cereal in my mouth and get ready for another shot. Then Kate comes into the kitchen, texting on her phone.</p><p>All that worry about losing the baby weight? It was for nothing. Look at her\u2014snug black yoga pants hug narrow hips, a navy Penn State T-shirt shows off her flat stomach and toned arms. Her hair\u2019s pulled back into a ponytail, and a touch of shiny, strawberry-flavored lip gloss is her only makeup.</p> <p>Gorgeous.</p><p>Kate still has that simple, low-maintenance kind of beauty. She doesn\u2019t have to work at being hot\u2014she just is. I maneuver next to James\u2019s high chair and wait for Kate to look up.</p><p>Yes, it\u2019s deliberate. Children have the power to suck the sex drive out of a relationship like a hungry black hole. So it\u2019s important to stoke the flame\u2014keep the coals burning hot. And something about seeing a shirtless guy with a baby turns every woman on.</p><p>Trust me\u2014I\u2019ve been accosted at the beach enough times to know. It\u2019s like female frigging Viagra.</p><p>It\u2019s different for guys. Not that a baby is a negative, necessarily\u2014but seeing a chick with one doesn\u2019t automatically make us want to bang her. Because deep, deep down all men are still little boys. We want all your attention on us. It\u2019s just how it is.</p><p>I feel Kate\u2019s eyes on me and I pop a piece of apple into James\u2019s mouth. Then I stretch out my arms\u2014flexing the muscles\u2014giving her a good show. Oh, yeah\u2014it\u2019s working. She\u2019s definitely wet. See how her head tilts and her eyes shine as she looks me up and down? How her lips part and she breathes just a little bit faster?</p> <p>She\u2019s remembering what we just finished doing\u2014and thinking about when we\u2019ll get to do it again.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes shift to James. Her smile changes\u2014no sexy, more sweet. \u201cHey, little man.\u201d</p><p>She comes over and takes an apple slice for herself. \u201cHow are my two favorite guys doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good.\u201d I nod toward the phone in her hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m texting Billy\u2019s manager Steven and Alexandra\u2019s address. The one he was given is for a pawnshop in the middle of the Bronx. You wouldn\u2019t know anything about that, would you?\u201d</p><p>My parents are watching all the grandchildren for the weekend. Since Steven and my sister\u2019s two trumps our one, the whole gang\u2019s meeting at their place and taking a car to the airport together.</p><p>I play innocent. \u201cWho me? Nope\u2014I know nothing.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t look as if she buys it. \u201cHe could\u2019ve missed the car to the airport. Maybe the whole flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that would\u2019ve been a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming, isn\u2019t he? I think letting your ex-boyfriend tag along to my bachelor party is above and beyond the call of nice.\u201d</p><p>Kate motions with her hands as she attempts to defend donkey dump. \u201cYou\u2019re always complaining about how close I am with him, but maybe if you tried a little harder, he wouldn\u2019t depend so much on me. And besides, Billy doesn\u2019t have a lot of guy friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes perfect sense. He\u2019s a pu**y\u2014and females tend to flock together.\u201d</p><p>Kate rolls her eyes.</p><p>James decides to join the conversation. \u201cPoosy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. That\u2019s not good.</p><p>But still, I start to laugh. How can I not?</p><p>Kate frowns at me. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Most kids speak their first word around the eleven-month mark. Because my son is a genius, his first word came at nine months. And it wasn\u2019t Mama or Dada or anything typical like that.</p><p>James\u2019s first word was shit. Kate was not pleased.</p><p>Between you and me, though, we got off easy. It could have been so much worse.</p><p>She turns to James and admonishes gently, \u201cNo, James.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, trying to understand. \u201cNo poosy?\u201d</p><p>I crack up harder. Now Kate is glaring. She puts her hands on her hips. \u201cYes\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what Daddy\u2019s going to be getting if he doesn\u2019t stop laughing right now.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s eyes go wide and he tries to warn me. \u201cNo poosy, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m full-out laughing my ass off.</p><p>Kate throws her hands up in the air. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just perfect! Now he\u2019s going to spend the next two days with your parents talking like a foulmouthed little hooligan. What\u2019s your mother going to think?\u201d</p><p>I sober slightly, still smiling, taking her hand in mine and holding it against my chest. \u201cConsidering she\u2019s the woman who had to raise the first foulmouthed hooligan? I think she\u2019ll have an enormous amount of sympathy for you.\u201d</p><p>Kate grins. \u201cWhich is totally deserved. I swear, between the two of you, I don\u2019t know how I keep my sanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sex. If raisins are nature\u2019s candy, screwing is its antidepressant. It\u2019s the best way to maintain good mental health.\u201d</p><p>An orgasm a day keeps the psychiatrist away.</p><p>Kate crosses her arms doubtfully. \u201cSure it is. That sounds an awful lot like when I was pregnant and you told me women who performed o**l s*x more often were less likely to develop preeclampsia.\u201d</p><p>I point my finger at her. \u201cThat was totally true! I read an article about it.\u201d</p><p>How awesome is that? If I wasn\u2019t sure before, after that I was certain\u2014God is definitely a guy.</p><p>\u201cIn what magazine? Playboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen\u2019s Health.\u201d</p><p>Feeling left out, James tries to get another laugh out of me. \u201cPoosy!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ruffle his hair. \u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d</p><p>Kate scoops him out of the chair and holds him close. \u201cAre you done with breakfast, baby? Do you want to sing with Mommy?\u201d</p><p>He claps his hands.</p><p>Most of James\u2019s likes and dislikes mirror my own. He hates broccoli. Female sportscasters get on his nerves. And he despises televised figure skating. But he loves Kate\u2019s voice.</p> <p>Oh\u2014and her boobs. See how he bends down to rub his face against them? Reveling in their symmetrical, cushiony softness.</p><p>I nudge his shoulder. \u201cDude, we\u2019ve been over this\u2014they were loaners. You\u2019re cut off now.\u201d</p><p>Kate breast-fed for the first year. Weaning was hell. Not that I blame the kid\u2014if Kate told me her perfect tits were off-limits? I\u2019d pitch a f**king fit too.</p><p>James\u2019s little face scrunches up\u2014like Damien from The Omen.</p><p>He grabs on to Kate\u2019s shoulders with both hands and yells, \u201cMine. Is my mummy!\u201d</p> <p>I pull her a little closer to my side. \u201cTechnically, she belongs to both of us, buddy. We can share. But those?\u201d I point to Kate\u2019s br**sts. \u201cThose are mine.\u201d</p><p>He ups the volume. \u201cNo. Is mine!\u201d</p><p>Sigmund Freud would have a field day in this house.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my mummy!\u201d</p><p>Getting into a yelling match with a two-year-old is not a good idea. That\u2019s a battle that cannot be won.</p> <p>Kate pushes my chest. \u201cStop teasing him. And go shower\u2014we\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her forehead. Then, behind her back, I point to myself and mouth to James, Mine.</p><p>He blows a raspberry at me. Smart-ass.</p><p>As I back out of the kitchen, Kate starts to sing. In that soft, flawless voice that still makes me weak in the knees.</p><p>And stiff in the crotch.</p><p>I know the song\u2014\u201cJet Plane\u201d by John Denver\u2014but she changes the lyrics to fit the situation.</p><p>\u2019Cause we\u2019re leavin\u2019 on a jet plane</p><p>We\u2019ll be back on Sunday again</p> <p>Oh, James, we love you so.</p><p>Kate rocks back and forth slowly, and James\u2019s deep brown eyes turn to her alone. He looks up at her with complete adoration. Overwhelming worship. Total devotion.</p><p>It\u2019s the same way I look at her. Every day.</p><p>I\u2019m not a big fan of humility. But watching the two of them like this? It makes me feel humble. Fortunate. Like how Joseph must have felt seeing his wife hold baby Jesus. Just so f**king lucky to get to be a part of something so beautifully sacred.</p><p>We\u2019re leavin\u2019 on a jet plane</p><p>We\u2019ll be back on Sunday again</p><p>Oh, James, we love you so.</p><p>I drag my eyes away and head for the shower.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>We get to my sister\u2019s place a little after 7:00 A.M. The apartment is a madhouse\u2014the sounds of yelling kids, talking adults, clattering coffee cups, and barking dogs fill the air.</p><p>Well . . . one barking dog. His name is Bear\u2014he\u2019s a Great Dane. I got him for Mackenzie last Christmas because Applejack the pony didn\u2019t exactly work out as I\u2019d planned. Despite some serious begging, pleading, and negotiating, the Bitch wouldn\u2019t break down and agree to let the pony I bought Mackenzie for Christmas live with them. Her main reason was the Central Park West Homeowners Association.</p><p>If you\u2019re not familiar with these types of organizations, I\u2019ll fill you in. They\u2019re the geriatric version of the gestapo\u2014composed mostly of bitter, wrinkly old bags who lie in wait for someone to do something they don\u2019t approve of.</p><p>Such as hang a gaudy wreath on the door or play music too loud . . . or convert a bedroom into a barnyard stall.</p><p>Instead of trying to buck the system and risk eviction procedures, Steven and Alexandra relocated Applejack to my parents\u2019 place upstate\u2014leaving my poor niece without a live-in pet. Which was utterly f**king unacceptable. Hence\u2014Bear.</p><p>He\u2019s awesome. And big. Sort of like a pony\u2019s dwarf cousin.</p><p>But he\u2019s gentle\u2014great with kids\u2014even though he has no idea how large he actually is. He\u2019s always trying to climb into Alexandra\u2019s purse or sit on Steven\u2019s lap\u2014which can make breathing difficult.</p><p>Kate and I walk into the living room with James on my shoulders, and Bear welcomes us with deep woofs and slobbering licks. We greet the parentals, and Kate heads into the kitchen with my mother\u2014rattling off a list of instructions and unloading James\u2019s paraphernalia for the overnight stay. I put my son on his feet and he waddles over to the corner where his cousin Thomas is quietly constructing a tower of blocks.</p><p>If Mackenzie is my sister Alexandra\u2019s twin? Tommy-boy is all Steven. He\u2019s a little underweight for his age. But long\u2014lanky. His hair is dark, his eyes are blue and thoughtful. Thomas is easygoing. Laid-back. The perfect yin to my son\u2019s Tasmanian-devil-like yang.</p><p>With a diabolical giggle, James obliterates Thomas\u2019s tower. But he doesn\u2019t complain. He just starts building another one. I wrestle with Bear a bit, until my sister walks in with a cup of hot coffee for me.</p><p>I take the cup and gesture toward Bear. \u201cHow\u2019s the house-training going?\u201d Bear has a weak bladder. And though it doesn\u2019t detract from his appeal, he\u2019s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.</p><p>\u201cFantastic\u2014if the goal was to turn my nine-thousand-dollar Persian rug into his pissing ground.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the rug in question. \u201cHe\u2019s got good taste. That\u2019s a fugly rug, Lexi. I\u2019m thinking about pissing on it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>I sip my coffee. \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>She leads me toward the adjoining dining room. \u201cI talked to the wedding planner last night and finished the seating chart. Take a look.\u201d</p><p>The wedding.</p><p>Okay\u2014most guys would rather have their teeth pulled than have any involvement in the wedding planning. Sorry to break it to you, ladies, but we don\u2019t give a shit about colors or centerpieces or the embossing style of the goddamn invitations. If we act as if we do, it\u2019s only because we\u2019re smart\u2014and we\u2019re trying to keep you off our backs.</p><p>As long as the bride looks good and those mini hot dogs are served during the cocktail hour? We\u2019re there.</p><p>So in the beginning, I happily left all the details of the big day to Kate and my sister. But then I started hearing such words as low-key and small, intimate affair and nothing too ostentatious. And I had to step in.</p><p>Because when an Olympian wins the gold medal, do they have a small, intimate affair?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>They throw a f**king ticker-tape parade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which is the least of what Kate deserves. Because she did what everyone\u2014including the members of my immediate family\u2014thought impossible. She bagged me. The grand prize\u2014the unattainable\u2014the megamillions jackpot.</p><p>That should be celebrated. In a huge way.</p><p>Plus, a woman\u2019s wedding day is supposed to be special\u2014unforgettable. She only gets one. This is particularly true in Kate\u2019s case, because shortly after James was born, we had that whole discussion about what we would do if one of us kicked the bucket early. You\u2019ve heard of that \u201cIt\u2019s a far, far better thing I do\u201d guy in A Tale of Two Cities? The one who sacrificed himself so the woman he loved could go on to live with another man?</p><p>Fucking pansy. He deserved to hang. I\u2019m not him.</p> <p>Sure, I want Kate to be happy\u2014but I want her happy with me. Or no one at all. So if I bite the big one before her? She\u2019s just gonna have to muddle through on her own.</p><p>Single.</p><p>Celibate.</p><p>Because if she hooks up with another guy? Has my son calling some loser Daddy?</p><p>I\u2019ll haunt her. Forever. Like, The Grudge style.</p> <p>You think that\u2019s awful, don\u2019t you? Selfish, possessive, egotistical?</p><p>And this surprises you why?</p><p>Anyway\u2014back to the wedding. Once I took over the reins, things got jacked up a whole lot of notches\u2014no expense spared, no detail overlooked. Alexandra and I work great together. Her hyperactive planning and organizational skills coupled with my micromanaging and determination for the perfect day have made a stupendous combination. We also have the assistance of Lauren Laforet, the most sought-after wedding planner in the city, making sure all our big plans become a reality.</p><p>Prince William and Kate can kiss my ass. Amateurs. We\u2019ve got this wedding-of-the-century thing in the bag.</p><p>On the dining-room table sits a model of the Four Seasons ballroom, with dozens of miniature tables and hundreds of name-labeled chairs perfectly arranged.</p><p>I\u2019m impressed. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>She pushes a strand of blond hair behind her ear, contemplating her handiwork. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I notice one table doesn\u2019t look right. I\u2019m about to comment, but a commotion in the living room signals a new arrival. I move to the doorway to see who\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cWoof! Woooof!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Brangelina. Otherwise known as Matthew and Delores. Curious about the nickname? You\u2019ll see.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, beast!\u201d</p><p>Bear has a real hard-on for Dee-Dee. Literally. He tries to violate her every chance he gets. Maybe he\u2019s just horny. Maybe he likes how her ass smells. Maybe he instinctually senses that she\u2019s a freak who\u2019d be into bestiality\u2014I don\u2019t know. Whatever the reason?</p><p>Funniest f**king thing ever.</p><p>\u201cMatthew, help! He\u2019s licking me! He\u2019s drooling on me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDown, Bear!\u201d</p><p>Steven appears and drags the hot and bothered hound out of the room. Dee-Dee adjusts her outfit\u2014a green silk halter jumpsuit, with a royal-blue poncholike cape and silver stiletto heels. Reminds me of a strawberry-blond, hazel-eyed peacock.</p><p>Matthew pounds me warmly on the arm. \u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Then Mackenzie walks into the room. She\u2019s taller than the last time you saw her\u2014she\u2019ll most likely get to five feet ten by the time she\u2019s done growing. Her hair\u2019s still long and blond with a slight curl; she\u2019s wearing blue jeans, Converse sneakers, and a pink Yankees jersey. She\u2019s a month shy of nine now\u2014in this day and age, that\u2019s practically a preteen.</p><p>Mackenzie is a masterpiece\u2014and I take full credit.</p><p>She\u2019s polite, brilliant, feminine\u2014but not in a screechy afraid-of-spiders way. She watches sports\u2014not to get the attention of some little prick, but because she knows what a two-point conversion and a technical foul are. She paints her nails and plays guitar. She\u2019s confident but kind. Best of all, she takes shit from no one. Yeah\u2014that\u2019s all me.</p><p>Even though I have my own son now, she was the first. The only girl. A piece of my heart will always, always belong to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She jumps up and throws herself into my arms. I spin her around.</p><p>\u201cHi, Uncle Drew! I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust got here. I like your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Then, from down the hall, I hear Steven and Alexandra going at it. And not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cI told you to put him in his crate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to isn\u2019t doing! I should\u2019ve just done it myself\u2014like everything else around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give the martyr complex a rest, please?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ve been like this lately. Tense. Strained. We\u2019ve all noticed. It happens\u2014live with someone long enough, they\u2019re bound to get on your f**king nerves. My sister\u2019s nag-athons don\u2019t exactly make it easy. But Steven\u2019s always known what she\u2019s like, and he worshipped her anyway.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>It\u2019s his tone that bothers me the most. He sounds tired. Worn-out. Fed up.</p><p>Mackenzie gazes at the floor.</p><p>I grasp her chin and tilt her face up. \u201cHow\u2019s it been around here?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cDramatic.\u201d</p><p>I glance down the hall. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sensing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s parents for you.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cCan\u2019t live with \u2019em, but emancipation is a costly and complicated process.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cYou know my door\u2019s always open, right? There\u2019s a spare room with your name on it.\u201d</p><p>She glances at Thomas. \u201cBut that would leave Thomas holding down the fort. He\u2019s just a little kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you?\u201d</p><p>Blue eyes stare up at me\u2014wise beyond their years. \u201cI\u2019m the big sister.\u201d</p><p>I lean over and kiss her forehead. Then I whisper, \u201cThis weekend will be good for them, I promise. Like a mini vacation. And I\u2019ll talk to them\u2014knock their heads together.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a soft smile, as if she appreciates my effort but doesn\u2019t quite believe it\u2019ll do any good. \u201cOkay, Uncle Drew.\u201d</p><p>Matthew walks over, oblivious of everything but Mackenzie. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl!\u201d</p><p>She looks back at him and the smile free-falls from her face. She raises her nose and folds her arms. Did you feel the temperature drop? That\u2019d be from my niece\u2019s cold shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fisher, how nice to see you again. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d</p><p>Matthew groans and drops to his knees. Even though he\u2019s over six foot, with a boxer\u2019s frame, he looks almost diminutive when faced with my niece\u2019s displeasure. \u201cMackenzie, you\u2019re killing me, baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He pushes a frustrated hand through his light brown hair. \u201cAre you ever going to forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive you? For what? For depriving me of growing up with female companionship? For leaving me wallowing in a forest of penises? Is that what I should forgive you for, Mr. Fisher?\u201d</p><p>Having babies is contagious\u2014like mono. Once a friend or a relative has one, everyone wants one just like it. At Thanksgiving dinner, the year after James was born, Matthew and Dee-Dee announced that they were having a baby. That they were adopting a baby.</p> <p>Brangelina? Get it now?</p><p>After they proclaimed their intentions, everyone was happy for them.</p><p>Well . . . almost everyone:</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re adopting a baby?\u201d asks Frank Fisher, as he sits at the dining-room table of my parents\u2019 country house on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>Still holding his wife\u2019s hand, Matthew faces his father. \u201cWhat do you mean, what do I mean? We\u2019re adopting a little boy! The paperwork is filed, and we\u2019re waiting on the final approval, but the agency says that\u2019s just a formality. Dee and I have passed all the big hurdles. He\u2019s almost two months old\u2014he\u2019s healthy and gorgeous.\u201d Matthew turns to Estelle. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see him, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Estelle beams back at her son with budding tears of joy. But Frank asks, \u201cIs something wrong with your wife? Is she barren?\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s smile falters. Before he can answer, Delores retorts, \u201cNo, Frank, I\u2019m not barren. This is something Matthew and I have talked about doing since we were married.\u201d</p><p>Frank wipes his mouth with his cloth napkin, tosses it down on his plate, and pushes back from the table. The air shifts\u2014like a summer afternoon when the sun is shining, but the wind picks up and you can feel the storm that\u2019s about to burst over your head.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you want to raise a child that isn\u2019t yours, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>My best friend frowns. \u201cBecause he will be ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Frank argues, \u201cthat\u2019s my point\u2014he won\u2019t be. You have no idea where this kid comes from, what kind of garbage his real parents are. He could grow up to have mental problems, health issues\u2014and you\u2019ll be stuck dealing with that for the rest of your life.\u201d</p> <p>Although part of me suspects my father agrees with him, he still tries to get Frank to lighten up. \u201cThat\u2019s a defeatist view, Frank. Cases like that are rare when you look at the millions of children who are adopted each year.\u201d</p><p>By this time I\u2019m on my feet, positioning myself closer to Matthew. Because I suspect this pot is about to boil the f**k over. In looks, Matthew resembles his father, but in personality he takes more after Estelle. Not much bothers him\u2014he has a long fuse. But when he blows? It\u2019s like the finale at the Macy\u2019s fireworks extravaganza.</p><p>Then Frank does the one thing that\u2019s sure to light Matthew\u2019s fuse: he lays into Dee-Dee. \u201cThis is your doing, isn\u2019t it? You and your liberal, new age bullshit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, please,\u201d Estelle pleads softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too self-centered to take time from your career to fulfill your duties as a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy duties?\u201d Delores shouts from behind Matthew. \u201cWhat year are you living in, Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter the year\u2014a woman is a woman, and a mother is a mother. Unless she physically can\u2019t, a good woman gives her husband children. If you\u2019re not up to the task, young lady, then my son would be smart to replace you with a woman who is.\u201d</p><p>Hello, shit. Meet fan.</p> <p>Matthew steps forward, the urge to put his father right through my mother\u2019s professionally painted mural wall written all over his face. \u201cDon\u2019t ever f**king talk to her like that again!\u201d</p><p>I grab Matthew\u2019s shoulder, holding him back. \u201cC\u2019mon, buddy, let\u2019s take a walk outside.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs me off.</p><p>In a lifeless voice Delores says, \u201cI\u2019d like to go home now. Matthew, can we please go?\u201d</p><p>He looks over his shoulder at her crestfallen face, and even though none of this is his fault, remorse is in his eyes. \u201cYeah, yeah, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>He turns to me\u2014because Matthew and Delores drove up with me, Kate, and James in our new Escalade.</p><p>I nod. \u201cKate\u2014get the baby\u2019s stuff. I\u2019ll get our coats.\u201d</p><p>Looking as if she wants to plunge her stiletto into Dee\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s forehead, Kate agrees. She brings Delores with her to gather our son and his gear. Estelle wrings her hands and weeps silently.</p><p>Frank just won\u2019t let it frigging go. \u201cWhen this blows up in your face, Matthew, don\u2019t come crying to me.\u201d</p><p>Matthew replies with a mixture of anger and hurt, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I would never f**king consider it.\u201d He glances at his mother. \u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d Then he walks out of the room and I\u2019m right behind him.</p><p>The ride home is quiet. James falls asleep before we hit the highway. My friend and his wife hold hands in the backseat, whispering apologies and reassurances to each other.</p><p>Delores cries.</p><p>I don\u2019t like it. It makes her seem so . . . human.</p><p>I offer my take on the situation. \u201cI think we can all agree that sucked sweaty balls. But Frank\u2019s not going to be a dick about it forever. He was blindsided\u2014and he\u2019s worried about you.\u201d I make eye contact with my best friend in the review mirror. \u201cRemember when you bought the Ducati?\u201d</p><p>Even though Matthew was twenty-two at the time, the way Frank blew a gasket when he saw his son\u2019s motorcycle, you would\u2019ve thought he was sixteen and taking out a Lamborghini for a joyride. The first time Matthew rode it to the office, Frank bribed the maintenance guys to remove one of the f**king tires.</p><p>Even though Frank went about it the wrong way, it stemmed from his concern for his son. Trying to protect him\u2014desperately not wanting to see him become roadkill. This situation isn\u2019t any different.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Matthew begrudgingly admits.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing. He\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s jaw clenches. \u201cWell, maybe I f**king won\u2019t. He insulted my wife. And this isn\u2019t a motorcycle, Drew. This is my kid.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, \u2019cause I knew he was going to say that. \u201cI know. But I bet once my parents and Lexi get through guilt-tripping him, he\u2019ll be kissing your ass come Monday. Frank\u2019s going to see the error of his ways and apologize. To you too, Dee. Just watch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only . . . he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Matthew and Frank didn\u2019t speak to each other for two whole weeks.</p><p>Then adoption day came.</p><p>They flew to Transylvania or one of those small Eastern Bloc countries, and they came back with a beautiful baby boy. The weird thing is, he actually looks like them\u2014bright hazel eyes and brown hair with natural-blond highlights.</p> <p>Estelle broke the standoff. She threatened to leave the stubborn bastard if he didn\u2019t tell Matthew and Dee how sorry he was\u2014how wrong he had been.</p><p>The day after they brought the baby home, they threw a small family party so everyone could meet the new addition. I watched Frank from the second he walked into Matthew\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Proud. Distant. Hard.</p><p>Until he saw his son, holding his own son.</p><p>And all of his proud ideals about how things should be just kind of melted away.</p> <p>The Discovery Channel has a show about gorillas. At first, male gorillas feel threatened by their offspring. They don\u2019t understand them, sort of ignore them, or bang their chests whenever they\u2019re around. But then, after a couple days, they get used to them. And God f**king help anyone who tries to mess with them.</p><p>It was a lot like that.</p><p>After that first visit, from the moment Frank held the baby, he decided that this was his grandson in every way. And he\u2019d happily beat the crap out of anyone who said otherwise.</p><p>It\u2019s been smooth sailing ever since.</p><p>Now, back to Matthew\u2019s groveling.</p><p>Delores comes to his rescue and kneels down in front of Mackenzie. \u201cI understand why you\u2019re upset, Mackenzie. I didn\u2019t have any girl cousins, either.\u201d</p> <p>Mackenzie throws her arms up in the air. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it! You got to pick your baby! It wasn\u2019t like with Aunt Kate and Mommy, where we just had to take what we got. Why couldn\u2019t you have picked a girl?\u201d</p><p>Dee smiles softly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pick Rain, sweetie. He picked us. And even though he didn\u2019t grow in my body, he grew in my heart. He was supposed to be our son\u2014there really was no choice.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie breathes deep. \u201cWell, the next time you decide to grow a baby, could you please tell your heart we need another girl around here?\u201d</p><p>Matthew pulls her in for a hug and squeezes her tight. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>Personally, I\u2019m relieved they got a boy. You know that saying \u201cIt takes a village to raise a child\u201d? That\u2019s all wrong. It takes a village to raise a girl. Pick a headline\u2014any headline. Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus\u2014it\u2019s not their fault they\u2019re train wrecks. It\u2019s because they didn\u2019t have people in their lives who cared enough about them to teach them. Prepare them for what is still mostly a man\u2019s world.</p><p>Boys are easy. Keep the fridge stocked, smack them around once in a while, discourage them from jumping off the roof into the swimming pool, make sure they use soap when they shower. That\u2019s pretty much it.</p><p>Girls are a whole other animal. You have to worry about low self-esteem and poor self-image, eating disorders, cutting, drug abuse, sluttiness, catty mean-girl attitudes, and the horde of adolescent bastards who are just dying to get their dicks wet and won\u2019t give a damn if they leave a broken heart, pregnancy, or an STD in their wake.</p><p>Even though Mackenzie is coming along nicely, once puberty hits, all bets are off. The fewer distractions I have when those days come, the better.</p> <p>As Matthew and Delores get up off the floor, I ask, \u201cWhere is Michael, anyway? With Helga?\u201d</p><p>Unlike Kate and me, Matthew and Dee had no issues about hiring a nanny. And Delores may be crazy, but she\u2019s not stupid\u2014no way she was gonna have some sexy, young au pair rocking her cradle. Helga\u2019s a professional Russian nanny. She\u2019s suspicious and distrustful of anyone not related to Michael\u2014and sometimes even of those who are. She bears a strong resemblance to Brutus from the Popeye cartoons. She\u2019s got a femstache and a permanent scowl, and she could probably kick my ass with one hand tied behind her back.</p><p>I like her.</p><p>Because she thinks the sun rises and sets with my nephew. She calls him her babushka, and it\u2019s easy to see that she\u2019d lie, cheat, steal, or kill for him. That makes her okay in my book.</p><p>Mackenzie giggles. \u201cUncle Drew, Rain\u2019s name isn\u2019t Michael, it\u2019s Rain.\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee\u2019s eyes turn sharp as they regard me. \u201cUncle Drew knows his name, Mackenzie. He\u2019s just being a jerk.\u201d</p><p>I stare Dee-Dee down, not giving an inch. \u201cRain isn\u2019t a name. It\u2019s a meteorological event. Every child deserves a normal name. He\u2019ll always be Michael to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m working on having his birth certificate changed. A little forgery never hurt anyone. Christ, what kind of uncle would I be if I let the kid go through life with a f**king name like Rain? As if the chips weren\u2019t already stacked against him with a crazy woman for a mother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault his mother\u2019s a wack job and his father\u2019s a victim of reverse spousal abuse.\u201d</p><p>Matthew adds his pathetic two cents: \u201cI like the name Rain.\u201d</p><p>So sad.</p><p>I sneer, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d I point to my temple. \u201cThat\u2019s the brainwashing talking. She\u2019s got you under her evil spell. You\u2019ve been twat-notized by the golden watch between Dee\u2019s legs.\u201d</p><p>If I slap him hard enough, think he\u2019ll snap out of it?</p><p>Delores doesn\u2019t take it lying down. \u201cBrainwashed? Look who\u2019s talking. James is your golden watch. I swear sometimes that\u2019s the only thing keeping Kate with you.\u201d</p><p>A few years ago that comment would have bothered me. Not anymore. \u201cPlease. We all know it\u2019s my dick that\u2019s keeping her with me. And that\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon, so I\u2019m really not worried.\u201d</p><p>Before Dee can retaliate, the front door slams open with a bang, and the blur of an eight-year-old, light-haired boy comes barreling through the living room. He gives my sister a crooked grin. \u201cHi, Mrs. R.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra smiles. \u201cHi, Johnny.\u201d Then she turns toward our parents. \u201cMom, Dad, you remember Johnny Fitzgerald from downstairs? He\u2019s kindly offered his services this weekend to help keep the little ones entertained.\u201d</p><p>Johnny Fitzgerald. Sound familiar? Think back, way back.</p><p>I\u2019ll give you a minute to flex the old memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remember the foolish, misguided preschooler who told Mackenzie that penises were better than baginas, a lifetime ago? Yep\u2014that Johnny Fitzgerald.</p><p>He lives one floor down. Ever since preschool, he and Mackenzie have been connected at the hip. His dad\u2019s an old-money ass**le\u2014his mom\u2019s a functioning alcoholic. Alexandra has him over as often as possible so he can gain exposure to a normal family unit.</p><p>Mackenzie pokes her finger at Johnny. \u201cYou can help\u2014but you have to do what I say. I\u2019m in charge.\u201d</p><p>I throw a smirk my sister\u2019s way. \u201cBoy, does that sound familiar.\u201d</p> <p>On cue, James squawks from the corner. \u201cMine! Is mine!\u201d</p><p>Alexandra lifts an eyebrow. \u201cSo does that. Must be genetic.\u201d</p><p>Then Mackenzie and Johnny\u2019s newest battle of the sexes begins. \u201cHold on a second, Kenzie,\u201d he says. \u201cI should be in charge. I\u2019m a boy and they\u2019re boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I can show them how to do things you can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>My niece\u2019s hands fall to her hips, imitating my sister\u2019s stance perfectly. Talk about genetics. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show them to throw a baseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can play cars with them.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie scoffs, \u201cSo can I.\u201d</p><p>Johnny goes in for the kill. \u201cI can show them how to pee standing up.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a heavy pause. Mackenzie frowns.</p><p>Johnny starts to think he\u2019s won. So young, so dumb.</p><p>Until Mackenzie smiles. Triumphantly. \u201cThey wear diapers\u2014they don\u2019t use the toilet yet.\u201d</p><p>Johnny lowers his head in submission. Might as well get used to it now, kid. \u201cOkay\u2014you can be in charge.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie smiles wider. Then she taps her fingers together, not unlike Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jack O\u2019Shay shows up. He\u2019s wearing a smart, light blue button-down and casual slacks. His red hair is cut short and gelled within an inch of its life. Jack\u2019s the last of my single friends. The lone wolf. A desperado. He\u2019s still living the life I always thought I\u2019d have. Spontaneous. Irresponsible. Uninhibited. He takes great pleasure in ragging on us about all the great nights\u2014and wild snatch\u2014we\u2019re missing out on.</p><p>Not going to lie; I get a kick out of his stories\u2014because I remember how much fun a random hookup can be. But I wouldn\u2019t trade places with him in a million years. The grass doesn\u2019t get any greener then Kate Brooks.</p> <p>We\u2019re all gathered in the kitchen now, where my mom and sister have laid out a continental breakfast. Jack chews on a fresh-baked croissant and chats with my mother. \u201cYou\u2019re looking lovely as always, Mrs. Evans.\u201d</p><p>She giggles like a cheerleader talking to the star quarterback. Ewww. \u201cThank you, Jack. That\u2019s sweet of you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust being honest. Now tell me\u2014how often do you get mistaken for the nanny when you\u2019re out with these little guys? \u2019Cause there\u2019s no way anyone would believe you\u2019re a grandma.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like he\u2019s coming on to my mom, but he\u2019s not. When you\u2019re a player, this is just how you talk\u2014to all women. Remember that the next time some hotshot is dazzling you with his verbal diarrhea. You\u2019re not special\u2014he doesn\u2019t mean it. It\u2019s just his nature.</p><p>My father doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate this fact, however. See how he moves closer to my mom? How he scowls in Jack\u2019s direction? \u201cDon\u2019t talk to my wife, O\u2019Shay.\u201d</p><p>Jack instantly sobers and steps back. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at her, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>My old man may be getting on in years, but he still knows he\u2019s at the top of the food chain. The last thing Jack wants is to get chewed up and spit out. He segues the conversation toward something safer.</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Evans, you\u2019re not coming with us this weekend?\u201d</p><p>My dad shakes his head, and his tone is filled with regret. And longing. \u201cNo, not this time. Though I wish I could go with you boys. So much.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s head whips around. \u201cOh, really, John?\u201d</p><p>He coughs. And clears his throat. \u201cYes . . . well . . . you know . . . for the sports betting. You know how I enjoy sports betting, Anne. And we don\u2019t have that . . . here . . . in New York.\u201d</p><p>Nice save, Pops. Nice save.</p><p>My mother nods skeptically. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>At which point the old man deflects my mother\u2019s negative attention toward a more obvious target. Which would be me, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou boys have fun this weekend, but be safe. Remember the last time we were in Vegas, Andrew? Let\u2019s not have a repeat.\u201d</p><p>When I was seventeen, my father had business in Vegas. He and my mother thought it would just be a wonderful idea to make a family trip out of it. But I was seventeen. A time in a guy\u2019s life when he doesn\u2019t even want to admit that he knows his family\u2014let alone spend time with them. So, while my parents, Alexandra, and Steven were off visiting the Hoover Dam, I was forced to occupy myself with other . . . activities.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it a thousand times, Dad\u2014I didn\u2019t know she was the ambassador\u2019s daughter.\u201d They should make them wear dog tags or tattoos on their foreheads or something. I roll my eyes and say to no one in particular, \u201cOne international incident and they never let you forget it.\u201d</p><p>Kate appears at my side. Her gorgeous face is contemplative, digesting what she has just heard. \u201cDo I want to know?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t even have to think about this one. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cGood enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Next to arrive is Erin Burrows. She\u2019s still my secretary, but in the last two years she\u2019s become much more. At times my schedule is so packed, Kate talks to Erin more than she talks to me. At other times, when clients want both members of the dynamic duo at the conference table, Erin takes over James duty. Even though she\u2019s technically an employee, Erin calls it like it is. In other words, she\u2019s a friend. One of the gang. And cool to hang out with. So when this soiree was slapped together, Kate and I couldn\u2019t imagine not inviting her to come along.</p><p>After greeting James, Erin joins the rest of us near the kitchen table. She\u2019s changed her hair. It\u2019s shorter, straight, and has tasteful honey-colored streaks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate approves. \u201cYour hair looks great, Erin.\u201d</p><p>She fingers her tresses. \u201cThanks. I had it done yesterday. I\u2019m pulling out all the stops\u2014this is my weekend to meet Mr. Right. New York men are hopelessly defective. I think Nevada will offer more suitable options.\u201d</p><p>Erin dates a lot, but as far as I know, she\u2019s never been in a serious relationship. Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly the smartest place to find a stellar boyfriend, however. Might as well try your luck at AA or Gamblers Anonymous.</p><p>Sex-addict meetings are always a safe bet.</p> <p>Steven wanders over. \u201cTake my advice, Erin\u2014stay single. Life is less complicated that way.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra flinches. Even though he\u2019s one of my oldest, dearest friends, I have the urge to reach into his mouth and rip out his tongue. That\u2019s not wrong, is it?</p><p>I let it go. For now.</p><p>Matthew offers sagely, \u201cKeep your head up, Erin\u2014it\u2019ll happen. When the time is right, when you least expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I\u2019m staying optimistic. You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince.\u201d</p> <p>Alexandra responds, \u201cThey\u2019re all frogs, Erin. Just try and find one with the least amount of warts.\u201d</p><p>I elbow Jack. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about the genital variety, you should talk to O\u2019Shay. You\u2019re kind of the in-house expert on those, right man?\u201d</p><p>He flips me the bird.</p><p>Then the last member of our traveling circus arrives. Care to hazard a guess?</p><p>\u201cYo, party people in the house! Who\u2019s ready to rock?!\u201d</p><p>Yep\u2014it\u2019s the douche bag. For Kate\u2019s sake, I try not to hate him as much as I used to\u2014but some things just can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s like when you have the tail end of a cold and one loogie hangs on to back of your throat. You cough, you hawk, but no matter what you do, you just can\u2019t f**king get rid of it.</p> <p>That\u2019s Billy Warren. My personal, annoying ball of phlegm.</p><p>Kate and Dee-Dee squeal and hug the dumbass.</p><p>He hugs them back. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you guys.\u201d</p><p>Kate says, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to fly all the way out here. You could have just met us in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the preparty? No way.\u201d</p><p>I was hoping his plane would get hijacked by bloodthirsty terrorists. The kind that like to cut off body parts and FedEx them back to the family, one by one. Oh, well. There\u2019s always the return flight. It\u2019s important to stay positive about these things.</p><p>His attention turns toward me. His eyes look me up and down stiffly. \u201cEvans.\u201d</p><p>I raise my chin. \u201cWarren.\u201d</p> <p>He turns around and zeroes in on James. Warren scoops him up and exclaims, \u201cWhat are you feeding this kid, Kate? He\u2019s so much bigger than the last time I saw him.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Shocking. \u2019Cause babies don\u2019t usually grow or anything.</p><p>Moron.</p><p>\u201cI brought you presents, tadpole. A shiny, noisy set of drums. You\u2019re gonna freak when you see it.\u201d</p><p>James giggles. To the casual observer, it might seem that my son is actually fond of the f**kface. But I know better. Animals can sense when a person\u2019s a few cards shy of a full deck. When they\u2019re on the lower end of the bell curve. Kids can do that too. James doesn\u2019t like Warren\u2014he pities him. Because he knows that, even at two years old, he\u2019s smarter than Jackass can ever hope to be.</p><p>As the small talk builds to a crescendo, Kate and I look over the seating chart one more time. I put my arm around her just because she\u2019s mine. Her eyes are soft and her voice is velvet as she sighs, \u201cSeven more days. About this time next week, I\u2019ll be putting my dress on.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s been kept confidential. Strictly off-limits. \u201cCan\u2019t I have a hint? Will there be cle**age? Is it satin? Lace?\u201d I wiggle my eyebrows. \u201cLatex?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me you didn\u2019t pick some old-fashioned, frilly getup that makes you look like a yeti.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell. But . . . feel free to try and torture the information out of me. By any means necessary.\u201d</p><p>Several ideas come to mind. Each with the potential of earning me a front-row seat in hell. Possibly a jail cell. \u201cGod, I love the way you think.\u201d</p><p>My sister\u2019s voice drags me from my sinful musings. \u201cOh\u2014I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you two\u2014we have a problem with table forty-five. A guest hasn\u2019t responded yet.\u201d</p><p>She picks up her trusty clipboard. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . Brandon Mitchell . . . Delores\u2019s stepbrother. He may or may not be bringing a plus one.\u201d</p><p>Delores\u2019s mother got married last summer to some cop from their hometown. It figures that only a man professionally trained in firearms and self-defense would be brave enough to tie the knot with Amelia Warren.</p><p>I turn on Delores. \u201cAgain with your f**king family. What is it with you people? You\u2019re like King Midas in reverse\u2014everything you touch turns to shit.\u201d</p><p>She argues, \u201cBrandon is not my family.\u201d</p><p>For once my sister and I are on the same page. She waves her finger in Dee-Dee\u2019s face. \u201cOh, yes, he is. His father married your mother\u2014that makes him yours. If we have to claim Great-Aunt Clara, you have to own up to this Mitchell clown.\u201d</p><p>Great-Aunt Clara is my grandmother\u2019s stepsister, on my mother\u2019s side. She\u2019s like a thousand years old. The kind of relative we only wheel out of the nursing home once or twice a year for big events. Clara loves to dance, and even for an ancient she can move pretty well.</p><p>The things is\u2014since she was born a century ago, when women couldn\u2019t vote or show ankle skin\u2014Clara\u2019s a big fan of women\u2019s liberation. So she refuses to wear a bra.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>And her br**sts are massively huge. Heavy\u2014like dry-cement-stuffed balloons. They should be classified as deadly weapons.</p><p>At James\u2019s christening? Clara was getting down on the dance floor to the latest Rihanna song. She lifts her arms, spins around . . . and nails my best client\u2019s teenage son in the head with her left tit.</p><p>The kid was out cold for ten minutes. Thankfully, his parents chose not to sue.</p><p>Kate steps between us, hands up, into the line of fire. \u201cOkay, everyone, let\u2019s just all take a step back. Dee, call your mom and have her lean on Brandon.\u201d</p><p>Delores does as she\u2019s told. But I go on, \u201cYeah\u2014lean on him hard. Or he\u2019ll be eating dinner in the parking lot with the valets.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s hand snakes around my back, tracing soothing lines under my T-shirt. \u201cRelax, Drew. It\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her touch is soft\u2014skin on skin. It feels like a double dose of Valium: instantly calming. My voice holds considerably less heat as I tell her, \u201cThis day is going to be goddamn magical. No way I\u2019m letting an honorary Warren mess with it\u2014even if it\u2019s just the seating arrangement.\u201d</p><p>She turns into me, and her arms climb up around my neck. \u201cAre you going to show up at the church?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head back so I can look in her eyes. \u201cWild lions couldn\u2019t keep me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . at some point . . . will we become husband and wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>She reaches up on her toes and brushes her lips with mine. Once. Twice. \u201cThen it\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee closes her cell and announces, \u201cMy mother says Brandon\u2019s coming, but he\u2019s not bringing a date.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra amends her list and removes the question-mark chair from the model. Then she beams. \u201cThere. Crisis averted. I just need to adjust the number of favors and we\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cOh, I almost forgot!\u201d She rummages around in her shiny metallic shoulder bag, then raises her arms in victory. \u201cParty favors!\u201d</p> <p>Fisted in Delores\u2019s hands are a dozen lollipops. Each about ten inches long.</p><p>In the shape of a dick.</p><p>She hands a few to my mother. \u201cHere you go, Anne. Just because you\u2019re not partaking in the festivities doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy a treat.\u201d Then she adds with a wink, \u201cVanilla and chocolate. Yum.\u201d</p><p>My mother turns the confection around with a mischievous smile and playful glint in her eyes. Then she puts it on the counter. \u201cThank you, Dee-Dee. I\u2019ll save these for after dinner.\u201d</p><p>My father grins. Broadly.</p><p>Great. Now I\u2019m stuck with the image of my sweet, saintly mother sucking down a cock-pop while my old man watches. There\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ll never get a boner again.</p> <p>Fucking Delores.</p><p>Okay, the boner thing is an exaggeration, but still\u2014do you see why I can\u2019t stand her? Her and her whole demon family tree. My best friend couldn\u2019t marry a normal girl, could he? No\u2014he had to fall for the Bride of Chucky incarnate.</p><p>The phone rings. It\u2019s the doorman letting us know the limo\u2019s here. Everyone files out the door as my parents spread around the hugs and well-wishing.</p><p>I snatch James back from Warren for a final farewell.</p><p>We\u2019re lucky\u2014James is not one of those clingy, whiny little bastards who lose their mind when Mommy walks out the door. Even so\u2014good-byes are never fun.</p><p>Kate kisses his cheek and pushes his hair back from his eyes. \u201cWe love you, baby. We\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>I kiss his head. Then I ask the stupidest question ever. \u201cAre you gonna be good for Grandma and Pop?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me sideways. And grins. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>I shrug toward Kate. \u201cWell, at least he\u2019s honest.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I\u2019m not a big fan of air travel. For several reasons. First, there\u2019s the pilot. You can never be sure he knows what the hell he\u2019s doing. Maybe he got his license from a Cracker Jack box. Maybe his daddy made a generous donation to his flight school.</p><p>If I want to put my life in jeopardy? I\u2019ll ask my sister if she\u2019s gained weight.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the charade of it. No matter how many people those security agents feel up, no matter how many bags those former McDonald\u2019s employees search? If somebody really wants to do some damage? Eventually, he will. The airlines should be up-front about it. Like those SWIM AT YOUR OWN RISK signs at the beach. When the desk agent hands you the boarding pass, he or she should say, \u201cHold on, pray your ass doesn\u2019t get blown up, have a nice flight.\u201d</p><p>Would that really be so bad?</p><p>Finally, there\u2019s the doom-and-gloom certainty that if something\u2014even accidentally\u2014does go wrong? You\u2019re toast. I know what the statistics say\u2014that you\u2019re more likely to get into a car accident, blah, blah \u0327 blah. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014lots of people who\u2019ve had auto collisions have walked away without a scratch. Now tell me how many people you know who\u2019ve gotten out of a plane wreck unscathed?</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Still\u2014I don\u2019t let those worries interfere with my life. They don\u2019t get in the way. At all. Because fear doesn\u2019t make a coward\u2014actions do. I\u2019m a lot of things, but a chickenshit isn\u2019t one of them. And I have to admit, even though it\u2019s not my favorite thing to do, there used to be benefits to flying.</p><p>Meaning the veritable smorgasbord of available women that can be found in airports and planes. There\u2019s the oh-so-lonely housewife, the overworked businesswoman, the carefree graduate student looking to let loose . . . the flight attendant.</p><p>In recent years, quality control on that last one has gone majorly downhill. Once upon a time, sex appeal was in the job description. That\u2019s no longer the case. But I find the airlines tend to schedule at least one screwable female on every flight. Back in my free-man days, they were the easiest pickings. Always so eager to be of service.</p><p>One time, on a business trip to Singapore, three stunning flight attendants were ready, willing, and able to show me the all sights worth seeing\u2014inside their hotel room. We had quite the layover. That\u2019s what I call some friendly skies.</p><p>Speaking of which, one\u2019s headed our way now. She\u2019s attractive\u2014slim, tall, long dark hair pulled back at the sides, and deep blue eyes with an exotic slant. Her hands are manicured\u2014delicate\u2014the perfect size for a decent jerking-off.</p><p>Yes\u2014guys notice things like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, you\u2019ll have to keep your seat belt buckled until the captain turns the sign off.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the belt in question, then back up. \u201cRight. \u2019Cause if we nose-dive from twenty thousand feet, this little piece of fabric is gonna stand between me and certain death?\u201d</p><p>Like I said\u2014hypocrites.</p><p>She laughs. And the yellow seat-belt sign goes out with a ding.</p><p>I grin. \u201cGuess he heard me.\u201d</p><p>Full, pink lips smile. \u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>Blue eyes glance around the first-class cabin. \u201cA little birdie told me you\u2019re all headed to Vegas for a prewedding party\u2014and you\u2019re the groom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I am.\u201d</p><p>She hands me a mimosa. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She hands Kate a glass as well, then her attention reverts back to me. \u201cSo . . . where are you staying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a sip of the orange concoction. \u201cThe Bellagio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d She leans over a little\u2014close enough that I can smell her cheap, too-sweet perfume\u2014and drops the bomb. \u201cI\u2019m off the clock once we land in Nevada. I\u2019m staying with friends. . . . Maybe we\u2019ll stop by the Bellagio casino tonight? You look like you\u2019d be in the high rollers\u2019 section?\u201d</p><p>My friends and I aren\u2019t flashy about our money\u2014most people who have it aren\u2019t. But the signs are there if you know what you\u2019re looking for\u2014quality luggage, Rolex watches, classic but expensive brand clothing.</p><p>And yes\u2014this chick just stepped over the line. Her words sounded like a proposition, because they were. Which is pretty f**king disrespectful, considering my fianc\u00e9e is within earshot.</p> <p>But I\u2019m not surprised. Even though men are supposed to be the bold pursuers? Women can be so much worse. They\u2019re brazen. Shameless. They\u2019ll stab each other in the back faster than Jason freaking Voorhees.</p><p>Just ask Steven. When he and Alexandra were dating? Practically every one of her so-called friends offered to climb on his face and take it for a test ride. Because they were petty. Jealous. Because they wanted what Alexandra had.</p><p>Some guys, such as Jack, would welcome crap like this with open arms, always wanting to keep their options open. But not me\u2014not anymore. I play it gracious but firm. Reverently, I pick up Kate\u2019s hand and kiss her knuckles, making sure the ring is in sight. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty busy tonight. Thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>She backs off with an offended shrug. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not the first time this has happened, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. Kate handles it well, even though deep down I know it bugs the shit out of her.</p> <p>I\u2019m not above using that to my advantage, of course. See that devil on my shoulder? Yeah\u2014he\u2019s ready to get busy. Watch.</p><p>I lean toward Kate. \u201cSo . . . you\u2019re just going to let her get away with that?\u201d</p><p>She continues to stare at her magazine, turning the pages harshly. \u201cGet away with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith that Hail Mary pass she just threw. Trying to eat off your plate. If a guy came on to you like that in front of me? He\u2019d be eating sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a teenager, Drew. My days of fighting over a boy are over.\u201d</p><p>What I wouldn\u2019t give to have seen those days. With Jell-O on top.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you should yank her hair out or rip each other\u2019s clothes off\u201d\u2014I chuckle\u2014\u201cthough that would be awesome. I just think you should teach her a lesson. Show her who I belong to.\u201d</p><p>Kate closes the magazine, shaking her head slightly. Her eyes are shiny with amusement. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to get me to have sex with you in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Busted. \u201cA b**w j*b will work too. You\u2019re really good at those.\u201d</p><p>She reopens the magazine. \u201cFlattery will get you nowhere, Evans. Least of all into my pants.\u201d</p><p>I whine, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause all of our friends are here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll hear us.\u201d</p><p>I lie, \u201cNo, they won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stuff your panties in your mouth\u2014they won\u2019t hear a thing.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. And stays strong. \u201cSounds romantic. Still . . . not happening.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so happening. But I admit\u2014this banter? The sexual tension? Having to work for it once in a while? It\u2019s still fun. Exciting. It keeps my skills razor sharp.</p><p>Knowing I\u2019ll eventually get my way? That helps too.</p><p>I try a different tactic. Guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition, Kate. Like tapping the mascot symbol when you exit the locker room before a football game. It\u2019s bad luck to break tradition\u2014something terrible could happen. How will you feel if this plane crashes and burns, all because you didn\u2019t want to give it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>I look forward and sigh. This is a five-hour flight. There\u2019s no way Kate can hold out that long. Because, when you know how to strum a guitar the right way? That sucker plays.</p><p>I give it a few minutes, until her guard is down. Then I turn sideways in my seat. And start off slow. Subtle. One hand on her thigh, drawing leisurely circles. Eventually my other hand joins in, stroking her arm, then her shoulder\u2014relaxing her. Overwhelming her senses.</p><p>Notice, she\u2019s not pushing me away. Because even though one set of lips is saying no? The other set is always up for a good time.</p><p>I lean over and my mouth lightly caresses her cheek, moving gently across her jawline to her neck. My hand creeps down and covers one breast\u2014squeezing and rubbing. Sliding and teasing.</p><p>Kate\u2019s breathing picks up. The magazine falls from her hands. She half warns, \u201cDrew . . .\u201d</p><p>I whisper in her ear, \u201cJust kiss me. That\u2019s all I want, baby. Just one kiss.\u201d</p><p>These are the famous last words spoken by teenage boys everywhere, in the backseat of their parents\u2019 car. If there are any young females out there? Be warned\u2014it\u2019s never just one kiss. They don\u2019t call it stealing bases for nothing. Before you know it, he\u2019ll be rounding second, sliding into third, and a home run is just inches away.</p><p>Kate presses her mouth to mine\u2014lets me seduce her with my tongue. So warm. So wet.</p><p>So nice.</p><p>Hot, hard, real desire uncoils low in my gut, and my pants tighten predictably. I turn my attention to her earlobe\u2014sucking and biting. Then I whisper tender, dirty, need-filled words that you don\u2019t get to hear. About how much I want her, how beautiful she is, about all the things I want to do to her, and the detailed positions I want to do them in.</p><p>Kate\u2019s h*ps move upward, searching for friction against the fingers that are now firmly stationed between her legs. When she\u2019s primed and panting\u2014right where I want her\u2014I retract my hands. And look into her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this in the other room.\u201d</p><p>Kate bites her bottom lip. Her slightly dazed eyes dart left to right, making sure there are no witnesses. She\u2019s just about to cave . . .</p><p>Until a foreign body plops down between us\u2014half on both our laps. My eyes are covered with strawberry-blond hair. And the taste of hair spray fills my mouth.</p><p>God damn it.</p><p>\u201cHope you got a good night\u2019s sleep last night, Katie. For what I have planned, you\u2019re going to need lots of energy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Delores. As if there were any doubt.</p><p>She wiggles her ass off my thigh, forcing Kate and me to move over so she can squeeze in between us.</p><p>Kate recovers quickly. \u201cYep . . . um . . . you know me. I\u2019m all about being well rested.\u201d</p><p>My body crackles with unspent carnal energy. It makes me cranky. \u201cDo you frigging mind? We were in the middle of something.\u201d</p> <p>Dee-Dee turns toward me with knowing disdain clear on her face. \u201cNope, don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d She shoos me away with her hand. \u201cYou can amscray\u2014Kate and I have some catching up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello? This is a bachelorette party\u2014and it starts now. You\u2019re not invited. Go compare peckers with the boys, talk about the massive dump you took last night\u2014or whatever it is you do when we\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>I grind my teeth. Clench my jaw. To keep from calling her the crusty crotch crack she\u2019s acting like. Too much? My bad. Blame the good Dr. Seuss\u2014we\u2019ve been reading him a lot in my house.</p><p>I take a deep breath. Then I close my eyes and tilt my head back. I\u2019ll wait Dolores out. She\u2019ll have to leave at some point. Or I can use the cum-stained complimentary pillow to smother her.</p> <p>The thought makes me smile.</p><p>Dee-Dee and Kate talk. And talk. After a few minutes, the sounds blend together in my male ears like those of Charlie Brown\u2019s faceless teacher. \u201c . . . wa wa wah wah wanh . . . Matthew\u2019s birthday present . . . wa wa wanh . . . wasn\u2019t sure . . . wah wah wa wa . . . came through last minute . . . wa wa wah wanh . . . see his face . . . wa wa wah . . . so surprised . . . wa wanh . . .\u201d</p><p>Gifts are important to women. But what I\u2019ve come to realize is\u2014at least for some of them\u2014it\u2019s not the actual gift that matters. Or even how much cash you shelled out for it. It\u2019s all about the effort. Symbolism. How much thought you put into getting it for them.</p><p>For instance, if I were to hunt down a napkin from the bar where Kate and I first met? Then, if I had it matted and framed and gave it to her as an anniversary present? I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d f**k me into a coma to show her gratitude.</p><p>It\u2019s still just a napkin. But to Kate\u2014it means so much more.</p><p>Last year for my birthday, she got my initials waxed into her bush. I was touched. Talk about a great gift\u2014creative and practical. Anyway, with mild curiosity I open my eyes and ask Delores, \u201cWhat are you giving him?\u201d</p> <p>She grins smugly. \u201cOnly the greatest gift a woman can give the man she loves.\u201d</p><p>I take my best guess. \u201cAnal?\u201d</p><p>Kate covers her eyes.</p><p>Dee-Dee\u2019s smile turns into a scowl. \u201cNo\u2014pig. I\u2019m giving him the gift of health. My acupuncturist cleared her schedule. She\u2019s going to work on Matthew the whole day.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. Because this explains so much.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your gift? Really? It\u2019s the guy\u2019s birthday and you\u2019re gonna make him get needles stuck in his face all day? What are you gonna get him for Christmas\u2014a colonoscopy?\u201d</p><p>Kate clarifies, \u201cDrew, the acupuncture is to get Matthew to stop smoking.\u201d</p><p>Yep, Matthew\u2019s a smoker. Statistically, if you don\u2019t start by the age of eighteen, you never will. But my buddy\u2019s the exception to this rule. His habit began in college\u2014during a particularly stressful game of Madden NFL football.</p> <p>Matthew\u2019s kept it in the closet, however. His parents don\u2019t know. Because Frank sucks back two packs a day\u2014and like any smoker, he\u2019d break every one of his kid\u2019s fingers if he found out he was doing it too.</p><p>I put my hands up in surrender. \u201cI take it back, Dee\u2014it\u2019s a stupendous gift. Anything to help Matthew kick the cancer sticks is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>She practically pats herself on the back. \u201cThank you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now that we\u2019ve gotten that settled, could you please\u2014and I mean this in the nicest way possible\u2014go the f**k away?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not smiling anymore. \u201cNo. I told you\u2014this is my time. My Kate time.\u201d</p><p>Fast Times at Ridgemont High appears in my head. \u201cWhatever, Mr. Hand.\u201d</p><p>Kate reaches over and touches my leg. \u201cDrew, maybe you should just go hang out with the guys for the rest of the flight.\u201d</p><p>I stamp my foot. And point at Dee-Dee. \u201cHow come she gets Kate time? Where\u2019s my Kate time? I want Kate time too!\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee answers, \u201cYou\u2019ll be getting a whole bunch of Kate time next week. It\u2019s called a honeymoon, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>I glare at her. \u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>She rubs a finger over her lips lasciviously. \u201cThat I do. Frequently. Matthew doesn\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>I grimace. \u201cNow I\u2019m nauseous. Kate, will you rub my stomach?\u201d</p><p>Kate smiles. Her voice takes on that motherly, condescending tone she gets when she\u2019s asking James to behave. \u201cYes, Drew\u2014I\u2019ll rub your stomach, and any other body part you want me to . . . when we get to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and resign myself to not getting laid. Just as I start to sink into a deep depression, Jack\u2019s voice echoes throughout the cabin.</p><p>\u201cDude! Check it out! I\u2019ve got p**n on my in-flight entertainment system!\u201d</p><p>Someone yelling \u201cporn\u201d in an enclosed space is akin to an alarm\u2019s going off in a firehouse at midnight. Four pairs of feet scramble in Jack\u2019s direction, including mine. Maybe guy time won\u2019t be so bad, after all.</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. Stop wasting my time. Can we skip the bullshit and get to the good stuff already?</p><p>I\u2019m working on it.</p><p>Besides, I think you should enjoy the good times while they last. I did. I have a feeling things are going to get real crazy\u2014real quick\u2014from here on out. \u2019Cause our next stop? That\u2019s Vegas, baby. And there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called Sin City.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>When it comes to swanky hotel rooms, you might think the penthouse is top-of-the-line. In most cases, you\u2019d be right. But the Bellagio has something better. The villa. It\u2019s the kind of place only royalty, heads of state, and highly overrated actors get to stay. Five bedrooms, formal dining room, office, library, and a huge kitchen\u2014all trimmed in elegant woods and marbles\u2014decked out with the finest appliances, accessories, and Italian fabrics. It even comes with a full-service maid and butler staff.</p><p>Money can\u2019t buy happiness\u2014but it makes it a hell of a lot easier to stay happy.</p><p>Since we\u2019re the guests of honor, Kate and I get the master suite. Our adjoining bathroom has a steam shower and huge Jacuzzi that I definitely plan on putting to good use later. Steven and Alexandra, Delores and Matthew, each pair gets a room too\u2014complete with fireplace and king-size bed. Erin claims a slightly smaller room with a queen, while Jack and Warren bunk together in the last room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a good thing their room has two double beds, because if there\u2019s one thing a guy will never do, it\u2019s share a bed with another dude.

Totally acceptable, when faced with the risk of waking up to a loaded rifle in your back.</p><p>After the butler\u2014we\u2019ll call him Mr. Belvedere\u2014gives us the grand tour and the maids take our luggage to unpack, the nine of us relax in the living room, talking about the agenda for the day.</p><p>Sitting on the dark brown love seat, with Delores on his lap, Matthew goes first. \u201cThere\u2019s a water-volleyball tournament down at the pool in twenty minutes. I figured we\u2019d start there\u2014get our burn on. And they\u2019re having a pig-roast barbecue\u2014you know how I love a good swine.\u201d</p><p>All the guys nod their consent.</p> <p>Dee-Dee begins, \u201cOur goddess party starts at five. . . .\u201d</p><p>Goddess parties . . . for guys they\u2019re a dream\u2014mythical. Like the fabled pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, or the topless pillow fight at a sleepover. It\u2019s pretty much a female-only sex party, minus the actual sex. Legend has it there\u2019s a wide array of toys for sale\u2014dildos, vibrators, bondage gear, and lingerie. And there are lessons\u2014women are instructed on all kinds of acquired skills, such as deep throat, mast***ation, pole dancing.</p><p>\u201c. . . but before that, we ladies have appointments at the spa, to get beautified for tonight.\u201d</p><p>I run my hand through Kate\u2019s dark hair as she sits beside me on the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou can\u2019t improve perfection.\u201d</p><p>She blushes slightly. Still so f**king adorable.</p> <p>Dee-Dee counters, \u201cYou say that now\u2014but wait until you see us after. We\u2019re gonna get wrapped, waxed, plucked, and massaged. I swear, Kate\u2014after Ricardo works you over? You\u2019ll never be the same. It\u2019s like being touched by an orgasm.\u201d</p><p>My curiosity gets the best of me. \u201cWho\u2019s Ricardo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate\u2019s massage therapist.\u201d</p><p>Huh. \u201cRicardo\u2019s a weird name for a woman.\u201d</p><p>Delores rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, yeah, it would be\u2014but Ricardo\u2019s all man. He\u2019s got the body of a Greek god, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his steroid days. And he knows how to use it\u2014especially his hands.\u201d</p><p>Some guys would be okay with this situation. Men who are laid-back like Matthew or understanding like Steven. They\u2019d kiss their lady on the cheek and say, \u201cHave a good time, honey.\u201d But\u2014despite my emotional growth these last years\u2014that\u2019s just not how I roll.</p> <p>So what I say is \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not f**king happening.\u201d</p><p>Kate puts her hand on my leg. \u201cDrew, it\u2019s just a massage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. Two words\u2014happy ending. Two more words\u2014no way.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra tries to be helpful. \u201cRelax, little brother. There\u2019s no reason to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>I open my arms wide. \u201cWho\u2019s jealous? I\u2019m not jealous\u2014\u2019cause it\u2019s not f**king happening.\u201d I turn to Kate and explain calmly, \u201cYou really think I\u2019m gonna be able to just sit here knowing you\u2019re out there\u2014with your goodies covered only by a thin cotton towel\u2014while Ricardo-frigging-Montalb\u00e1n has his hands all over you? Making you moan? Screw that. All your moans belong to me\u2014they\u2019re paid in full with that rock on your finger.\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee holds her hand out to Matthew. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Pay up.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his wallet out and slaps a twenty in her palm. I shake my head in disappointment at him. \u201cYou thought I\u2019d be okay with this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs.</p> <p>My eyes narrow. \u201cI don\u2019t even know you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicardo\u2019s awesome, man. His hands are magic. If I was g*y, I would totally enter into a civil union with him.\u201d</p><p>From the recliner, Steven joins the discussion. \u201cYou let a dude give you a rubdown? Have you considered the possibility that you\u2019re already g*y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow me.\u201d</p><p>Steven laughs. \u201cSee, that\u2019s what I mean. These subliminal messages are tickling my g*ydar.\u201d He holds his finger out, pointing to each guy in the room. \u201cBeep. Beep. Beep . . .\u201d Then he points at Matthew. \u201cBeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.\u201d</p><p>Billy and Jack crack up, and Steven gives them a high five. Matthew makes the jerk-off sign with his hand. Which doesn\u2019t help his case much.</p><p>Kate brings us back on topic. \u201cThis is really a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019ll taint my memory of the entire weekend.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. And turns toward Delores. \u201cSwitch my appointment.\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee looks appalled. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious?\u201d She throws her hands up in the air. \u201cAnd so it begins. You\u2019re not even married yet, and he\u2019s already controlling you\u2014dictating what you can and can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>I jump to Kate\u2019s defense. \u201cShe\u2019s respecting my goddamn feelings. That\u2019s how a mature, healthy relationship works. You should try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely considerate of Matthew\u2019s feelings!\u201d</p><p>Kate jumps in. \u201cDee, we\u2019re here to have fun, not torture my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee pouts. \u201cBut torturing him is my idea of fun. Party pooper.\u201d Still, she grabs the phone and calls the spa.</p><p>Kate nestles into my side, resting her head on my shoulder. I pull her closer and kiss the top her head. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cWhen you get back from your primping, I want some of that Kate time you owe me.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her head and whispers, \u201cDoes this, by chance, involve finishing what we started on the plane?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cIt does\u2014and I guarantee it will be a spectacular finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always is.\u201d She leans forward, kissing me playfully, her tongue grazing and teasing.</p><p>When she pulls back, I lick my bottom lip, savoring the taste of her. \u201cBet your ass it is.\u201d</p><p>Warren interrupts our flirtatious moment. \u201cSo, before we split up, does anybody wanna like . . . get high?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not a big fan of drugs, even the recreational kind. With alcohol, you can pace yourself\u2014have a drink or two, then slow down and enjoy the buzz. Or you can go full throttle and down five quick shots. In either case, there\u2019s control over how shitfaced you want to be.</p><p>But drugs are like a train without a conductor. Once you\u2019re on, you\u2019re going for a ride\u2014no slowing down, no getting off if you change your mind. Dee-Dee doesn\u2019t share my sentiments. No surprise there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sits next to her cousin on arm of the couch. \u201cThank God\u2014I thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>Warren reaches into his pocket and pulls out a clear baggie that contains a few prerolled joints, some loose marijuana, and a small, brightly colored bowl pipe.</p><p>Erin asks, \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought it from New York.\u201d His brow furrows as he clarifies, \u201cWell, technically, I brought it from California to New York, and then here. It\u2019s good shit\u2014high-level medical grade. The janitor at my music studio has glaucoma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how did you get it past airport security?\u201d my sister questions.</p><p>Warren explains proudly, \u201cI keep it in my boxer briefs. That way, if I get picked for one of those scanner things, it just looks like the downstairs dreadlocks need a trim.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cNow there\u2019s a backup plan. If the music career tanks, you can always become a drug mule.\u201d Drug smugglers have an extremely high rate of early, violent death. Awesome.</p><p>Warren passes Dee-Dee a joint and she lights up. Matthew makes his way over. \u201cI could go for a hit of herb.\u201d</p><p>Erin is hesitant. \u201cI\u2019ve never smoked marijuana before.\u201d</p> <p>Warren tries to be reassuring. \u201cThen you\u2019ve come to the right place. We\u2019re all friends in the dope show.\u201d</p><p>She still looks nervous, so I tell her, \u201cJust say no, Erin. Only losers get high.\u201d I point my thumb at Warren. \u201cYou really want to end up like Exhibit A over there?\u201d</p><p>Delores holds her hands up like claws. \u201cPeer pressure! Come on, Erin\u2014you have to try it at least once. Live a little, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be Exhibit B.\u201d</p><p>Erin takes a big breath and looks at me with wide, approval-seeking eyes. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna try it. I mean . . . sometimes you just have to say, \u2018What the f**k?\u2019 . . . right, Drew?\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t argue with a Risky Business quote. I shrug my shoulders in surrender, and Erin joins the rest of the stoners.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s not interested. \u201cNo thanks, man. I\u2019m all about keeping the toxins out of my system these days.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra declines as well, with a wave of her hand. Steven, however, says, \u201cSure, why not? I\u2019ll relive my misspent youth.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra snaps, \u201cWhat do you mean relive? You\u2019re a man\u2014you\u2019re still living your misspent youth.\u201d</p><p>My brother-in-law holds out his hand to Warren. \u201cMake mine a double.\u201d</p><p>Warren passes Steven a full bowl and a lighter, while Matthew offers Kate the joint. She shakes her head. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>I walk across the room, open a window, and turn on the ceiling fan.</p><p>Warren asks, \u201cWhat about you, Evans? You down?\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cLike I\u2019d ever put something in my mouth that hitched a ride next to your sweaty balls. I\u2019d rather kiss a jungle elephant\u2019s ass.\u201d</p> <p>Warren takes a long drag, and puffs of smoke escape his lips as he mocks me. \u201cNarc.\u201d</p><p>I deadpan, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. On my off days I hang out with Johnny Depp down at 21 Jump Street.\u201d</p><p>Already feeling the effects of the high, Matthew giggles. And announces to the whole room, \u201cNah, Andrew\u2019s cool. But him and Mary Jane don\u2019t get along. He tried her once in college. It didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>Kate leans forward. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly one of my finer moments.\u201d</p><p>Matthew laughs louder. \u201cHe took four hits, then started running around the house locking all the doors and windows. He thought his old man was gonna show up, or the SWAT team was gonna drop out of the sky. Then he had a panic attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not have a frigging panic attack.\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s eyes meet mine. \u201cDude, I thought I was gonna have to haul your ass to the emergency room. You looked like you were going into cardiac f**king arrest.\u201d</p><p>Everyone has a good chuckle at my expense\u2014even Kate.</p><p>Warren nods his head happily. \u201cEvans can\u2019t handle the weed. Good to know. Now, if I ever want to mess with you, I know just how to do it.\u201d</p><p>Friends are supposed to rag on each other. It\u2019s one of the benefits of knowing everything about a person\u2014all their accomplishments, all their embarrassing, dirty little secrets.</p><p>But that\u2019s a hammer that swings both ways.</p><p>\u201cKeep on walking down memory lane, Matthew. There\u2019s a few potholes I could dig up on you too.\u201d</p><p>He spreads his arms wide. \u201cI\u2019m an open book.\u201d</p><p>I smile devilishly. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it, chump.\u201d</p><p>I turn toward his wife. \u201cHey, Dee, Matthew ever tell you about the time he was so trashed, he pissed in Kelly Macallister\u2019s mouth while she was giving him a blow job?\u201d</p><p>Matthew sobers immediately.</p><p>Steven doubles over laughing.</p><p>\u201cEwwww,\u201d Erin squeals. \u201cThat\u2019s so gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how he got his nickname in our fraternity\u2014Golden Shower Fisher.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra looks both sickened and amused.</p><p>Jack snorts, \u201cNasty.\u201d</p><p>Kate grimaces and covers her ears.</p><p>Delores laughs at first, then turns to her husband and confesses, \u201cI\u2019m ruined. I\u2019ll never be able to suck you off again without thinking of that story.\u201d</p><p>Matthew glares at me good-naturedly, \u201cYou\u2019re a dickwad, man.\u201d</p><p>I just grin. \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Erin lies feet up in the recliner with heavy-lidded eyes. She raises one arm slowly, then the other. \u201cThis is great. I\u2019m so relaxed.\u201d</p><p>Steven\u2019s face is slack as he motions toward the shiny grand piano in the corner. \u201cHey, Billy, why don\u2019t you play something?\u201d</p><p>Yes, asswipe can also play the piano. Just keep in mind\u2014he may be a multifaceted tool, but he\u2019s still a f**king tool.</p><p>Dee pipes up, \u201cGood idea. Nothing goes better with a quality high than some smooth tunes. Make it mellow, cuz.\u201d</p><p>Shit-for-brains gets up, settles himself on the piano bench, cracks his knuckles, and starts to play. After a few bars of instrumental, he starts to sing \u201cSomeone Like You\u201d by Adele. It figures he\u2019d choose a chick song.</p><p>As he croons the last line before the chorus\u2014the one about things not being over between him and his former love, my good mood sours like milk left out of the fridge too long. This is why I always have, do now, and will forever hate Warren\u2019s guts. Because, despite Matthew\u2019s story about my experience with marijuana, I\u2019m not a paranoid guy. I\u2019m observant. Intelligent. Goddamn smart enough to know why\u2014out of all the motherfucking songs he could have played\u2014he picked this one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And more important\u2014I know whom he\u2019s playing it for.</p><p>There are no accidents. Body language and Freudian slips have meaning. They\u2019re our subconscious\u2019s way of showing how we really feel. What we really want. And somewhere, deep down in Warren\u2019s puny brain and inadequate heart\u2014I think he still wants Kate.</p><p>Look at her face now. It\u2019s the same look she always gets when she watches him sing. Her head\u2019s tilted slightly, a small smile sits on her lips, and her eyes swim with a mixture of pride and wonderment. Admiration. And possibly, remembered affection. Even though I know she doesn\u2019t have those feelings for him anymore, even though I know she chose me\u2014she loves me more\u2014it pisses me off. Badly.</p><p>Because the only person I\u2019ve ever looked at like that\u2014in my entire life\u2014is her.</p> <p>As he plays the final note, I swallow my resentment down. Matthew, Steven, Erin, Dee-Dee, and Kate clap. Alexandra actually wipes a tear from her eye.</p><p>Jack says, \u201cDamn you\u2019re good. That music shit must make you a righteous pu**y hound. Tonight, Billy, you\u2019re my wingman.\u201d</p><p>Warren nods shyly. \u201cSure, man.\u201d</p><p>Then I stand up. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve gotten my dose of estrogen for the day, how about we head to the pool and check out that barbecue? I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m more than ready for the first of many rounds.\u201d</p><p>Everyone agrees.</p> <p>I keep Kate close to me as we all head to our respective rooms for a quick clothing change. And prepare to go our separate ways.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The barbecue at the adults-only pool is in full swing. There\u2019s music, sunshine, bikinis as far as the eye can see\u2014and some I wish I didn\u2019t have to. Remember, ladies, two-piece bathing suits are a privilege, not a right.</p><p>We rent an enclosed cabana near the bar and settle down at the circular, umbrella-covered table in front of it. Our round of beers arrives and we hang out waiting for our turn in the volleyball tournament. For men, team sports have the power to inspire a warlike, us-against-them mentality. It\u2019s like spending the night in a foxhole\u2014an instant bonding experience. Even if you don\u2019t like each other\u2014hell, even if you can\u2019t stand each other\u2014you close ranks, pick up the slack where you have to. Because you\u2019re in the same platoon \u0327 and anyone who\u2019s not with you is against you. They\u2019re the enemy.</p><p>Why am I telling you this? You\u2019ll understand shortly.</p><p>For now, I take a sip of my beer and focus on my sullen-faced brother-in-law. I get right to the point: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and my sister?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not surprised by the question. But he\u2019s reluctant. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about it? What? Did you grow a vagina on the walk over? I suppose next you\u2019ll tell me you\u2019re fine? Don\u2019t be a bitch, Steven\u2014talk. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand down his face and stares at the pool for a minute. Deliberating. Then he turns toward us and leans forward, elbows on the table. \u201cAll right. It started about two weeks ago. For a couple days, Alexandra had been in a rotten mood. But I wasn\u2019t worried\u2014she just gets like that sometimes. And then I found something in the bathroom trash can . . . a pregnancy test.\u201d</p><p>Sympathetic groans roll across the table like the wave at a football game. \u201cShe\u2019s never gonna let you out of the house again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta space the kids out, Steven. If you have them too close together, one is bound to fall through the cracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s gonna be three against two\u2014you\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>Steven holds up his hand. \u201cIt was negative. Alexandra\u2019s not pregnant.\u201d He takes a swig from his beer. \u201cBut when I asked her about it, she went ballistic. Yelling at me about how I don\u2019t understand her\u2014how I shouldn\u2019t worry about kids because I can have them until I\u2019m seventy. And how men pretty much suck in general. Ever since then, she\u2019s been unbearable. It\u2019s like she\u2019s just looking for any excuse to be pissed off at me.\u201d</p><p>Matthew advises, \u201cMaybe she needs a break. You know\u2014a night out to feel more like a woman and less like a mom?\u201d</p> <p>Steven shakes his head. \u201cAlready thought of that. I set up an overnight in the Hamptons\u2014had my dad lined up to take the kids and everything. She shot me down\u2014wanted no part of it. Then she bitched me out for making plans without consulting her.\u201d</p><p>Jack snorts, \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. No offense, dude, but Alexandra\u2019s always been a cold fish.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t take exception to his comment because I can see why he\u2019d think like that.</p><p>Steven\u2019s voice takes on a soft, sad tone. Wistful. \u201cBut she\u2019s not, though. That\u2019s just a front she puts up. The real Alexandra is warm . . . and funny . . . and she\u2019d go to ends of the earth for the people she loves. Up until two weeks ago, that included me. But lately . . . it doesn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>I pinch the bridge of my nose and sigh. \u201cYou gotta fix this, Steven. You can\u2019t do this to me\u2014not now.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t take it well. \u201cYou? What the hell does this have to do with you, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I point my finger at him accusingly. \u201cYou and Alexandra are my gold standard. You\u2019re the only reason I\u2019m not shitting my pants about marrying Kate next week. Because you\u2019re my proof that marriage can actually work.\u201d</p><p>Steven\u2019s brow wrinkles. \u201cYour parents have been married for forty years.\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand. \u201cThey don\u2019t count. They\u2019re old\u2014no one else will have them.\u201d</p><p>Matthew asks, \u201cWhat about me and Dee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you another year\u2014tops.\u201d</p><p>Matthew just shrugs. Because he doesn\u2019t give a damn what other people think\u2014even me.</p><p>Now, Alexandra may be my sister\u2014but Steven is more than a brother-in-law. He\u2019s a friend\u2014one of my best. Which makes placing loyalties a sticky situation. So if I have to take sides? I\u2019m going with Mackenzie and Thomas. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no frigging way I\u2019m letting my niece and nephew grow up in a broken home. You gotta talk to her, Steven\u2014work it out.\u201d</p><p>He pushes his chair back\u2014frustrated. \u201cI\u2019ve tried! Don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve tried? I\u2019ve kissed her ass for the last two weeks. . . .\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and hold up my hand. \u201cPlease\u2014easy on the mental pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything I can think of . . . but I\u2019m not gonna try anymore. If she wants to work it out, when she wants to talk\u2014she\u2019s gonna have to come to me. I\u2019m putting my foot down. I have some pride, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looks as if I\u2019ll be taking matters into my own hands. \u201cI\u2019ll have a sit-down with my sister when we get back\u2014find out what the hell her deal is.\u201d</p><p>Steven is vehement. \u201cNo, Drew. This is between me and my wife. Stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>I back off. \u201cAll right. Relax\u2014don\u2019t have a coronary.\u201d But I still plan on talking to Alexandra. If you want something done right, you have to f**king do it yourself.</p><p>We\u2019re all silent for a minute.</p> <p>Steven says, \u201cLook\u2014I don\u2019t want this to bring us all down. Just shelve it. For tonight, let\u2019s just have a good time\u2014like the old days. The only thing I want to think about is getting hammered and having fun. GTG all the way.\u201d</p><p>Matthew laughs. Because, like me, he hasn\u2019t heard those letters in years. And they bring back some pretty awesome memories.</p><p>He fist-taps Steven. \u201cFuckin\u2019 A right\u2014GTG.\u201d</p><p>Warren asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s GTG?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cIt was our monogram back in the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it stand for?\u201d</p><p>I wiggle my eyebrows. \u201cGood-time guys.\u201d</p><p>Later, going into the fourth round of the water-volleyball tournament, we\u2019re in first place. Kicking ass and taking names. With only three more matches until the championships. It\u2019s fun. Physical. We exert ourselves but have enough time in between games to kick back, socialize, and down a few drinks.</p><p>Steven is currently getting down on the makeshift dance floor to \u201cBlurred Lines.\u201d Can you see him over there? Pointing his fingers John Travolta style and thrusting his h*ps in time to the beat? It\u2019s not smooth or cool, but somehow Steven still comes off looking like the f**king man. The hip-shaking, hand-clapping, giggling girls surrounding him are loving it.</p><p>Across the opposite end of the pool is a loud, big-drinking divorce celebration, to which Jack invited himself, and he ended up getting some action in the hot tub from the divorc\u00e9e herself.</p><p>Now he\u2019s back at the table with Matthew and me. We\u2019ve been playing it mellow. Despite a few panty-dropping offers, we\u2019ve made it clear our interests lie in hanging out\u2014not hooking up. Surprisingly, Warren has turned out to be the heavy hitter in the poontang department.</p> <p>Well . . . kind of. After our second win, he disappeared with a chick into the cabana. They came out half an hour later, retying their bathing suits. Fifteen minutes ago, he dove back in again\u2014with girl number two.</p><p>I\u2019m not impressed because . . . how can I put this without making you want to snip my balls off with a pair of garden shears? . . . girl number one was . . . of the rotund persuasion. A jolly girl. The kind who has to broadcast an entertaining personality because she\u2019s severely lacking in the shape department. Don\u2019t get me wrong, big girls have their place in society too. Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin\u2019 world go round, and all that.</p><p>And every guy has a type. One man\u2019s hog is another man\u2019s hottie. I\u2019ve always preferred my women on the petite side\u2014they\u2019re easier to flip around and maneuver into just the right position. But I don\u2019t think Warren has a passion for the plumpies. I mean, he held on to Kate for a decade, and she never went through a chubby phase\u2014I\u2019ve seen pictures.</p><p>Plus, Warren\u2019s girl number two was totally at the other end of the spectrum. Superskinny, with a rack as flat as a surfboard, and a hook nose that suggested a strong relation to the bald eagle.</p><p>Pencil-dick himself emerges from the cabana with a satisfied grin. He sits down at the table and takes a long drag from his beer. Matthew, Jack, and I just stare at him.</p><p>He looks back and forth between us. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I jerk my chin toward girl number two as she walks back to her table of equally unattractive friends. Subpars tend to stick together.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you and the scary sisters?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean your first hookup made Snooki look like Miss America. And that last chick is probably next of kin to the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d</p><p>He sneers defensively. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>Matthew and Jack cough. \u201cButter face . . . butter face.\u201d</p><p>Warren asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s a butter face?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at his ignorance. \u201cIt means everything is hot\u2014but. Her. Face. Get it? And I think that\u2019s pretty generous, considering there\u2019s nothing boner-worthy about a woman with the h*ps of a ten-year-old boy.\u201d</p><p>Jack suggests, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a fetish. You like to bump uglies with the uglies, Billy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have a thing for ugly girls.\u201d</p><p>I beg to differ. Still, I give him the chance to explain himself. \u201cThen why are they the only ones you\u2019re hitting on?\u201d</p><p>Warren squirms uncomfortably. \u201cThey\u2019re just . . . easier. I like a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>Matthew says, \u201cYou sold out Giants f**king Stadium six months ago. For you they should all be sure things.\u201d</p><p>Warren avoids eye contact and picks at the label on his beer. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like . . . I was with Kate for a long time . . .\u201d</p><p>As if I could f**king forget.</p><p>\u201c. . . and I never really had a chance to practice my skills, you know? And chicks in LA? They\u2019re bitches, man\u2014they\u2019re hot and they know it. So, it\u2019s less intimidating if I stick with the easy scores.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a story in the Bible about a guy who was a real mean bastard. One day he was walking down the road, and God knocked him on his ass. This blinding light came from the sky, and a booming voice shouted down from the heavens, telling him what he needed to do. How to fix his life.</p><p>That\u2019s what this moment is like for me. An epiphany. A divine revelation.</p><p>If I can find Warren a girl of his own . . . if I can teach him the secrets of scoring quality pieces of ass . . . maybe he\u2019ll be so distracted, he\u2019ll finally stop sniffing around Kate. And maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I\u2019ll be rid of him. For good.</p><p>I have seen the path to the promised land, boys and girls. And it\u2019s lined with pu**y.</p><p>Energized by the prospect of a Warren-less existence, I propose, \u201cI can help you with that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith getting girls?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cGetting top-notch girls. The kind of females you\u2019ve only seen in magazines and wet dreams. I can teach you how to make it happen. Once you taste gourmet, you\u2019ll never munch junk food again.\u201d</p><p>Jack tells Warren, \u201cJump all over this, man. You\u2019d be learning from the best. Evans is the master\u2014before he gets married, they should bronze his dick, like DiMaggio\u2019s cleats.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack\u2019s praise is flattering. And a little disturbing.</p><p>Still, Warren looks suspicious. \u201cWhy would you want to help me?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for a lost cause\u2014St. Jude always was my favorite saint. Plus, you\u2019re Kate\u2019s little buddy. If I help you out, I score points with her. And that\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d</p><p>He seems satisfied with my answer, so I start with the basics. \u201cWhat\u2019s your game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour game plan. How do you approach these gorgeous LA women? What do you say?\u201d</p><p>He scratches his head, like the dumbfuck monkey he is. \u201cWell, sometimes I\u2019ll rush over, looking surprised, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself? That fall from heaven was far.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The guys and I start laughing straightaway. But Warren doesn\u2019t. Then we stop.</p><p>I ask, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014were you serious?\u201d</p> <p>He looks away, slightly pissed. \u201cForget this.\u201d</p><p>I implore him, \u201cNo, we won\u2019t laugh anymore. I want to help. What else?\u201d</p><p>He debates answering for a second. \u201cSometimes I tell a joke.\u201d</p><p>Matthew looks perplexed. \u201cA joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014you know\u2014\u2018This guy walks into a bar . . .\u2019 Shit like that.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cRight. I can see why you think that would work . . . because every woman wants to screw Bozo the Clown.\u201d</p> <p>Then we start laughing again.</p><p>Warren growls, \u201cFuck you guys. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d He starts to get up.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014don\u2019t go. Come on, man, we\u2019re just busting your balls.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Warren sits back down.</p><p>I begin my tutorial. \u201cFirst mistake\u2014you\u2019re trying too hard. Women can smell desperation like a dog smells fear. And to them, it reeks like shit. You have to be calm. Confident. Like . . . when we were kids, Matthew\u2019s uncle used to take us camping. At the campground there was a lake with all these sunnies swimming around, that all the kids would try to catch. There was this one annoying little prick who wanted to catch the most fish\u2014so he brought a net. He\u2019d slam it into the water over and over, but he never caught any fish. He just scared them away. I, on the other hand, would bring a little bag of bread crumbs. I\u2019d drop in just a few at a time\u2014a small taste. Then I\u2019d sit back and wait. After a minute or two, all the fish would come to me. You see what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>Monkey-boy nods. \u201cYeah . . .\u201d Then he stops. \u201cNo, actually. Not really.\u201d</p><p>This is going to be harder than I thought. And the really scary thing? If Kate and I die together in a fiery collision? This dumbass is third in line to raise my kid.</p><p>Forget global warming\u2014that\u2019s the thought that keeps me up at night.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d I take a drink of my beer. \u201cForget the lines. Forget the goddamn jokes. Women aren\u2019t that complicated. You just have to figure out what they want to hear. Then, tell it to them. You do that, and even the hottest knees will part like the Red Sea.\u201d</p><p>He digests my words for a moment. \u201cSo I should tell a chick I\u2019ll listen to her demo tape? Maybe get her a recording contract?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Rule number one\u2014don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t or have no intention of keeping. Play it straight\u2014anything else is just a scumbag move. And it\u2019s the easiest way to turn a semi-normal chick into a stalker. After the deal gets sealed, if you\u2019re in a jam and need an exit strategy, ask for her phone number\u2014but don\u2019t actually say you\u2019re going to call. It\u2019ll be assumed, but that\u2019s not your problem.\u201d I take another drink of beer. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the moment\u2014screw tomorrow. Decipher what she wants, right then and there. Some chicks actually want a dickhead\u2014they get off on being treated like crap.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t even think about telling me I\u2019m wrong. Where do you think the whole \u201cnice guys finish last\u201d thing came from? Because deep down, some women live for drama.</p><p>\u201cSome just want a shoulder to cry on, or a good time. Listen to what they say, watch how they say it, and show them that, at least for the night, you\u2019re exactly what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Matthew says, \u201cHe looks confused, Drew. Maybe a little demonstration is in order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>I scan the pool area and spot a waitress scurrying across the concrete. She\u2019s got dark, curly hair, pale skin with a hint of freckles. She fills out her uniform nicely\u2014a white blouse tied in a knot at the waist, high and tight, black shorts that look as if they were stolen from Hooters, and black heels. Bingo.</p><p>I point her out. \u201cWhat do you think of her?\u201d</p><p>Jack comments, \u201cI\u2019d bang her.\u201d</p><p>Warren agrees, \u201cYeah. She\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand and call the waitress over. With pad and pen ready she asks, \u201cHey, guys, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never understand why women set themselves up like that. Try to think like a man, for God\u2019s sake. When a red-blooded guy hears this question? He immediately thinks of at least eight different things you could \u201cdo\u201d for him, in about ten different positions.</p><p>I give her my most charming smile. \u201cCould you bring us a bottle of J\u00e4ger, honey? And five shot glasses please. Take your time, you look busy. We\u2019re not in a rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Coming right up.\u201d</p><p>She turns away and walks to the bar.</p><p>Jack stares. \u201cI hate it when they leave, but I love to watch them go.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s staring at her ass too.</p><p>So I smack him. Slap. To get his attention . . . and . . . because it\u2019s fun.</p><p>\u201cFocus. Look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking at her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just at her ass\u2014look at the whole package.\u201d</p><p>He glares at me, touching his cheek. Then he watches the waitress.</p><p>\u201cSee how she\u2019s rubbing her lower back? And wiping the sweat from her forehead? How she shifts her weight from one foot to the other? What do you think she needs right now?\u201d</p><p>His face scrunches up with concentration.</p><p>After a minute, I can\u2019t resist. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014she looks like she could use a nap.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThere\u2019s hope for you yet. A nap would be good, but you can\u2019t give that to her. What you can do is make her feel important. Valued. Show her that you appreciate her as a woman, not just a server. Chicks eat that shit up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Waitress girl starts to head back over, balancing a bottle and shot glasses on a tray one-handedly. Before she reaches us, I hiss a warning at Warren\u2014just to be safe. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about telling tales to Kate that I\u2019m screwing around. This is for purely educational purposes only. It means nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the absolute truth. It\u2019s like . . . acting. I would have made a great actor. The Broadway kind. Because no matter what an actor feels for his leading lady in real life\u2014when that curtain rises, he performs. Convincingly.</p><p>She arrives at our table. \u201cHere we go, guys.\u201d</p><p>As she sets out the glasses, I ask, \u201cIs it always this crazy around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot always. There\u2019s a podiatrist convention in town this weekend, so we\u2019re swamped.\u201d She brushes a hair from her face. \u201cThe tips are good though, so I can\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. Everyone deserves to bitch once in a while. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and pours our drinks.</p><p>\u201cBetter yet\u2014how about you sit down for a few minutes? Take a load off. Have a drink with us? You look like you could use one.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s tempted. But then she glances over her shoulder at the balding, heavyset guy behind the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to ask\u2014but I can\u2019t. My boss wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSweet is my middle name.\u201d I jerk my thumb toward the bar, \u201cHe your boss?\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s him. Harry\u2019s a total slave driver.\u201d</p><p>I stand and hold up a finger. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I jog over to Harry. \u201cHey, man, my friends and I are looking to have a quick drink with our waitress.\u201d</p><p>He looks over at our table. \u201cWith Felicia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Felicia\u201d\u2014or, whatever\u2014\u201cand we\u2019re willing to pay for her time. What\u2019s a ten-minute break gonna cost me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d I slap the money on the bar and beat it back to the table quickly\u2014before the price goes up. Then I put my sexy face back on.</p><p>I pull out a chair and motion for the waitress to sit. \u201cYou\u2019re all set.\u201d</p><p>She looks surprised. \u201cNo kidding?\u201d She looks at Harry, who gives her a nod, then she sits down gratefully. \u201cWow, you convinced Harry to give me a break? You must be very good.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle wickedly. \u201cBaby, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I sit in my chair and raise my shot glass. Everyone follows suit and we down them together. Then I pour another for the waitress. We chat casually for a few minutes. She tells me about her dreams of becoming a showgirl, which were put on hold because of her mother\u2019s emphysema. I listen oh so attentively and nod at all the right times.</p><p>Then I dig a little deeper. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot for a lady to have on her shoulders. Does your husband help out?\u201d</p><p>She drinks her second shot and shakes her head. \u201cNo husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA boyfriend, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one of them, either. Who has the time?\u201d</p><p>Then I go in for the kill. \u201cA great girl like you doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend? That\u2019s a damn shame. Still, you should make time to blow off a little steam. Let loose. Have a good time with a good guy.\u201d</p><p>She licks the alcohol off her lips. \u201cI squeeze in a good time here and there. When it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>See her suggestive smirk? The invitation in her big, hazel eyes? That\u2019s her signal\u2014telling me she thinks I\u2019m worth it. That if I offer to help her blow off some steam in any fashion I can think of, she\u2019s up for it.</p><p>That also concludes our presentation for the day.</p><p>I glance at my watch. \u201cTen minutes are up. I wouldn\u2019t want you to get into trouble with your boss.\u201d</p><p>She blinks. \u201cOh\u2014right.\u201d</p><p>Then she stands up\u2014but doesn\u2019t leave right away. \u201cI\u2019m done here in a few hours. Are you guys going to stick around?\u201d She asks all of us, but she\u2019s looking at me.</p><p>I let her down easy. Because that\u2019s the kind of gentleman I am. \u201cUnfortunately, no. We\u2019ll be heading out soon and we\u2019re busy all night. But it was a pleasure talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Back in the day, I would have kissed her hand for good measure. But these days my lips are for Kate alone.</p><p>Her shoulders sag. \u201cOkay . . . well . . . thanks for the drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, honey. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d</p><p>She walks away, sneaking a peek back over at our table as she goes.</p><p>I turn my attention to Warren and spread my arms wide. \u201cAnd that is how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>I toss back a shot. My voice is strained after it burns down my throat. \u201cIf I was interested, I\u2019d hang around awhile. And if no other opportunities presented themselves, I\u2019d take her home, bang her for a few hours, and leave her smiling.\u201d</p><p>Warren suggests, with a hint of awe, \u201cYeah. Or you could bring her up to your room for a quickie.\u201d</p><p>Jack, Matthew, and I simultaneously exclaim, \u201cNooooo.\u201d</p><p>I correct him, \u201cWith the high-end women you\u2019re going to be scoring? You\u2019re gonna want to take your time. And\u2014rule number two\u2014always have an escape route. Never take a girl back to your home turf. It could take a forklift to get her the f**k out.\u201d</p><p>Jack shudders. \u201cOne time I had to call the cops. And when they dragged her out, the broad was still clinging to my bed-sheets. That\u2019s a mistake you only make once.\u201d</p><p>Warren nods. \u201cYou make it seem so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting laid is supposed to be easy,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNone of us would be here if it wasn\u2019t. God gave men instincts\u2014even you. Just relax and let them lead you.\u201d</p><p>I slap him on the back. Harder than I have to. \u201cNow, young Skywalker, your training is complete. Tonight\u2014you become a Jedi.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cCool. Thanks, man.\u201d Then he cocks his thumb toward the restroom. \u201cI gotta hit the john.\u201d</p><p>Jack stands. \u201cAnd I see a new lucky lady. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>After they leave, Matthew\u2019s eyes burn a hole in my face.</p><p>I return his stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours ago you could barely stand to be in the same room with the guy, and now you\u2019re giving him pu**y pointers. Why are you really helping him, Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a helpful guy.\u201d</p><p>He continues to stare, waiting for me to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . if Warren\u2019s occupied with his own snatch . . . he\u2019ll stay away from Kate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matthew\u2019s head rolls back with a groan. \u201cDude\u2014you\u2019re still hung up on that? Let it go, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear the same song I did?\u201d</p><p>His voice rises with exasperation. \u201cSo f**king what? It was a song. Kate is marrying you\u2014you have a son together.\u201d He cups his hands around his mouth like a megaphone. \u201cGet over it.\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my neck. \u201cI am. I am over it. But . . . when I see him . . . when I see them together\u2014it drives me nuts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I still think he has feelings for Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain\u2014why?\u201d</p><p>I grind my teeth. And clench my hands. When I open my mouth, the God\u2019s honest truth comes tumbling out. \u201cBecause I would never let her go, Matthew. Ever. No matter what happened\u2014no matter what I did, I\u2019d keep hoping, trying, until she came back to me.\u201d</p><p>Matthew nods compassionately. \u201cAnd that is why you are marrying Kate, and Warren is not. Because he was able to let her go. It wasn\u2019t the forever kind of relationship, it was the for-right-now kind. And he did get over her. It\u2019s the same way for Kate. So stop torturing yourself\u2014and the rest of us\u2014and just f**king enjoy it. You won. She\u2019s yours.\u201d</p> <p>I think about his words for a moment. And then I shrug. \u201cEither way, no harm, no foul. I get peace of mind, Warren gets his pickup skills upgraded, and Kate will be pleasantly surprised that I\u2019m not jumping at the chance to put him in a shallow grave. Everybody wins, right?\u201d</p><p>Matthew nods thoughtfully and finishes his drink.</p><p>Over the speaker system, the lifeguard calls our team number, and we get ready to nail the game.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>By the time we head back to the villa\u2014as the returning water-volleyball champions we are\u2014afternoon has slipped into dusk. It\u2019s my favorite time of day. The sun is setting and the air smells like summer\u2014a mix of earth and chlorine and freshly cut grass. I swipe my card through the security gate surrounding the house and walk toward the front door.</p><p>Something in the window catches Jack\u2019s eye, and he freezes. \u201cWhat the hell . . .\u201d</p> <p>I follow his gaze through the window. I see the girls in the library, sitting in a circular formation on chairs dragged in from the dining room. They\u2019re wearing long, pink, satiny robes and open-back, fuzzy, black heels. In the center of the circle stands a tall, fiftyish blonde in full black-leather dominatrix attire. She\u2019s sort of hot\u2014in an aging-hooker, been-around-the-block, her-pussy-is-probably-as-wide-as-the-Lincoln-Tunnel kind of way.</p><p>I whisper excitedly, \u201cGoddess party.\u201d</p><p>See? Dreams really do come true.</p><p>Matthew fist-pumps. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Like SEAL Team Six, we stealthily invade the villa single-file. Once inside, we line up\u2014totem-pole style\u2014in front of the library\u2019s mahogany double doors. Without making a sound, I crack the door\u2014just a little. Just enough to watch and listen. In one hand, dominatrix lady holds a mini, purple vibrator\u2014in the other, a matching remote control.</p><p>\u201cWe call this the Master. You insert the vibrator into your panties, and your gentleman takes possession of the controller. It\u2019s noiseless and discreet, but powerful. With the remote, he can alternate speed and pressure at his discretion. . . .\u201d</p><p>Matthew whispers, \u201cI have got to get me one of those.\u201d</p><p>I murmur, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get five.\u201d I envision our weekly staff meetings in the conference room taking on a whole new meaning.</p> <p>Dominatrix lady goes on, \u201cAnd now, ladies, let\u2019s continue our oral instruction. Your bananas, please.\u201d</p><p>Instantly and without shame, each of the girls picks up the large banana that has been resting on her lap. And puts it in her mouth.</p><p>Holy Mary, mother of God.</p><p>\u201cRemember to relax your jaw . . . breathe on the outtake. Watch your teeth . . .\u201d</p><p>My eyes are glued to Kate as the banana slides smoothly in and out from between her perfect pink lips. I\u2019m so turned on, I could hammer nails into a two-by-four with my cock. I mean, I\u2019ve been where that banana is going many times before, but something about watching Kate give head from this point of view is crazy erotic. It\u2019s like . . . live- p**n dinner theater.</p><p>\u201cUse your other hand, ladies. The testes are the neglected stepchild of the male genitalia. Knead them, massage them, caress them\u2014they need your love too.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, they do.</p><p>In a hushed voice, Jack puts into words what all of us are thinking. \u201cAnyone else about to jizz in their swim trunks? This is . . . this is like every fantasy I\u2019ve ever had all rolled into one.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but agree. \u201cMe too\u2014except the part about my sister being there. And Delores.\u201d</p><p>Matthew is insulted. \u201cHey, my wife is magnificent.\u201d</p><p>You wanna know what else is magnificent? A black panther, streaking across a valley, going in for the kill. Doesn\u2019t mean I want to mount one.</p><p>I tear my eyes away from the fruit-blowing fest and look down at Matthew. \u201cYour wife\u2019s a psychopath. I wouldn\u2019t f**k her with your dick. She\u2019d probably pull some kind of booby-trap shit and shove razor blades up her twat to try and slice my c**k off.\u201d</p><p>Was that too crude?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a f**ked-up thing to say.\u201d</p><p>Pick a conspiracy, any conspiracy\u2014the JFK assassination, Area 51 . . .</p><p>\u201cThe truth usually is.\u201d</p><p>The guy code restricts how much you can mock a friend\u2019s significant other. There\u2019s an imaginary line. And if Matthew\u2019s reaction is any indication? I just crossed it.</p><p>He lands an angry punch to my right leg. In the spot above my knee\u2014the charley-horse region\u2014that makes pain echo up and down my femur.</p><p>\u201cOw! God damn it!\u201d</p><p>I shift my weight to my other leg to keep from falling over, but I step on Warren\u2019s hand and set off a not-so-quiet domino effect.</p><p>\u201cHey! Those are my fingers, ass**le!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, stop pushing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up, I can\u2019t hear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruining it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop f**king punching me!\u201d</p><p>You know what\u2019s going to happen next, don\u2019t you? Yep\u2014the doors open. And the five of us tumble into the room in a heap\u2014like a pileup after a fumble.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>There\u2019s a collective gasp at our intrusion\u2014the kind of sound a sunbather would make after getting doused with a bucket of ice water. Meanwhile, the man-pile does its best to untangle.</p><p>\u201cOmpf . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your knee off my balls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your balls off my knee!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m the first to recover.

Carry on, pretend like we\u2019re not even here.\u201d</p> <p>But the lust spell has been broken. With a meaningful look, Delores peels her banana, then takes a big, chomping bite out of it.</p><p>I flinch.</p><p>My sister huffs, \u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d</p><p>Erin continues analyzing the remote control of the must-have vibrator. Kate is the only one who doesn\u2019t seem upset by our arrival. She leans back in her chair and stares at me dreamily, her dark eyes big and shiny. Then she sighs. \u201cHi, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the guys are now standing, and Jack approaches dominatrix chick, who\u2019s busy packing up her naughty paraphernalia.</p><p>His come-on is a cross between James Bond and Rico Suave. \u201cO\u2019Shay. Jack O\u2019Shay. If you\u2019re in need of an assistant or a model to demonstrate correct technique . . . I would be honored to fill that role. I\u2019m available until tomorrow evening.\u201d He holds out his card and whispers, \u201cCall me . . . cell phone\u2019s on the back.\u201d</p><p>She looks him up and down appreciatively, fingering the card with one red nail. \u201cI\u2019ll keep your offer in mind.\u201d</p><p>But Matthew, like me, isn\u2019t ready for the party to end just yet. \u201cWait, you don\u2019t have to leave now.\u201d</p><p>Dee-Dee stands and holds up a magazine. \u201cI have a catalog, Matthew. Let\u2019s look it over together in our room\u2014you can make a Christmas list.\u201d</p><p>His eyes follow her as she walks out, then he scampers after her like a puppy chasing a bone.</p> <p>Erin announces that she\u2019s taking a nap, and my sister and Steven disappear without a word to each other, or anyone else. My eyes never leave Kate. It\u2019s only been a few hours . . . but still . . . I missed her.</p><p>\u201cYou look relaxed,\u201d I comment. \u201cDid you have a good afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Kate stands and grazes her palms over my chest and across my shoulders, feeling me up. \u201cIt was nice. But I know how to make it even better.\u201d She wraps her arms around my neck and slides her tongue around my ear. It\u2019s soft at first\u2014teasing. Then she plunges inside with the perfect amount of pressure to make my knees want to buckle.</p><p>Every guy has a spot. A highly sensitive place that, when stimulated, goes right to his dick. For some, it\u2019s the neck or the stomach. For some freaks it\u2019s the toes. But for me? It\u2019s my ears. Kate knows this.</p><p>Sucking lightly on my earlobe, her hands skim down my sides around to the back, before settling on my ass with a firm squeeze. I\u2019m not complaining\u2014this is me here\u2014a little grab-ass or jerk the johnson is never a bad thing. But Kate is usually more on the conservative side. Less overt with her sexual advances, particularly when other people are nearby.</p><p>I lean my head back to look at her face. Her smile is lazy, and her eyes\u2014did I say they were shiny? They\u2019re not. They\u2019re glassy. There\u2019s a difference.</p><p>\u201cHave you been smoking Warren\u2019s crotch stash?\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip. Guilty as charged. She holds up two fingers, pinching them together, and closes one eye. \u201cJust this much.\u201d Then she gives me an innocent, adorable look. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p> <p>As I said before, I\u2019m not into drugs. They\u2019re not just a vice\u2014they\u2019re a crutch. A chemical support for weak-minded individuals who can\u2019t deal with life\u2019s everyday bullshit. But it\u2019s not like Kate is popping Mommy\u2019s Little Helpers three times a day. Since I\u2019ve known her, she\u2019s gotten stoned exactly twice\u2014both times with Dee-Dee, while the four of us were on vacation together. Kate doesn\u2019t buy or grow her own stuff. She would certainly never get high around our son.</p><p>So if she wants to kick back and toke up once in a blue moon, I\u2019m not going to be the self-righteous, overbearing ass**le who gives her shit for it. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not mad.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grows. \u201cOh . . . that\u2019s good. Because I have plans . . . plans that require you not being angry.\u201d She giggles wickedly. \u201cWell . . . maybe a little angry would be okay.\u201d</p><p>Then she attaches her lips to my neck, sucking and kissing, moaning softly. Have I mentioned that weed makes Kate horny? Oh, yeah, it does. Which is another reason I\u2019m perfectly happy with her current condition.</p><p>I sweep her up into my arms, princess style. She squeals. Then I tell Jack, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in our room. Don\u2019t knock on that door unless the place is on f**king fire.\u201d</p><p>Now that the goddess host has left the building, Jack\u2019s feeling needy. \u201cI thought we were going to play Xbox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans change.\u201d I swing around and make my way toward our room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not cool, man. Bros before . . .\u201d My glare cuts him off. Because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let him finish that sentence when he\u2019s talking about my fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>He takes the hint. \u201cFine. Dicks before chicks, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to rethink that. Because while you\u2019re out here jerking your game remote with Warren, I\u2019m gonna be in there, with Kate. No contest, buddy.\u201d</p><p>I walk through our door and kick it closed behind me. Then I set Kate on her feet, cup her face with my hands, and kiss the breath right out of her. I pull the pink robe down her arm, exposing the creamy flesh of her shoulder. I taste it with my tongue, then slowly make my way up to her neck.</p><p>Her head rolls to the side with a moan. My hands make quick work of the robe and the black, strappy nightgown underneath\u2014sliding them off Kate\u2019s body into a ring of satin around her feet. After kissing her lips deeply one last time, I kneel in front of her, soaking up the sight of her beautiful bareness.</p><p>She\u2019s perfect. It shouldn\u2019t surprise me\u2014I know what she looks like. But still, every view of Kate\u2019s firm tits, her flat waist, her toned, smooth legs, revs me up like a kid getting his first glimpse of p**n .</p><p>Because she\u2019s mine. Because she\u2019s amazing. Because she wants me as badly as I want her. And this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be\u2014the way it\u2019s supposed to feel. The way it always will\u2014an intense haze of lust and heat and adoration.</p><p>Her heavy-lidded eyes look down at me as I lean forward and kiss the skin around her pu**y. She\u2019s completely smooth and soft\u2014freshly waxed. Kate pulls back just a bit at the contact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTender?\u201d I ask.</p><p>It\u2019s times like this I\u2019m particularly glad I\u2019m a guy. Because manscaping with an electric razor is one thing. Getting hair ripped out in large clumps with hot wax? No thanks. Sounds like a goddamn torture technique, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>Though the results are awesome.</p><p>She exhales. \u201cJust a little sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>I cup her ass and bring her sweet snatch to my mouth. I caress her with my tongue\u2014like an artist stroking a fresh canvas. Slowly at first. Then deeper, with more purpose\u2014more pressure. And I\u2019m overwhelmed by the texture\u2014the sight, the taste, and the scent. It\u2019s sublime sensory overload.</p><p>The saints can keep heaven, because this spot between Kate Brooks\u2019s legs is so much f**king better. Paradise on earth.</p><p>We\u2019ll stop right here for a second. Don\u2019t want to ruin the vibe\u2014but we should talk about a \u201cvery special\u201d topic. A topic that the male youth of today are tragically under-informed about. I like to call it cunning linguistics.</p><p>You may know it as going down. Dining at the Y. Carpet munching. Having a box lunch. The point is, pu**y-eating is an acquired skill. All that making-the-alphabet-with-your-tongue crap is for lazy schmucks who couldn\u2019t find a G-spot with a f**king flashlight and a navigation device.</p><p>You have to hone your craft\u2014develop your technique. It\u2019s a lot like . . . basketball. Just knowing the right moves isn\u2019t a guarantee you\u2019re gonna score points. Because you have to know whom you\u2019re playing with\u2014the type of moves they\u2019re partial to. Too much attention to a sensitive cl*t kills the momentum. Not enough attention and the chick will be checking her watch thinking, Is he done yet? Body language is crucial. Reading the signals\u2014taking cues.</p><p>At the moment, Kate\u2019s pu**y is dripping\u2014wet desire clings to her thighs. And it\u2019s f**king glorious. Women should never be embarrassed about being turned on. Even if you squirt like a high-powered water gun or gush like Old Reliable\u2014be proud. Guys love it.</p><p>Because it can\u2019t be faked.</p><p>As \u201cSally\u201d demonstrated in that 1980s Billy Crystal movie, just because a woman acts as if she were coming, it doesn\u2019t mean she really is. For some, every pant, scratch, and squeal may be suspect. Is she really getting off? Or is she just tired of getting nailed? But feeling, seeing, that slick desire tells men that you\u2019re actually into it. That they\u2019re doing it right. And that makes us guys want to do it more.</p><p>Now that my good deed is done for the day\u2014back to the bedroom.</p><p>Kate\u2019s h*ps start to rotate against my face. My hands help her along. She leans her upper body back against the wall. Her breaths come faster and her face turns upward. Her eyes close. Then the explosion comes. She grabs the back of my head, holding me in place as she clenches and grinds against me. Her mouth opens, but no sound comes out.</p><p>Fucking gorgeous.</p><p>After a minute, her grip loosens, and her eyes open. She looks down at me with a satisfied smile, and I kiss a path up her body as I stand. Her limp arms rise slowly up and around my neck, and just before she presses her mouth to mine, she whispers, \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>I thought so too, but it\u2019s always nice to hear. As she kisses me, my hands find her ass again. Kate\u2019s ass reminds me of a kid\u2019s favorite stuffed animal. Once it\u2019s within my reach, I just can\u2019t seem to let it go.</p><p>I drag her up my body and her legs lock around my waist. Now that I\u2019ve gotten Kate off, my plan is to slow things down. Take our time. Because once you have kids\u2014time is never your friend again. Even in the dead of night, there\u2019s always the thought, the nagging f**king possibility, that time will run out. But that\u2019s not the case now.</p><p>James\u2014whom I love with everything I am\u2014is my parents\u2019 problem. I plan to make the most of it. By spending the next few hours doing all the fun, naughty\u2014loud\u2014things I wouldn\u2019t risk doing when he\u2019s nearby.</p><p>\u201cI owe you a massage,\u201d I whisper to her.</p><p>But Kate has other ideas. She reaches down between us and pulls my rock-hard dick out of my swim shorts. She strokes it expertly, until my eyes cross. \u201cYou can massage me later. I need you to f**k me right now.\u201d</p><p>Christ. I love it when she gets bossy. With one hand, I push my shorts down the rest of the way. Then I line us up and slide slowly inside. \u201cGod damn.\u201d Her body swells around me. Takes me in and holds me tight.</p> <p>It might sound stupid\u2014overly romantic\u2014to say that Kate\u2019s body was made for mine. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. My h*ps pull back, and her muscles squeeze harder, not wanting to let me go. I push in deeper till Kate\u2019s ass hits the wall behind her. I pump into her with short, hard strokes, thumping against the wall in a drumming rhythm. We gasp and moan together\u2014cursing and humming\u2014with every thrust.</p><p>It\u2019s not gentle. Or quiet. We\u2019re loud enough for the rest of the house to hear us. Hell, we\u2019re loud enough for Indonesia to hear us. Holding her against me, I turn around so my back\u2019s braced against the doorframe of the bathroom. I lift her up and down smoothly. My arms strain from the action, and a sheen of sweat covers our skins.</p><p>Then I take a few steps into the bathroom, to the vanity counter. I perch her on top, knocking clinking bottles of perfume and face wash to the floor. I kiss her deeply, and her tongue dances against mine. She pulls back and grips my h*ps with her hands, taking over the pace.</p><p>She moans and begs and orders, \u201cSlow.\u201d</p><p>I do as she commands, rotating my h*ps in sensuously slow circles. Clashing against her, bringing us closer to that powerful pinnacle with every breath we take.</p><p>\u201cFuck . . . ,\u201d I hiss, because it feels too good not to.</p><p>\u201cDrew . . . ,\u201d she answers with a soulful whimper.</p><p>Kate\u2019s legs tremble, shake under my steady hands. I move faster, pump against her harder, greedy for the feeling of her tight, hot muscles pulsing and contracting around me. The heels of the black shoes that still encase her feet dig into my ass as she matches the give-and-take of my h*ps with her own.</p><p>Then she\u2019s clinging to me\u2014chest to chest\u2014her teeth biting into my shoulder as she screams. \u201cYes . . . yes . . .\u201d</p><p>When you\u2019ve had as many orgasms as I have, they tend to blend together, forming one general happy memory. But every once in a while, one stands out from the rest. It\u2019s a moment I\u2019ll think about later\u2014relive on my next business trip when mast***ation is my only recourse.</p><p>This is one of those orgasms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ecstasy rips through me like a submarine missile tearing into the ocean. I lean forward over Kate, pressing her against me. Trying to get closer\u2014to absorb every ounce of bliss she\u2019s giving me. I think I shout her name, but I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Several moments later, after the sound of my blood pounding in my ears has lessened, I look into Kate\u2019s smiling eyes. She pushes my damp hair off my forehead. Then she kisses the tattoo of our son\u2019s name on my chest.</p><p>And she hugs me\u2014holds me\u2014resting her cheek against my heart. \u201cI love you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>It should be weird to have such sweet words and tender actions come after the rough and raw screwing we just enjoyed. But for us? Nothing weird about it.</p> <p>For us, it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>I did eventually give Kate that massage. Not that she needed it, relaxed as she was\u2014but rubbing warm baby oil on Kate\u2019s body is my idea of a really good time. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out how things went from there. Which is why, at the moment, Kate is passed out cold on the bed. I\u2019ll let her sleep another twenty minutes or so before I\u2019ll have to wake her. Because it\u2019s common knowledge that women take forever and a day to get ready for a night on the town. Kate may be different from most girls in a lot of ways\u2014but in that way? She\u2019s exactly the same.</p><p>I walk out of the bedroom to the kitchen, looking for some nourishment. Man can\u2019t live on sex alone\u2014as cool an idea as that would be. The house is quiet. Jack and Warren probably took off to escape the sounds of bumping and grinding all around them.</p><p>I make myself a turkey on rye in the kitchen, then I glance out the balcony doors and spot my sister. Sitting alone on the private brick patio in the rear of the villa.</p> <p>Mentally I shake my head and step out through the doors. Alexandra glances at me quickly, then turns her eyes back to the foliage surrounding the yard. Forlorn is not a look I\u2019m used to seeing on my sister. It\u2019s unsettling.</p><p>I sit down in the lawn chair beside her and put my sandwich on the table. I should start off kindly. Unaccusing. Considerate. I should be diplomatic.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>She takes a sip from the martini glass in her hand before placing it on the table. \u201cGo away, Drew. I\u2019d like to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to buy a private island in the South Pacific and name it Drewland, but that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon. We can\u2019t always have what we want.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the pink-concoction-filled glass and give it a sniff. My head jerks back and my nose wrinkles. Whatever my sister\u2019s been drinking smells like fruity ammonia\u2014like strawberry-scented bat piss.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to poison your body, at least have the decency to use a premium-brand toxin.\u201d Cheap liquor is strictly reserved for winos and college kids who don\u2019t know any better.</p><p>Her face is impassive. Slack and sad. She shakes her head slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>I toss her drink onto the grass. \u201cI resent that. I\u2019ll have you know I understand all perspectives\u2014man, woman, or child. God and I are a lot alike that way.\u201d I pause for a second and my voice softens. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Alexandra? Whatever it is, maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>Her tone is flat. Lifeless. \u201cSteven is going to divorce me.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cWith the way you\u2019ve been acting lately, I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>I ready my hand to block the glass that I\u2019m pretty certain is about to come spiraling at my face. But nothing gets thrown at me. Instead something more shocking\u2014more horrifying\u2014happens.</p><p>The Bitch covers her face with her hands and sobs into them.</p><p>I swallow hard. Then I look around. Waiting for that douche bag Ashton Kutcher to jump out and yell, \u201cPunked!\u201d Because Alexandra Evans isn\u2019t a crier. She\u2019s a doer\u2014a fixer.</p> <p>And throughout the history of mankind, crying has never fixed shit.</p><p>I stutter. And ask the second-stupidest question ever. \u201cAre you . . . are you crying?\u201d</p><p>In my head Tom Hanks\u2019s voice echoes, \u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d Did Cleopatra cry when Egypt got sacked? Did Joan of Arc cry when the Catholic Church called her a witch? They are my sister\u2019s counterparts.</p><p>Alexandra shakes her head, but the tears keep on flowing. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve pushed him away. I\u2019ve been miserable to be around. I\u2019ve treated him terribly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you know that, why don\u2019t you just . . . stop?\u201d Seems simple, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m so sad. And angry. It\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m too young to be a dried-up prune!\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019s really going at it. Sniffling and snotting all over the place. I don\u2019t have a tissue, so I take off my T-shirt\u2014even though it\u2019s one of my favorites\u2014and hand it to her. Alexandra blows her nose into it. It sounds like a dying goose.</p><p>Even though I have no f**king clue what she\u2019s talking about, I know I\u2019m supposed to say something. \u201cWell . . . prunes have their uses. A few months ago, James\u2019s pipes were backed up. And we fed him a few of those bad boys and they did the trick. It was like edible Drano\u2014cleaned everything out. Prunes are great.\u201d</p><p>She stops. And looks up at me with red-rimmed, perplexed eyes. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no f**king idea! I\u2019m trying to be comforting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t come to you for comfort often. You suck at it!\u201d She goes back to bawling in the T-shirt.</p><p>I pinch the bridge of my nose and breathe deep. Let\u2019s try this again. \u201cYou said you were angry. Sad. Why are you angry and sad, Alexandra?\u201d</p><p>She wipes at her face and talks quickly\u2014rushed. \u201cI could set my watch to my period. Every twenty-seven days on the dot. So when it didn\u2019t come, I thought, Oh, crap, you know? And even though the test said negative, I assumed it was just too early. So I went to the doctor and I was so sure he was going to tell me I was pregnant. And even though it wasn\u2019t planned, I started to get used to the idea of another one. I was excited. But then . . . then he told me I wasn\u2019t pregnant.\u201d</p><p>A cold ball of ice settles in my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . you\u2019re not sick, are you?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not sick.\u201d She takes a cleansing breath. \u201cHe said it\u2019s menopause. Early-onset menopause. I can\u2019t have any more children\u2014ever. I\u2019m infertile.\u201d</p><p>She weeps quietly for a minute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rub her shoulder gently. \u201cDid you and Steven want a lot more kids?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrows slightly. \u201cWell . . . no. We\u2019d always planned on two. After Thomas was born, I\u2019d even talked to Steven about getting a vasectomy. He wasn\u2019t keen on the idea.\u201d</p><p>I try to understand the problem. That fails, so I ask, \u201cBut, if you don\u2019t want any more kids\u2014then why are you so devastated about not being able to have any more kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a woman, Drew! Creating life. Nurturing\u2014that\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p> <p>Nope\u2014still don\u2019t get it. \u201cBut that\u2019s not all you do. I mean, Jesus, Alexandra, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re a Handmaid\u2019s Tale breeder here. So the egg basket\u2019s empty? Big deal. You have two beautiful children\u2014be happy with them. Maybe this is nature\u2019s way of telling you that you shouldn\u2019t have any more. I\u2019ve seen what pregnancy does to your body. It ain\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019s glaring at me. Which is a good sign. Pissed-off Alexandra I can handle.</p><p>\u201cI am happy with the two that I have. It\u2019s just . . . having the option to have more was nice . . . even if I never did. I feel . . . cheated. And old. I have the insides of a sixty-year-old woman, Drew. How long before the outside reflects that? And have you looked at Steven lately? Every year he gets more handsome\u2014more distinguished looking. Soon some gold-digging bimbo is going to try to get her claws in him, and he\u2019s going to be saddled with a wife who looks like Barbara Bush!\u201d</p><p>She buries her face in the shirt again, and I can\u2019t help but laugh. Just a little. \u201cLexi . . . you\u2019re hardly Barbara Bush. I\u2019d say you\u2019re more of the Christie Brinkley variety. And besides\u2014Steven loves you. You. Not your goddamn ovaries. You\u2019re the bitchy-boss center of his universe. You always have been. When the rest of us were jerking off to thoughts of Sister B, Steven was jerking off to thoughts of you.\u201d And don\u2019t think I\u2019m comfortable knowing that. \u201cHe\u2019d never trade you in for some skinny-legged twit who\u2019s only interested in the size of his bank account. Steven is too smart for that.\u201d</p><p>She looks up. Almost hopefully. \u201cHow would you feel if Kate told you she couldn\u2019t have any more kids?\u201d</p> <p>I take a moment to ponder. To imagine the possibilities. \u201cIf Kate told me I could bang her all I wanted and I never had to worry about knocking her up? I\u2019d do the Irish jig down Fifth f**king Avenue. It\u2019d be like Christmas every day. No more PMS, no more abstaining for three to five days every month . . . unless you let Steven go wading in the crimson tide? Which, if you do, please lie to me.\u201d</p><p>Period sex is a deal breaker for Kate. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, she\u2019s not interested. Which I will never understand. We\u2019re hunters, ladies. We like blood. It\u2019s part of the reason action flicks and war movies have so much of it. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s gross. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s just . . . more lubrication.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m just being honest.</p><p>The tears have almost dried up. Alexandra sniffles and hiccups. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want more children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I want more. James is the best. I\u2019d have twenty with Kate. In theory. Reality\u2019s a different story. Kids are hard.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra nods.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to talk to Steven. You\u2019re torturing the guy. It\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he looks at me differently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and try to find the right words. \u201cBecause . . . because when Kate was pregnant with James? She was as big as a house\u2014and I still wanted to f**k her every bit as much as I want to right now. Because when I look at her? I just see Kate . . . the woman who walked into my life five years ago and screwed it all up. Who shook me out, turned me upside down, and made me . . . more. So even when she gets wrinkly or gray? She\u2019ll still be Kate. She\u2019ll still make me laugh and make me crazy . . . and she\u2019ll still love me more than I will ever deserve. And I know that Steven feels the same way about you.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra wipes her eyes with my shirt one last time. She starts to look more like herself. \u201cSo . . . you\u2019re saying I\u2019m making a bigger deal about this than it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying if you tell Steven, it won\u2019t feel so big anymore.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I know you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll talk to him tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra stands up, leans in, and hugs me. I squeeze her back, letting her know that I\u2019m here for her. To listen, and to kick her in the ass whenever the rare opportunity presents itself.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t go making a habit out of this falling-apart thing,\u201d I chastise. \u201cI have an exclusive on self-destructive behavior in this family.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles and heads toward the house. Then she pauses and turns toward me. \u201cHey, Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so smart?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an easy one. \u201cAbout five years ago.\u201d</p><p>After I finish my sandwich, I head back to the bedroom to wake Kate. But when I get there, she\u2019s already up and in the shower. Washing the body I obsess about and singing.</p><p>Nobody does it half as good as you</p><p>Baby, you\u2019re the best</p><p>Her voice floats around the bathroom and echoes off the tiles. It\u2019s a cheesy song\u2014Carly Simon\u2014from some seventies James Bond flick. But pleasure still rises up from my gut and spreads out through my chest at the sound. Because as sure as I know Delores will one day be committed to a home for the criminally insane, I know Kate is singing about me. I fold my arms, lean back against the door, and watch her through the steamed glass. She tilts her head back under the hot stream of water. Her rack juts out high and proud\u2014more tantalizing than any Vegas showgirl\u2019s set. Her long hair brushes against her ass, playing peekaboo with the butterfly tattoo on her lower back.</p><p>Kate turns off the water and steps out of the shower. She smiles when she sees me. \u201cHey, you. Where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>I should probably hand her a towel. It would be the nice thing to do. The bathroom tiles are cool, and if her pointy ni**les are any indication, she\u2019s a bit chilled. But you don\u2019t really think I\u2019m going to do that, do you?</p><p>Come on.</p><p>Like I would ever pass up the chance to eyefuck Kate Brooks in all her wet, bare-ass beauty. And pointy ni**les are awesome. So, like the giggly, perverted schoolboy part of me still is, I don\u2019t move an inch as Kate scurries across the bathroom and grabs a robe off the hook on the far wall, then covers up my favorite viewing pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was on the patio with Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>Kate twists a second towel around her head in that high-crown style that only women are capable of. Then she frowns worriedly. \u201cShe really hasn\u2019t been herself lately. I hope she\u2019ll talk to me tonight about whatever\u2019s going on between her and Steven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay ahead of you. It\u2019s all taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>I reach into the shower and turn the water back on full blast. Then I slip off my boxers. Despite the seriousness of the conversation, Kate does a little eyefucking of her own.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>\u201cHer baby-making factory got an early foreclosure notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor told her she\u2019s menopausal.\u201d</p> <p>Kate\u2019s hand goes to her chest with a sympathetic sigh. \u201cBut she\u2019s so young!\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah. She\u2019s a hot mess about it. She\u2019s been afraid to tell Steven, but I convinced her to talk to him later. They\u2019ll get back on track.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou convinced her to talk to Steven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe talked, bawled her eyes out, and I . . . comforted . . . her.\u201d</p> <p>Now Kate looks confused. \u201cYou comforted her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, a f**king parrot? Yes, I comforted her\u2014why are you shocked?\u201d</p><p>Kate folds her arms across her chest. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see. Could it be because your idea of comforting Mackenzie when her cat died was to tell her not to be sad because now Snowball was with all his other feline friends in hell?\u201d</p><p>I possibly could have worded that better.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because when my mother missed James\u2019s christening because of that blizzard, you comforted her by saying that when he grows up, he\u2019ll barely know who she is anyway?\u201d</p><p>Some people just can\u2019t handle the truth.</p><p>\u201cThen there was the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over her smart-ass mouth. Her dark, deep eyes stare up at me with warmth and teasing affection.</p> <p>\u201cI admit, not everyone is able to absorb my particular brand of comfort. But in this case, Alexandra did. Because of me, she and Steven are on their way back to marital bliss. For that, I deserve a pat on the back. A hand job would also do nicely.\u201d</p><p>Kate busts out laughing. She wraps her arms around my neck, pressing her terry-cloth-covered stomach against my dick. She tilts her head up. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be the stable couple in the group for once. Go, us.\u201d She holds up one palm. \u201cHigh five.\u201d</p><p>I glance at her hand, then shake my head dismissively. \u201cI don\u2019t do high fives.\u201d I wiggle my digits. \u201cBut if you\u2019re interested in some fingering, I\u2019m happy to oblige.\u201d</p><p>Kate giggles. \u201cSuch a pervert.\u201d</p><p>I give her lips a peck. \u201cFor you? Always. Now stop trying to seduce me, and let me take a shower.\u201d</p><p>As she turns away, I swat her ass for good measure. Then I step into the shower and close the glass door behind me. I stick my head under the searing water and let the heat relax the muscles in my neck and back.</p><p>Through the glass a blurry Kate moves around, beginning the long getting-ready ritual. \u201cI called your parents to see how the baby was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother sounded half-dead, but all of the kids are great.\u201d</p><p>Just as I expected.</p><p>Five minutes later, I\u2019m out of the shower. I towel off and slip on a fresh pair of boxers. Then I step up to the sink and lather shaving cream on my face. Kate reenters the bathroom and stands beside me, putting makeup on. Her hair is damp but the robe is gone. In its place is a mouthwatering matching bra-and-panty set.</p><p>They\u2019re pink silk with a black lace overlay. The panties are high cut\u2014bikini style\u2014and the bra pushes her tits up and together, creating a sexy-as-all-hell deep cle**age line. She dusts powder onto her face while I check her out.</p><p>\u201cNew underwear?\u201d I keep a mental catalog of all of Kate\u2019s undergarments, organized by color and style. I\u2019ve never seen these before. I definitely would\u2019ve remembered them.</p><p>She turns her hips, showing me the goods. \u201cYeah, aren\u2019t they cute?\u201d</p><p>Cute? No. Boner inducing? Definitely.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a La Perla boutique downstairs. I bought them before our spa treatments.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but contemplate what she was thinking when she bought them. I mean, a steamy night at home after James is asleep is one thing\u2014a new outfit always makes that more interesting. But tonight we won\u2019t even be hanging out together. Depending on what condition we\u2019re in when we make it back to the room, we\u2019ll be lucky if we even pass out next to each other.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>That one syllable gives her pause. The hand that was applying eyeliner stops and she looks at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I keep shaving. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any . . . other . . . underwear with you?\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkles. \u201cSure I do. You don\u2019t like these?\u201d</p><p>I rinse my razor in the sink. \u201cNo . . . they\u2019re fine. I just thought maybe you could wear something different. Something whiter, cotton, more full coverage.\u201d</p><p>A triple-locked chastity belt would also suffice.</p><p>Her head tilts, trying to figure out where I\u2019m going with this. \u201cNo, Drew, I didn\u2019t bring any granny panties with me.\u201d</p><p>You think I\u2019m crazy, I know. But I\u2019m not. I told you a long time ago\u2014I play chess. I don\u2019t just think about the next move; I think about the move five moves from now. So I can\u2019t help but question why the hell would Kate buy new panties that would make any man with half a pulse want to sink to his knees in front of her and shred them with his teeth? It\u2019s like . . . when a woman shaves her legs before a first date, even if she\u2019s wearing pants. Maybe she doesn\u2019t realize it, maybe she doesn\u2019t want to admit it\u2014but the only reason she\u2019s doing it is because some part of her brain is hoping she\u2019ll get laid.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>Kate just looks sideways at me. I pat my chin with a hand towel while she finishes her makeup. As she smooths gloss over her succulent lips, I can\u2019t help but speak up.</p><p>\u201cFlavored lip gloss, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it.\u201d She puts the cap on the gloss with a snap and drops it in her bag. Then she turns toward me quickly. \u201cYou need to stop. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what? I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. I know what\u2019s going on in that deviant head of yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cross my arms. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so. You\u2019re having this whole conversation with yourself about why I would buy new underwear and who I\u2019m going to let see it. Then you\u2019re thinking, why am I putting on flavored lip gloss? Why not just plain lip gloss\u2014unless I want someone to taste it?\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cBut the truth is, I bought the underwear for me. Because having bras and underwear that match make me feel more put together. And you should know, Mr. I See Everything, that the flavored lip gloss is the only gloss I use. Every day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound awfully defensive, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t defensive. This is a natural reaction to having to deal with the twisted way you view the world.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other for a few seconds, arms crossed, not giving an inch. Until Kate does. She plucks a tissue from the box on the back of the toilet and wipes the gloss off her lips. With a ring of sarcasm in her tone she asks, \u201cThere. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>I should be. I mean\u2014I won, right? But it\u2019s kind of hard to be happy when you\u2019re acting like a douche.</p><p>\u201cAnd since the underwear concerns you so much\u201d\u2014she slides the scrap of silk and lace down her legs and tosses it to me\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t wear any.\u201d</p> <p>She moves to exit the bathroom, but I step in front of her. \u201cWhoa! Wait up\u2014let\u2019s pause the crazy talk for a second.\u201d</p><p>I hold Kate\u2019s gaze for a few seconds. Then\u2014thoroughly contrite\u2014I sink to my knees in front of her.</p><p>Her arms are still folded, but her eyes soften. Kate likes me on my knees.</p><p>\u201cYour point is well taken.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rise in feigned innocence. \u201cWhat point is that?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThat I should trust you. That I do trust you.\u201d I pick up one foot and kiss her light-pink-painted toes, before sliding it through the leg of the underwear. Kate drops her arms, using my shoulders for balance, as I repeat the action with the other foot. I slide the panties up her legs, kissing each thigh reverently as I go. \u201cEvery flavored-lip-gloss-slathered, f**k-hot-panty-covered inch of you, I trust.\u201d</p> <p>She smiles forgivingly as I retrieve the gloss and replace it on those flawless lips. She rubs them together, then she sighs. \u201cI already told you this bachelorette-party thing is not worth it if it\u2019s going to cause problems between us. Be honest if you can\u2019t handle it. Do you want me to tell Delores to call tonight off?\u201d</p><p>Doesn\u2019t that just make me feel like the biggest insecure pu**y that ever walked the face of the earth? But we should examine this moment more closely for a second. Because in life, we make choices\u2014ones that seem completely harmless and totally insignificant.</p><p>Until they play out.</p><p>Only in hindsight do we realize the monumental effect our decisions have. It\u2019s the businessman who decides to go in to work a few minutes late and misses a fatal collision by seconds. The teenager who chooses to hold a grudge against her mother, and it turns out to be the last conversation they ever have. The guy on the street who finds a dollar and uses it to buy a winning lottery ticket.</p><p>Small choices can lead to huge consequences.</p><p>I was trying to be unselfish. I wanted to do the right thing.</p><p>You can bet your ass I won\u2019t be making that mistake again.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s calling anything off,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cI had a jealous-dickhead seizure\u2014completely temporary. The green-eyed monster will stay in his cage the rest of the weekend. The one-eyed monster will want to play with you later on.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs and takes my face in her hands. \u201cMy panties are for your eyes only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Kate stretches up and kisses me. And I taste strawberry. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go out with the guys and be assaulted by money-hungry strippers\u2014and I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to go out with the girls and be surrounded by horny, half-naked men\u2014and it won\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the stable couple in the group now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a good time\u2014no problems.\u201d</p><p>When I told her that? I honestly believed it.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Some men wear expensive suits because they want to feel as if they have money, even if they don\u2019t. Others wear them because they want to show people how much money they have. For me, it\u2019s all about the mind-set. The attitude. I\u2019ve never had a problem with confidence, but for guys who do, a custom-fitted suit makes you walk taller, stand straighter. It makes your balls bigger and gives off that GoodFellas, don\u2019t-fuck-with-me kind of vibe.</p><p>I unbutton the jacket of my charcoal Ermenegildo Zegna and pour myself three fingers of Scotch from the wet bar in the living room. Jack, Matthew, and Steven share my affinity for a well-made suit and are decked out in their own Gucci, Newman, and Armani respectively. Our stud quotient is high\u2014any female within a twenty-foot radius is bound to get caught in our tractor beam.</p><p>Then Warren walks out of his room. Wearing a wrinkled green T-shirt, tan carpenter shorts, and sandals. Yes\u2014frigging sandals.</p><p>I take a sip of my drink and stare at him. \u201cIf I\u2019d known we were going to the skate park, I would\u2019ve brought my board.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s perplexed. Then he looks at the rest of us and back at his own attire. He shrugs. \u201cI like to be comfortable. You guys look like you\u2019re going to a funeral. I look relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a loser,\u201d I argue. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unacceptable for tonight. My guidance will only get you so far. If you wanna attract quality snatch? You need to step up your game. That means a half-decent suit, or at least a pair of pressed slacks\u2014preferably ones not made from the same material as prison jumpsuits.\u201d I toss back the rest of my drink. \u201cAnd what the hell is with your hair?\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s wavy, light brown locks are less tamed than usual. They\u2019re higher\u2014poofier\u2014like an old lady fresh from the hairdresser. He pats the top of his head self-consciously. \u201cI forgot my gel. But it\u2019s cool\u2014chicks dig the curls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if it\u2019s 1998 and your name is Justin Timberlake.\u201d</p><p>Jack intervenes. \u201cI\u2019ll hook you up, dude. I always bring my buzzer along. We\u2019ll trim the mop-top, slick it back\u2014your own mother won\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>Steven sets his Scotch down on a coaster. Then he taps his chin thoughtfully. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll call the concierge\u2014have them send over something from the Armani boutique near the lobby.\u201d He eyes Warren up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re a thirty, maybe a thirty-two waist, with a slim-cut jacket. A light blue tie will really bring out the color of your eyes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to another edition of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.</p><p>And Matthew makes it so much worse. He claps his fingertips together daintily and says in a high-pitched voice, \u201cMakeover time!\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow in his direction. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later Warren is decked out in a slick navy suit, black shirt, and shiny Prada shoes. His hair has a neat wet look\u2014short on top, combed back at the sides. He looks . . . passable. Extremely awkward and uncomfortable\u2014but passable.</p><p>I stand in front of him and brush off his shoulders, inspecting his clothes like a general at boot camp.</p><p>While he whines like a bitch. \u201cIt itches.\u201d He rolls his neck and steps from one foot to the other.</p><p>\u201cStop f**king fidgeting.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls at the collar. \u201cIt\u2019s stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s new\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be. Stand up straight.\u201d Jesus, do I sound like my father or what?</p><p>I drape the blue tie around his neck, to demonstrate how to tie one. But then I think better of it.</p><p>There\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ll end up strangling him with the damn thing. And a trip out to the desert to bury a body would be a major inconvenience right now.</p><p>Steven, who has turned patience into an art form, takes my place. \u201cOkay, Billy, the rabbit comes out of his burrow, goes around the tree . . .\u201d</p><p>You can tell a lot about a person by the game he or she plays at a casino. Adrenaline junkies, those willing to take big risks for an even bigger payoff, they orbit the craps tables. Craps is a game of skillful luck. It requires a certain finesse\u2014quick thinking and decisive action. Then there\u2019s blackjack. Unless you\u2019re a freak-of-nature card counter, you have to stick to the rules. Assume each card\u2019s a ten, stay at fifteen even if every fiber of your being is screaming to hit, and wait for the dealer to bust. If you don\u2019t know how to play, stay the f**k away. Blackjackers tend to throw quite the hissy fit if you take \u201ctheir\u201d card. After blackjack, there\u2019s roulette. Roulette is all about odds. Play black or red and you have a slightly less than 50 percent chance of winning. Statistically speaking, it\u2019s your best shot at beating the house.</p> <p>At the low end of the gambling totem pole are the slot machines. A monkey could play them. Put your money in, pull the lever; money, lever; money, lever. They require no proficiency or knowledge and they\u2019re programmed to favor the casino. The longer you play, the more likely you are to go broke.</p><p>The only people who play slots are the aged, the mentally infirm, and suckers.</p><p>\u201cCool\u2014slot machines! That\u2019s all I play. I\u2019m so good at them,\u201d Warren says.</p><p>Saw that one coming a mile away, didn\u2019t you?</p><p>I slap him on the back and steer him toward the high-roller section. \u201cTonight you\u2019re gonna play craps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to play craps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to watch and learn. Craps is a man\u2019s game. All the hottest girls hang out at the craps table because that\u2019s where the money is. If the mountain won\u2019t come to Muhammad, than he has to go to the motherfucking mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mountain?\u201d</p> <p>For a second I forgot I was talking to a real, live sphincter. \u201cNever mind. Just pay attention.\u201d</p><p>Matthew, Warren, and I get our chips while Jack heads over to blackjack. Steven gets comfortable at a $5,000-minimum roulette table. He\u2019s all about statistics and odds. At the craps table, I\u2019m rolling and Matthew handles the bets. Right out of the gate, I roll a seven, and the crowd goes wild.</p><p>Matthew pounds my back excitedly. \u201cYes! Mickey f**king Mantle! Keep \u2019em coming!\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, we\u2019ve tripled our money. The number of bystanders around the table has doubled. Warren still has no idea how to play the game, but he takes his cues from the crowd and responds accordingly. Everyone is laughing, drinking, elbowing in to place money on the table\u2014trying to get a piece of the action. It\u2019s wild. Fun. It feels like the old days\u2014just me and the boys out for a good time. There are no worries about kids or weddings, no stress about work or any of the bullshit that real life abounds in.</p><p>Then real life taps me on the shoulder.</p><p>Dice in hand, I turn around. And come face-to-face with the dark-haired, blue-eyed flight attendant from the airplane. She\u2019s wearing a black, strapless cocktail dress and heels high enough to put her at eye level with me. She\u2019s not alone. In triangle formation behind her are two equally attractive women. One is blond and baby faced, shorter, with fuller curves. The other is a brunette with blond streaks, olive skin, and full, ripe lips.</p><p>Blue-Eyes smiles wide. \u201cHello again.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be rude, but\u2014screw it\u2014I\u2019ll go with rude. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said this was where you were staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also said we\u2019d be busy.\u201d</p><p>She responds coyly, \u201cBut I saw the look you gave me. I knew you only said that so your girlfriend wouldn\u2019t get upset. So she wouldn\u2019t think you were interested.\u201d</p><p>Okay\u2014I\u2019m all for women who are assertive. You are sexual beings with needs. Own it. Relish it. But coming on strong to a guy who blatantly doesn\u2019t want you isn\u2019t going to change his mind.</p><p>It just makes you look pathetic.</p><p>Her hand reaches out to rub my chest, but I catch her wrist before she makes contact.</p><p>\u201cExcept I\u2019m really not interested.\u201d</p><p>Like a horny ghost, Jack appears at my side. \u201cI, on the other hand, am very interested.\u201d He takes her elbow and leads her away. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Drew\u2014he\u2019s a blind fool. How about we get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>The brunette friend fades into the crowd, but the baby face just stands there looking blank. She twirls her hair in that \u201cdumb blonde\u201d way that makes me suspect her IQ may actually be lower than Warren\u2019s. But she\u2019s hot\u2014definitely a step above the trough he\u2019s been feeding at lately. I nudge him with my arm and jerk my chin in the blonde\u2019s direction.</p><p>He wipes his hands on his pants nervously. Then he speaks to her. \u201cHey, wanna hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>And all my hard work goes down the f**king tubes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the blanket say when it fell off the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sheet.\u201d</p><p>Blondie\u2019s lips pout in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Is the blanket, like, computerized?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Warren\u2019s face falls. \u201cNo . . . it\u2019s . . . let me try another one.

That\u2019s Premium Pussy for Warren, in case you weren\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cMy friend here is a singer. Billy Warren? He has to save his voice for his next concert\u2014doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes open wide and her tone is dim-witted. \u201cMy horoscope said I was going to meet someone famous today! Billy Warren\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize you. I totes loved your last single.\u201d</p><p>Matthew calls, \u201cDrew, come on\u2014you gotta roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I fish a handful of quarters from my pocket and slap them into Warren\u2019s hands. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you kids go play the slots? You\u2019ll be safer there.\u201d</p><p>With a giggle, Blondie informs me, \u201cThe way the wheels go around and around is so funny! I love slot machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes so much sense,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>Could you imagine the children these two would have? Maybe genetic selection isn\u2019t evil after all.</p><p>I shove Warren away. \u201cAnd remember, don\u2019t f**king talk. At all.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and gives me two thumbs up. He looks so grateful and brainless, I can\u2019t help but laugh as they walk away.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Matthew and I are still on fire. Unstoppable. He\u2019s taken over rolling, and I shift our chips around, betting big because we\u2019re up by a lot. Matthew rolls a two and the room erupts in cheers. I give him a man shake and double our bet.</p><p>Which is when a certain semi-stalker flight attendant shows up next to me. Again.</p><p>\u201cCan I give you a blow?\u201d</p> <p>My ears immediately perk up. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She points to Matthew. \u201cThe dice. Can I blow them for you? For luck?\u201d</p><p>How about you blow me instead? I immediately think. Because I may be a man in a committed relationship\u2014but I\u2019m still a man.</p><p>That is the curse of evolution. Instincts. It\u2019s why most guys have such a hard time with monogamy. Because our natural drive is to spread our seed around\u2014offer it to as many willing partners as possible. We don\u2019t have to act on it, but the impulse is always there. So the next time you think your guy is flirting with some random ho bag? Try not to get too upset. He\u2019s waging an epic internal battle against his own body\u2019s inclinations.</p><p>\u201cNot needed,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWe\u2019re on a streak\u2014never mess with a streak. These dice are doing fine on their own.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes in my pocket. The text from Kate says the girls are finally ready and on their way down to the casino.</p><p>Flight girl leans over my shoulder and looks at my phone. \u201cCute kid. He yours?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s referring to the picture of James on my main screen. I took it a few weeks ago, when I was trying to get James to eat a bowl of pasta. He wasn\u2019t pleased with his meal and told me so by dumping the whole f**king thing on his head.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She moves close to my ear and cuts me off. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to play these games. I have a hotel room waiting two blocks away. I want you. It\u2019s obvious you want me. Stop fighting it.\u201d</p><p>I lean back. \u201cDid we forget to take our meds this morning?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. Sounds kind of like Norman Bates, doesn\u2019t she? Throughout my debauched pre-Kate years, I encountered my fair share of Fatal Attraction, I\u2019ll-never-fuck-you-even-if-you-are-that-hot-because-you-obviously-have-several-screws-loose women. They\u2019re out there and they\u2019re not hard to spot. I was a master at avoiding, deflecting, and escaping their fanatical grasp.</p><p>But it looks as if I\u2019m out of practice. Because before I can stop her, she swipes the phone out of my hand and moves back a few steps.</p><p>Anger flashes on my face and in my voice. \u201cGive me back my goddamn phone.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cCome and get it.\u201d She puts my phone down her frigging dress.</p><p>You have got to be kidding me. I turn to Matthew. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to help me out with this?\u201d</p><p>He looks down at the chips, then back to me. \u201cThere\u2019s like a hundred grand here, man.\u201d</p><p>Of course there is.</p><p>Have you ever seen Flash Gordon? You know that scene where Flash has to put his hand in the rock? The one with the grotesque, prickly snake thing inside it, just waiting to bite him? That\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019m feeling right now.</p><p>I crack my knuckles and shake my hands out. \u201cCover me. I\u2019m going in.\u201d Then I shove my hand down the front of her dress. I limit the physical contact as best I can, but the dress is tight. So upon entry, I immediately realize this chick is sporting a fake set of tits. And a nipple ring.</p><p>Don\u2019t judge me. Do I look like I\u2019m enjoying this, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Psycho Flight Girl, on the other hand, seems to be enjoying it a whole bunch, if her moans are any indication. \u201cOooh, that\u2019s nice. A little to the left.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and try to find a happy place. Then, the most improbable thing happens. Or, an absolute certainty, depending on your point of view.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?!\u201d</p><p>Care to guess whose voice that is?</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to turn around, but I do. \u201cKate!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, trying my damnedest to deny that any of this is happening. \u201cThis isn\u2019t . . . I\u2019m not . . .\u201d Yes, my arm is still biceps deep inside this chick\u2019s dress.</p><p>I rip it out.</p><p>And point at her like an older sister accusing a younger one of wearing her favorite sweater. \u201cShe took my phone and won\u2019t give it back.\u201d</p><p>Sensing I\u2019m in deep shit, Warren and Jack wander over to watch the show. Matthew just keeps gambling.</p><p>Kate struts forward and holds out her hand, simultaneously subjecting the woman to the thousand-watt bitch-glare.</p><p>The psycho woman rolls her eyes and takes the phone out of her dress. Kate gets an ever-ready bottle of antibacterial spray out of her purse, squirts the phone with it, wipes it with a tissue, then hands it back to me\u2014spraying my hand for good measure.</p><p>After that, all of Kate\u2019s pissed-off radiance turns back to the flight attendant. Her voice is low and deadly serious. \u201cI put up with your shit on the plane because I didn\u2019t want to spend the first hours of my vacation in the custody of federal air marshals. But we\u2019re not on the plane now.\u201d Kate holds up her left hand. \u201cSee this ring? It means I belong to him. And the tattoo of my name on his arm means he belongs to me. All of him. His dick is a compass, and I\u2019m due north\u2014it only points to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t hear every day.</p><p>\u201cSo you are going to disappear, right now. Or I\u2019m going to kick your ass from one end of this casino to the other. And you might want to take a look around\u2014\u2019cause it\u2019s a damn big casino.\u201d</p><p>The flight attendant\u2019s eyes narrow into slits. As she replies, her head does that urban-slide thing that looks incredibly f**king stupid but means she\u2019s ready for war. \u201cYou think you can take me? You and what army, bitch?\u201d</p><p>Erin walks up and stands next to Kate. \u201cThis one.\u201d</p> <p>Psycho laughs\u2014and I kind of don\u2019t blame her. Even in heels, Erin is shorter than Kate by about two inches. Together, they\u2019re not exactly poster girls for intimidation. Until Dee-Dee comes on the scene. And although her physical stature isn\u2019t that different from Erin\u2019s and Kate\u2019s, the disturbed, unbalanced look in her eyes makes up for it in a big way.</p><p>I shiver.</p><p>Psycho Woman stands her ground, but her expression is a little less sure. Then comes the icing on the cake. Which would be my sister\u2014standing a foot above the other girls like the mighty Amazon she is.</p><p>Her smile is downright scary. \u201cThe way my hormones are raging, I would like nothing more than to rip out those cheap extensions on your head and nail them to my wall like a hunting trophy.\u201d</p><p>Now Psycho actually looks frightened. She glances around, searching for backup. My sister does a head slide of her own. \u201cDon\u2019t look for your friends. They\u2019ve moved on to fatter, stupider targets.\u201d</p> <p>Delores clenches her fists. \u201cThe cheese stands alone.\u201d She sniffs the air. \u201cAnd it\u2019s stinky. Ever heard of feminine wipes? Might want to invest in some.\u201d</p><p>As hilarious and . . . disturbingly sexy . . . as this whole situation is to watch, I don\u2019t want Kate to have to deal with a wack job because of me. She\u2019s had to do that enough already. So I take the path of least resistance and grab a security guard. \u201cWe\u2019re guests at the main villa, and this . . . person\u201d\u2014I gesture to Psycho\u2014\u201cis harassing me and my fianc\u00e9e. I\u2019d like her removed from the premises immediately.\u201d</p><p>Psycho Woman doesn\u2019t take it well. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I just did.\u201d</p><p>Security Guy checks my hotel key. \u201cSorry about the trouble, Mr. Evans.\u201d Then he tells her firmly, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to come with me, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u2014I know my rights! Don\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p> <p>When more security comes on the scene, she screeches again, like a charging boar. Before they drag her out, she spits one final threat my way. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, ass**le!\u201d</p><p>So much for friendly skies.</p><p>Then she\u2019s gone. But the fun\u2019s not over yet. This\u2014right here\u2014is my favorite part.</p><p>Because Warren says, \u201cYou should\u2019ve decked the bitch, Katie. I haven\u2019t seen you throw down in years.\u201d</p><p>His blonde companion may not have two brain cells to rub together, but she\u2019s loyal. \u201cHey\u2014that\u2019s my friend! Bastard.\u201d</p><p>And then\u2014</p><p>Slap.</p><p>She gets him dead in the face. Hard enough to leave an instant crimson handprint.</p> <p>Blondie stomps off dramatically. While holding his flaming cheek, Warren looks at me and says, \u201cUgly girls don\u2019t hit so f**king hard.\u201d</p><p>Once the excitement dies down, everyone pairs off to talk and continue gambling. Leaving Kate and me relatively alone. \u201cWhat was Billy saying about ugly girls?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I wave my hand. \u201cIrrelevant. Let\u2019s go back to the part where my dick is a compass and you\u2019re due north.\u201d</p><p>She covers her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I said that.\u201d</p><p>I take her hands away. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed. I\u2019m very proud. Just out of curiosity\u2014we\u2019re talking about a monstrously huge compass, right?\u201d</p><p>Kate pushes me on the shoulder. \u201cStop fishing for compliments. Let\u2019s talk about the stewardess who followed you here\u2014am I going to have to get you a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>Only then do I notice her outfit. Black miniskirt, black, high-heeled boots that end just below her knee, and a sparkly pink top that leaves nothing to the imagination.</p><p>Stunning.</p><p>I walk around her like a predator circling a tasty morsel. \u201cNo, but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wearing, I\u2019m thinking about hiring a whole team of bodyguards for you.\u201d I finger the pink, sequined crown on her head. It says BRIDE-TO-BE. \u201cThat\u2019s a keeper.\u201d</p><p>She touches it too. \u201cLike that, do you?\u201d</p><p>I imagine turning it into a game. Seeing how long Kate can keep the crown balanced on her head while I do unspeakable things to her. \u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee-Dee got it for me.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cEven a broken clock is right twice a day.\u201d</p><p>The broken clock herself yells, \u201cAll right, ladies\u2014our chariot has arrived!\u201d</p><p>Matthew cashes out our winnings. I hold Kate\u2019s hand as we all walk through the casino together. Matthew and Delores bicker playfully as we approach the lobby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing,\u201d he tells her in a teasing voice.</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Remember that the next time you\u2019re in the mood to play lecherous photographer and nude model\u2014and I tell you to go screw your camera lens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . I\u2019m still not apologizing.\u201d</p><p>Do I know what they\u2019re arguing about? No. Do I care enough to ask? Not really.</p><p>We make it outside to the front entrance of the hotel. Parked at the curb is the biggest, pinkest limo I\u2019ve ever freaking seen. It\u2019s like a bottle of Pepto-Bismol on wheels. Neon lights pulse on the inside, and flashing strobes spin from the roof.</p><p>I look at Dee-Dee. \u201cA pink limo? That\u2019s not too gaudy.\u201d</p><p>She smiles proudly. \u201cThis is Vegas, baby\u2014gaudy is king. We should retire here.\u201d</p><p>With that, she kisses Matthew and starts to walk away. Before she can take two steps, he grabs her, pulls her back, and kisses her longer and more roughly. When she\u2019s slightly dazed, Matthew grins and sends her off toward the limo. Erin waves and follows her.</p><p>I put my hands on Kate\u2019s shoulders to make sure she\u2019s paying attention. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone buy you a drink. And with the way you\u2019re dressed, they\u2019re definitely gonna try.\u201d</p><p>She smiles indulgently. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t put your drink down after you have it. Someone could slip something in there when you\u2019re not looking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes\u2014shit like that does happen. When you\u2019ve been on the bar scene long enough, you get a clear-cut picture of just how f**ked-up the world\u2014and the people in it\u2014are.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>I grimace. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d When it comes to screwing, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m not into. Except that. The whole \u201cWho\u2019s your daddy?\u201d thing is a buzzkill. It\u2019s weird\u2014it makes me think of James, or my father, and in either case . . . no f**king thanks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some twenty-one-year-old on her first trek to the bars, Drew. I can handle myself.\u201d</p> <p>My sister joins the conversation. \u201cAnd just in case she can\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d Alexandra pulls various weapons out of her large leather bag. \u201cI\u2019ve got my Mace, pepper spray, highly illegal Taser gun, and if all else fails . . .\u201d She whips out a four-inch metal rod that, with a flick of her wrist, expands to the size of a police-issue nightstick\u2014with pointy barbs on the end. \u201cI call it the nut scrambler. Feel better now?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cA lot better, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She speaks quietly to Steven, then Alexandra climbs into the limo too. I wrap my arms around Kate, trying to cop one last feel. With her head on my chest, she promises, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I joke, \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to make a run for it. They\u2019ll never catch us.\u201d</p> <p>She giggles. Then tilts her head up and presses her mouth softly to mine. Against my lips she murmurs, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I pull back and trace her jaw with my fingertips. \u201cAnd I will always love you more.\u201d</p><p>She smiles one final time and disappears into the bowels of the hideous limousine.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>After the girls\u2019 car pulls away, Matthew says, \u201cOur ride\u2019s down thatta way, boys.\u201d He jerks his thumb toward a sleek, black stretch limo at the end of the block.</p><p>As we walk I ask Steven, \u201cYou and Alexandra get your shit straight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEh . . . not yet. But her attitude is definitely improving. I was never really worried. Your sister likes to act like she runs the show, but we all know who\u2019s really in charge.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. That would be my sister.</p><p>He pounds his chest. \u201cI\u2019m the man.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have the heart to destroy Steven\u2019s delusions, so I just tap him on the back and say, \u201cYeah, Steven. You the man.\u201d</p><p>Our first stop was Carnevino, the finest steak house in Las Vegas, where we treated ourselves to a superb dinner and first-class red wine. The atmosphere was impressive\u2014high ceilings, Italian-marble floors, antique furniture. Next we headed to Havana Club\u2014an elite, old-school cigar bar.</p><p>That\u2019s where we are right now. See us there? In that small, private back room, sitting in cushiony leather chairs. A hand-rolled cigar in one hand and swirling an amber-liquid-filled glass in the other, while heavy-scented smoke circles our heads.</p><p>Warren lets out a choking cough for the third time.</p><p>I warn him, \u201cStop inhaling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he rasps. \u201cInhaling is like a reflex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better \u2018help it\u2019 or you\u2019re gonna be barfing up a lung soon.\u201d</p><p>I speak from experience. When Matthew and I were twelve, we swiped a few of my father\u2019s Cubans and lit them up on the rooftop of Matthew\u2019s parents\u2019 building. Then we hurled our guts out over the edge, barely missing several unsuspecting pedestrians on the sidewalk below.</p><p>Warren sips his brandy and grimaces.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste,\u201d Steven tells him. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Warren looks into his glass. \u201cWhy do I want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u201d\u2014I spread my arms wide, motioning to the finely fashioned room around us\u2014\u201cthis is the high life, man.\u201d</p><p>He wrinkles his nose. \u201cI think I like the low life better.\u201d</p><p>I put the cigar back in my mouth and talk around it. \u201cAgain\u2014not surprising.\u201d</p><p>Jack leans forward. \u201cBefore we move on to the main event of the night, why don\u2019t we get the toasts and roasts out of the way now?\u201d</p><p>Steven raises his glass. \u201cI second that motion.\u201d</p><p>I grin and stand up. \u201cAll right. I\u2019d just like to say thank you, to you all, for taking time out of your busy schedules to share this momentous occasion with me. If I\u2019m going out with a bang, there\u2019s nobody else I\u2019d rather have with me than you guys.\u201d I glance at Warren. \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><p>Then I raise my glass. \u201cIn any case, a toast: to the best friends a guy could ask for. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>We drink. There are claps and hear, hears all around, then I sit down.</p><p>Warren stands up. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna do some roasting, I should go first.\u201d The other guys give him the floor. He straightens up, clears his throat, and with a serious expression looks at each of us. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of myself as a one-man wolf pack\u2014\u201d</p><p>Everyone cracks up. Who knew Warren had enough brain capacity for a sense of humor?</p><p>Matthew throws a wrapper at him. \u201cYou took my line, f**ker.\u201d</p><p>Warren laughs too. \u201cBut seriously\u2014I was a one-man wolf pack . . . with two she-wolves. And even though things were messy when Kate and Evans first hooked up, it all worked out. She\u2019s happy\u2014and that\u2019s all I ever really wanted for her. And now, our packs have joined. And there\u2019s more wolves, and she-wolves, and wolf pups . . . the pups are cool. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, I never had a big family . . . but . . . now I know what it feels like to be a part of one. It\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>He raises his glass in my direction. \u201cSo I\u2019d like to toast Drew and Kate\u2019s marriage. If you ever break her heart, I\u2019ll hold you down while Dee-Dee breaks your balls.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t that a lovely visual.</p><p>Still, I nod to Warren as he sits down. He takes a big chug of his drink and nods in return.</p><p>Then Jack stands. He chomps his cigar thoughtfully for a moment. \u201cI will never get married. I used to think Drew and I were on the same page about that. Women are like Kleenex\u2014soft, disposable, a convenient place to cum.\u201d Everyone chuckles. \u201cAnd then Kate Brooks walked into our office. And because Drew is a smart guy, he realized right away what the rest of us didn\u2019t. Kate isn\u2019t some plain, ordinary tissue. Kate is a hankie. The kind you hold on to. The kind you embroider your initials on. Kate is a keeper.\u201d Jack looks at me. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re one of my best friends, I\u2019m really glad you get to keep her for the rest of your lives.\u201d He raises his glass, \u201cTo Drew\u2014a lucky, undeserving son of a bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We raise out glasses and laughingly drink to Jack\u2019s unconventional\u2014yet extremely accurate\u2014toast.</p><p>Next up is Steven. He wobbles a little as he stands. He takes a big breath, holds it a moment. \u201cMawwiage. Mawwiage is what bwings us togethew today.\u201d</p><p>All of us laugh, except for Jack. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s seen The Princess Bride. It\u2019s Kate\u2019s favorite movie, so I\u2019ve sat through it a few times. Definitely a chick flick\u2014although that Inigo Montoya guy was pretty badass.</p><p>\u201cAnd wuv, tru wuv, will fowow you foweva . . .\u201d Steven grins and clears his throat. \u201cBut seriously, being the most married guy here\u2014it\u2019s my job to warn you. Women change after marriage. It\u2019s not all candlelight dinners and lingerie, no matter what Vogue says. And the sex changes too. Sometimes it\u2019s routine, sometimes it\u2019s nonexistent . . . and sometimes it\u2019s freakier than you would have ever thought possible.\u201d</p> <p>I cover my ears. Because usually Steven keeps his and my sister\u2019s bedroom activities to himself. And I absolutely f**king prefer it that way.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you get married, the most important thing isn\u2019t being in love. It\u2019s making sure you marry your best friend. A partner\u2014the person you want to share the good times, the shitty times, and everything in between with. You\u2019ve found that partner in Kate. You\u2019re my best friend, Drew\u2014and I love you, man. But now? I get to be proud of you too. And I am\u2014damn proud. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>I raise my glass back at Steven. \u201cThanks, man. It means a lot.\u201d And it does.</p><p>Finally, Matthew takes center stage. \u201cI am probably more grateful than anybody that Drew and Kate got together. Because of Kate, I met my angelic wife, Dee. And although sometimes she\u2019s a pain in the ass, more than anything . . . she completes me.\u201d Matthew glances down at his glass a moment, spinning the liquid around, before looking back up. \u201cI\u2019ve known Drew my whole life. We were like . . . best friends before we were born. So I\u2019ve seen him have a lot of successes. I\u2019ve been there when he scored the best grades, landed the biggest clients, nailed the hottest girls. And through all those times, Drew looked . . . satisfied, but unsurprised. Like all those accomplishments were just . . . expected. He worked hard for them\u2014he always deserved them\u2014and he knew it.\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s eyes meet mine and he speaks to me directly. \u201cBut when you look at Kate? You look . . . grateful. Thankful. Like even though you know you\u2019re the shit, you still can\u2019t quite believe that you get to be the lucky bastard who has her. And . . . it\u2019s a really good look for you, man.\u201d Matthew raises his glass. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna wish you happiness, \u2019cause you\u2019ve already got that. So I\u2019ll just say, may the road rise to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face. May you live as long as you want, and never want as long as you live. May there be a generation of children on the children of your children. May you live to be a hundred years, with one extra year to repent. And may the saddest day of your and Kate\u2019s future be no worse than the happiest day of your past.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Matthew finishes his speech, I\u2019m choked the f**k up. I down the rest of my drink to hide it. Then I stand up and hug him. A drunk, backslapping, lift-his-feet-off-the-floor kind of hug.</p><p>Good times . . .</p><p>After the brandy and the cigars are exhausted, we head outside. Matthew wants a cigarette; apparently the cigars didn\u2019t increase our chances of developing lung cancer enough for his liking. We hang on the corner while he lights up. Across the street is a sleek, trendy-looking bar. Loud, raucous music seeps out through the frosted, neon-framed windows, and its parking lot is filled to capacity with high-end, souped-up sports cars. Next to the bar\u2019s door, on a sidewalk bench, sits a short-haired platinum blonde with a killer body. A black tank top, denim skirt, and ankle-length, black boots show it off well. She\u2019s hot and she\u2019s alone. It\u2019s a prime opportunity for Dipshit to test out the skills I\u2019m benevolently trying to teach him. Maybe wiggle his way under her skirt. Or possibly get Maced.</p><p>Either scenario would be a win-win in my book.</p><p>\u201cHey, Warren,\u201d I call. \u201cCheck it out. Lonely girl, at night, on the Vegas streets\u2014a regular damsel in distress. Maybe you should go ask her if she needs a hand, strike up a conversation?\u201d</p><p>Jack agrees. \u201cThe chivalry card works every time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBehaving like a gentleman is actually very important to me,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014you\u2019re a regular white knight, dude.\u201d Jack snorts.</p><p>With liquid courage flowing through his system, Warren struts across the street. He stops a few feet away from her, which is smart. Don\u2019t want to make her nervous by invading her personal space. He starts with the direct approach. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She glances up quickly, then giggles and looks away just as fast. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Warren inches closer. \u201cSo . . . you need a ride? We\u2019re not serial killers or anything. Just a few guys, hanging out. And we have a limo. You could hang with us or I could give you a lift, wherever you wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>Her head turns toward the bar, just a bit nervously. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to wait here for my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Warren sits beside her on the bench. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of man leaves a gorgeous woman like you sitting out on the street. If you were my girl, I\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>Good boy. I feel that I should throw him a treat or pat his head.</p> <p>And then . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k did you just say?\u201d</p><p>That little tidbit was growled by a beefy, blond-haired guy who just walked out from the side of the bar, with four other equally large men behind him. What they lack in height, they make up for in solid girth\u2014the type my mother would have called \u201cbig boned.\u201d They\u2019re probably early to mid-twenties; one has a University of Nevada hat on, another wears a sweatshirt with Greek lettering.</p><p>Frat boys.</p><p>Although I was one of them once, I never realized how f**king obnoxious and annoying this particular breed can be, until after I graduated. They epitomize the phrase young, dumb, and full of cum. Because they travel in groups, they have that mob mentality\u2014emboldened, loud, and constantly trying to impress each other how far up the dick-o-meter their actions are.</p><p>And Billy Warren is in their crosshairs. Not good.</p><p>Warren begins to respond, \u201cI said\u2014\u201d</p><p>I jog over, with Jack, Matthew, and Steven hot on my heels, to make sure Warren doesn\u2019t get killed. Kate would not be pleased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blond Ape #1 shoves Warren\u2019s chest. The really strange thing is, it genuinely pisses me off. \u201cYou talkin\u2019 to my girlfriend, loser?\u201d He grabs the girl by the arm. \u201cI told you to wait, bitch\u2014I didn\u2019t say you could talk.\u201d</p><p>I step in front of Billy. \u201cHey, fellas\u2014I think there\u2019s been a little misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is any of your business.\u201d</p><p>I confess, \u201cYou have no idea how much I wish that were true. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not. My friend thought the girl needed help. He was looking out for her\u2014that\u2019s all. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour boyfriend made a major f**king foul, hitting on my girl. I\u2019m gonna take it out on his ass.\u201d Then he spits at my feet.</p><p>Classy.</p><p>I no longer feel like resolving this diplomatically. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re gonna be an ass**le about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>The girl tries to intervene. She puts a hand on the guy\u2019s chest while the other rubs his arm, trying to soothe the savage beast. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. Just let it go, Blair.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cBlair? Your name is Blair? Christ, no wonder you\u2019re so angry. You have my sincerest sympathy.\u201d Keeping my eyes on the group of numb-nuts, I motion to Matthew. \u201cYou see what happens when parents are careless with the naming? This is your future, man.\u201d</p> <p>In case you can\u2019t tell\u2014no, I\u2019m not intimidated by the loudmouth frat boy. Because he, like most bullies, is a pu**y. Real tough guys? Truly dangerous men? They\u2019re on the quiet side. They don\u2019t need to put on a show or announce all the pain they\u2019re going to inflict on you. They just do it, before you ever have the chance to be afraid. Or see it coming.</p><p>Blair steps toward me, but Warren pops in between us\u2014hands raised in submission.</p><p>\u201cHold up. Just wait\u2014this is between you and me, f**ker. Keep my friends out of it.\u201d</p><p>I look at Warren as if he\u2019s lost his mind. \u2019Cause I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019s the case. \u201cAre you nuts?\u201d</p><p>He looks back over his shoulder at me. \u201cKatie would never forgive me if you missed the wedding because you were in the hospital. And I grew up with Dee-Dee\u2014if there\u2019s one thing I know how to do, it\u2019s take a beating.\u201d</p><p>Right then and there, my opinion of Warren is forever altered. He\u2019s still an idiot\u2014as he just demonstrated. And because of his history with Kate, I\u2019ll never like him. But throwing himself on his sword like this? Trying to protect me and the guys? It takes balls\u2014brass ones. He just earned my respect.</p> <p>Matthew, Steven, and Jack are lined up behind me, tense and ready. I take a breath and ask, \u201cMatthew\u2014you cool with this plan?\u201d</p><p>He answers, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Jack, you up for it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles darkly. \u201cI\u2019m always up for it, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not? Screw it.\u201d</p><p>Those are the only answers I need. I step around Warren, closer to Blair. \u201cOkay\u2014you can kick the shit out of him, and the rest of us will just sit by and watch.\u201d</p><p>Confused shock registers on his face. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cNo, moron\u2014I\u2019m lying to you.\u201d By the time my words register in his addled brain, my fist is already flying. Right at the f**ker\u2019s nose, busting it wide-open.</p><p>Then all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Typically, I believe a sucker punch is a pansy move. Cowardly. But this is a street fight. A cage match. There are no rules. Fingers in the eye sockets, kicks to the nads\u2014it\u2019s all fair game. A bloodied Blair tackles me to the ground, while the melee rages around us.</p><p>I take a blow to the shoulder and the ribs, trying to protect my face. Warren had a valid point about the wedding thing. If my face is stitched up like Frankenstein\u2019s, it\u2019ll ruin the pictures.</p><p>I land a left hook to the dickhead\u2019s jaw, close enough to the injured nose to make him howl. It goes on like this for about five minutes, though it feels much longer.</p><p>Then the girl that started it all says the magic words: \u201cCops! Cops!\u201d</p><p>Every one of us responds like a high schooler at a beer bash.</p><p>We run. We break apart and scatter. The five of us make it back to the confines of the limo in record time, and the driver takes off. The flashing lights of Las Vegas\u2019s finest don\u2019t follow us. Thank God.</p><p>You may not understand it, but believe me when I tell you this was an awesome development to our evening. No matter how old he is, every guy thinks it\u2019s cool to drink, gamble, and then beat the shit out of somebody with his closest friends. We pass around a bottle of vodka and show off our battle wounds, bragging about how great we were.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that guy\u2019s teeth explode? Bam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had that big son of a bitch on the ropes. He was ready to cry for his ugly mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope that loser likes liquid meals, \u2019cause that\u2019s all he\u2019s gonna be able to have for a long time.\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of Grey Goose, then pour it on my bleeding knuckles.</p><p>Warren shakes his head and laments, \u201cMy luck with girls is crap.\u201d</p><p>No one disagrees. But what I\u2019ve come to accept is this: it\u2019s not his fault.</p><p>Really.</p><p>Warren is simply more pu**y than dick. It\u2019s how he was raised\u2014surrounded by bush. It\u2019s like . . . one of those weird news stories about a baby tiger that\u2019s adopted by a family of pigs. When it\u2019s older, it doesn\u2019t show its claws or pounce or growl.</p><p>It f**king oinks.</p><p>Unlike the rest of us, who had confident, strong men in our lives, Warren\u2019s only male exposure was whatever specimens Amelia brought home. Obviously, there were no freaking winners in that bunch.</p><p>After a minute, he asks, \u201cI really thought you were gonna let them kick my ass. What changed?\u201d</p><p>Matthew takes a drink from the bottle. \u201cFuck that. No man gets left behind.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cExactly. You know the first rule of wolf packs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take care of our own.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I think we should step back and take note of just how much alcohol the boys and I have consumed so far. There were the shots and beers at the pool, the Scotches in the room and at the casino, the wine with dinner, the brandy afterward, and now the vodka that we\u2019re passing around like winos huddled near a burning garbage can.</p><p>I\u2019m no lightweight\u2014but that\u2019s a lot of f**king booze. We\u2019re out-and-out walking saloons, for God\u2019s sake. Even though it\u2019s been spread out over hours, eventually that shit catches up to you. One minute you\u2019ve got it all under control, then you take that last shot. The scales get tipped, and you find yourself on the floor\u2014unable to walk or form a coherent sentence without drooling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remember this fact.</p><p>I have a feeling it\u2019s going to play a big part in whatever lies ahead.</p><p>Looking out the window at the dark desert landscape, I ask, \u201cWhere are we going again?\u201d</p><p>Matthew and Jack grin at each other. Jack says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to heaven, brother. No lie\u2014this place is like an oasis. Top-of-the-line women who know how to take care of a man. Nothing is off-limits\u2014T and A will be everywhere.\u201d He kisses his fingers. \u201cLike manna from heaven.\u201d</p> <p>I just shrug, unimpressed. But apparently Warren\u2019s impatient. \u201cDriver dude? What\u2019s the holdup? I can get out and walk faster than this.\u201d</p><p>The driver glances back at us in the rearview mirror. \u201cSorry, fellas. There\u2019s a Lincoln Town Car in front of me doin\u2019 twenty below the speed limit. She won\u2019t let me pass her.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and glance out the front window. Yep\u2014it\u2019s a grayhair. A whole clown car full of grayhairs, actually. You remember my feelings about senior-citizen drivers? In case you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just say this: menace to society.</p><p>Steven holds the bottle of vodka and takes a swig. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s talking to us or himself, but out of nowhere he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to be dead soon.\u201d</p><p>All eyes in the limo turn to him. Matthew asks, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about my life is half over. And there\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t done. I\u2019m not going to hold back anymore\u2014I\u2019m going carpe diem on this bitch from here on out.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cYou\u2019re just trashed. Don\u2019t go getting depressed on us now. If you start crying, I\u2019m throwing you out of the car while it\u2019s still moving.\u201d</p><p>Steven doesn\u2019t acknowledge my warning. He leans toward the partition separating us from the driver and slurs, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a hundred bucks if you can get up alongside \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>With no oncoming traffic, the driver crosses the double line and pulls even with the Lincoln.</p><p>Steven\u2019s words slush together as he gets to his feet. \u201cCrossing this one off the bucket list.\u201d Then he unbuckles his belt and grabs the waist of his pants\u2014yanking the suckers down to his ankles\u2014tighty whities and all.</p><p>Every guy in the car holds up his hands to try to block the spectacle. We groan and complain. \u201cMy eyes! They burn!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPut the boa constrictor back in his cage, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not the ass I planned on seeing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Our protests fall on deaf ears. Steven is a man on a mission. Wordlessly, he squats and shoves his lily-white ass out the window\u2014mooning the gaggle of grannies in the car next to us.</p><p>I bet you thought this kind of stuff only happened in movies.</p><p>He grins while his ass blows in the wind for a good ninety seconds, ensuring optimal viewage. Then he pulls his slacks up, turns around, and leans out the window, laughing. \u201cEnjoying the full moon, ladies?\u201d</p><p>Wow. Steven usually isn\u2019t the type to visually assault the elderly.</p><p>Without warning, his crazy cackling is cut off. He\u2019s silent for a beat, then I hear him choke out a single strangled word.</p><p>\u201cGrandma?\u201d</p> <p>Then he\u2019s diving back into the limo, his face grayish, dazed, and totally sober. He stares at the floor. \u201cNo way that just happened.\u201d</p><p>Matthew and I look at each other hopefully, then we scramble to the window. Sure enough, in the driver\u2019s seat of that big old Town Car is none other than Loretta P. Reinhart. Mom to George; Grandma to Steven.</p><p>What are the f**king odds, huh?</p><p>Loretta was always a cranky old bitch. No sense of humor. Even when I was a kid she hated me. Thought I was a bad influence on her precious grandchild.</p><p>Don\u2019t know where she got that idea from.</p><p>She moved out to Arizona years ago. Like a lot of women her age, she still enjoys a good tug on the slot machine\u2014hence her frequent trips to Sin City. Apparently this is one such trip.</p><p>Matthew and I wave and smile and in fourth-grader-like, singsong harmony call out, \u201cHi, Mrs. Reinhart.\u201d</p><p>She shakes one wrinkled fist in our direction. Then her poofy-haired companion in the backseat flips us the bird. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the funniest goddamn thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>The two of us collapse back into our seats, laughing hysterically.</p><p>Steven snaps out of his stupor and yells to the driver, \u201cFor the love of God, man, floor it!\u201d</p><p>We speed off into the night, howling like Mad Hatters on laughing gas. All of us except Steven. You know that saying \u201cWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\u201d? I don\u2019t think my brother-in-law is gonna be that lucky.</p><p>The name of the strip club is Paradise. The sand-colored, two-story, windowless building is surrounded with lush trees, stone statues, a pond, and several fountains. The oasislike atmosphere stands out in sharp contrast to the barren desert around it. Even though the sign glows a modern neon, I half expect to see girls in togas, carrying big palm leaves and frigging grapes, wandering around the outside.</p><p>We get to the front door. You may want to brace yourself. Don\u2019t want anyone keeling over from the shock. Because, you have to understand\u2014men are essentially pigs in human clothing. I readily admit it. There is no end to the perverted high jinks, fetishes, fortes, and fantasies we\u2019re capable of dreaming up.</p><p>And this joint caters to every single one of them.</p><p>The door is opened by a fortyish-looking redhead in a dark green teddy with matching heels. She has aristocratic features\u2014pale skin, full lips, high cheekbones\u2014nicely accentuated by expensively subtle plastic surgery. \u201cWelcome to Paradise, gentlemen. We\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d</p><p>Cream-colored walls, marble tile, and a burning white-stone fireplace make the foyer feel welcoming and warm. Almost homey. Deep, sexy music pounds from behind a dark mahogany door on the far side of the room. \u201cMy name is Carla; I\u2019ll be your hostess this evening. If there is anything I can get for you during your stay\u2014anything at all\u2014please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s mouth hangs open\u2014like a fish who\u2019s seen the face of God. Matthew and Jack are giggly with anticipation, while Steven still looks dazed from mooning his grandma.</p><p>But I bet he\u2019ll forget all about that shortly. We walk into the next room. The lights are low\u2014as they always are in places like this\u2014but the room is huge for a strip club. A main stage sits in the center, with two smaller stages beside it, each with a standard silver pole. A large glass bar lines one wall, with two bikini-clad dancers swaying on top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Men of all ages are scattered everywhere\u2014at small tables, corner booths, and bar stools. And every one of them has at least two girls fawning over him. Out of the corner of my eye I see a salt-and-pepper-haired guy motorboating the tits of a blonde with pigtails and a Catholic-schoolgirl uniform. Behind them, a black-haired Asian woman stands na**d on a table, sliding a Blow Pop into her twat. Then she leans down and pops it into the mouth of the college-age kid salivating in front of her.</p><p>Kind of reminds you of Sodom or Gomorrah, doesn\u2019t it? And we all know how they ended up.</p><p>I tried to warn you.</p><p>Carla explains, \u201cTo the left is our game room. I\u2019ve reserved a poker table for your party as you requested, Matthew. Darts and billiards are also available. Down that hall are the booths for private dances, and upstairs we have fully appointed rooms for even more private interactions, should you desire.\u201d</p> <p>She leads us to the bar. \u201cFirst round is on the house. This is Jane.\u201d Carla motions to a dark-haired girl behind the bar, wearing a suit jacket and nothing else. \u201cShe\u2019ll be your private server.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s eyes follow a long-legged blonde wearing assless leather chaps as she walks by. \u201cI thought it was against the law to have na**d girls and alcohol in the same place.\u201d</p><p>Matthew shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s only in New York and Jersey. This is the land of legalized prostitution.\u201d</p><p>I hold up a finger. \u201cBut all other rules apply. Which means no touching, unless somebody tells you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s mouth is still hanging open. I close it ungently. \u201cGet a grip, man. Don\u2019t embarrass us or I\u2019ll make you go sit in the car.\u201d</p> <p>He forces his face to relax. Then he bobs his head and slumps his shoulders. \u201cNo, it\u2019s good. I\u2019m cool. I\u2019m . . . holy shit! Do you see that chick with the lollipop?!\u201d</p><p>Hopeless.</p><p>I turn away. \u201cJane, I\u2019ll take a whiskey on the rocks, please.\u201d</p><p>Service with a smile. \u201cComing right up, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>Carla takes her leave. \u201cI\u2019ll be close by should you need my assistance. Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.\u201d As soon as she steps away, five girls converge on us, each more stunning than the next.</p><p>I sip my whiskey as one blue-lingerie-clad stripper meets my eyes. \u201cSo this is a bachelor party? And you\u2019re the groom?\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love grooms.\u201d</p><p>Small talk with strippers is not really the norm. Usually it\u2019s more of a transaction: rubbing and gyrating in exchange for a few singles. But this isn\u2019t your typical strip club. And I\u2019m a friendly guy. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always the wildest ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. Tonight is more for my buddies. I\u2019m just an innocent bystander.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and pinches my cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t look innocent.\u201d She gives my face a mini slap. \u201cYou look more like the naughty type.\u201d</p><p>I wink. \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d</p><p>A curly-haired girl with wide hips, wearing a purple bikini and standing next to Jack, vies for my attention next. \u201cYou wanna see a magic trick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, she holds up a large cucumber. \u201cI\u2019m going to make this cucumber disappear. Watch closely.\u201d She peels off her bikini bottoms, spreads her legs, and inserts the end of the cucumber into her pu**y. Then she holds her hands up over her head. Her abdominal muscles clench, and magically the cucumber slides up, disappearing into her twat.</p><p>Now all of our mouths are hanging open like Warren\u2019s.</p><p>Then, the cucumber peeks out and slides down. She grabs it and says sweetly, \u201cTa-da!\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands. \u201cYou are a very talented girl.\u201d</p><p>Yes\u2014I\u2019m going to hell. But at least I\u2019ll be in good company.</p><p>Jack holds up his hands, fingers spread. \u201cI give it a ten for creativity.\u201d</p><p>Matthew adds, \u201cYou\u2019d be a shoo-in for that X Factor show.\u201d</p><p>She just smirks at me. \u201cHow about a private dance and I can show you all of my talents?\u201d</p><p>I shrug her off. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>One hour, a few drinks, and about a hundred $1 bills later, Carla rejoins our little group. \u201cI hope you gentlemen are enjoying yourselves?\u201d</p><p>While I pass the time watching two girls tongue-kissing each other at the direction of a middle-aged patron, Matthew answers, \u201cWe are, thank you. The service and amenities are impeccable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aim to please. And now it\u2019s time to give the guest of honor a true Paradise welcome.\u201d She takes my arm. \u201cIf you\u2019ll come with me, Drew?\u201d</p><p>That takes my attention away from the Female Foreplay Show. \u201cI\u2019m fine right here, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She smiles persuasively. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not optional. Your friends insisted.\u201d</p><p>I frown at the guys. \u201cWhat did you douche bags do?\u201d</p><p>Matthew laughs sinisterly. \u201cNothing you weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your last night of freedom, man. Enjoy it,\u201d Jack adds.</p><p>Two more girls come up behind me. They and Carla pull me off my stool and guide me onstage as Steven yells out, \u201cIt\u2019ll only hurt for a minute!\u201d</p><p>I decide to go with the flow. It was too much to hope that the guys didn\u2019t have some sick, twisted event planned. Best to just get it over with now. A lone chair sits empty in the middle of the stage. As three pairs of feminine hands push me down in it, the lights dim even lower. Spotlights dance around the room, and when \u201cOne More Night\u201d by Maroon 5 comes on, the crowd cheers.</p><p>Two woman bounce out from backstage. They\u2019re wearing black G-strings and sheer, black button-down tops. After a few ass shakes and high kicks for the crowd, they turn toward me. One drops to her knees and crawls around my legs like a submissive\u2014and appealing\u2014kitten.</p><p>Her hands slide up my calves to my knees and she pushes\u2014roughly jerking them apart. Then she ties each ankle to the leg of the chair with a surprisingly sturdy ribbon. The girl in back scratches red fingernails down my chest, stopping just above the danger zone. Then she yanks both my arms back and ties my wrists behind me. It\u2019s not exactly enjoyable. Some guys like to be dominated, but as history has shown, I\u2019m much more of the dominator type.</p><p>But my interest is piqued. The crowd goes wild as another woman appears front and center\u2014swinging gracefully around the pole, obviously the star of the show. She\u2019s petite, but thigh-high, leather, black boots with insanely spiked heels make her seem taller. Her hair is tucked under a black leather cap, shocking red gloss covers her lips, and dark sunglasses disguise much of her face. The rest of her body, however, is bared for all to see. A black thong with a scarcely there triangle hangs on her hips. Her tits are adorned with stick-on nipple tassels\u2014and nothing else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With her back to me, she rips off the cap and throws it to the crowd, revealing a cascade of shiny, brown hair. She takes a few more spins on the pole, then turns toward me and stalks forward.</p><p>For a moment, I\u2019d swear on my kid that it was Kate. The face and body dimensions are that similar.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, I notice the differences, however. Besides the fact that Kate Brooks would never be up on a stage shaking her tits and ass in the faces of strangers\u2014unless she actually wanted me to stick ice picks through the eyeballs of every ass**le in the place.</p><p>And, yes, that would include the ass**les I came with.</p> <p>But also, this girl\u2019s skin is paler than my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s, her nose thinner, her hair lighter\u2014not quite the same mahogany shade. Other than that, the resemblance is pretty f**king frightening.</p><p>She spins and leans against me, her back pressed up against my chest. Her hair falls across my face and tickles my nose. She smells . . . great. Like honeysuckle and jasmine. It\u2019s a musky incense, like the aroma of a closed room after hours of fantastic f**king. She doesn\u2019t smell nearly as incredible as Kate\u2014but her bouquet is what I would\u2019ve probably defined as incredible if I\u2019d never had the pleasure of Kate\u2019s sublime scent.</p><p>Her arms snake around my neck and her ass nestles perfectly against my dick. Then she slides down between my open legs and arches forward elegantly, raising her ass tantalizingly toward my face. She plants her feet on the floor and straightens her legs, while still bent over at the waist. Then she slides the thong down her legs and smacks her right butt cheek hard\u2014in the way I\u2019m sure every guy in the place is chomping at the bit to do.</p><p>She stands up and turns to face me again. She kicks one leg slowly up around my head\u2014giving me an unobstructed, detailed display of her bare slit.</p><p>I swear I try not to look. Really.</p> <p>But I do.</p><p>Give me a motherfucking break\u2014I\u2019m engaged, not dead.</p><p>She climbs onto my lap, facing me. Then she shoves the thong she\u2019d been wearing in my mouth. The crowd roars to a deafening crescendo.</p><p>I think the crazy train just jumped the track. I\u2019d like to get off now\u2014and not in the happy way. It\u2019s all fun and games until you have another woman\u2019s bodily fluids on your tongue. Kate would never be okay with this. Remind me to guzzle some Listerine when we get back to the room.</p><p>Her red lips smile as she snatches the tie off my neck, and I manage to spit out the thong. Unperturbed, she drapes the open tie around my shoulders and holds each side like a horse\u2019s reins. She wraps the ends around her hands and uses them for leverage. Her h*ps sway and swivel expertly, the way only an experienced dancer\u2014or expensive hooker\u2014knows how.</p><p>To my utter horror\u2014my c**k gets hard. He moves quickly into position\u2014rigid and ready.</p> <p>Since the day Kate let me f**k her, I, and my dick, haven\u2019t given any other women a second glance. No matter how attractive or available, we haven\u2019t been interested. Or aroused.</p><p>Not one frigging time.</p><p>It feels completely wrong. To use Kate\u2019s words\u2014it\u2019s like a compass pointing south. If that were to happen, it would mean the universe was off-kilter. The end of the world as we know it. That\u2019s almost what this seems like.</p><p>Like a betrayal.</p><p>Maybe the priests were right, after all. Maybe penises are evil.</p><p>I glare down at my lap.</p><p>Traitor.</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>After the stage lights go dark and I\u2019m untied from the chair, I can\u2019t get off the stage quickly enough. I make a beeline for my happy place, also known as the bar.</p><p>The guys surround me, backslapping and laughing like chimpanzees at the zoo. \u201cThat was awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rethinking this whole marriage thing. If it gets me a f**king show like that, I just might do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take those seconds any day. . . . Wasn\u2019t anything sloppy about that brunette!\u201d</p><p>A thousand frazzled thoughts race through my head at once, but I put up a solid front.</p><p>\u201cIt was great.\u201d Talk quickly turns to joining the poker game in the back room. As the others make their way over, Matthew turns back to me, where I\u2019m still sitting at the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d</p><p>I lick my dry lips. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just going to finish my drink.\u201d</p><p>He nods understandingly and leaves me on my own. Have to admit, I\u2019m a little bit shaky. What was that hard-on all about? Did it happen because the woman grinding on me looked so much like Kate? And most important, do I have to tell Kate about it?</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>I go from looking at my drink to swallowing it in .5 seconds. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m telling Kate.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at me like that. Whoever said honesty was the best policy never lived with a frigging chick. Sometimes, it\u2019s best to keep your mouth shut. Certain things women don\u2019t want to know\u2014things, like this, that will accomplish nothing but upsetting them.</p><p>I\u2019m comfortable with my decision . . . until someone taps me on the shoulder.</p><p>I turn around to find a pair of big, beautiful brown eyes smiling at me. If my c**k had an elbow, he\u2019d nudge me with it.</p><p>She\u2019s changed since the stage show. Or, should I say, covered up. She\u2019s wearing a red, lace, knee-length nightie, with matching high heels. It\u2019s actually pretty conservative for a place like this. Close up, I note that her skin is creamy white and clear\u2014with almost no makeup. Her hair is still down, straight and shiny, and soft looking.</p><p>She greets me with a cheery \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lily.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAre you having fun tonight?\u201d</p><p>I motion to the bartender for another. \u201cSure, it\u2019s . . . super.\u201d</p><p>Lily sits\u2014uninvited\u2014on the stool next to mine. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I wanted to make sure you enjoyed the show, because I\u2019m new here. I only started a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>The revelation surprises me. \u201cNever would\u2019ve guessed. You\u2019re a natural.\u201d</p><p>Her smile gets wider. \u201cWow, you\u2019re so sweet.\u201d Her voice drops to a whisper, as if she were about to spill top-secret information. \u201cBut I\u2019m not really a stripper, you know.\u201d</p><p>I look around the room. Then I look her up and down. \u201cIs it some elaborate game of make-believe?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m a student, actually. This is my last year at the University of Nevada.\u201d</p><p>I remark drily, \u201cA student stripping her way through college? How very stereotypical of you.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. Not unlike the way Kate does frequently. \u201cI waitressed at Hooters for a year. But with the economy the way it is, they had cutbacks. And I got let go last month.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI always thought tits and ass were recession-proof.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and sips her drink. \u201cDidn\u2019t we all.\u201d</p><p>I toy with the napkin on the bar, feeling Lily\u2019s eyes appraising me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just . . . you\u2019re nothing like the other grooms I\u2019ve seen in this place. They acted like I was their last meal before the execution. But you\u2019re different. It\u2019s nice.\u201d</p> <p>Although she seems sincere, I\u2019m suspicious of the nice-girl-just-trying-to-get-by act. Strippers get na**d for money\u2014that\u2019s the job. They get more money if the customers like them\u2014if the stripper can make them feel they\u2019re special. Different. \u201cI don\u2019t do this for just any guy,\u201d they say, and\u2014bam\u2014before the loser knows it, his whole paycheck is down the drain.</p><p>Or up the crotch, in this case.</p><p>Lily puts her hand on my leg, and she starts to rub\u2014moving higher and higher. \u201cHow about we go in the back for a private dance? I\u2019ll even do you for free. It\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019d I tell you? Can I call them, or can I call them?</p><p>I stop her wandering hand with my own. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She leans toward me and tries again. \u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>But I hold my ground. \u201cI could. But I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stops, finally getting the point. Looking a little confused, she asks, \u201cDo you have one of those crazy, controlling fianc\u00e9es? The kind that makes you promise no lap dances, even at your bachelor party?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be pissed. But . . . I think she\u2019d be hurt.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what no one tells you about being in love. Sure it\u2019s grand and amazing and feels f**king fantastic. But there\u2019s stress too. Obligation. Responsibility. The knowledge that someone else\u2019s happiness\u2014someone who means so much to you\u2014can be made or destroyed by the choices you make. By the things you do.</p><p>Or in my case, the things you don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done that before\u2014made a bad call. Hurt her. And I\u2019m determined not to ever do it again.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyes glaze over with admiration. She\u2019s probably not used to talking to a guy who isn\u2019t a complete and utter dickweed. For her, it must be like when those scientists in the sixties first realized apes were capable of learning sign language. A revelation.</p><p>She kisses her fingertip and presses it to my cheek. \u201cI hope your fianc\u00e9e knows how lucky she is, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cI make sure to remind her every day.\u201d</p><p>She smiles longingly. Then her gaze turns to the other end of the room, where an expensive-suit-wearing older gentleman sits by himself, looking all kinds of lonely.</p><p>She hops off the bar chair. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d In a flurry of dark hair, she walks away.</p><p>My eyes follow her as she goes. And, thank Christ, my dick doesn\u2019t move an inch.</p><p>Before she reaches her destination, I get an idea. Practice makes perfect\u2014and there\u2019s no better practice run than a newly minted stripper.</p> <p>I call her back. \u201cI\u2019m gonna pay for that private dance after all.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes light up. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>I guide her to the back room, where Warren is playing poker\u2014badly\u2014with Steven, Jack, and Matthew. \u201cHey, douche bag, have you ever had a private dance?\u201d</p><p>Suspicion washes over his face, probably thinking I\u2019m setting him up to be the butt of a joke. Not that he needs any help in that department. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>I smile and motion to each of them with my hand. \u201cLily, this is Billy. Billy\u2014Lily.\u201d</p><p>Warren stands and Lily loops her arm around his. \u201cFirst timer, huh? I\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just racking up the good deeds today, aren\u2019t I? I tap both their shoulders. \u201cYou kids have fun.\u201d</p><p>As they walk away together, I hear Warren ask, \u201cHave you heard the one about the priest and the rabbi in a bar?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and shake my head. Fucking hopeless.</p><p>I tell the poker dealer to deal me in, then lay my money on the table and stack the green chips she slides my way. Without prompting, a shot girl places a fresh whiskey in front of me, and I put my tip on the tray. Paradise isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill strip club. It\u2019s not just about the dancers\u2014it\u2019s about making the customers feel like kings. Anticipating their wants and desires.</p><p>Jack changes two cards and comments, \u201cDrew Evans turning down a lap dance\u2014that makes me sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned it down out of respect for Kate. Just like she canceled the man massage out of respect for me.\u201d</p><p>Steven smiles and congratulates me. \u201cYou\u2019ve come so far, Little Grasshopper.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cKate and I have a very respectful relationship.\u201d</p><p>This is mostly true. Although, at times a little disrespect can end up being a really good time.</p><p>Let\u2019s examine that theory more closely:</p><p>After what feels like an eternity of not being inside Kate, our six-week sex ban has at last come to an end. My generous parents\u2014whom I love tonight more than ever\u2014agreed to come to our apartment and watch James for a few hours.</p><p>My c**k has fabulous, filthy ideas on how to spend every minute of those hours.</p><p>Despite his intentions, we didn\u2019t go straight to the hotel room I rented for the evening. Why not? you ask. The short answer is because Kate owns me, I\u2019m now a pushover\u2014and a f**king idiot. The long answer is because Kate put extra effort into getting dressed for our night together\u2014she painted her toenails, curled her hair just so, and bought a scorching-hot little black dress that makes her tits look fantastic. Meaning she wants to spend at least part of the night in public. Around other adults.</p><p>Engaging in conversation that will stimulate her mind as acutely as I plan on stimulating her cl*t with my tongue very shortly.</p><p>So . . . we\u2019re eating dinner at Jean-Georges, an ultrachic restaurant that also happens to be located one block from our hotel suite. Talk during dinner was interesting and fun, as always. We talked about James, work, Kate\u2019s upcoming transition back to the office, and my impending conversion to part-time stay-at-home dad. The food was great too. Yet it hasn\u2019t exactly been an enjoyable meal for me.</p><p>My body is strung tight with anticipation, and every single thing Kate does just makes me want to f**k her that much more. The way her fingers grasp her water glass, the way she licks her lips and slides the fork deep into her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christ.</p><p>It\u2019s a blessing you can\u2019t actually die from horniness\u2014\u2019cause I\u2019d be stone cold by now.</p><p>Even though Kate\u2019s been strict about what she eats, because she\u2019s breast-feeding and working hard to get back into her \u201cskinny\u201d jeans, I talked her into indulging in some dessert.</p><p>Not my best idea.</p> <p>\u201cMmmm . . . ,\u201d she moans over a bite of chocolate cake.</p><p>My dick twitches\u2014like a wild bull raring to get out of his pen.</p><p>I swallow the rest of my wine, reminding myself it\u2019ll only be a few more minutes until I have her all to myself. Naked. With no one and nothing to disturb us for four blissful hours.</p><p>Kate pushes her plate back and wipes her mouth elegantly with her napkin. Then she regards me thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wondering?\u201d I\u2019m surprised that my voice is actually level. Considering the crotch of my pants is now painfully snug.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember the night we met\u2014at REM?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward in my chair and run my finger up and down her bare arm. \u201cEvery provocative detail.\u201d</p><p>She likes my answer. She smiles. \u201cWhat do you think would\u2019ve happened if I had gone home with you that night?\u201d</p><p>I force my gaze up from Kate\u2019s impressive rack to meet her eyes. \u201cI would\u2019ve done exactly what I said\u2014given the word pleasure a whole new meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about afterward?\u201d</p><p>This is one of those tricky hypothetical questions women love to pose\u2014just to screw with a guy\u2019s head. \u201cWhat if you had met my sister first?\u201d \u201cWould you have respected me if I f**ked you on the first date?\u201d \u201cIf you could go back in time, would you still marry me?\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, there\u2019s definitely a right way and a wrong way to answer. Unfortunately for men, the honest answer is usually the wrong one.</p><p>But because I\u2019ve sworn to never lie to Kate again\u2014and because she\u2019ll know if I am frigging lying\u2014I go with the truth.</p><p>\u201cAfterward, I would\u2019ve paid your cab fare and gone on my own merry, sexually satisfied way home.\u201d I wink. \u201cAnd I would\u2019ve ranked our night as the best of my life. So far.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t frown, exactly, but the potential is there. Disappointment settles in her brown eyes, and the edges of her smile fall just a bit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? So you don\u2019t think we\u2019d be together right now?\u201d</p><p>I pick up her hand and hold it in mine, looking it over before kissing each of her fingertips. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. Like those of most geniuses, my epiphanies take a little time to settle in. I would\u2019ve spent most of Sunday reminiscing\u2014but by Sunday night, I would\u2019ve started figuring out how to find you again.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, the pre-frown vanishes. \u201cYou would\u2019ve wanted seconds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeconds, thirds, fourths . . . and when I found you at my office on Monday? You can bet your ass my couch would\u2019ve been scandalized much sooner.\u201d</p> <p>Kate leans forward, purposely teasing me with a bird\u2019s-eye view of her cle**age. \u201cWhat about your rule\u2014Drew Evans doesn\u2019t ride the same roller coaster twice?\u201d</p><p>I enjoy the scenery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve proven beyond a reasonable doubt that when it comes to you, my rules were always meant to be broken. If you were the coaster in question, I would\u2019ve bought the whole f**king amusement park and ridden you until I couldn\u2019t see straight.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s free hand slides up my thigh, inching close to the holy land. Her voice is teasing. Playful. \u201cAre you flirting with me, Mr. Evans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, I\u2019m obviously out of practice.\u201d I up my game. \u201cTake your panties off. Right here, right now. Then give them to me.\u201d</p><p>How\u2019s that for flirting?</p><p>Her hand stops its exploration. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t sound shy or shocked. So I know her refusal isn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t want to.</p><p>The lewd lightbulb goes on above my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing any, are you?\u201d</p><p>Kate looks into my eyes. And sexily pops the p as she says, \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Instantly my finger rises toward the waiter. \u201cCheck, please.\u201d</p><p>The waiter quickly brings the check, and I throw a handful of bills down on the table. In a rush, I stand up.</p><p>Kate giggles. \u201cThey\u2019re going to think you\u2019re unhappy about the food, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I help her out of her seat and lower my mouth to her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what they think. If I don\u2019t get you out of here right now, I\u2019m going to lay you down on this table and give the other customers a show they\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at my face daringly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d let you.\u201d</p><p>Oblivious of the stares of the patrons and staff, Kate wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me. When her demanding tongue strokes mine, the sensation goes straight to my balls. With my arm around her lower back, I say, \u201cYou got all dolled up\u2014I thought you wanted a night out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, I haven\u2019t come in six weeks. The only thing I want is your c**k so deep inside me, I can taste it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t actually remember leaving the restaurant after that. Kate\u2019s awesomely dirty revelation must have fried my brain.</p><p>The next thing I know, we\u2019re on the sidewalk and I\u2019m dragging her to the side of the building\u2014to the narrow alley just wide enough to fit a Dumpster that faces the street. I have enough awareness to bring Kate to the far side of it\u2014so we\u2019re shielded from the view of cars and pedestrians. My eyes scan the path for intruders. Finding none, I devote all of my attention to Kate\u2014to making up for all the screwless days she\u2019s endured.</p><p>My hand buries itself in her hair, gripping the soft strands, holding her head captive as I plunder her mouth with my tongue. She writhes and rubs against me, pulling my shirt free of my pants and working on my belt.</p><p>It\u2019s times like this I wish God had made people more like octopuses\u2014six extra hands would be convenient right about now. We\u2019re ravenous for each other\u2014tearing and pulling at annoying clothes, wanting to touch every erogenous zone at the same time.</p><p>It reminds me of the first time we kissed, that night in my office years ago. It feels the same as that night\u2014I\u2019d wanted Kate, fantasized about her for weeks then too. The difference now is, I know precisely what I\u2019ve been f**king missing. So I\u2019m even hungrier for her, bordering on totally out of control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hand slides down the front of her dress, into her bra, straining the fabric. I palm and knead her full breast, and a welcome moan reverberates in Kate\u2019s throat. My fingers rub and pinch her nipple, making it harden to a perfect peak. Kate tears her mouth from mine and moves to my neck\u2014sucking and licking\u2014nipping the sensitive skin with her teeth. Making me weak in the f**king knees.</p><p>I switch gears and slide my hands up her thighs, bunching her dress above her waist. Then I kneel down and pause for just a moment to appreciate the sight of her exquisitely smooth snatch.</p><p>Panting hard, Kate tries to cover her stomach with her hands. \u201cI know I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**king finish that sentence.\u201d I grab her wrists, holding them away from her body.</p><p>Pregnancy is a strange experience for women. So many fast-paced changes\u2014mentally, emotionally, physically. And, no, Kate doesn\u2019t look exactly as she did before. But only a total ass**le would expect her to.</p><p>Only the eminent ruler of all ass**les would care.</p><p>\u201cYou made a person, Kate. A perfectly amazing person.\u201d Then I look up into her eyes and tell her honestly, \u201cYou\u2019ve never been more beautiful to me than you are right now.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugs at her flushed lips. I release her wrists, lean forward, and press my mouth against the soft flesh of her pu**y.</p><p>Hello, old friend. I\u2019ve missed you.</p><p>I spread her with my fingers and delve in deep. She\u2019s hot on my tongue\u2014already wet\u2014and sweeter than chocolate frigging cake. I cup her ass in my hands, pressing her forward, and revel in the taste of her. My eyes roll back in my head as Kate moans and gasps above me. Her fingernails cut into my shoulder blades, and after only a minute she\u2019s begging.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Drew . . . I need you inside me. I need to feel you now.\u201d</p><p>Unwilling to deny her and incapable of it, I lap at her one last time and stand. I cover her lips with mine and back us up to the wall of the building. As I caress her tits, Kate slips my pants and boxers down my hips.</p><p>She takes my straining c**k in her hands, pumping it firmly and slowly.</p><p>I groan into her mouth.</p><p>Then I lift her, cushioning the back of her head with one hand, so it doesn\u2019t smack against the bricks. My other arm is under her ass, holding her up. Kate locks her ankles together at my lower back, then guides my dick home.</p><p>I don\u2019t wait. Waiting is just not possible. I plunge into her roughly, deeply.</p><p>\u201cDrew . . . ,\u201d she sighs.</p><p>Kate\u2019s wet inner walls stretch around me, still blissfully f**king snug. Buried fully, I savor the sensation of being inside her again. Being surrounded and held by intense, hot perfection.</p><p>I whisper the only word that matters. \u201cKate . . .\u201d</p><p>Her legs pull me closer, knees squeezing tighter. I do what we\u2019re both craving.</p><p>I move.</p><p>Slowly, my h*ps pull back. Kate\u2019s cunt grips my c**k spectacularly as it slides from her.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like f**king heaven,\u201d I moan.</p> <p>Then I thrust forward hard, rubbing her cl*t with my pelvis, making sure she\u2019s feeling the same blinding pleasure I am. I keep that pace\u2014slow, rough strokes that make Kate purr every time our bodies collide.</p><p>Her eyes close and her mouth finds mine.</p><p>We\u2019re gasping and moaning, gripping and pulsing\u2014drowning in fantastic friction. With her cheek pressed against mine, Kate pants, \u201cOh, God . . . oh, God, Drew, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>My h*ps quicken, needing to feel her contracting around me more than I need air to breathe. \u201cFuck yes, come, baby. Let me feel you come hard.\u201d</p><p>Then she is. Her arms around my neck, her legs around my waist, constrict and tighten. Kate\u2019s pu**y squeezes my c**k in a primal, uncontrollable rhythm that pulls me deeper inside her. I push and surge forward one last time, until I rise into the stratosphere with her. It\u2019s so f**king good, so intense, for several long, exquisite moments the only sound I can hear is the rush of our ecstasy pounding in my ears.</p><p>Minutes later, I\u2019m still breathing deep against Kate\u2019s neck, and she continues to tremble with aftershocks. Still inside her, I lift my head and brush her hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome.\u201d</p><p>She smiles wide. \u201cMind-blowing.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, I set her feet back on solid ground. Then I help smooth her dress back into place and tuck myself in and zip up. \u201cAnd we still have a whole suite waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to my suite.\u201d Kate holds out her hand.</p><p>I take it. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Back out on the sidewalk, the fog of lust clears and Kate puts the hand I\u2019m not holding over her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we had sex in an alley.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we waited so long to have sex in an alley. What was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an activity that\u2019s definitely going on my repeat list.</p><p>Is alley-screwing respectful? Generally . . . no. But in this case, it was just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>Now, back to our card game.</p><p>Jack turns to Steven. \u201cWhat do you say, Reinhart\u2014you and me and two of the most flexible ladies in the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexandra would rip my head off if I got a lap dance\u2014private or otherwise,\u201d Steven laments.</p><p>Matthew grins. \u201cDelores would be into it\u2014but only if she got to watch.\u201d</p><p>Steven shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give her another reason to be pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>Matthew chuckles. \u201cBut that\u2019s the way it works, man. Dee-Dee\u2019s happier when I\u2019m messing up\u2014gives her an excuse to yell at me. She feels needed, and it makes me appreciate how lucky I am to have her. For men and women\u2014that\u2019s the circle of life.\u201d</p><p>Steven considers the idea but still tells Jack, \u201cI don\u2019t think married men belong in a private booth. If I want a strip show, I\u2019ll buy my wife pole-dancing lessons.\u201d His face brightens. \u201cIn fact\u2014that\u2019s gonna be her Mother\u2019s Day gift. Boom\u2014scratch that off the list.\u201d</p><p>At first I frown at the visual imagery . . . but then get over it and smile. Because I know exactly what to get Kate for my birthday.</p><p>After Warren emerged from the private booth looking dazed and satisfied\u2014and walking stiffly because he most likely jizzed in his pants\u2014we all sat down front row at the main stage to enjoy another show. This time without my participation. It was a girl-power-themed production, meaning three girls and a variety of battery-powered toys. A show like that is guaranteed to make any man hope for an encore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gave it a standing ovation.</p><p>Then, the five of us went back to the game room for a dart tournament. See us there? Jack\u2019s taking his turn, Steven\u2019s watching another member of the Stripper Lollipop Guild play peekaboo with the Blow Pop across the room, while Matthew, Warren, and I lean against the wall nursing our drinks.</p><p>Warren\u2019s phone pings with an incoming message. He looks down at it for a few seconds and laughs.</p><p>For no particular reason, I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p> <p>His reaction piques my interest. He drops the hand holding his phone to his side and wipes the grin off his face. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I push off the wall and stand in front of him. \u201cLet me see your phone.\u201d</p><p>He puts it behind his back. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. Nothing you want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now I f**king do.\u201d</p><p>Looking like a cornered rat, he calls to Steven, \u201cReinhart\u2014think fast.\u201d And tosses the phone in the air. Steven catches it, but because he always did love a good game of Monkey in the Middle, when I get close to him, he throws it to Matthew. Matthew gets Jack into the game. I take three steps back to Warren, so I\u2019m right in front of him when he catches his phone.</p> <p>Then I end the game\u2014with a not-too-hard punch to Warren\u2019s gut.</p><p>Ooomph.</p><p>He doubles over, holding his midsection. The phone falls from his hands and clatters to the floor. I pick it up and access the main screen. Warren rasps out, \u201cEvans\u2014I\u2019m telling you as a friend\u2014you shouldn\u2019t look at the pictures.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him.</p><p>With the push of a button, the images pop up in all their disgustingly vivid, high-resolution, multi-megapixel splendor. This is a historic day\u2014mark it on your f**king calendar. For once in his life, Warren was right.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have looked.</p> <p>The guys peer over my shoulder as I scroll through the pictures\u2014clearly from tonight. The first is of Kate on the shoulders of some nameless, bare-chested bastard, surrounded by the outstretched hands of several other dickheads who all bear a strong resemblance to Tarzan. I don\u2019t like it, but I can live with it.</p><p>The next one shows Kate cradled in the muscular arms of a different thong-wearing prick. Her hands rest on his shoulders, and her skirt has risen up high on her thighs. High enough that, if you look closely, you can spot the pink-and-black-lace panties that caused me so much concern earlier.</p><p>I now plan to burn them like toxic waste as soon as we get back to the hotel.</p><p>My grip on the phone tightens. If I were a superhero, it\u2019d be dust by now. But I manage to keep my shit together.</p><p>Steven comments from behind me, \u201cBuck up, little camper\u2014they\u2019re not so bad.\u201d</p><p>Then I slide to the final image.</p><p>Jack says, \u201cOh, that one\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>Bad? Bad is a kid who wipes out on his bike, taking off several layers of skin. Bad is Derek Jeter getting sidelined with an injury during the play-offs. This photo isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s a blasphemy.</p> <p>She\u2019s leaning back on a dark-upholstered couch, with a guy on top of her\u2014lined up just right to dry-hump her through his black, shiny thong.</p><p>If he put her legs on his shoulders, they\u2019d be in one of her favorite positions. And she\u2019s smiling. She\u2019s looking away from the camera, off to the side, but her mouth is open. Frozen in a wide, laughing scream.</p><p>Not exactly the picture of the loyal, devoted fianc\u00e9e is it?</p><p>Every muscle in my body demands that I reach into the device, grab the son of a bitch on top of her, and choke him the f**k out. But the final blow is when I see the writing under the picture. The message Dee-Dee probably gleefully sent. Take a look:</p><p>Drew who? :D</p><p>Remember what I was saying before? About how when you\u2019re in love, the choices you make can have huge effects on the person you love? Well, I wasn\u2019t just talking about my choices. I meant Kate\u2019s too.</p><p>Something inside me cracks. Breaks. Matthew\u2014the only one who senses just how perilously close to the edge I am\u2014tries to pull me back. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lap dance, dude. It\u2019s her bachelorette party. Tomorrow everything goes back to normal.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and my mouth tastes bitter. My movements are dangerous and desperate. I shove Matthew\u2019s hand away and toss Warren\u2019s phone back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Matthew, it doesn\u2019t mean shit. None of it\u2019s real, right? It\u2019s Cinderella\u2019s motherfucking coach, a one-night freebie\u2014then tomorrow, it\u2019ll be like it never even happened.\u201d</p><p>Matthew frowns. \u201cDrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warren interrupts, \u201cWould you stop being such a f**king hypocrite?\u201d He holds his hands out wide. \u201cDo you see where we are right now?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think about how he\u2019s once again correct. I don\u2019t think about all the wrongs I\u2019ve committed, or all the promises I\u2019ve made.</p><p>Because back in the caveman days? They didn\u2019t have time to consider the ramifications of their actions when a woolly mammoth was bearing down on them. All they could do was react. That same primal instinct is pushing me now. Driving me to do something\u2014anything\u2014to get rid of the jealousy that\u2019s burning through my chest.</p><p>Once upon a time there was a guy, and he was awesome. He had a perfect life\u2014good-looking, a great job, money to burn, and woman tripping over themselves to f**k him. He was the ace in the hole. A number one. Mr. No Apologies, I know exactly what I want and I get it, if you\u2019re not with me, you\u2019re against me, get on board or get the f**k out.</p><p>I liked that guy. He called the shots. He was in control. And there was never a time he felt as bad as I do right now. About anything.</p><p>I know what he would\u2019ve said at a time like this: Stella can lick Chomper\u2019s balls; Drew is the one who needs to get his groove back. Then he would\u2019ve grabbed a stripper and paid for a raunchy lap dance\u2014maybe paid for more. To even the score.</p><p>But if you think you know how this goes, you\u2019re f**king wrong.</p><p>\u2019Cause I\u2019m not going to do any of that stuff.</p><p>As shitty as this is, as sick and jealous as seeing those pictures makes me feel? I know something that feels even worse.</p><p>Letting Kate down. Breaking her trust. Making her cry.</p><p>Kate has forgiven me my screwups and she trusts me, even when I don\u2019t always give her a reason to. Mercy is a gift\u2014given out of love, not worthiness. And that\u2019s what Kate will always be to me.</p><p>She\u2019s my mercy.</p><p>And I will be damned if I punk out and fail to be the man she adores\u2014the man I know I can be. For her. For James.</p><p>I rub my eyes and take a breath. The guys watch me as I walk to the bar and sit down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Warren asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and make yourself feel better? Hook up with a stripper?\u201d Matthew offers.</p><p>I just shrug. \u201cBeen there, done that\u2014it never ends well.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, you know as well as I do that she didn\u2019t get that lap dance \u2019cause she wanted it\u2014any more than I wanted a goddamn thong in my mouth. The girls put her up to it, and she was just going with the flow.</p><p>Still sucks, though. Which is why when Jack repeats Warren\u2019s question, I say, \u201cI\u2019m going to do what any guy in my shoes would do. I\u2019m gonna f**king drink.\u201d</p><p>The perky bartender appears before me, smiling. \u201cWhat can I get you, Mr. Evans?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou got anything that will erase the last five minutes from my brain?\u201d</p><p>I meant it as a joke, but she smiles thoughtfully. \u201cActually, I think I have just what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p> <p>She walks to the end of the bar and retrieves a long-necked, glittery, sparkling bottle. Someone went a little crazy with the BeDazzler. She holds it up. \u201cThis is Pandora. It\u2019s part of an in-house contest. Eight hundred dollars a bottle. If you\u2019re able to drink the entire contents without passing out, vomiting, or requiring medical intervention, you win an I DOMINATED PANDORA IN PARADISE T-shirt. And we put your name and picture on the Wall of Studs.\u201d</p><p>She points behind the bar, where WALL OF STUDS is hung on a glowing neon sign. With no pictures underneath.</p><p>\u201cIf you fail to drink the contents or engage in any of the aforementioned behaviors, your picture and name are relegated to the Wall of Pussies.\u201d She gestures to the opposite wall. Where a shitload of pictures hang. Every one featuring some poor slob who\u2019s passed out or puking\u2014sometimes both. One guy looks as if he\u2019s having a seizure.</p><p>I stare at the bottle. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur own blend. I can\u2019t tell you the exact proof, but I must warn you, it\u2019s quite high. So what do you say, Mr. Evans? Up for the Pandora Challenge?\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s a fact for you\u2014men will do practically anything for a T-shirt. Free throws till our backs give out, hot-dog eating until our stomachs rupture. If there\u2019s a chance to acquire a cheap cotton garment that proclaims our accomplishment? We\u2019re helpless to resist.</p> <p>\u201cHell, yeah.\u201d I smack the money down on the bar. She hands me the bottle and offers a glass, which I turn down.</p><p>I uncork the top and toast the guys. \u201cParty on!\u201d</p><p>The liquid is sweet, warm. Not the bitter, burning taste of most hard liquors. I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve got this in the bag. Might as well put my T-shirt on right now.</p><p>I look at Matthew, who smiles back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen, right?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Your body\u2019s ability to absorb alcohol and still function depends on several factors: weight, liver health, past patterns of consumption. Most adults already have this figured out, but just in case you\u2019re one of those who don\u2019t know\u2014I\u2019ll tell you. There are different levels of intoxication.</p><p>First, there\u2019s that warm, happy feeling the average person gets after a drink or two. Most could still operate a car safely and, unless you have a low body mass index, would probably pass a Breathalyzer. We\u2019ll call this buzzed.</p><p>Then, in the three-to-five-drink range, some people get a little silly. Talkative. Possibly annoying. You\u2019re beyond happy at this point, and even the most mundane events seem hilarious. This is often referred to as tipsy.</p> <p>Next, there\u2019s actual drunkenness. By now, you\u2019ve lost count of the number of drinks you\u2019ve had. You could bite a hole through your tongue, but you wouldn\u2019t feel it. You\u2019re slurring your words, and swaying on your feet. We\u2019ll call this shitfaced.</p><p>The final level of intoxication is completely f**king obliterated. Coherent thought is pretty much gone. Coordination\u2014nonexistent. And your self-awareness equals that of a fruit fly.</p><p>About an hour after popping that cork from Pandora\u2019s mouth, I am f**king obliterated. Moving is a bit of a challenge. It\u2019s similar to those nightmares when the ax murderer is chasing you, and no matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t get your legs to move? It feels like a thick, invisible force field of Jell-O is encasing my body\u2014every action is slow and strenuous.</p><p>Time has no meaning. Apparently the brain cells are dying off so f**king fast, only short, disjointed moments make it into my actual memory. Like pictures taken with an old Polaroid camera.</p><p>As far as I can tell, most of the patrons at Paradise have taken their leave\u2014and my bachelor party has more or less taken over the club.</p><p>There\u2019s Jack\u2019s face, just inches from mine, his mouth open, tongue hanging out, yelling, \u201cWaaaassssuuuuuppppppp?!\u201d There are Steven and Matthew, behind the bar, throwing bottles to one another, pretending to be Tom Cruise doing the Hippy Hippy Shake. There\u2019s Warren, getting striptease lessons from a dancer\u2014trying to swing around the pole and falling.</p><p>Like that guy needs another blow to the head.</p><p>Then there\u2019s all of us\u2014onstage\u2014my arm thrown around Warren\u2019s shoulder as we belt out \u201cMaking Love out of Nothing at All\u201d by Air Supply, while Steven, Matthew, and Jack sing backup.</p><p>Christ Almighty.</p><p>When the fog clears next, I\u2019m at the bar, my cheek resting sloppily on my hand. Sitting next to me is the dark-haired stripper who rode me onstage. I know I should know her name, but I can\u2019t remember it. She\u2019s talking animatedly\u2014her hands moving as fast as her mouth. I only hear every third word or so.</p><p>I look at the bottle that\u2019s on the bar next to me. It\u2019s about three-quarters empty. I shrug\u2014bring the bottle to my lips\u2014and just manage to take a drink. A little of the red liquid trickles down my chin and soaks into my shirt. That\u2019s embarrassing\u2014I\u2019ve never been a sloppy drunk.</p><p>\u201c. . . so, you\u2019re okay with that, right, Drew?\u201d</p><p>Hearing my name gets my attention, and I turn toward the sound. Like a dog. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t usually do this, but you guys are a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>I agree. \u201cYeps . . . tha\u2019s usss. We\u2019re the GT . . . yeah . . .\u201d</p><p>With a compassionate smile, she hops off her barstool. \u201cTake it easy with that stuff, handsome.\u201d</p><p>I try to hold up two thumbs\u2014the universal sign for It\u2019s all good\u2014but my fingers don\u2019t cooperate. I hold up all ten instead.</p><p>She laughs, gives me a high five, and walks away. I sit for a moment. Then\u2014because that\u2019s the f**king genius I am\u2014I decide I want to play darts. I drag myself off the bar stool in search of a game. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This won\u2019t end well.</p><p>Sometime later\u2014could be three hours or thirty minutes\u2014I realize I\u2019m sitting in a chair, at one of the back poker tables. Five cards are in my hand and a stack of chips is next to me.</p><p>I can\u2019t feel my face\u2014and for a moment, I fear it might have fallen the f**k off. I slap my cheeks.</p><p>Still there. Awesome.</p> <p>Across the table, Matthew holds his own cards in his hand. Behind him, a statuesque blonde in a black mesh body stocking is rubbing his shoulders, giving him a massage while he plays. Next to Matthew is Steven. He also has cards in his hand . . . and a hot Asian chick on his lap.</p><p>Both seem to be at shitfaced level, so . . . that explains a lot.</p><p>On the stage, Billy Warren strums a guitar he must have pulled out of his ass, singing \u201cMandy\u201d by Barry Manilow.</p><p>My phone vibrates, but when I try to fish it out of my pocket, it jumps out of my hands and onto the floor. I push my chair back and get on my knees under the table to look for it. I find the slippery bastard, but when I start to stand back up, my eyes land on the bar.</p><p>And there is the one of the most glorious sights I have ever seen.</p> <p>It\u2019s Kate.</p><p>She\u2019s in jeans and a T-shirt and her back\u2019s to me, but I still know\u2014I\u2019m certain\u2014it\u2019s her. I\u2019m so f**king relieved, I kind of get a little choked up. I can\u2019t explain why, but it feels like it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen her\u2014goddamn ages. Like so much has happened.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed her. And now she\u2019s here.</p><p>They must have come here to surprise us. What a great surprise! I pull myself up and stumble forward. I wrap my arms around her from behind, pulling her close against my chest. I bury my face in her neck, in her hair, and breathe her in\u2014enjoying the soothing wonder of being surrounded by all things Kate.</p><p>Somewhere, in my Pandora-marinated brain, I recognize that Kate smells . . . different.</p><p>Wrong.</p> <p>But I brush it off. Because I\u2019m too stupidly happy to give a shit about something so trivial.</p><p>I lick my lips and put all my energy into not slurring my words as I whisper in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. Let\u2019s just . . . leave. You and me. They won\u2019t notice we\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t care about any of this stuff\u2014I just want to be with you. I want to go back to the hotel and invent new ways to make you come.\u201d</p><p>My eyes close, and I skim my nose against her cheek. My hand finds Kate\u2019s chin and I turn her face toward me. So I can taste her, so I can press my lips to hers and show her how badly I want her\u2014how much I need her.</p><p>But before our lips meet . . .</p><p>There\u2019s a crashing sound in the distance. A commotion. And a Bitchy-sounding voice calls out, \u201cOh, hell no . . .\u201d</p><p>My eyes are still closed, and without warning my equilibrium does a 180. Then I\u2019m falling. Into total darkness.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Do you see that guy on the bed? The one with the grayish, clammy skin, wearing last night\u2019s wrinkled clothes? Nope, it\u2019s not a corpse. That\u2019s me\u2014Drew Evans.</p> <p>Not my best look, I admit. But it\u2019s the morning after. The time when the piper gets paid. Someone should take my picture\u2014it\u2019d make a great antidrinking billboard. \u201cThis is what stupid looks like, kids.\u201d</p><p>When you think about it, hangovers are kind of interesting. They\u2019re your body\u2019s way of calling you an ass**le. Of saying, \u201cI told you so.\u201d You know how I feel. We\u2019ve all been there. My stomach is rolling, my head is pounding, my mouth is dry, and my breath smells as if I just chowed down on a dog-shit sandwich. Yum.</p><p>The alarm clock on the nightstand table goes off, music blaring from its speakers, and I\u2019m pretty sure my skull just cracked in two. I roll on my side and breathe out a moan. You don\u2019t feel bad for me, do you? I get that. If you want to play, you gotta pay. Don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time. Blah, blah, blah. I slap the button on the alarm and the music fades to a low hum.</p><p>I open my eyes just enough to see that Kate isn\u2019t in the bed next to me. My hand moves across the sheets where she\u2019s supposed to be, but they\u2019re cold\u2014meaning she\u2019s hasn\u2019t been here for a while.</p><p>I sit up slowly and brace my feet on the floor. My stomach churns like an ocean dinghy during a storm. I rub my temples to try to alleviate the drumming pain. And maybe dislodge a memory. Because I don\u2019t know about you\u2014but I don\u2019t remember a goddamn thing about last night. It\u2019s just . . . blank.</p><p>Like a wet sponge on a chalkboard\u2014wiped clean.</p><p>Weird. I\u2019m not typically a blackouter. That week Kate left me drowning my sorrows while she hightailed it back to her hometown in Ohio was the only exception. But let\u2019s not talk about that.</p><p>I guess . . . I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Guys are competitive. Put a bunch of us in a room and we can turn anything into a contest. Who can burp the longest, piss the farthest, whose dick is bigger, who can punch the hardest.</p><p>Who can drink the most.</p><p>Is that what happened?</p><p>I stand stiffly and stumble toward the adjoining bathroom. I open the door. A thick billow of steam floats out. The bathroom\u2019s huge\u2014as large as a small bedroom\u2014wall-to-wall Italian marble. The sound of running water echoes from the triple-spouted corner shower.</p><p>Behind the blur of the frosted door, I make out the silhouette of a woman\u2014her head tilted back under the spray as she rinses her long, dark hair. She\u2019s petite. Skin tanned and toned, with an unmistakably luscious ass.</p><p>Technically, I\u2019m still a Catholic\u2014but if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now, Kate is my deity. Her body is my holy land, her words are my scripture, her pu**y is the altar I\u2019d crawl across burning coals to worship.</p><p>My eyes are glued to Kate\u2019s hands as they run over her slick skin for a final rinse. I lick my lips and imagine what she tastes like. Clean and wet. Vanilla and lavender. That\u2019s all it takes. My southern region rises to attention.</p><p>Ten-hut.</p><p>It\u2019s mind over matter. Or in this case, horniness over hangover. It seems that despite my fragile physical state, the guy downstairs is still cocked and ready for some morning action.</p><p>Ha ha . . . cocked . . .</p><p>Anyway, I take two steps toward the stall, fully intent on joining my irresistible fianc\u00e9e. But then the water shuts off. The shower door opens; the dark-haired beauty steps out.</p><p>And my heart drops to my feet\u2014like a f**king A-bomb from a World War II fighter plane. Can you hear it whistle?</p><p>Big, brown eyes find mine as she reaches for a towel. \u201cHey, handsome, how are you feeling? You were pretty crazy last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s smiling.</p><p>I\u2019m not.</p><p>You know how, for some people, just a whiff of peanuts can immediately make their throat close up, cutting off their airway? I don\u2019t have a peanut allergy\u2014but now I know how it feels.</p><p>They say when you\u2019re dying, your life flashes before your eyes. And I can tell you, with all certainty, that they\u2019re right. I see images of Kate . . . of our perfect little boy. They flicker in my head like a black-and-white silent movie. They\u2019re pictures of the moments we had, of the life we shared.</p> <p>A life that\u2014without a doubt\u2014is over now. As dead as the goldfish Mackenzie had a few years ago. The one she insisted on bringing to the beach, in her pocket, so he could visit all his fishy friends.</p><p>RIP Nemo. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. What the hell\u2019s your problem? Why all the drama? Why is a little na**d bush making me go all Clockwork Orange bowler-hat psycho?</p><p>\u201cDrew? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>The problem, kiddies, is that the beautiful, wet woman standing in front of me\u2014who is obviously well acquainted with me and whatever the hell went down last night?</p> <p>She\u2019s not Kate Brooks.</p><p>You know that saying, \u201cPinch me . . . I must be dreaming\u201d? Well, kick me in the balls . . . I\u2019m having a goddamn nightmare.</p><p>In a rush it all comes back to me, like a montage on fast-forward. Gambling with the boys, dinner, the fistfight, the thong in my mouth, nuzzling the stripper\u2014Lily\u2014at the bar. But that\u2019s all there is. After that last moment, there\u2019s nothing but a void.</p><p>A black hole\u2014much like the bullet I\u2019m tempted to put right between my f**king eyes at the moment\u2014would leave.</p><p>I thought it was her. Jesus Christ. I thought it was Kate. When I was embracing her, trying to kiss her\u2014I thought it was Kate.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>I sit down on the closed toilet lid while Lily wraps a towel around herself\u2014concern lines etched on her face as she watches me. I breathe hard, fast, and my heart beats as if it wants to jump out of my chest and run far, far away from this latest clusterfuck.</p><p>What happened? Did the guys pick me up and drag me back to the hotel? I would give my left nut to be able to believe that\u2019s how it went down. But if that\u2019s the case\u2014why is this girl in my goddamn shower, talking about how crazy I was last night?</p><p>Mother . . .</p><p>For the first time in my life, I can\u2019t think of an appropriate exclamation. Not a curse in existence is powerful enough to fit this situation. Did I sneak out of the bar with her, hijack the limo, and come back here? That sounds like something I could pull off.</p><p>Did Kate . . . my stomach twists . . . did Kate see us here?</p><p>Fucking God Almighty.</p><p>My heart picks up even more speed, and I think I may actually be having a heart attack. Is thirty-two too young to have a heart attack? I hope it\u2019s not.</p><p>Because she\u2019s never going to forgive me.</p> <p>Not this time. All my get-out-of-jail-free cards are used up. I run through every kiss-ass scenario I can think of\u2014every groveling method known to man.</p><p>And I discount every single one.</p><p>No flower or gift or grand gesture is going to fix this. Hallmark doesn\u2019t make an I\u2019M SORRY I NAILED ANOTHER WOMAN, THINKING IT WAS YOU card. Even if I explain . . . Kate will never move past it. Never get over it. Never look or feel about me the same way she did yesterday.</p><p>And I don\u2019t blame her.</p><p>I close my eyes and drop my head into my hands.</p><p>She deserves more than this\u2014so much more. Kate deserves someone better than a guy who\u2019s going to punch a hole in her soul every two years or so.</p><p>Better than me.</p><p>\u201cDrew, are you all right? Should I get someone?\u201d</p><p>Before I can stutter the questions I don\u2019t want to know the answers to, the bathroom door opens. And Billy Warren sticks his head in. His eyes drift from me, to Lily, and back to me. \u201cEverything okay in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answers. \u201cI think Drew\u2019s really sick, boo-boo.\u201d</p><p>Sick.</p><p>That\u2019s precisely what I am.</p><p>There\u2019s something wrong with me. I am messed-up in the head. You know it\u2014you probably realized it a long time ago. I keep\u2014</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Did she just call him boo-boo?</p><p>Warren walks into the bathroom, stops next to Lily, and puts his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou gotta puke, man? You should\u2014you\u2019ll feel better. I told you not to drink that shit last night.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at Warren\u2019s face, trying to remember\u2014to figure out. A tiny flicker of hope sparks in my chest. \u201cDid . . . did you two hook up last night?\u201d</p><p>And Douche Bag pisses all over my little flame of hope. \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t hook up.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>But then Shower Girl holds out her left hand and adds giddily, \u201cWe got married!\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up\u2014and the quick movement makes the pounding return with a sharp vengeance.</p><p>Warren straightens and puts an arm around her shoulders\u2014both of them wearing huge, matching grins.</p><p>I point between them. \u201cYou two . . . you got married?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI figured if Vegas was a good enough place for my cousin to tie the knot, it\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d His gaze shifts to Lily adoringly. \u201cWhen you find someone this amazing\u2014when you know it\u2019s the real thing\u2014you don\u2019t let it pass you by.\u201d</p><p>I squint. \u201cMarried?\u201d</p><p>Lily nods enthusiastically. \u201cAt the Drive-Through Wedding Chapel. We took some great pictures. And now I\u2019m Mrs. Billy Warren.\u201d</p><p>Nope, still can\u2019t wrap my head around it. \u201cMarried? Really?\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s expression goes from sappy to annoyed. \u201cYeah, Long Duck Fuckin\u2019 Dong\u2014married. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>It finally sinks in. Donkey Dick married Shower Girl. But more important:</p><p>I. Didn\u2019t. Screw her.</p><p>Cue the chorus of angels. Ahhh-le-luia, ahhh-le-luia, alleluia, alleluia, ah-leee-luia . . .</p><p>I didn\u2019t mess up. I didn\u2019t betray Kate or ruin our son\u2019s life or destroy everything we have. Overcome with emotion, I may actually weep with relief.</p><p>But I don\u2019t cry. I do something much, much worse. I stand up and hug Billy Warren. \u201cI love you, man.\u201d</p><p>Yes, the stress of the last few minutes has finally driven me over the edge. We embrace for a second before he pushes me back, holds me at arm\u2019s length, and looks at me with confused brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d he utters disgustedly.</p><p>I come to my senses. And shake my muddled head. \u201cSorry, I just . . . I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Translation?

Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Then I realize I still have no idea where the hell Kate is. I hook my thumb toward the door. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p> <p>As fast as my feet can carry me, I dash out the door.</p><p>Stepping out of the bedroom into the living area feels similar to when Dorothy stepped out of her dilapidated house into Oz. Everything is too bright, too colorful . . . too loud.</p><p>Matthew and Delores sit close together on the couch, under a beige blanket, sharing a bowl of cereal and watching Gilligan\u2019s Island on TV. Matthew chuckles at the television before Dee feeds him a scoop of Froot Loops.</p><p>As I step into the room, Matthew\u2019s attention turns to me. \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>Delores is disappointed. \u201cDamn it. I was hoping we\u2019d have to get your stomach pumped.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew tugs her strawberry-blond ponytail and tells her firmly, \u201cI told you to be nice from now on. Cut that shit out.\u201d</p><p>When he turns back to me, Delores sticks her tongue out at him.</p><p>The ecstatic adrenaline rush from learning I did not actually put my dick in a pu**y that wasn\u2019t Kate\u2019s is starting to wear off. My head and stomach resume the nauseating symphony of a mighty hangover.</p><p>I rub my temples and inform Matthew and Dee, \u201cYou know Billy got married last night?\u201d</p><p>In unison, they respond wearily, \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a stripper he\u2019s known for less than twenty-four hours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Though I think I already know the answer, I ask the third-stupidest question ever: \u201cDid he get her to sign a prenup?\u201d</p><p>Delores scoffs, \u201cI\u2019m not sure my cousin knows how to spell prenup.\u201d</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>They seem way too calm about this development. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d</p><p>Now Dee glares at me. \u201cAre you f**king kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Matthew explains, \u201cDrew, it was your idea.\u201d</p> <p>My face goes slack. \u201cIt was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. After you woke up from your nosedive at the strip club, you went on and on about how great marriage is. How everyone should get f**king married. How love is a precious, beautiful flower, and marriage is the water and sunlight that helps it grow.\u201d</p><p>I seriously need to never drink again. Ever.</p><p>\u201cI said that?\u201d</p><p>Matthew nods. \u201cYou were very poetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. We should call Wilson\u2014he\u2019s the best divorce lawyer in New York City.\u201d And an old colleague of my mother\u2019s. \u201cMaybe he can draft something that\u2019ll work retroactively.\u201d</p><p>Matthew takes another bite of cereal. \u201cAlready left him a message.\u201d</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>My fingers move from my temples to my forehead, continuing to rub the torturous pounding. \u201cWhat else am I missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d Matthew asks.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . playing poker with you and Steven at Paradise. Warren singing Barry Manilow onstage.\u201d</p><p>My best friend laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re missing a lot.\u201d He sets the bowl of cereal down on the coffee table and elaborates. \u201cKate, Dee, Lexi, and Erin decided to crash our party and showed up at Paradise. After we left the police station\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him right off. \u201cWhy were we at the police station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where they take you when you get arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got arrested?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cOh, no\u2014we didn\u2019t get arrested.\u201d</p><p>Dee raises her hand. \u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go wide. \u201cKate was in jail?\u201d</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Matthew waves his hand calmly. \u201cOnly for, like, twenty minutes. They released the girls to our custody\u2014no charges were filed. I smoothed things over with the strip club.\u201d</p><p>Going with the usual-suspect line of thought, I turn on Delores. \u201cWhat did you do to get Kate arrested?\u201d</p><p>She just laughs. \u201cYou can thank your sister for that one\u2014Alexandra didn\u2019t appreciate her husband getting so much attention from the strippers. When one of them got in her face, Lexi showed her what was up\u2014and the rest of us had her back. I\u2019ll say this much: for a trust-fund baby, the Bitch has got a mean right hook.\u201d</p><p>This is not news to me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d I sigh. \u201cAll right, forget all that\u2014just tell me where Kate is.\u201d</p><p>Dee looks confused. \u201cWhat do you mean? She\u2019s in your room.\u201d</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Before I can point out that Kate is not, in fact, in our room, one of the bedroom doors opens. Erin steps out, wrapped in a fluffy bathrobe, her hair wet. \u201cGood morning, everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, naughty girl,\u201d Dee greets her.</p><p>Erin steps into the kitchen. \u201cMmm . . . coffee.\u201d</p><p>And prepare to have your mind blown\u2014because in the bedroom doorway Erin just exited appears none other than . . . Jack O\u2019Shay.</p><p>Shirtless. Wearing only boxers.</p><p>No way.</p><p>He stretches his arms wide above his head with a yawn, then scratches his chest and adjusts his balls. \u201cWhat a great f**king night, huh? I\u2019m actually sad you\u2019re only getting married once, Evans. I could definitely do that again.\u201d</p><p>Please look closely at my face. Did my eyeballs fall out of my head? \u2019Cause it feels like they have.</p><p>I look at Matthew. He just nods and flicks his hand, silently telling me, What are you gonna do?</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>As Erin sticks her head into the refrigerator behind us, Jack stands next to me. In a low voice I ask, \u201cDid you . . . is this . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this what you think it is?\u201d He grins like a well-fed feline. \u201cIt is, and I did.\u201d Then, softer, he says, \u201cErin\u2019s a wildcat, man. Easily made the top three bangs of my lifetime. I\u2019ll fill you in later.\u201d</p><p>If this ends up causing Erin to not be my secretary in the near future\u2014I\u2019m going to have to kill Jack. Seriously. I can always find more friends. Finding a secretary who knows her shit as well as Erin does? That\u2019ll be much more difficult.</p><p>Erin comes back into the room sipping her coffee. Jack grabs a newspaper off the table and announces, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the john.\u201d Before he goes, he adds, \u201cHey, Erin\u2014how about you bring me a cup of coffee for when I get out?\u201d</p><p>Erin smiles sweetly. \u201cHey, Jack\u2014how about you get it yourself? This isn\u2019t the office, and even if it was, I don\u2019t work for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack just chuckles and goes back into the bedroom.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>I turn to stare at Erin. My voice is teasingly aghast as I say, \u201cErin. I am shocked. I can\u2019t believe you let Jack play you\u2014I thought you were smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cDid you ever consider the possibility that I\u2019m the one who played Jack?\u201d</p> <p>I touch my jaw thoughtfully because, no, I hadn\u2019t considered that.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Erin continues, \u201cI came here hoping to meet Mr. Right, but he didn\u2019t appear. Jack is cute, and, more important, he was ready, willing, and able. You do the math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t that going to be weird for you, working in the same office every day? He\u2019s seen your cum face.\u201d I pause. \u201cAt least . . . I hope he\u2019s seen your cum face.\u201d</p><p>Erin winks. \u201cHe\u2019s well acquainted with it.\u201d She sips her coffee. \u201cBut, no, it\u2019s not going to be awkward. We\u2019re adults\u2014and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>Unless you\u2019re Billy Warren. In his case, what happens in Vegas may end up taking 50 percent of his net worth.</p><p>With that, Erin goes back to the kitchen, pours a second cup of coffee, and returns to the bedroom Jack retreated to, closing the door behind her.</p><p>I shake my head a little. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to ask Matthew and Dee where Kate is again\u2014but that rhythmic knocking noise starts back up. Do you hear it too?</p><p>Thump.</p> <p>Thump.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that noise?\u201d</p><p>Like those disturbing twins from The Shining, my best friend and his wife answer in harmony yet again. \u201cSteven and Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>The racket does seem to be coming from behind their closed door. \u201cWhat are they, nailing each other to a cross?\u201d</p><p>Matthew mutters, \u201cSomething\u2019s getting nailed all right.\u201d</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Cautiously, I step toward their door. When I\u2019m inches away, I align my ear with the seam at the hinge. Listening.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s your daddy, baby? Say it, say my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteven, ooohhh, Steven.\u201d</p><p>Then the unmistakable sound of a palm slapping ass reaches my ear.</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d I jump back away from the door as if it were an electrified fence. I cover my ears, but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>I bend over and brace my hands on my knees, on the verge of actually vomiting. I just hope the villa is stocked with hydrogen peroxide, so I can sterilize my eardrums.</p><p>After the desire to upchuck passes, I stand up and address Dee and Matthew. \u201cScrew all this. The only thing I want to know is\u2014where. Is. Kate?\u201d</p><p>Delores answers, \u201cI told you, dumbass, she\u2019s in your room. We tucked you two into bed together as soon as we came back last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just in our room! She\u2019s not there!\u201d</p><p>Delores shrugs. \u201cMaybe she decided to bail on the wedding\u2014pried open the window and made a break for it.\u201d Then she smiles. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2014good on her.\u201d</p><p>Matthew pulls Dee\u2019s hair again, but says, \u201cIt\u2019s true, Drew; Kate hasn\u2019t left the room\u2014we would\u2019ve seen her.\u201d He turns back to his wife and warns, \u201cIf yanking your hair doesn\u2019t get the job done, I\u2019m going to break out the paddle.\u201d</p><p>She leans closer and taunts, \u201cPromises, promises.\u201d Then she kisses him, ignoring my dilemma completely. I push my hand through my hair, then turn away and march back to our bedroom.</p><p>My eyes scan the bed, but Kate\u2019s not there. Just to be safe, I pick up the blanket and shake it out.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I enter the walk-in closet next to the bedroom door. Though I realize it\u2019s unlikely, I check behind the hanging clothes. Not a sign of Kate to be seen. Then I walk out of the closet and take a few steps around the bed . . .</p><p>On the floor, peeking out from the far side of the bed, are five pretty toes. They\u2019re connected to a beautiful foot. My eyes travel from the foot, up the delectable calf, to the exquisite thigh that fits so perfectly around my hip.</p><p>Still in last night\u2019s clothes, sound asleep on her side, one leg stretched out, one tucked close to her torso, with folded hands resting under her cheek, like a pillow.</p><p>Kate.</p><p>Every cell in my body sighs her name with relief. I stand there for a minute, just watching her\u2014breathing in the sight of her as she slumbers like a kitten in front of a fireplace. The all-encompassing love I have for her, that\u2019s always with me\u2014I feel it more keenly. Because even for just a few minutes, I\u2019d thought I hurt her.</p><p>I grab a pillow and the blanket and drop to my knees beside Kate. Then I lie on the makeshift floor bed and gather her tight against me. My chest pillows her head.</p><p>She stirs with a moan. \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>I smooth her hair. \u201cYeah, baby, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Without lifting her head, she wonders in a drowsy voice, \u201cWhy are you on the floor?\u201d</p><p>I kiss the top of her head and whisper against her hair, \u201cBecause that\u2019s where you are.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, she just says, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>My hand slides up and down her back, her arm, savoring every touch\u2014enjoying the feel of her next to me. \u201cDid you have fun last night?\u201d</p><p>Still lying on my chest, she nods. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d Then Kate breathes deep and suggests, \u201cLet\u2019s never do anything like this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could not agree with that statement more.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re quiet for a few moments. I look up at the ceiling, wanting and needing to get a few more hours of sleep. But I have to tell her one more thing first.</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d I squeeze her shoulder gently. \u201cHey, Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>My voice is low, rough with emotion, as I confess, \u201cI really can\u2019t wait to marry you.\u201d</p><p>She raises her head and gazes at me with adorable bleary eyes. She smiles. \u201cYeah . . . me too.\u201d</p><p>Kate lays her head back down, and her hand rests right over my heart. I cover her hand with mine, and together we fall back to sleep.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>So what have we learned from this story?</p><p>First and foremost, bachelor parties?</p><p>Terrible idea.</p><p>Once you\u2019re in a committed relationship, going to bars or a strip club without your significant other is just asking for trouble. Whoever started the bachelor-party tradition should be buried alive in a mass grave with the karaoke guy and . . . well . . . I was going to say Billy Warren.</p><p>But I guess we can let him live. I\u2019m over it\u2014he\u2019s harmless. He\u2019s also dim-witted, annoying, and . . . decent . . . a stand-up guy, a good friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You already knew that, didn\u2019t you?</p><p>We\u2019ll never be the best of friends, but from here on out, the one or two times a year I have to see him will actually be okay with me.</p><p>What else?</p><p>Have faith in yourself\u2014it actually is possible to learn from your mistakes. I did. And this time, when I was on the spot, I didn\u2019t screw up. I believed in Kate, trusted what we have, and did the right thing. Fucking finally.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s get to the part you\u2019ve been waiting for:</p><p>The wedding.</p><p>Matthew, Jack and Steven, my parents, James and I, arrive at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral right on time. Although they rarely close the church to the public, for our event\u2014and to accommodate the thousand-plus guests sitting in the pews\u2014the powers that be agreed to do just that. The hefty \u201cdonation\u201d I gave didn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>I keep an eye on my son as he runs up and down the aisle, stopping occasionally to bask in the attention of an adoring guest. Then I shake hands with Father Dougherty, the priest who\u2019ll actually be doing the deed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling this afternoon, Andrew? Are you ready?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was born ready, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Your bride\u2019s limousine has just arrived, so you can take your place at the altar.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no anxiety\u2014no nervousness or fear that I\u2019m making a mistake. No cold feet. The only thing I feel is . . . excitement. Impatience.</p><p>My mother retrieves James and they head back to the vestibule. My father and I walk up the side aisle, toward the altar.</p><p>About halfway there, he stops me with a hand on my shoulder. His blue eyes, so much like my own, are filled with emotion. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t told you before, I want to make sure you know\u2014I\u2019m so proud of you, Son. You\u2019re a good man, you\u2019re an amazing father, and I have no doubt you\u2019ll be an outstanding husband. I\u2019m so very proud, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Then he hugs me. Tight and secure, the kind of embrace that tells me even though I\u2019m married and a father\u2014he\u2019s still my dad and I\u2019ll always be his son.</p> <p>\u201cThat means a lot, Dad,\u201d I say gruffly. \u201cThank you for being the best example of what a father, a husband, is supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>We pat each other\u2019s back. Then he taps my biceps. \u201cNow get up there before Kate changes her mind.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cHighly unlikely.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cBetter to be safe than sorry. I didn\u2019t think your mother would try backing out, either.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019t heard that one before. \u201cMom balked at marrying you?\u201d</p><p>He slaps my back again. \u201cThat\u2019s a story for another day, Son. Go get yourself married\u2014and enjoy every second of it.\u201d</p><p>With that, he walks to the back of the church. I meet Matthew and Steven at the altar. \u201cYou got the rings?\u201d I ask Matthew.</p><p>He taps his pocket. \u201cSafe and sound.\u201d</p> <p>When the pianist begins playing the prelude\u2014\u201cAngels Watching\u201d by the O\u2019Neill Brothers\u2014Steven announces, \u201cThat\u2019s our cue.\u201d</p><p>Matthew grins my way and imitates the Terminator: \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d They both walk down the side aisle to the back of the church.</p><p>I\u2019m left standing alone. Waiting.</p><p>I nod to the watching guests. One hand rests at my side, the other is folded across my lower back. I inhale a deep breath and blow it out slowly.</p><p>The string quartet in the orchestra bay begins to play Canon in D by Pachelbel.</p><p>It\u2019s game time.</p><p>The first to appear in the doorway are our parents. My father looks distinguished as he stands in the middle, my mother, wearing a plum gown, on one arm; Kate\u2019s mother, in deep blue, is on the other. All three wear beaming smiles as they proceed down the aisle. Before my mother enters the pew, she blows me a kiss. She used to do the same thing when I was a kid, as I ran out the door to school\u2014before I was old enough to ask her to stop.</p><p>I smile back at her meaningfully.</p><p>Next are my sister and Steven. Alexandra looks gorgeous in the strapless, burgundy bridesmaid gown Kate chose. An ivory shawl demurely covers her shoulders: her blond hair is pinned up and curled, not a strand out of place. Her arm rests comfortably, confidently, through Steven\u2019s. They glance at each other and I just know they\u2019re thinking of their own wedding. When they reach the altar, Steven kisses Lexi sweetly, then they part and stand on their respective sides.</p><p>Jack and Erin follow, arm in arm. Jack winks at a female guest as he strolls down the aisle and Erin smiles joyfully. Brightly. If you ever wanted a good example of how a no-strings-attached hookup should be done, Jack and Erin are it. No bad feelings, no awkwardness, just friendly, physical attraction.</p><p>After they reach the altar, it\u2019s Matthew and Dee-Dee\u2019s turn\u2014the best man and matron of honor. Wearing the same gown as my sister\u2014instead of one of the whacked-out ensembles she typically dresses in\u2014Delores looks really good. She holds Matthew\u2019s arm and sways her h*ps in time with the music, making him laugh at her silly exuberance. When they reach the altar, she looks me up and down\u2014then gives me a thumbs-up.</p><p>I nod at her silent compliment.</p><p>Delores stands beside my sister, and Matthew takes his place to my left.</p><p>One more couple to go before Kate makes her entrance. This couple will steal the whole f**king show. I knew it, Kate knew it, and neither of us minded at all.</p><p>Mackenzie and James.</p><p>The flower girl and the ring bearer. The gold mine of every wedding photographer who ever worked.</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s dress is white lace with cap sleeves. Her long hair is pulled up at the sides with white daisies woven into the crown of blond braids. She\u2019s old enough to be called beautiful but still enough of a kid to be called adorable. Her blue eyes shine as she waves to me from the end of the aisle.</p><p>I wave back.</p><p>She takes my son\u2019s hand and together they make their way to me. James looks impressively lovable in his own custom Armani tux. He\u2019s surprisingly well behaved\u2014keeping pace with Mackenzie, holding his ring-bearer pillow straight, grinning for all the cameras taking their picture.</p><p>When they reach the altar, James drops Mackenzie\u2019s hand, ditches his pillow, and runs straight to me. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>I scoop him up and look into his big, brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs good?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYou did great, buddy.\u201d I kiss his temple. \u201cGo sit with Grandma and Pop now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtay.\u201d</p><p>I set him down and my parents receive him into their pew.</p><p>Then I straighten up. The starting notes of the \u201cWedding March\u201d fill the cathedral. All the guests stand and turn toward the closed double doors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wooden doors open. And the air rushes from my lungs.</p><p>Because she\u2019s breathtaking. More stunning than I\u2019d imagined\u2014and my imagination is pretty f**king active.</p><p>Kate\u2019s a vision in white\u2014strapless, a sweetheart neckline with just a teasing taste of cle**age, fitted around the middle, accenting her tiny waist. Lace covers the delicate swell of her hips, flaring out behind her in a majestic train. An Irish-lace veil adorns her head, and her hair falls in shiny, dark waves beneath it. Her makeup is light, just enough to emphasize her flawless skin, full lips, and those big, dark eyes that captivated me the moment I saw them.</p><p>She swallows hard and gazes around the crowded cathedral, looking uneasy. Anxious. Until she sees me. At the altar\u2014waiting for her.</p> <p>She holds my eyes for a second, then slowly, surely, she smiles.</p><p>And it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>My view of the world blurs, and I don\u2019t give a shit if that sounds pussified. It\u2019s true. And deserved. My chest tightens with tenderness, with the sanctity of this moment.</p><p>The music soars as Kate holds George\u2019s arm, and he escorts her down the aisle. I can\u2019t take my eyes off her, and her gaze never leaves my face. When they finally arrive, I shake George\u2019s hand and he moves into the pew next to Carol.</p><p>Kate offers me her hand, and, as I did the first time we met, I bring it to my lips and kiss it reverently.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re exquisite,\u201d I tell her softly. \u201cI . . . have no words.\u201d</p><p>Her smile doesn\u2019t falter. \u201cI guess there really is a first time for everything.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if everyone else, the whole damn church, just fades away. And there\u2019s only the two of us. I cup her cheek and smooth her lip with my thumb. Then I lean forward and kiss her\u2014softly and slowly and brimming with feeling.</p><p>After a few seconds, Father Dougherty clears his throat. Loudly. \u201cThat part comes later, son.\u201d</p><p>I end the kiss and turn to the priest, still holding Kate\u2019s hand.</p><p>Kate blushes and the guests\u2019 laughter echoes off the walls.</p> <p>I clear my throat. \u201cSorry, Father. Patience has never really been my strong suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in this case, I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d He focuses on Kate. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Father.\u201d She passes her bouquet of white daisies and roses to Delores.</p><p>\u201cShall we get on with it, then?\u201d Father Dougherty asks.</p><p>From the first row, James yells, \u201cReady, set, go!\u201d</p><p>Again, laughter ripples through the congregation.</p><p>Father Dougherty says, \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>The wedding ceremony proceeds without incident\u2014the prayers, the readings, the lighting of the unity candle. Then the moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for arrives.</p> <p>Father Dougherty asks, \u201cAndrew, do you promise to be true to Katherine in good times and bad, in sickness and health? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish her until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>In a clear voice, I pledge, \u201cI sure do.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes hold mine and her smile is so bright\u2014so true\u2014as Father Dougherty asks her, \u201cAnd do you, Katherine, promise to be true to Andrew in good times and bad, in sickness and health? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish him until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>Tears well in her beautiful brown eyes. \u201cYes. Yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>It takes everything I\u2019ve got not to pull her to me and kiss her again.</p><p>Matthew passes me the rings and Kate holds out her hand. My throat tightens as I place her ring on her finger. \u201cI give you this ring as a token of my love and devotion. I pledge to you all that I am, all I\u2019ll ever be. With this ring, I marry you and join my life to yours.\u201d</p><p>Kate holds my hand for an extra moment. Then, tears slip down her cheeks as she slides my own ring on my finger, saying in a voice choked with emotion, \u201cI give you this ring as a token of my love and devotion. I pledge to you all that I am and all that I will ever be. With this ring, I gladly marry you and join my life to yours.\u201d</p><p>Then Father Dougherty declares, \u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife. What God has joined together, let no man pull asunder. You may kiss your bride.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, I sweep Kate up into my arms. She laughs and wraps her arms around my neck, and our mouths fuse hot and heavy. The kiss is long and thorough and totally inappropriate for church.</p><p>Applause and whistles erupt, the church bells ring, and the musicians belt out \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d</p><p>Finally, reluctantly, I set Kate on her high-heeled feet and we walk down the aisle side by side.</p><p>Hand in hand.</p><p>Husband and wife.</p><p>We take a thousand f**king pictures, in a variety of locations and every conceivable combination. James holds up like a trouper\u2014doesn\u2019t get cranky once. The photographer had to ask Kate and me to stop making out so we could smile for the camera. Apparently, my hand on her ass is not an acceptable pose for a wedding portrait.</p><p>But I think he\u2019s just flat-out wrong about that.</p><p>Once we all pile into the limo, Matthew passes me a bottle of champagne. I pop the cork, spewing bubbles everywhere. Some splashes on my face, and Kate leans over and slowly licks it off.</p><p>Delores whistles.</p><p>\u201cMmm . . . ,\u201d Kate hums to me. \u201cChampagne tastes good on you, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI can think of a few other spots it\u2019ll taste even better, Mrs. Evans.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cMake sure we have a bottle in the honeymoon suite tonight, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay ahead of you, baby.\u201d Her body puts Waterford crystal to shame.</p><p>I fill glasses and pass them around the limo. Steven gives Mackenzie a sip from his, and her face scrunches up adorably with disgust.</p><p>James climbs onto his mother\u2019s lap and rests his head against her chest.</p><p>Kate strokes his dark hair. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to last.\u201d</p><p>I take a drink from my glass. \u201cThe way you look in that dress? Neither am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your favorite dress was the one I\u2019m not wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is the exception. Although, I should reserve judgment until I see you out of it.\u201d I kiss her ear, then whisper into it, \u201cAfter a long, exhaustive perusal . . . I\u2019ll make my preference abundantly clear.\u201d</p><p>She gazes at me tenderly, with soft adulation shining on her beautiful face. \u201cI\u2019m so happy, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Mission accomplished.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>I stroke James\u2019s back and pull Kate close with my free arm.

I\u2019m definitely gonna be looking for excuses to speak of her that way.</p> <p>I escort her under the twinkling lighted archway into the building where we\u2019ll celebrate our marital bliss. Though you and I both know the real celebration happens in the honeymoon suite.</p><p>Our group arrives at the well-appointed suite adjacent to the main ballroom, where the wedding party enjoys the cocktail hour away from the prying eyes of the guests\u2014like rock stars in the greenroom. Lauren Laforet, our wedding planner, greets us, makes sure we\u2019re good so far, then walks off dictating orders into a walkie-talkie to her minions. Delores and Alexandra have Kate stand to \u201cbustle\u201d the back of her dress, so she can dance without getting stepped on and falling on her face.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what the \u201cbustle\u201d entails, but by the look of concentration on their faces\u2014I don\u2019t want any part of it. I head over to the buffet and pile hors d\u2019oeuvres onto a plate for Kate.</p><p>Gotta keep her strength up for later.</p><p>While she stands, I feed her piece by piece. I\u2019m guessing she didn\u2019t eat this morning because she moans and sighs with each mouthwatering bite. Or maybe she just likes sucking on my fingers\u2014\u2019cause she does that too.</p> <p>With a knowing smirk, Kate asks me, \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>My semistiff dick nods. \u201cImmensely.\u201d I slide a small, bacon-wrapped scallop between her lips, and her tongue swirls around my finger.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Called it. \u201cSuck it harder,\u201d I tell her\u2014only half joking.</p><p>She obliges.</p><p>When I reach for another piece, Kate says, \u201cNow, where have I heard that before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet used to hearing it more. There\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll be my mantra for the next three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Alexandra calls from where she\u2019s crouched behind Kate. \u201cWe can hear you. And . . . ewwww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019ll still never be as damaged as I was by what I heard from your f**king room in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>The peroxide didn\u2019t work. Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear them.</p><p>I\u2019m considering therapy. Or hypnosis.</p><p>She just grins slyly. \u201cThat was a great morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was a great morning?\u201d Steven asks, as he brings my sister a cocktail.</p><p>She looks at Steven the way a twelve-year-old looks at a Justin Bieber poster. \u201cEvery morning with you.\u201d</p> <p>He kisses her lips.</p><p>I catch Mackenzie\u2019s eye from across the room, wink, and tilt my head toward her parents. She beams back at me, and I know things at home have been back on track with Lexi and Steven. Then Mackenzie mouths, So gross.</p><p>I just nod.</p><p>After the food, music is the second most important ingredient for a successful wedding reception. We hired a twelve-piece band, and a DJ for the songs that just sound stupid when someone other than the original artist covers them. The wedding singer\u2014a voluptuous redhead with stellar pipes\u2014introduces us as Mr. and Mrs. Drew Evans for the first time, and as our guests stand and applaud, I lead Kate to the dance floor for the customary first dance.</p><p>It\u2019s the wedding singer\u2019s partner\u2014a salt-and-pepper-haired guy with a smooth voice\u2014who sings it. Kate, being more musically inclined than I\u2019ll ever be, chose the song\u2014but I got final approval.</p><p>\u201cI Cross My Heart\u201d by George Strait.</p><p>The lyrics, the tone, it\u2019s perfect for us.</p><p>And just like in the church, while we waltz around the dance floor and I hold her close against me, the thousand eyes watching us fade from our awareness. It\u2019s just me and her\u2014and this moment.</p><p>I look into my wife\u2019s shining brown eyes, and I sing the lyrics to her that mean the most:</p><p>You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete.</p><p>Kate sings the next line back to me:</p><p>And as long as there\u2019s a breath in me, I\u2019ll make yours just as sweet.</p><p>It\u2019s a sickeningly tender, crazy-in-love, never-happens-in-real-life kind of moment that I would\u2019ve made fun of if I saw it in a movie or on TV.</p><p>But because it\u2019s real\u2014because it\u2019s us\u2014it\u2019s f**king impeccable.</p><p>Afterward, Kate dances with my father to \u201cThe Way You Look Tonight\u201d by Frank Sinatra. The old man\u2019s a great dancer, and he makes Kate smile and laugh. At one point she gets choked up from whatever words he\u2019s whispering to her, and I make a mental note to ask her later on what he said.</p><p>Then my mother and I take the floor\u2014Kenny Rogers, \u201cThrough the Years.\u201d Her eyes fill with tears as she looks at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She laughs self-depreciatingly. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. You\u2019re my little boy and I\u2019m so happy for you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Mothers are the first woman a man will ever love\u2014at least the good ones are. They show you how a lady should and shouldn\u2019t be treated, and they set the standard for every woman that comes after them. I really lucked out in that department.</p><p>My mother continues, \u201cShe\u2019s your match in every way. You chose so well.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Kate, who stands beside her mother and George\u2014so goddamn lovely, it makes my heart ache.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I really did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d I kiss my mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you, Mom. If it wasn\u2019t for you\u2014I never would\u2019ve been able to win over a woman like Kate.\u201d</p><p>My mother hugs me as we finish the dance. No more words are needed.</p><p>After that, the party really gets started. The lights are turned down low, accenting the tall, candlelit centerpieces, overflowing with white blossoms. We drink, we laugh, we devour amazing culinary delights. Once Kate and I have managed to chat with every one of our guests and thank them for joining us on our \u201cspecial day,\u201d a couple approaches us.</p><p>Billy Warren and his stripper-heeled, tiny-black-dress-wearing wife.</p><p>Yep, they\u2019re still married\u2014six whole days now. That\u2019s a hell of a lot longer than I was betting on. I shake Warren\u2019s hand. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d I turn to his dark-haired companion. \u201cAnd with clothes on. Even better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I told Kate all about the hangover-shower meet-and-greet. She thought it was hysterical.</p><p>Warren smiles. \u201cYou mind if I borrow your wife for a dance?\u201d</p><p>Because he called her my wife, I don\u2019t mind at all. \u201cAs long as you give her back.\u201d</p><p>Kate kisses my cheek and heads off with Hopeless.</p> <p>His blushing bride goes to the bar. I stand alone, watching the swaying couples on the dance floor. Until Matthew comes up, arms crossed, standing next to me, taking it all in.</p><p>He nods toward Kate and Warren. \u201cYou okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangely enough, I really am.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a beat. Maybe it\u2019s just the significance of the day, but I\u2019m feeling pretty f**king sentimental. \u201cHave I ever thanked you for being my best friend?\u201d</p><p>Matthew smiles. \u201cNo thanks are needed. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial thing we\u2019ve got going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but . . . thank you for pulling my ass out of the fire\u2014and for kicking it when needed. Or at least . . . getting Alexandra to do your dirty work for you. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d Then he spreads his arms wide. \u201cLet\u2019s hug it out, bitch.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and we do just that, slapping each other on the back.</p><p>Until Delores comes tearing up to us, holding the knife that we\u2019re soon supposed to cut the cake with.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Something tells me she\u2019s not talking to Matthew.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stab you in your scrotum!\u201d</p><p>This sounds serious.</p><p>As Matthew restrains his wife, I ask calmly, \u201cIs there a reason you have the sudden urge to sexually mutilate me?\u201d</p><p>She tells her husband, \u201cHelga just called. Documents were delivered to the house that she had to sign for. Legal documents\u2014he changed our son\u2019s name, Matthew!\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Those weren\u2019t supposed to arrive until Kate and I were on our honeymoon\u2014far away, in the middle of the Mediterranean for three wonderful, na**d weeks.</p><p>Matthew looks over his shoulder at me. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms up in the air. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me one day. And so will Michael.\u201d</p><p>Delores lifts the knife.</p> <p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t love you two and your son, I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d I let that sink in a minute. \u201cAnd you\u2019re one to talk\u2014what about that text you sent Billy from the bachelorette party? If I wasn\u2019t so evolved, that could\u2019ve really f**ked things up for me and Kate. And . . . it hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>Did it really? No. But you play the cards you\u2019re dealt.</p><p>My admission calms Dee a little. I have a feeling she and Matthew have already discussed it. \u201cThat was a joke, Drew. If I really hated you . . . I wouldn\u2019t put any effort into torturing you. I\u2019d just ignore you completely.\u201d</p><p>Matthew interjects, \u201cWe\u2019ll change his name back. It was a screwed-up attempt at a nice gesture, but we\u2019ll change it back.\u201d</p><p>I doubt they will. And if they do . . . I\u2019ll just have to be stealthier in my next attempt.</p><p>Kate comes over, looking only half-concerned. But she still stands in front of me protectively.</p><p>\u201cDee-Dee? Remember we said no bloodshed on the wedding day\u2014it\u2019s bad luck.\u201d</p><p>Dee sighs and tosses the knife on the table. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Matthew nods. \u201cI\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019re gone, Kate turns around to me. \u201cThe papers arrived early, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI told you it was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around her because she\u2019s gorgeous when she\u2019s right. \u201cI should\u2019ve listened to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles up at me. \u201cMaybe we should have kept \u2018obey\u2019 in the vows.\u201d</p><p>She does have a point.</p><p>We dance. Slow and sweet, dirty and sweaty. At one point, while I\u2019m grinding against Kate\u2019s ass, James barrels onto the dance floor with Sister Beatrice Dugan hot on his heels. I pick him up, and the first nun I ever lusted after smiles with appreciation.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying your celebration, Katherine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Sister, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be praying for you both\u2014for a long and fruitful union.\u201d</p><p>I bounce James and he squeals. \u201cAll our prayers have been answered, Sister B\u2014save yours for someone who really needs them.\u201d</p><p>She clicks her tongue. \u201cAll newlyweds need the Lord\u2019s grace, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>Disgruntled with not being the center of attention, James rectifies the situation. \u201cPoosy!\u201d he yells, laughing manically. \u201cPoosy!\u201d</p><p>I freeze, and Kate\u2019s eyes slide closed.</p><p>Sister B smirks. \u201cAnd this darling seems to have his father\u2019s disposition.\u201d</p><p>Kate opens her eyes. \u201cVery much so, yes.\u201d</p><p>Sister B pats Kate\u2019s arm with sympathy. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be praying doubly hard.\u201d She addresses our son. \u201cWould you like a soda pop, young James?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and he nods quickly. I put him down, and, holding Sister B\u2019s hand, he toddles off.</p><p>The music changes to a slower song\u2014\u201cAll of Me\u201d by John Legend. Without a word, Kate raises her arms to my shoulders, I rest my hands on her lower back, and we sway in time to the beat.</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice another couple dancing off to my right\u2014not anywhere as close as Kate and I are\u2014but still, for a second I\u2019m shocked.</p><p>Because it\u2019s Mackenzie and Johnny Fucking Fitzgerald.</p><p>Her one hand is on his shoulder, his at her waist, while their other arms are bent at the elbow, hands clasped in the classic ballroom posture.</p><p>I almost pity him. Because even though it\u2019s not intentional? My girl was born to be a heartbreaker.</p><p>As I watch them silently, Johnny makes his move. Catching Mackenzie off guard, the little bastard presses his lips to hers and snatches a kiss. Her first, I\u2019m guessing. It\u2019s chaste and over as quickly as it started.</p><p>Johnny pulls back and looks hopeful. But Mackenzie . . . she seems confused . . . until she\u2019s not. Then she rips her hand from his.</p><p>And punches him right in the gut.</p><p>\u201cOoof!\u201d He folds at the waist, holding his stomach, and Mackenzie stomps off.</p><p>I help the kid off the dance floor. \u201cYou need to work on reading a chick\u2019s signals or you\u2019re gonna be getting hit a lot, Casanova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenzie hits hard for a girl,\u201d he rasps.</p><p>\u201cShe kicks harder. You got off lucky.\u201d Once he\u2019s in a chair, I pat his shoulder. \u201cBetter luck next time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then I return to my wife\u2019s waiting arms.</p><p>An hour later, it\u2019s speech time. Completely at ease, Matthew taps his glass with a spoon and then addresses the silenced crowd.</p><p>\u201cAs the best man, I could stand up here and tell you stories about Drew and Kate. How they met, their accomplishments and battles at the office, what amazing parents they are, how devoted they are to family and friends. But that would take a long time . . . and dessert is coming.\u201d The audience chuckles. \u201cSo I\u2019ll sum it up like this: Drew is one of a kind in the greatest of ways. When God made him, he broke the mold. But he didn\u2019t want him to be alone. So he made Kate, and then he broke her mold too.\u201d Matthew raises his glass and the crowd raise theirs. \u201cIf ever there was a man and a woman who were perfect for each other, who deserve each other and bring out the best in each other\u2014it\u2019s you two. Congratulations on your marriage\u2014may it be long and fun and frisky\u2014and may you always look at one another the way you do today. To Drew and Kate.\u201d</p><p>Got to hand it to him\u2014Matthew knows how to give a good f**king speech.</p> <p>After toasting us, the crowd calls for a kiss\u2014which I\u2019m more than happy to provide.</p><p>Later, after Delores got wasted and dragged Kate and Billy onstage to sing \u201cThat\u2019s What Friends Are For,\u201d after the cake was cut and I licked the icing off Kate\u2019s lips, after Kate threw her bouquet into Erin\u2019s waiting arms, and Dee\u2019s stepbrother made a diving catch of the garter, we dance the final dance.</p><p>The floor is packed with our family, with all of our friends. In the center are me and Kate. I hold a sleeping James with one arm, his head on my shoulder. The other arm is around Kate\u2019s waist, holding her tight against me, her head on my chest, my lips resting against her hair.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got a camera, I\u2019d whip it out right about now\u2014\u2019cause that\u2019s the money shot. The picture you\u2019re going to want to remember.</p><p>My parents take James to their room for the night. Kate and I fly out tomorrow afternoon. While we\u2019re gone, James will stay a week with my sister and Steven, and a week with Matthew and Dee. Then, my parents will bring him out to us on the Amalfi Coast in Italy. They\u2019ll take off on their own romantic getaway, and Kate, James, and I will enjoy the last leg of the honeymoon together.</p> <p>The elevator opens on the top floor. Before Kate steps out, I sweep her into my arms and cradle her as I walk to our suite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to carry me over the threshold, Drew. Not through the whole hotel.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve always been an overachiever.\u201d</p><p>I open the door and carry her in. The bed is awesome. An oversize king with huge, fluffy pillows, red silk sheets, and a comforter of the softest down. Rose petals are scattered in a path to the bed and over the covers, giving off a soft but fragrant scent.</p><p>I shift Kate in my arms and slide her down my body. Her eyes dance with happy mischief as they look into mine. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some help getting out of this dress.\u201d</p><p>I crack my knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the right man for the job.\u201d</p> <p>My fingers ghost along the silky skin of her back. I take my time with the buttons, popping each one slowly, giving Kate\u2019s imagination time to run wild.</p><p>As the last button is released, I step closer to Kate. I watch, fascinated, as the pulse in her neck throbs quickly with anticipation. I cover it with my mouth, sucking gently. Kate lifts her head and leans back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this all day,\u201d I whisper against her skin. \u201cGetting you here, getting you bare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d</p><p>With one tug, the lace and satin pools around her feet, revealing my favorite playground. Kate steps over the dress and turns to me. Though I\u2019m not a lingerie man, her undergarments are nothing short of beautiful. Blue silk with a white lace overlay\u2014the bra strapless, the panties bikini, leading to sexy garters that keep opaque stockings in place.</p><p>There\u2019s wonder in Kate\u2019s voice as she says, \u201cYou\u2019re my husband.\u201d Then she smiles giddily. \u201cHow great is that?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty f**king awesome.\u201d I step purposefully to her. \u201cAnd right now, your husband wants to sixty-nine his wife.\u201d I lick my lips. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>I loosen my tie and pull it off. But when I start with the buttons of my shirt, Kate\u2019s hand stops me. \u201cLet me do it.\u201d</p> <p>She watches her fingers as they reveal inch after inch of my heated skin. She opens my shirt, pushing it and my jacket down and off my arms. Then her hands run over my shoulders slowly, across my chest, down my abs.</p><p>In a husky voice she says, \u201cI love your body, Drew. So strong, so hard . . . I could spend all night just touching you like this.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds in my chest.</p><p>She opens my belt, the clasp of my pants. She crouches and kisses the happy trail. \u201cAnd this right here\u201d\u2014her tongue traces the V of my upper pelvis, sculpted lines that show when sweats sit low on my hips\u2014\u201cthis is my favorite part.\u201d</p><p>My breathing speeds up, and when her tongue goes back to teasing, I can\u2019t help but thrust forward, wanting it so frigging badly to be her I\u2019m thrusting into.</p><p>Her mouth, her cunt . . . not choosy at the moment.</p><p>She drags my pants down my legs, and because of its proximity to Kate\u2019s mouth, my c**k aches. Finally naked, I sit on the bed and crook my finger at Kate. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She stands, and, keeping her bridal heels on, she struts to me. I grasp her hips; she braces one knee on the bed, straddling my waist. My hands move to her face, holding it still, and I kiss her roughly, sucking on her tongue, making her moan.</p><p>While I worship her mouth, Kate\u2019s h*ps gyrate, seeking friction. When she finds it against my dick, I grunt. Moving to her jaw and neck, I scour her skin with my lips and teeth\u2014sucking and nibbling\u2014while my deft fingers unclasp her bra from behind.</p><p>When her bra falls down, I lean back for the best view. \u201cJesus, your tits are beautiful.\u201d I take one in my palm, massaging and kneading, before bringing it to my mouth and suckling greedily.</p><p>Kate shouts nonsensical words and clasps my head to her breast. I lave at her nipple, then fall back on the bed, taking her with me. From this position, both of her tits are accessible\u2014I take advantage and alternate between them\u2014kissing and flicking each hard nipple with my tongue.</p><p>Full-out panting, Kate rears back and her eyes meet mine. I\u2019m burning up, needing more\u2014I can\u2019t remember ever being this desperate for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClimb up here,\u201d I say. It\u2019s meant to be an order, but it comes out as a plea. \u201cRight f**king here.\u201d</p><p>She rises to her knees and slides her panties and garters down and off. The heels follow. Then she crawls up the bed next to me, swings her knee around, and hovers over my insatiable mouth. Taking her h*ps in my hands, I guide her pu**y down to my face.</p><p>She\u2019s so worked up, so hot, I feel the warmth against my lips even before I taste her. But when my tongue sinks inside, my eyes roll to the back of my head.</p><p>Her taste\u2014fuck\u2014it gets better every time. I revel in the sensation of being surrounded by her. I think she calls my name, but my heartbeat pulses so loud in my ears, I can\u2019t be sure. While I feast on her, Kate lowers her upper body so it\u2019s flush with my torso.</p><p>I feel her warm breath on my c**k first. Then the sublime wetness of her mouth encases me\u2014and I swear my heart stops in its tracks.</p><p>People who think this is wrong or depraved are out of their mind. If that were true, we wouldn\u2019t fit like this so f**king perfectly. We were made to do this.</p><p>My fingers dig into the flesh of her perfect ass. Holding her against me, moving her left and right in an unforgiving rhythm guaranteed to make her come. I want that so much\u2014to feel her, my wife, pulsing around my tongue, writhing against my face.</p><p>She\u2019s not slow or teasing with her mouth now. She takes me all the way in, until I feel the back of her throat\u2014then she sucks hard as she slides upward. Over and over, until my legs quake.</p><p>We work in tandem, giving and receiving the most salacious pleasure. She hums around me, and the vibrations push me closer to the edge. I feel the tingles in my spine, the tightening of my balls.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want to come like this\u2014not yet. I\u2019ll certainly revisit that opportunity later, but this first time, I want to be buried deep inside her when I let go.</p><p>With renewed vigor, I find her cl*t with my tongue. I press against it, suck on it, then thrust inside her\u2014stimulating all her pleasure points. When Kate starts to buck against me, when she loses her focus on my c**k and has to take her mouth off it to get in enough air\u2014I know my actions are about to pay off.</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d she whimpers against my thigh, holding on to my legs, trying to ground herself because she\u2019s about to take flight. I grasp her ass tighter. . . .</p><p>She\u2019s there. Falling. Flying. A thousand blissful eruptions coursing through her as she comes on my face and calls my name. Over and over.</p><p>Afterward, Kate stills and her harsh breaths tickle my thighs. Taking one last lick, I maneuver her boneless limbs until she\u2019s lying on the bed and I\u2019m above her.</p><p>She smiles into my face, looking happy and orgasm-weak. \u201cThat was so good . . . the best ever.\u201d</p><p>I can only smirk as pure masculine pride wells in my chest. \u201cThe best . . . so far.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her arms around my neck, her knees bent and resting against my ribs. \u201cLove me, Drew. Make love to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>I drag the tip of my c**k up and down over her opening, savoring the feel of her hot wetness. \u201cLook at me, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She gazes up at me\u2014and I swear it feels like she\u2019s seeing into my soul. I push into her slowly, drawing the action out until our lower stomachs press together.</p><p>We\u2019re joined deeply\u2014in every conceivable way.</p><p>My head tilts back and I shift my hips, moving in tight, close rotations. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet, Kate . . . you feel . . . Christ, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>It really is.</p><p>In the last five years, I\u2019ve wondered if sex between Kate and me would ever get stale. Ever not feel as if my blood vessels were exploding from pleasure overload.</p> <p>Hasn\u2019t happened yet.</p><p>As far as I\u2019m concerned, this cinches it. It\u2019s just going to keep getting better.</p><p>Her inner muscles contract and squeeze. At last I start to move, dragging my dick out from her heavenly pu**y, then thrusting back in. Groaning louder each time.</p><p>I lift up so I can watch. Nothing is more of a turn-on than watching my c**k disappear into Kate. If I was going to go blind, that would be the last image I\u2019d want to take into the darkness with me.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Drew,\u201d she begs.</p><p>I lower my head and Kate\u2019s tongue runs across my lips, then plunges into my mouth\u2014tangling with my own. Our h*ps move together, gaining speed and force. Our moans and whispered words mingle in our mouths and along the skin of our necks and shoulders.</p><p>This is more than magnificent screwing.</p><p>More than the physical expression of love.</p><p>It\u2019s spiritual.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a heaven. I sure as shit don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get there. But if there is . . . it\u2019s got to feel like this. Perfect harmony with another soul, surrounded by warmth and acceptance and rapture without end.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>Kate\u2019s h*ps rise to meet mine as I thrust into her again and again. Searing pleasure courses up my legs, threatening to burst, but I hold it off\u2014because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going alone.</p><p>All I can pant out is \u201cWith me . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate gasps, \u201cYes . . .\u201d</p><p>I push in deep one last time and burst inside her in a forceful pulse. Spots dance behind my closed eyes, and exhilaration floods the motherfucking marrow of my bones. Kate constricts and throbs around me as her nails bite into my back.</p><p>After, neither of us moves for a few minutes. Not sure either of us can.</p><p>I finally manage to roll to the side, with my arms still around her\u2014both of us breathing hard and slick with the best kind of sweat.</p><p>She brushes the damp hair off my forehead with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I breathe. \u201cThat was incredible. We should\u2019ve gotten married years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it. I think I had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>We laugh.</p><p>There are a few specific moments in my life that I consider as the greatest. That first night with Kate. The day she believed I loved her and told me she felt the same. The day James was born.</p><p>And this . . . this moment right here just made the list.</p><p>I pull her close and touch her face. My voice is rough, heavy with emotion, as the words are torn from my lungs. \u201cI love you, Kate. I\u2019m going to love you forever. And whatever comes after forever\u2014I\u2019m going to love you then too.\u201d</p><p>My words bring tears to her eyes, She kisses me gently, softly. Then she traces my lips with her finger. \u201cYou can bet your ass that I\u2019m going to hold you to that, Drew Evans.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s it. The epic conclusion.</p><p>I think we\u2019ve come a long away, don\u2019t you? From that guy you first met with the \u201cflu,\u201d camped out on his living-room couch? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Boy, was he a f**king mess.</p><p>Thanks for sticking around, for not giving up on me.
